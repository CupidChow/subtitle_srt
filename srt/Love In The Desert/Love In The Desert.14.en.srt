(Yunfang Pavilion)

25
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,190
Lady Youjia, what brings you here?

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,390
Her Ladyship is bathing.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,140
(Luckily, Ruo Wen reminded me to come.)

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,390
(Is she working on something)

29
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,790
(to win the competition?)

30
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,420
(Let me see)

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,620
(what she is really doing.)

32
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm not a man.

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,950
Why can't I get in?

34
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,270
- Go away.
- Lady Youjia, you can't get in.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,950
Lady Youjia!

36
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,830
Lady Youjia.

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,910
Lady Youjia.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,270
How about another day...?

39
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,110
Youjia, who taught you

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,350
to invite yourself in?

41
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,990
So, I'm bathing at a bad time.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,390
Don't say that.

43
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,070
You and I are close.

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,270
Don't stand on ceremony.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,700
Get into the tub. Don't catch a cold.

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,540
Lady Youjia,

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,700
there's water on the ground.

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,180
Don't go any closer.

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,860
What did you come for, Youjia?

50
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,020
I've brought you flowers and pastry.

51
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,670
Lady...

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,180
Thank you, then.

53
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,230
But now,

54
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,740
I have no time for you.

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,820
Why don't you go back?

56
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,670
Beishuang,

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,230
I just remembered.

58
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,350
His Lordship gave me some wormwood.

59
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,180
When you bathe,

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,180
you can put some in the water.

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,620
It takes the chill off.

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,860
Youjia, if you don't mind,

63
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,390
go back.

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,670
I'll visit you another day.

65
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,180
You keep asking me to leave.

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,270
I guess it's really inconvenient for you.

67
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,620
I won't disturb you, then.

68
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,230
I'll come another time.

69
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,460
See you, Youjia.

70
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,910
Beishuang.

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,020
When the water is cold, come out of it.

72
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,950
If you catch a cold,

73
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,330
you'll hold up the competition.

74
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,660
Qingyun.

75
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,950
Qingyun.

76
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,550
You fooled me.

77
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,110
Before the last minute,

78
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,940
I even wondered if you tried to kill me.

79
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,260
Unless you have a death wish,

80
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,550
get dressed and leave.

81
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,710
Then, can I come back?

82
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,500
You've recovered.

83
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,030
I don't think

84
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,300
you need to come back.

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,260
Who said that?

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't you want to win the oasis

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,470
for Enaqi?

88
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,670
(Looks like the coup in Masui)

89
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,380
(has something to do with Yunpei.)

90
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,060
What did you find out
in Yunfang Pavilion?

91
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,310
Mr. Ruo Wen,

92
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,380
when I arrived,

93
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,820
Huang Beishuang was bathing.

94
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,070
And...

95
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,860
She looked nervous.

96
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,790
Bathing?

97
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,180
Is there anybody else in her room?

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Who else?

99
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,220
Yepei.

100
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,110
Did she say anything

101
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,500
very confusing?

102
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,590
I didn't notice.

103
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,350
But she kept asking me to leave.

104
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,190
Mr. Ruo Wen,

105
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,030
the cooking competition is coming.

106
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,810
How can she still be so leisurely?

107
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,790
Instead of preparing the dishes,

108
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,500
she had time for a bath.

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,060
Will she be opportunistic

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,990
and play some tricks?

111
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,750
Never mind.

112
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,830
She can't win.

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,300
Are you Mr. Gu?

114
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,550
Who are you guys?

115
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,230
We want to learn to cook from you.

116
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,670
The favorite dish of the Lord of Yunpei.

117
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,550
You get the wrong man.

118
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,060
I don't cook.

119
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,390
Who is this man?

120
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,060
He was Na Zhan's chef.

121
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,030
It's said that Na Zhan loved

122
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,260
the dishes he cooked.

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,670
But he had a queer temper

124
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,860
and offended many men.

125
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,470
That's why he retired.

126
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,020
Mr. Gu,

127
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,590
teaching us won't take a long time.

128
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,820
Name your price.

129
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,500
Do not pester me.

130
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,300
We can't persuade him.

131
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,100
Let's do it the hard way.

132
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,430
Qingyun.

133
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,740
How about we give up?

134
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,790
I don't want to impose.

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,110
Let's find another way.

136
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,910
Ageratum leaf?

137
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,260
What?

138
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,260
I read about it in the Herb Volume.

139
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,590
It can be made
into medicine to remove heat.

140
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,110
It can also be made into food.

141
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,940
It's common in the Central Plains.

142
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,620
It’s edible after being planted
for eight or nine days.

143
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,820
But it's not common

144
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,710
in the desert.

145
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,180
Sadly, the soil has poor breathability.

146
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,350
So, it doesn't grow very well.

147
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,150
Are you saying it's the soil problem?

148
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,190
Thread Noodles, His Lordship's favorite.

149
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,070
Noodles?

150
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,700
Pendants.

151
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,360
Pendants for sale.

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Look.

153
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,950
Today, I'm not the head of Boa Agents.

154
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,660
You're not Lady Beishuang of Yunpei.

155
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,590
Let's spend this day like ordinary people.

156
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,340
All right.

157
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,620

And the painting.

176
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
You've prepared a lot.

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
There's more.

178
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,470
Come on. I'm taking you somewhere.

179
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,910
This is for you.

180
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,270
Qingyun,

181
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,620
I love having you in my life.

182
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,860
I'll always remember this moment.

183
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,670
What is this?

184
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,470
Looks more exquisite

185
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,990
- than the two-word note.
- Wait.

186
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,230
You can't open it now.

187
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,540
It's my suicide note.

188
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,540
Why do you give it to me?

189
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,860
In this world,

190
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,640
I have no family or friends.

191
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,990
You're the only one

192
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,910
I can trust it with.

193
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,790
Promise me.

194
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,740
Unless I'm dead,

195
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,260
you won't open it.

196
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,190
All right.

197
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,670
You have my word.

198
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,270
Say no more.

199
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,380
Here I am.

200
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,350
You've picked a fine time.

201
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,340
Ge Xinwei?

202
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,780
This is your last present.

203
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

204
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,340
- No.
- Yes.

205
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,900
Well, suffer then.

206
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,590
I can take you to the Mansion.

207
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,380
But whether you'll take away Ruo Wen

208
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,540
relies on your own.

209
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,550
No problem.

210
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,830
Excuse us for a moment.

211
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,790
Come on.

212
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,310
Let's go.

213
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,430
How's your life out there?

214
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,860
I wander around with Ruo Wen.

215
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,710
We live each day as if it were our last.

216
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,950
Free and comfortable.

217
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,070
That's nice.

218
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,700
Oh.

219
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,310
I domesticated a bird of paradise in Masui.

220
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,590
It can send messages.

221
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,860
If you need me for anything,

222
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,540
you can see it loose.

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,070
It will send me a message.

224
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,740
Masui...

225
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,460
Forget it.

226
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,860
I don't think

227
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,660
I'll need you for anything.

228
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,660
Get into Masui for a bird...

229
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,020
I don't want to get killed.

230
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,540
Maybe you'll see it soon.

231
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,100
(Huayu Mansion)

232
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,310
Your Grace,

233
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,830
such a big box.

234
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
What treasure is in it?

235
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,470
You'll know tomorrow.

236
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,190
Such a fancy hairpin.

237
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,220
Who gave it to you?

238
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
I won't tell you.

239
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,140
I know who gave it to you.

240
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,260
Don't gossip, Yepei.

241
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,430
I knew before you told me.

242
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,780
What's the mystery

243
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,430
of the water in the wooden box?

244
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,860
Mr. Ruo Wen, you're back.

245
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,310
The competition will start tomorrow.

246
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,590
Would you like to sleep early?

247
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,260
I think the box is big enough

248
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,620
to hide a man.

249
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,990
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,380
It's too heavy to be moved.

251
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,990
How heavy can it be?

252
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,780
Mr. Ruo Wen,

253
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,860
what are you talking about?

254
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,470
What happened?

255
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,830
Mr. Ruo Wen, don't do this!

256
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,500
Put me down!

257
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,860
Put me down.

258
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,310
You...

259
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,590
She doesn't weigh a lot.

260
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,550
Mr. Ruo Wen,

261
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,620
what do you want?

262
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
Jewels or brocades.

263
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,620
I have everything.

264
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,380
But I won't sleep with you.

265
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,020
I would rather die.

266
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,620
Ingredient.

267
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,860
Drink some wine.

268
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,900
Going to kill your wife?

269
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,580
Madwoman?

270
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,620
Miss me that much?

271
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,500
You're so heartless and you lie.

272
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,340
You cheated on me.

273
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,590
Ruo Wen, you're terrible.

274
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,030
Madwoman,

275
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,070
you refused to follow me, huh?

276
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,230
Why did you get in?

277
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
I just want to see

278
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,830
why you have to be so stubborn

279
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,590
and keep doing evil.

280
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,670
Shh.

281
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
You can't control me.

282
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:33,910
I'll just yell.

283
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,620
Somebody!

284
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,580
Madwoman,

285
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,850
this isn't where you make a scene.

286
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,070
What are you? A dog?

287
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,230
You just worry about me.

288
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,500
You don't want me to be caught.

289
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,430
Not at all.

290
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,470
Hope you'll be caught.

291
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,430
What if you ruin my plan?

292
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,540
Don't be shy.

293
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,260
Anyway, before I came,

294
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,540
you didn't get what you wanted.

295
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,260
Be patient. Let's see tomorrow.

296
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,300
Wish you success in getting the pretty.

297
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,870
Thank you, but no thank you.

298
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,190
Leave right away.

299
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,430
Tomorrow, I'll have to cook.

300
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,470
You? Cook?

301
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,700
For tomorrow's banquet?

302
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,300
Or what? Will you cook?

303
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,820
Well, I cook really well.

304
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,060
Maybe I can help you.

305
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,180
No need.

306
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,630
Bamboo shoot with chicken marrow.

307
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,780
Goose breast rolls.

308
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,870
Osmanthus cake with arrowroot.

309
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,060
Roast duck.

310
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,740
You can cook?

311
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,830
Of course.

312
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,100
If you want to beg me,

313
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,540
try to make me happy.

314
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,500
Forget I even asked.

315
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,870
Huayu Mansion is so big.

316
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,580
There must be a lot of food and fun.

317
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,820
If someone can show me around,

318
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,630
he'll certainly realize his wish

319
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,260
and get what he wants.

320
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,990
Check over here.

321
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,580
Come out.

322
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,790
Don't touch me.

323
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,790
It's the opposite of what you think.

324
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,070
You refused to come, huh?

325
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,030
Are you blind?

326
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,230
Can't you see I'm reluctant?

327
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
Get off me.

328
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,830
I won't.

329
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,790
I am blind,

330
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,870
or why would I love you?

331
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,470
Get off me.

332
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,310
I just won't.

333
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
Madwoman, I warn you.

334
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,800
In the competition,

335
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,190
if you can't make a nice dish,

336
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,030
I won't let you go.

337
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,200
Count on me.

338
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,860
Look.

339
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,870
This will be my territory one day.

340
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,870
How long will it take?

341
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
One year.

342
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,510
I'll wait for you.

343
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,420
I'll accompany you until you take Yunpei.

344
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,940
Then will you travel around with me?

345
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,310
In your dreams.

346
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,550
Your Grace.

347
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,780
Come and check. Is this fish dying?

348
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,950
The smell of alcohol.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,060
Who did such a terrible thing?

350
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,790
I'll go buy one.

351
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,420
Too late.

352
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,950
It's not easy

353
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,120
to buy a fish in the desert.

354
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,420
What...?

355
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,020
What do we do?

356
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,940
Try to strangle me?

357
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,340
Don't just stand there.

358
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,550
Chop the vegetables.

359
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,580
Go.

360
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,100
Watch this.

361
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,870
Ruo Wen.

362
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,230
Don't mess it up.

363
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,580
Let me show you what a chef can do.

364
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,300
Madwoman,

365
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,060
you learned to cook in the brothel.

366
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,820
Nonsense.

367
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,260
That's my restaurant.

368
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,100
Only one dish is needed today.

369
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,950
Making so many dishes is thankless.

370
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,500
The rest of the dishes

371
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,020
are for you.

372
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,270
Taste it.

373
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,140
How does it taste?

374
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,270
Not good.

375
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,470
Then eat more.

376
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,910
This is the Roast Duck by Lady Youjia.

377
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,470
Inside the duck

378
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,710
are eight previous nutritious ingredients.

379
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,870
And the whole duck is off the bone.

380
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,780
Rather complicated.

381
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,270
Is it?

382
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,190
The duck tastes tender.

383
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,300
The filling is scrumptious.

384
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,540
The second dish.

385
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,950
Noodles?

386
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,140
Yes.

387
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,710
Thread Noodles, right?

388
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,310
Congratulations, My Lord.

389
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,540
Since Chef Gu left,

390
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,950
you haven't had
such noodles for a long time.

391
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,020
The noodles taste a little different.

392
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,230
Did Lady Youjia make the noodles?

393
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,340
No. Lady Beishuang, instead.

394
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,900
Lady Beishuang?

395
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
Interesting.

396
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Get her in.

397
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,150
Get Lady Beishuang in.

398
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,190
I didn't know you could cook so well.

399
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,180
My Lord,

400
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,430
it's not hard to make these noodles.

401
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,990
First, pound the fish until it's chewy.

402
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,730
Then, make a dough.

403
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,470
Why does it have the smell of alcohol?

404
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,630
My Lord, you have no idea.

405
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,250
The noodles are improved.

406
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,260
Previously,

407
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,910
the fresh fish was made
into dough and then steamed.

408
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,670
Quite time-consuming.

409
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,230
This time,

410
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,060
I soaked the fish dough
into wine for an hour.

411
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,260
And then I dried it.

412
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,200
Some flavor is lost.

413
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,580
But it's conveniently stored.

414
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,020
When we want some,

415
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,340
we can steam the dried fish dough.

416
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,580
Very convenient.

417
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,100
Good.

418
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,470
It's very thoughtful of you.

419
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,390
I failed my job.

420
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,780
Punish me, My Lord.

421
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,990
What are you guilty of, General Wu?

422
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,990
The other day, I guarded inattentively.

423
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,390
So, some bandits

424
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,990
invaded the oasis on our border.

425
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,220
I've sent soldiers to fight them.

426
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,180
So,

427
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,910
please give me some more time.

428
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,230
Can we postpone

429
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,260
giving Her Ladyship the oasis?

430
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,550
Ridiculous.

431
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,670
I promised to give her that.

432
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,540
How dare you neglect your job

433
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,550
and make this big mistake?

434
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,790
Fine.

435
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,550
I'll dock your pay for half a year.

436
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,020
Take back the oasis soon.

437
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,340
Yes.

438
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,470
Since the oasis is gone,

439
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,580
the competition has no meaning.

440
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,070
But anyway,

441
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,100
you cooked sincerely.

442
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,420
I'll give you money and silk.

443
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,230
End of the story.

444
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,950
(Yunpei owns many fertile oases.)

445
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,230
(But he doesn't give me one.)

446
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,950
(He must be wary of me.)

447
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,870
(I guess)

448
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,340
(it'll take me some trouble)

449
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,820
(to get an oasis from him.)

450
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,230
(Juyun House)

451
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,070
Chief,

452
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,910
Desert Rankers have been recruiting.

453
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,020
A few days ago,
they robbed Yunpei's arsenal.

454
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,500
Previously, an elite squad lurked in Masui.

455
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,820
I guess they'll move north together.

456
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,100
Shall we stop them?

457
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,110
Using a double-edged sword wisely

458
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
bring more benefits.

459
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,020
Give some intel on Masui
to Desert Rankers.

460
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,900
Chief,

461
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,900
why do we assist them

462
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,700
instead of stopping them?

463
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,780
Masui needs a new ruler.

464
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,390
In the desert,

465
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,340
one more power will threaten Yunpei.

466
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,380
I get it.

467
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,820
The competition will be held today.

468
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,270
Will you not go?

469
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,670
Na Zhan is rather scheming.

470
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,740
It's extremely hard to get an oasis

471
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,340
from him.

472
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,270
Then...

473
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,390
Does Miss Beishuang know?

474
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,190
Yes, I guess.

475
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,230
Too bad.

476
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,740
She's been expecting the oasis.

477
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,900
How about this?

478
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,430
You go find an oasis near Tiandu.

479
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,020
All right. Count on me.

480
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,740
What are you doing here?

481
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,430
I thought after you lost the competition,

482
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,660
Na Zhan would think less of you.

483
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,500
Unexpectedly, he and Wu Jihai echoed.

484
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,670
It's really you who ruined my fish.

485
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,990
Huang Beishuang,

486
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,260
under such circumstances,

487
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,670
ignore the competition.

488
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,060
You've seen Na Zhan's attitude.

489
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,300
He won't give you anything.

490
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
I've just been here. It's not time yet.

491
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,910
Na Zhan must have

492
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,230
his concerns about this.

493
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,300
Huang Beishuang, listen.

494
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,430
If you still bet on Yunpei,

495
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,820
the opportunity you want

496
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,950
will never come.

497
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,670
Since I came to Yunpei,

498
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,430
there has been no turning back.

499
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,620
Even if it doesn't come,

500
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,580
I'll still wait.

501
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,020
Instead of waiting, why don't you move?

502
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,860
Let's go.

503
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,020
Move? How can I trust you?

504
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,670
Can you play chess?

505
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,670
I want to play chess with you.

506
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,950
Why do we have to play?

507
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,990
I move on my own.

508
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,510
It doesn't matter.

509
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,870
Chess reveals characters.

510
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,020
Since you insist on taking me away,

511
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,780
I have to trust a reliable man.

512
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,710
Huang Beishuang,

513
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,430
you're just a canary

514
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,710
kept in Yunpei.

515
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,260
Are you so reluctant to leave?

516
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,870
Obsession always binds you.

517
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,670
To leave with you or to stay here

518
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,350
makes no difference to me.

519
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,190
I'll be caged, anyway.

520
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,190
It's just a metaphor.

521
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,580
I always get what I want.

522
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,940
Are you sure?

523
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,020
There's nothing I can't get.

524
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,820
I don't believe you can take Masui.

525
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,300
You're Na Zhan's concubine.

526
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,430
Why do you provoke me to take Masui?

527
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,820
You just said

528
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,100
you could get

529
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,710
whatever you wanted.

530
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,750
Yes, of course.

531
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,260
But I have to know what you think.

532
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,430
This is what you want.

533
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,820
Not what I think.

534
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,630
You think you know me well, huh?

535
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,150
If it's not what you want,

536
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,100
why did you take the trouble

537
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,430
to get the map of Masui

538
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,060
in Henan Inn?

539
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,190
And why did you help Ge Xinwei

540
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,970
to smash the sacrificial ceremony?

541
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,430
Looks like you've got a lot

542
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,580
from Huo Qingyun.

543
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,670
In this case, let me be honest.

544
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,580
For this,

545
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,190
I've had a plan for a long time.

546
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,630
The Lord of Masui
is fatuous and incapable.

547
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,740
His soldiers are dissipated.

548
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,390
With your expertise, it won't be long

549
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,500
before you take Masui.

550
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,870
By then,

551
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,580
you can compete with Yunpei and Tiandu.

552
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,990
I just want to help you.

553
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
And...

554
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,190
I hope you can take a city soon

555
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,670
and stop drifting.

556
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,670
You're the only woman

557
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,430
who knows me this much.

558
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,540
When will you take action?

559
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,230
Within ten days.

560
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,640
Can you make it in one month?

561
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,510
Half of a month.

562
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,430
After that, I'll come get you.

563
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,630
Promise me.

564
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,890
You won't massacre the city

565
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,510
and you'll be nice to the people.

566
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,470
You have my word.

567
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,470
Huang Beishuang, remember.

568
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,020
I'm a master falconer.

569
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,990
No eagle will peck my eyes.

570
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,340
My Lady, why do you look gloomy?

571
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,420
Xiaolian,

572
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,470
during today's competition,

573
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,500
was His Lordship partial toward me?

574
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,340
Yes, of course.

575
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,020
The dish Mr. Ruo Wen offered

576
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,980
seemed to be favored by His Lordship.

577
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,430
That's right.

578
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,540
But His Lordship is suspicious.

579
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,910
It's dangerous to serve a king.

580
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,300
We're keeping a bandit here.

581
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,630
Once this comes out,

582
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,060
His Lordship will think
I colluded with Ruo Wen.

583
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,260
Then we'll be dead.

584
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,230
We have to send him away soon.

585
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,300
The competition is over.

586
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,820
Ruo Wen is useless.

587
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,020
Besides, Huang Beishuang

588
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,100
seems to have an affair with him.

589
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,990
Once they collude,

590
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,260
there will be trouble.

591
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,790
My Lady,

592
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,230
how about we wait
until Ruo Wen comes back?

593
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,820
If he refuses to leave,

594
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,470
shall we

595
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,910
confess to His Lordship?

596
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,430
We can't just confess.

597
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,340
His Lordship saw Ruo Wen.

598
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,910
And I suspect

599
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,500
he's the rebel who broke into the Library.

600
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,190
His Lordship will investigate it.

601
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,580
Then he'll punish us.

602
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,430
How about we do something?

603
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,750
My Lady,

604
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,470
how about we poison the meal?

605
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,910
By then,

606
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,470
we can get rid of this enemy.

607
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,780
His Lordship will love you more.

608
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,820
Punish me, My Lord.

609
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,740
I shouldn't have disturbed your nap.

610
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,230
Punish you for what?

611
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,710
A few days ago,

612
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,190
Qin Duo, the supervisor
of the east arsenal

613
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,260
was beaten to death in Zuixiang Brothel.

614
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,790
Then,

615
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,260
they took away his key.

616
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,060
When the guards changed shifts,

617
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,740
they stole a lot of weapons.

618
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,950
Losers.

619
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,100
Why didn't you tell me until today?

620
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,060
They only stole the weapons.

621
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,660
The storage boxes are intact.

622
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,380
Qin Duo had a sick leave for half a month.

623
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,700
So, we weren't aware for a while.

624
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,660
Later, I investigated Zuixiang Brothel

625
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,660
and found some traces.

626
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,870
Greetings, My Lord.

627
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,750
Speak.

628
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,750
For your information, My Lord,

629
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,870
that night,

630
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,910
I saw Mr. Qin get into the room

631
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,110
and I heard

632
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,790
someone call Fox inside the room.

633
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,830
I don't know

634
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,390
anything else.

635
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,390
Fox?

636
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,900
My Lord,

637
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,830
Fox is one of the two leaders
of Desert Rankers.

638
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,580
There were four of them
in Zuixiang Brothel.

639
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,620
Including a woman.

640
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,700
So, Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers did this.

641
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,950
Ruo Wen?

642
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,350
What is he doing in Yunpei?

643
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,750
My Lord,

644
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,270
do you remember

645
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,430
the whistle blow

646
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,870
at the Lantern Festival?

647
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
I guess

648
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,140
Ruo Wen is involved in the Library case.

649
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,830
So, he tried

650
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,580
to take away Rong Huo?

651
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,310
Yes.

652
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,180
Have a thorough investigation.

653
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,060
How dare a bandit

654
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,180
make trouble in my city?

655
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,020
Don't let him go.

656
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,670
Besides,

657
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,750
keep a close eye on Desert Rankers.

658
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,610
In case of anything unusual,

659
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,500
report to me immediately.

660
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,750
Yes, My Lord.

661
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,660
Ruo Wen.

662
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,060
I told you everything, anyway.

663
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,740
You have to leave today.

664
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,310
If you still insist,

665
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,580
I won't meddle with you.

666
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,390
No one will even bury the lot of you.

667
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,120
Stay out of my business.

668
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,220
Are you in love

669
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
with Zhenqu Youjia?

670
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,710
Yes.

671
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,700
I'm in love with her.

672
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,870
Or why do I insist on staying?

673
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,950
She'll even cut you into pieces.

674
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,310
What is your problem?

675
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,020
Who are you?

676
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,270
Ruo Wen's woman.

677
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,270
You...

678
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,060
Girl,

679
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
ask no questions unless you have to.

680
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,750
It's bad for you.

681
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,990
What is the box for?

682
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
I said,

683
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,500
ask no questions.

684
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
Ruo Wen's woman came out of nowhere.

685
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,140
It's not that simple.

686
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,310
Let's play it by ear.

687
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,270
Mr. Ruo Wen,

688
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,350
what are you doing?

689
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,190
Out of my way.

690
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,350
A reward for the competition.

691
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,750
Isn't it too much?

692
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,020
Mr. Ruo Wen.

693
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,130
- We've been married.
- Mr. Ruo Wen.

694
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,180
But I can't control him.

695
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,310
That's just what he is.

696
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,340
Straightforward.

697
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,860
Madwoman,

698
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,950
stop it, or I'll stuff you into the box.

699
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,620
Why can't I even speak?

700
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,410
- Quick-tempered.
- Mr. Ruo Wen.

701
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,220
Quite a lot of treasures.

702
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,110
Mr. Ruo Wen,

703
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,140
this is my drowsy from my tribe.

704
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,730
- You must not take it.
- Be careful.

705
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,020
How about something else?

706
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,270
- Don't forget.
- Mr. Ruo Wen.

707
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,310
You owe me a reward.

708
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,710
Girl,

709
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,100
you enjoy a rich life here.

710
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,180
Such jewels are just nothing.

711
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,910
Why would you care?

712
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,540
They are priceless.

713
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,390
How can they be "nothing"?

714
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,390
Mr. Ruo Wen, stop!

715
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,470
Please don't do this.

716
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,120
- Leave me some.
- Let me do it.

717
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,790
Come on. Go with me.

718
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,630
There's more?

719
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,590
Really?

720
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,620
Be careful, My Lady.

721
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,460
Get me up.

722
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,430
Stop, the two of you!

723
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,420
This one is good.

724
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,660
You can't take this.

725
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,990
Take that one.

726
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,470
Mr. Ruo Wen, stop it!

727
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,590
My Lady.

728
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,830
- Oh, my ankle.
- Are you all right?

729
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,620
Will we not leave anything to her?

730
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,190
We will.

731
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,060
You'll stay and serve her.
