23

=Episode 1=

24
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,280
(In the vast desert,)

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,480
(water was desperately short.)

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
(To get more oases,)

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,980
(tribes fought each other)

28
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,480
(and destabilized the world.)

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,580
(At one time, wars raged)

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,020
(and people lost their lives.)

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,620
(Many years later,)

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,410
(three big cities Yunpei, Tiandu,
and Masui reigned.)

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,260
(To survive, other weak tribes)

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,730
(offered pretty ladies
to the lords of big cities)

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,390
(and sought asylum every year.)

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,960
(However, the advent of the Desert Scroll)

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,180
(The Desert Scroll)
(upset the balance again.)

38
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,740
(It's said anyone who got the Scroll)

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,780
(could acquire the best resources.)

40
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,260
(To get it, Na Zhan, Lord of Yunpei,)

41
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,450
(held the most wasteful marriage ceremony.)

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,040
(The sign of wars)

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,940
(appeared again.)

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,380
(Yunpei, Tiandu, Masui)

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,020
(At this moment, Masui witnessed a coup.)

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,540
(Lord Ge Erre's brother
usurped him and killed him.)

47
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,740
(His daughter)

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,140
(escaped Masui with her mother)

49
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,620
(who came from Enaqi Tribe.)

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,910
(They are rushing to Tiandu for help.)

51
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,850
Protect the princess.

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,060
Faster! Don't let them catch up!

53
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,420
- The old lords are dead.
- Yes. Go faster. Hurry.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm afraid the Lord of the North

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,580
will deny the engagement between us.

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,540
Without a withdrawal letter,

57
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,660
he can't deny it.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,540
Outrunner, listen.

59
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,380
But

60
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,700
Tiandu has been closed for years.

61
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,860
Can we really get in there?

62
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,660
We have no other choice.

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,700
Your father was killed by your uncle.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,980
Enaqi is then unprotected.

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
Sorry, my poor daughter.

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,620
It's my bad.

67
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,940
I failed to protect you.

68
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,460
You have to flee with us.

69
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,380
Mother, don't blame yourself.

70
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,940
As long as we're alive,

71
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
there is always hope.

72
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,180
Ninth Lady and Ninth Princess of Masui

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,460
came to Tiandu to see the Lord.

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,580
(Tiandu)

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,140
Ninth Lady of Masui

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,460
is here to see the Lord of Tiandu!

77
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,340
Family of the late lord of Masui came

78
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,180
with the Desert Scroll!

79
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,860
We're here with the Desert Scroll!

80
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,020
(Tiandu)

81
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,420
Lord of the North is here.

82
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,820
(Huo Qingyun, Lord of the North)
Your Lordship,

83
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,860
a woman outside the city

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
claimed to be the Lady of Masui.

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,540
She wanted to see you and seek asylum.

86
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,980
Soldiers of Masui have caught up

87
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,860
and are trapping them at the city gate.

88
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,780
Orders, Your Lordship. Will we help?

89
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,900
Ninth Lady and Ninth Princess of Masui

90
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,820
are here to see the Lord of Tiandu!

91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,820
We'll present the Herb Volume
of the Desert Scroll!

92
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,580
Ninth Lady and Ninth Princess of Masui

93
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,020
will present the Herb Volume
of the Desert Scroll!

94
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,300
(Tiandu)

95
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,380
(Tiandu)

96
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,340
At the behest of the Lord of the North,

97
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,340
- shoot and kill them.
- Shoot!

98
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,140
My Lady, Your Grace, get in the carriage.

99
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,940
Protect Her Ladyship and Her Grace.

100
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,060
- Mother.
- My Lady.

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,540
Run!

102
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,820
Mother.

103
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,540
(Tiandu)
Leave me alone. Protect Xinwei.

104
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,460
My Lady, are you all right?

105
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,020
Protect Her Ladyship and Her Grace.

106
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,340
- What do we do?
- Mother, are you all right?

107
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,700
- Mother, don't go.
- Your Grace, no.

108
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,580
Let me go!

109
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,260
Get them on the horse.

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,140
Your Grace.

111
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,780
- Your Grace.
- Get on the horse.

112
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
Get on the horse. Hurry.

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,540
- Mother, let's go together.
- Your Grace, get on the horse.

114
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,420
Go with me, Mother.

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,300
Get on the horse.

116
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,380
No.

117
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,540
No, Mother.

118
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,540
Duozai, take her away now.

119
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Take her away.

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,820
Hurry. Just go.

121
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,420
- Get on, Mother.
- Leave.

122
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,540
Your Grace, let's go.

123
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,820
Mother!

124
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,140
Mother!

125
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,060
Xinwei, go to Yunpei!

126
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,380
Mother!

127
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,020
Live!

128
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,260
Mother!

129
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,900
Mother,

130
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,500
what we suffered in Masui and Tiandu,

131
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,700
I'll make them pay with blood

132
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,060
for you and Father in heaven.

133
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,260
Girl, let's kowtow.

134
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,940
(I'll collect all volumes of the Desert Scroll)

135
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,180
(and lead my clansmen)

136
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,180
(to survive.)

137
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,500
Duozai, we're going to Yunpei.

138
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,820
But with a marriage pass,

139
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,260
we can't get in town.

140
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,220
Then let's go find Enaqi's convoy.

141
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,460
Even if I serve as a slave,

142
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,580
I have to get into Yunpei.

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,620
I'll take you away now.

144
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,340
Your Grace.

145
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980
Your Grace.

146
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,580
Should we be going?

147
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,740
Don't rush me.

148
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
The sun is burning.

149
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
It nearly melts me.

150
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,820
To get married?

151
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,660
We don't even know if we can reach Yunpei.

152
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,620
But we rest all day long.

153
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,790
At this speed,

154
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,980
we can't make it to the marriage ceremony.

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,820
Isn't that great?

156
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,580
Then, let's not go.

157
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,140
You don't return to Enaqi, either.

158
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,060
I'll take you to travel
around the cities in the desert

159
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,220
and enjoy a very free life.

160
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,260
More dignified than your slave life.

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,340
Your Grace,

162
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,740
Enaqi needs your marriage

163
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,380
to get protection from the Lord of Yunpei.

164
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Don't threaten me like that.

165
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,820
I'm on my way, aren't I?

166
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,420
Fine. I'll take another short break.

167
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,660
When the sun comes here...

168
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,380
Maybe here.

169
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,300
Then, we'll set off again.

170
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,500
Cool.

171
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,940
Duozai,

172
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860
look over there.

173
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,700
Whoever wants to marry
the Lord of Yunpei can go.

174
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,980
I'm not going anyway.

175
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,340
Hey, girl.

176
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,140
Get up. Are you all right?

177
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
Are you hurt?

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,260
Miss, why are you here alone?

179
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,700
What happened?

180
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,820
Bandits are coming. Run.

181
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,940
Take me with you.

182
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
Bandits?

183
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
Too late.

184
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,500
Your Grace,

185
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,420
stop running.

186
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,580
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,620
I don't understand.

188
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,140
Your Grace, stop it.

189
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Come back with me to the camp.

190
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,780
Don't touch me.

191
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,740
Rogue! Bandit!

192
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,700
- You...
- I have no money.

193
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,940
Who on earth are you?

194
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Miss, it's our own business.

195
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
Horse, horse. Go. Quickly.

196
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,860
Silly horse, run.

197
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,540
Come on.

198
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,060
Move.

199
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
You...

200
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,620
To be honest,

201
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,660
we're Enaqi's convoy

202
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,220
going to Yunpei.

203
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,340
She's our princess for marriage.

204
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,220
Enaqi?

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,740
Your uncle is so vicious.

206
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,260
He usurped power

207
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,180
and even tried to kill you.

208
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
See?

209
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,460
Can marriage

210
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,380
really solve Enaqi's problem?

211
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,420
You just exchange my life

212
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,100
for temporary peace.

213
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Actually, I don't like

214
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,620
the title of "princess".

215
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,060
Being a princess

216
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,380
means I have to marry a lord.

217
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
It also means

218
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,220
I have to grovel

219
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,820
to make my people live.

220
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
Why do women

221
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,500
have to suffer this kind of fate?

222
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,420
We're not suffering

223
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,900
because we're women,

224
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,140
but because we're from weak tribes

225
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,060
and we don't have a choice.

226
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,380
Princesses in the past

227
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,780
were beautiful and wise.

228
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,940
They had big hearts.

229
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Determined to die, they started their journey

230
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,340
because they wanted

231
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,580
to make Enaqi stronger

232
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,380
and prevent their descendants
from the same destiny.

233
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
They're great, indeed.

234
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,300
But that's not what I want.

235
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,820
To be honest,

236
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,620
in no way will I go to Yunpei.

237
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
In the past century, Enaqi

238
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
has never been qualified
to marry a princess to Yunpei.

239
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,740
If you don't go,

240
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,820
Enaqi will have to suffer in extreme misery

241
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,460
for a lot more years.

242
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,060
Will you really disregard your responsibility?

243
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,020
Do you really not care

244
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,580
what kind of life your people live?

245
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,540
But why does it have to be me?

246
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,780
I want to replace you.

247
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
But I'm not qualified.

248
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,780
Don't be scared, anyway.

249
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,300
I'll keep you company.

250
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,580
Whatever it takes,

251
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,100
I'll help you marry the Lord of Yunpei.

252
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,540
Oh, yeah.

253
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,100
Why does it have to be me?

254
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,300
Since you want to go,

255
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,380
why don't you go instead of me?

256
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,620
You can marry the Lord.

257
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,260
Have you made up your mind?

258
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,140
If we switch identities...

259
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,900
I'm the Ninth Princess of Masui
who is running away.

260
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,540
If you survive in the desert as me,

261
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
you'll run into difficulties.

262
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,180
You may get killed at any time.

263
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,540
If both ways lead to death,

264
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,100
I would rather go your way.

265
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,220
The world is vast.

266
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
I just need to flee.

267
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll find a way out.

268
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,940
(Marriage Pass)
(I've made up my mind,)

269
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,020
(however hard my life will be)

270
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,460
(or however much I hate it.)

271
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,420
(I've made up my mind,)

272
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,180
(regardless of old sorrow)

273
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,780
(and terrible memories.)

274
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,140
(Marriage Pass)

275
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,460
I, Ge Xinwei, Ninth Princess of Masui...

276
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,140
I, Huang Beishuang, Princess of Enaqi...

277
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,780
We swear to wind, moon, and sand.

278
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,580
From this day on, we switch identities.

279
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,580
(Ge Xinwei, Ninth Princess of Masui)
I'll be Ge Xinwei, Ninth Princess of Masui.

280
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,740
(Huang Beishuang, Princess of Enaqi)
I'll be Huang Beishuang, Princess of Enaqi.

281
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
We won't ever change.

282
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,500
We won't ever regret it.

283
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,060
This is my seal of princess.

284
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,660
It's not very useful,

285
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,580
but it's a status symbol anyway.

286
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Keep it. Maybe you'll need it.

287
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,740
From this day,

288
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,380
you are me and I'm you.

289
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,380
For Enaqi and for ourselves,

290
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,220
we can never reveal who we are.

291
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,660
This big world is free for you.

292
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,980
Just stay away from trouble.

293
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,330
Keep it in mind.

294
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,740
(Marriage Pass)

295
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,580
This is my pass

296
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,980
and my token of princess.

297
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,020
Keep them.

298
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,700
From this day on,

299
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,820
I'm your princess Huang Beishuang.

300
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,660
(Marriage Pass)

301
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,620
If anyone objects

302
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,860
or doesn't want to take this risk,

303
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,460
stand out now.

304
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,740
You can return to Enaqi

305
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,860
or go your own way.

306
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,260
Leave as you wish.

307
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,860
We'll follow Your Grace

308
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
and go to Yunpei for the marriage thing.

309
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,980
(In the desert)

310
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
(and under the sky,)

311
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,700
(people live.)

312
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,180
(What if life is plain?)

313
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,580
(What if life is vigorous?)

314
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,020
(I pick my own way.)

315
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,020
(Since I choose to be this lady,)

316
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,060
(I have to fulfill my responsibility.)

317
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,300
(I guess it's also what Mother wants.)

318
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,180
(A lady like you,)

319
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,900
(either alive or dead,)

320
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,580
(will not be plain.)

321
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,980
(After we set out,)

322
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,700
(we'll soon cross)

323
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,540
(the Dead Zone of Desert Rankers.)

324
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,820
(We don't know if we can survive.)

325
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,700
(If I'm lucky enough to live,)

326
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,500
(I'm not going back to Enaqi.)

327
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,500
(I will live as Ge Xinwei)

328
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,140
(and travel around freely.)

329
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,460
(Have a pleasant trip.)

330
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,220
(Wish you a safe journey, too.)

331
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,900

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,580
Guys, fall back!

374
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,190
(The Dead Zone)

375
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,620
Come on.

376
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,680
Help me out.

377
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,570
Thank you.

378
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,010
You're back.

379
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,620
You're back, huh?

380
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,500
Let's drink next time.

381
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,620
(The Dead Zone)

382
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,740
They're back!

383
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,660
They're back!

384
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,020
There they are.

385
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Let's go have a look.

386
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,650
- Chief!
- Chief!

387
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,180
Guys, divide up what we robbed.

388
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,820
It's for everybody.

389
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,700
- Guys.
- Come over.

390
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,910
Guys, come over.

391
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,940
Take it away.

392
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,140
Here. Divide everything up.

393
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,230
Here. Somebody come.

394
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,020
Unload everything and let's drink.

395
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,380
Guys, take whatever you want.

396
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,220
Yes, Chief.

397
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,330
Fox.

398
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,340
You got the wrong girl.

399
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
But...

400
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,060
Is there really the Prettiest Lady?

401
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,220
Where did you get this portrait?

402
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,380
- I picked it up.
- Picked it up?

403
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,780
I did.

404
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
But Wolf told me

405
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,780
someone saw this lady nearby.

406
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,540
She must be with the convoy passing by.

407
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
Go look ahead.

408
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
Yes.

409
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,100
Since I'm the wrong girl,

410
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,100
why don't you release me?

411
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,300
Do you know nobody can get out of here?

412
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,500
Release me if you dare.

413
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,340
See if I can get out of here.

414
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,340
I don't dare.

415
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,260
You...

416
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,460
Tying a woman up

417
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,620
doesn't make you great.

418
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,940
Untie me.

419
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,420
It's not that I don't untie you.

420
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,820
I just fear after that,

421
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,740
you may go crazy and hurt yourself.

422
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,860
What's your name? Tell me.

423
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Want to know it?

424
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,860
It will scare you.

425
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm all ears.

426
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,860
I'm Ge Xinwei,

427
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,540
the woman of Ruo Wen,

428
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,300
head of Desert Rankers.

429
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,540
You arrogant guy.

430
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,380
Have you heard about Ruo Wen?

431
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,660
He's a ruthless bandit

432
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,460
who kills people impulsively.

433
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,220
If you're smart enough,

434
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
release me now.

435
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,060
Offer me wine and food.

436
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,220
Or when my man comes,

437
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,020
he'll take down your den

438
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,580
and make you suffer.

439
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,620
Your man sounds fierce.

440
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,660
Scared, huh?

441
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,860
Untie me now.

442
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,660
So, where is he?

443
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,180
He...

444
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,580
He's on his way here.

445
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,100
Come on. Tell me.

446
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,380
What does Ruo Wen look like?

447
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,900
He's tall with a big head and round eyes.

448
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,500
He's large and super strong.

449
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,060
With one hand, he can crush your skull.

450
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
Unlike you.

451
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,090
You look wea...

452
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,220
Pity for you to have such a man.

453
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,260
Try and you will know

454
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,020
if I am strong.

455
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,700
In your dreams!

456
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,940
Let... Let go of me.

457
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,260
My man won't let you go.

458
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
You...

459
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,420
Ruo Wen will deal with you.

460
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,540
Tell me who you are.

461
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,340
Chief.

462
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,900
Speak.

463
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,100
We found her.

464
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,860
Got it.

465
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,700
You want to know who I am, right?

466
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,580
I'm Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers.

467
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,300
Move, Feita.

468
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,500
You can't rest here.

469
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,060
Feita.

470
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,100
Old pal, don't be scared.

471
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,660
You won't die.

472
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,620
Your Grace, someone is ahead there.

473
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,780
Here's a little water.

474
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,020
Good boy, Feita.

475
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,340
Drink it.

476
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,980
Drink it and let's get out of here.

477
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,100
Duozai.

478
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,180
Drink it.

479
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,420
Why do you not drink?

480
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,380
Gentleman, you're injured.

481
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,420
I'm all right.

482
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,140
The world is dangerous
and the desert is merciless.

483
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,060
Even if you don't want it to die,

484
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,020
you have to let it be.

485
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,300
Gentleman, give up.

486
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,380
Feita isn't dead yet.

487
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,860
Thank you.

488
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,220
Guo'er, get me ten sachets of water.

489
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,300
In the desert,

490
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,860
ten sachets of water

491
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,060
are more valuable
than a thousand bags of gold.

492
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,980
People are indifferent in the desert.

493
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,060
Humans are cold to each other.

494
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,860
But you care so much for your horse.

495
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,940
You even gave it a name.

496
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,860
For this,

497
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,260
I'll give you ten sachets of water.

498
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,500
Five for your horse

499
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
and five for you.

500
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,460
Feita, why do you not drink?

501
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,700
It understands human nature.

502
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,740
You can drink some first.

503
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,180
Maybe it will drink, too.

504
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,260
Here.

505
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,380
Good boy.

506
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,300
I have a lot more water.

507
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Drink it slowly.

508
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,900
The water I give you

509
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,380
can last until you get out of the desert.

510
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,740
Her Grace means well.

511
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,700
Thanks.

512
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,540
Wish you a safe trip.

513
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,900
We have to keep traveling.

514
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,140
See you.

515
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,340
I'm Huo Qingyun.

516
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,980
You helped me.

517
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,260
I will...

518
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,940
(Why does she have the Desert Scroll?)

519
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't move.

520
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,020
It's too hot.

521
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,260
Your wound may fester.

522
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,540
You saved my life, right?

523
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,420
Thank you.

524
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,180
May I have your name?

525
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,820
Nothing.

526
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
You're just lucky enough.

527
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,780
We met by chance.

528
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,060
You don't need to know my name.

529
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,460
Of course.

530
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,060
Miss, it's understandable

531
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,340
that you are wary of me.

532
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,340
In this vast desert,

533
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,980
I'm just some nobody.

534
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,540
And I'm indeed not a nice man.

535
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,180
If you approach me,

536
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
you'll get into trouble.

537
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,060
Don't worry.

538
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,420
I'm leaving right away.

539
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,500
Stop the carriage.

540
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,860
Your Grace.

541
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,940
I'm sorry.

542
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,260
Are you from the Enaqi Tribe?

543
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,580
From these things,

544
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,620
you can tell I'm from Enaqi?

545
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,820
I'm a businessman

546
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,180
who often travels in the desert.

547
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,100
I can recognize local products

548
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,100
from all tribes.

549
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,180
Enaqi is a nice place.

550
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,980
I once lost some goods there.

551
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,740
When I went back there,

552
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,620
the goods were circled.

553
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,260
They were marked instead of being stolen.

554
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,700
Look at this.

555
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,540
Some spices from your clansman.

556
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,780
The scent lasts very long.

557
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
Smell it.

558
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,220
How does it smell?

559
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,380
Good, huh?

560
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,260
I heard them call you Your Grace.

561
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,220
You're a princess from Enaqi, huh?

562
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,420
Bearing the responsibility of marriage

563
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,980
must be hard for you.

564
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,060
Wish you a safe trip to Yunpei.

565
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,780
Then people in Enaqi

566
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,740
will live a good life.

567
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,140
But anyway, the trip is dangerous.

568
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
You can't be too cautious.

569
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,740
I lost my goods.

570
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,820
I have to return and report it.

571
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,900
See you in Yunpei
if we're destined to meet again.

572
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,740
By then, I'll repay you.

573
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
You're also going to Yunpei?
