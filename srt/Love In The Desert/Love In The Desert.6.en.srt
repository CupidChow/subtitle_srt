(Yunfang Pavilion)

25
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,670
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,350
Call me Your Grace.

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,580
I'm not used to being called

28
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,670
My Lady.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,390
Your Grace.

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,510
Your Grace.

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,300
Chief.

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,730
What?

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,990
Have you found the entrance
to the secret passageway?

34
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,230
The fire in your mansion
spread to outside the city.

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,070
Houses around the entrance were burned.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,070
After all these years, it's hard to find it.

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,350
We have to find it.

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,670
And we have to be quick.

39
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,910
Yes.

40
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,830
What's wrong?

41
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,810
Say it.

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,390
Today, Miss Beishuang got her title.

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,490
I know.

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,000
That's all I expected.

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,230
Indeed,

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,860
Miss Beishuang is beautiful and wise.

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,620
It's very easy for her

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,790
to win over Na Zhan.

49
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,620
Na Zhan doesn't care for this.

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,550
You mean the Desert Scroll?

51
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,510
Or why did he hold this ceremony?

52
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,990
So, Miss Beishuang is in a snake pit.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,110
She made her choice.

54
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,540
(Yunfang Pavilion)

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,020
Search the southwest of Yunfang Pavilion.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,980
I remember

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,830
there was a side door.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,790
Yes.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,980
My Lord.

60
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,620
Princess Zhenqu is quite sensible

61
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,670
and she fights for what she wants.

62
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,390
Beishuang, I heard you danced

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,550
Phenix Nirvana in the hall

64
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
and amazed everyone.

65
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,300
As I can see,

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,030
you're indeed extraordinary.

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
You flatter me.

68
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,910
You have a unique appearance

69
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,180
and a great talent

70
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,590
among all the ladies.

71
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,060
Today, I'm lucky enough

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,590
to get my title as you do.

73
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,110
We should have each other's back.

74
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes, of course.

75
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,030
(Yufu Pavilion)

76
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,620
Don't flatter each other like that.

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,550
Strangers may think you're familiar.

78
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,180
I'm not familiar with you.

79
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,940
I won't be modest, then.

80
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,300
Yufu Pavilion...

81
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,550
I'll live here.

82
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,470
You have good taste, Lady Yuwei.

83
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,230
It's nearest to His Lordship's chamber.

84
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,030
But Yuwei,

85
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,620
I like this place, too.

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,470
What do we do?

87
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,060
People in Zhenqu have good manners.

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,300
Yes. You're right.

89
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,100
What about Huang Beishuang?

90
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,060
Huang Beishuang...

91
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,740
I kind of can't see through her.

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,140
What?

93
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,300
Even you can't see through her?

94
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,180
Don't make fun of me, My Lord.

95
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,860
She behaves really prudently.

96
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,470
She appears to be mature.

97
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,150
But as far as I see,

98
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,990
judging from her temper,

99
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,550
she's quite simple.

100
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,110
When Princess Yuwei
embarrassed Princess Youjia,

101
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,990
she even helped the latter.

102
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,590
You like this place?

103
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,300
Princess Yuwei,

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,940
this isn't your tribe.

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,260
You're a noble lady.

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,470
So is Youjia.

107
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,470
You defend her?

108
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,620
You're quite close.

109
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,380
We all came here for marriage

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,740
with the responsibility of our tribe.

111
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,820
All we want is to stay with His Lordship

112
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,790
and serve him

113
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,940
so that he will care more

114
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,110
for our own tribe.

115
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,670
We'd better not embarrass each other.

116
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,550
Besides,

117
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,060
Mr. Zhu is watching.

118
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,590
If he tells His Lordship about it,

119
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm afraid His Lordship

120
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,230
will misunderstand your temper.

121
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,420
She's quite warmhearted.

122
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,590
Enaqi is very remote.

123
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,940
And she has the Desert Scroll.

124
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,180
She even got away from Ruo Wen.

125
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,990
Do you

126
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,590
still think she's simple?

127
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,260
It's wise of you, My Lord.

128
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,910
I really didn't think of it.

129
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,790
Ladies from over 30 tribes came.

130
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,820
But I received only one volume.

131
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,020
(Herb Volume of the Desert Scroll)

132
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,500
It's hard.

133
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,460
Really hard.

134
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,820
My Lord, no offense.

135
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,740
Only three volumes are out there.

136
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,300
Getting one

137
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,940
can be lucky enough.

138
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,150
But now,

139
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,990
Lady Yuwei and Lady Youjia
haven't been settled.

140
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,180
They share Yufu Pavilion for now.

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,300
Please make a final decision.

142
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,190
What do you think?

143
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,620
I noticed something.

144
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,230
Umm...

145
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,420
Lady Yuwei doesn't look

146
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,860
like Second Princess Yuwei

147
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,790
on the record I received.

148
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,940
She behaves more like Yuqiang,

149
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,300
the legendary Eldest Princess

150
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
of the Mizan Tribe.

151
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,710
It doesn't matter.

152
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,670
Send someone to her tribe and check it.

153
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,990
If she is an imposter,

154
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,990
execute her.

155
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,020
Yes.

156
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,180
What about Huang Beishuang?

157
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,790
She lives very far away...

158
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,350
In Yunfang Pavilion.

159
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,740
My Lord. My Lord.

160
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Didn't you tell her what place it is?

161
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,950
I did.

162
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,020
(Yunfang Pavilion)

163
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,310
Mr. Zhu.

164
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,500
I'll live here.

165
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,140
The scenery is good.

166
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,620
But His Lordship doesn't like this place.

167
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,740
It's very far away from his chamber.

168
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,830
And it's too quiet.

169
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,350
I have trouble sleeping
and I love to be quiet.

170
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,740
This place is perfect for me.

171
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,380
Yeah.

172
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,350
It's quiet, indeed.

173
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,860
But...

174
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,900
It has been uninhabited.

175
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,710
I'm afraid it's too dreary.

176
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,990
It's such a good place.

177
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,660
Why is it uninhabited?

178
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,350
Well, let me be honest.

179
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,590
In Yunfang Pavilion,

180
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,310
the late lord passed away.

181
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,540
If you live here alone,

182
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,660
at night, it may... You know...

183
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,500
It doesn't matter.

184
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,190
I'm righteous and not scared of ghosts.

185
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,670
Mr. Zhu.

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,390
Without you,

187
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,020
- I wouldn't be enjoying this.
- Umm...

188
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,430
Just a little present for you.

189
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,470
She insisted on living there.

190
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,310
And she said...

191
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,910
Said...

192
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,590
Said what?

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,020
She said...

194
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,020
She didn't mind.

195
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,070
My Lord, one more thing.

196
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,990
After today's ceremony,

197
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,830
Huang Beishuang took her servants

198
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,430
to Genesis Tomb and Sky Tower.

199
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,350
She knows quite a lot about our history.

200
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,350
Very rare, indeed.

201
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,430
My Lord, then...

202
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,990
What do we do with the remaining ladies?

203
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
Those who want to stay can stay.

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,540
Noble men in town will marry them.

205
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,030
Yes.

206
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,500
Zhu Jun.

207
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,230
Yes, My Lord.

208
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,160
How may I serve you, My Lord?

209
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,590
From the ceremony,

210
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,780
you've profited handsomely.

211
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,780
I wouldn't dare.

212
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,430
Return everything.

213
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,070
Yes.

214
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,820
(Yun)

215
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,430
Chief,

216
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,020
we found the entrance
to the secret passageway.

217
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,110
Any internal collapse?

218
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,760
It's been deserted for years.

219
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,180
But the walls are in good condition.

220
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,620
Standing water is somewhere, though.

221
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,350
I wonder if Na Zhan sent his men

222
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,080
to search this passageway.

223
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,960
He wouldn't find anything.

224
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,540
Those who knew what happened

225
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,110
aren't in Yunpei anymore.

226
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,590
I was overthinking.

227
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,740
When will we move?

228
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,660
Tonight, I'll go check it myself.

229
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,110
All right. Stay safe.

Why can't I come back?

237
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,380
Because bad guys moved in.

238

Your father doesn't want you to be hurt.

239
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,950
So, you have to leave.

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,830
No.

242
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,070
He has great martial arts.

243
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,740
Nobody can hurt him.

244
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,550

258
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,590
Your Grace.

259
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,070
What's all the fuss about?

260
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,140
Your Grace, something happened.

261
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,380
Lady Yuwei replaced her sick sister

262
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,710
and got caught.

263
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,310
She was clubbed to death.

264
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,590
His Lordship also ordered

265
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,310
he should stop taking offerings or ladies
from the Mizan Tribe.

266
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,380
He won't protect them, either.

267
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,900
Do not panic.

268
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,230
Enaqi is a very small tribe.

269
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,780
It has little connection with Yunpei.

270
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,710
His Lordship isn't familiar with us.

271
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,590
Unless we ask for trouble,

272
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,630
we won't be in trouble.

273
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,230
Huang Beishuang?

274
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,230
Why did she pick this chamber?

275
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,860
Your Grace,

276
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,380
do you regret coming here?

277
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,380
Why do you ask?

278
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,430
Your Grace, you like Mr. Huo

279
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,630
instead of His Lordship.

280
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,190
I...

281
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,190
That's not true.

282
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,470
That's not?

283
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,540
Then in your dream last night,

284
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,190
why did you keep calling Mr. Huo?

285
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,580
I did?

286
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,550
Yes.

287
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,590
Many times.

288
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,710
Don't be absurd.

289
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,780
It's just a dream.

290
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,310
It doesn't mean anything.

291
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,430
I do like him, but so what?

292
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,430
Yepei.

293
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,830
Promise me.

294
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,900
We won't talk about Mr. Huo anymore.

295
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,740
Why?

296
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,500
Things now are very different.

297
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,380
Life here is dangerous.

298
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,590
We must remember.

299
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,310
Keep silent and be very careful.

300
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,140
I have to forget him.

301
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,710
He shouldn't be thought of

302
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,660
or talked about.

303
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,030
All right.

304
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,500
You get to sleep.

305
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,980
(Masui)

306
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,500
(Masui)

307
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,600
Take a look.

308
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,420
Pendants for sale.

309
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,590
Are you done resting?

310
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,670
Then let's move.

311
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,870
You have no idea.

312
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm the princess.

313
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Such servants can't see my face.

314
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,390
Bumpkin.

315
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,300
Ruo Wen, put me down.

316
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,500
Ruo Wen, when I get down,

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,870
I won't let you go.

318
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,990
Why are we going there?

319
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,580
Put me down, Ruo Wen.

320
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,470
Be quiet.

321
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,780
Ruo Wen, put me down.

322
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,630
I'm begging you.

323
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,340
Put me down, Ruo Wen.

324
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,820
I beg you.

325
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,990
Put me down.

326
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Ruo Wen.

327
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,900
Today is the sacrificial ceremony.

328
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,990
No foreigners allowed.

329
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,940
Just leave.

330
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,340
(Oh, no. Why do we run into this?)

331
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,510
(I have to escape.)

332
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,630
Unfortunately,

333
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,580
I forgot the sacrificial ceremony.

334
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,470
Don't waste time. Let's move.

335
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,230
Where are you going?

336
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,910
This is Ge Xinwei, your ninth princess.

337
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,300
(Seal of Ninth Princess)

338
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,020
The Ninth Princess is here.

339
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,990
The Ninth Princess is here.

340
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,620
- Ruo Wen, look what you've done.
- The Ninth Princess is here.

341
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,580
What are you doing?

342
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,190
Let's go.

343
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,710
Where do you want to go?

344
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,390
Your Grace, come this way.

345
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,710
You're really a princess.

346
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,550
What's going on?

347
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,390
They'll take me back.

348
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,300
What do we do?

349
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,710
That's good.

350
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,710
Take her away.

351
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,260
- Ruo Wen, you punk.
- Yes.

352
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,820
Let's talk it over.

353
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,190
I'm not your princess.

354
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,740
I stole the seal.

355
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,500
Ruo Wen, Ruo Wen!

356
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,630
Trust me.

357
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,150
That is not my seal.

358
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm not your princess.

359
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,630
Put me down.

360
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,350
What on earth do you want?

361
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,670
I told you.

362
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,260
I'm not the Ninth Princess.

363
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,020
Your Grace, don't be kidding.

364
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,990
You get the wrong girl.

365
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,280
If you don't believe me,

366
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,870
find someone who met the princess

367
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,870
and let him verify.

368
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,260
Nine is for all.

369
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,710
Now, we have the lineage

370
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,060
of the Lord of Masui.

371
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,150
I'm not even one of you guys.

372
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,000
Are you insane?

373
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,990
Your Grace, don't try to fool me.

374
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,630
You have the seal of the princess.

375
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,580
That's the symbol of noble status.

376
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Fine. I am insane.

377
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,480
You know what?

378
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,020
I have an epidemic.

379
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Stay away from me.

380
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,300
Or everybody will be infected.

381
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,470
Don't panic, Your Grace.

382
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,550
This is time.

383
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,140
Don't be scared, Your Grace.

384
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,630
It's the moment you'll do honor to Masui.

385
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,670
I'm not the princess.

386
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,310
I'm not. You get the wrong girl.

387
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,340
She's a fraud?

388
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,430
Ruo Wen, come out of here!

389
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,230
Ruo Wen, I won't let you go!

390
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,780
Come out of here!

391
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,990
Ruo Wen!

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,260
- Who are you?
- Utterly ignorant.

393
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,420
Take him down.

394
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,190
What took you so long?

395
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,030
Is it fun?

396
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,790

- Go away.
- Now, it's fun.

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,580

The treasure you promised me...

417
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,580
I haven't got it yet.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Is there no other reason?

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,450

A princess like me

isn't as valuable as a mere treasure

423

in your eyes.

424
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,870
That's right.

425
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,780
Then go find it yourself.

426
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
No wonder you didn't want
to take me to Masui.

427
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,460
Turns out

428
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,980
this isn't your hometown.

429
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,140
For now, you can't get the treasure.

430
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,100
I'll make do with it.

431
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,980
How about I marry you

432
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,620
and be a bandit forever?

433
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,500
Hey, don't.

434
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,420
It's all right.

435
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,180
I can bear hardships.

436
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,030
I can be a bandit forever.

437
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,740
Who told you I'd be a bandit forever?

438
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,380
What is your plan, then?

439
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,540
What do you want?

440
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,700
You want to be my wife, huh?

441
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,140
Impatient?

442
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,780
Ruo Wen,

443
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,860
what do you want?

444
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,740
Untie me.

445
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,430
When I can't get the treasure,
you're of no use.

446
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,040
Untie yourself and go wherever you want.

447
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,740
Just don't follow me.

448
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,940
There are tigers, wolves,

449
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,340
vipers, and other beasts.

450
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,620
There are ghosts, too.

451
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,100
I don't want to stay here.

452
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,100
We've been through a lot together.

453
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,980
Ruo Wen!

454
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,340
How heartless you are!

455
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,500
Come back here!

456
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,820
Let me go!

457
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,020
- Chief.
- Chief.

458
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,340
What are you doing here?

459
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,700
Chief.

460
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,300
The Dead Zone...

461
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,380
The Dead Zone is gone.

462
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,140
It's gone?

463
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,460
The woman who escaped

464
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,700
colluded with old Dong Bahe

465
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,940
to destroy the Dead Zone

466
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,500
and took away her men.

467
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,300
A man helped her.

468
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,860
They worked together

469
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,500
- and fooled us.
- Man?

470
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,490
Do you have his portrait?

471
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

472
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,540
Show it to me.

473
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,060
It's him.

474
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,220
He looks familiar.

475
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,740
I met him in Henan Inn.

476
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Chief,

477
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,270
they were heading for Yunpei.

478
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,300
But anyway,

479
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,620
I shot him with a poisoned arrow.

480
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,100
Chief,

481
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,500
what do we do now?

482
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,540
We'll go find Dong Bahe.

483
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,380
Ruo Wen!

484
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,980
How clingy.

00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,860
Letter to the Death Lord.

487
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,460
What?

488
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Mr. Rong,

489
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,740
get pessimistic again, huh?

490
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,580
Or do you not like this place?

491
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,700
You have to offer Mr. Rong

492
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,140
good wine and dishes.

493
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,900
Take very good care of him.

494
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,780
Understand?

495
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,780
Yes.

496
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,140
Mr. Rong,

497
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,460
you were away from home for years.

498
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,060
Finally, you're back to Yunpei
for the rest of your life.

499
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,020
The late lord passed away.

500
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,260
Do you think I still care

501
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,340
that much for Yunpei?

502
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,580
Whatever.

503
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,220
Whatever.

504
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,700
Mr. Rong, I'm here to ask you

505
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,220
to explain something.

506
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,620
Please tell me

507
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,620
the secrets in the volumes by the late lord.

508
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,180
(Herb Volume of the Desert Scroll)

509
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,820
Congratulations. You got another one.

510
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,340
But I'm not good at explaining anything.

511
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,100
Go find someone else.

512
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,620
Mr. Rong,

513
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,740
don't be kidding.

514
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,100
Known as "historiographer",

515
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,700
you're conversant
with ancient and modern affairs.

516
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,180
Besides, you and Rong Ruo,

517
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,140
your elder brother,

518
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,860
compiled the volumes

519
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,980
with the late lord.

520
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,940
If you don't understand,

521
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,380
shall I consult
the late lord in the netherworld?

522
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,140
You can go.

523
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,420
Take the Letter to the Death Lord

524
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,180
and a letter of confession.

525
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,020
Mr. Rong, don't be kidding.

526
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,100
I have something else to ask you.

527
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,580
I'd like to know

528
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,740
about that boy.

529
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,540
Mr. Rong,

530
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,940
did you not hear me?

531
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,740
I want to know where the boy is.

532
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,660
When you leave,

533
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,580
remember to close the door.

534
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,180
I hate the cold.

535
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,340
Take good care of him.

536
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,700
Yes.

537
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,460
(Library)

538
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,380
- My Lord.
- Close the door.

539
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,700
Who do you want for tonight,
Lady Youjia or Lady Beishuang?

540
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,610
Both.

541
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,540
Yes.

542
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,460
Chief, if we get in like this,

543
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,820
will we not come out?

544
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,700
To defend the city against enemies,

545
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,060
the late lord built this passageway
and Huayu Mansion.

546
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,100
So, when enemies broke in,

547
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,940
his families could flee quickly.

548
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,740
Based on our previous investigation,

549
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,140
we're standing

550
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,140
right between the Council Room
and the inner chambers.

551
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,500
This passageway

552
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,300
winds in four directions.

553
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,290
You take the north and the south.

554
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,260
Sha Qu takes the east.

555
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,900
When you get out,

556
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,660
stay alert against patrolling guards.

557
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,420
Find Rong Huo as soon as you can.

558
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
- Yes.
- Yes.

559
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,460
I heard

560
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,340
the lady you met in the inn

561
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,700
lives in the west now.

562
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,580
Let's go.

563
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,260
Na Zhan is over 20 years old.

564
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,260
With the supervision right,
he's recruited many henchmen

565
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,300
- and colluded with the Lord's eunuch.
- My Lord.

566
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,700
Now,

567
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,300
we can't fight him.

568
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,380
Rong Ruo,

569
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,700
step aside.

570
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
Oh, you.

571
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,420
You're mature.

572
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,860
However,

573
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,740
you worry about too many things.

574
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,740
Don't be kidding, Father.

575
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,980
All I worry about

576
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,900
is your safety.

577
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,140
Getting impatient?

578
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,140
My Lord.

579
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,000
My Lord.

580
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,140
Rest in peace.

581
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,460
His Lordship is dead!

582
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,180
People live and die.

583
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,260
Love and hate.

584
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,260
Destiny

585
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,420
is amazing.

586
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,980
The wind blows away the clouds.

587
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,900
The frost in the sky is desolate.

588
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,260
(The wind blows away the clouds.
The frost in the sky is desolate.)

589
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,900
Your Grace, get in for some rest.

590
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,980
Your Grace,

591
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,420
why is the wardrobe door open?

592
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,260
Maybe I forgot to close it
when I took out some clothes.

593
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,620
Yepei.

594
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,980
Go make some tea.

595
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,140
All right.

596
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,820
Lady Beishuang.

597
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,540
Congratulations, My Lady.

598
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,220
Mr. Zhu.

599
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,820
At the command of His Lordship,

600
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,580
you and Lady Youjia
will spend the night with him.
