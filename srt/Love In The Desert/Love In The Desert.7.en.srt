Yes. Very much.

I just read Chapter 6.

There are 18 chapters.

69
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,700
You finished a third.

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,770

Yes, some of it.

73
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,030
I wouldn't dare.

74
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,130
You read it without permission.

75
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,400
You have to accept the consequences.

76
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,720
You can't avoid it.

77
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,130
If you answer correctly,

78
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,040
I won't punish you.

79
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,330
But if you get it wrong,

80
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,960
it's not too late to beg me for mercy.

81
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,520
Go ahead, My Lord.

The 10th column of Chapter 1

85
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,380
is about the phenomena of sandstorms

86
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,040
and the biggest wind erosion.

The 5th column of Chapter 3

89
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,240
is about the distribution of fixed dunes

90
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,120
and moving dunes in the north desert.

92

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,170
Marvelous.

94
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,390
Impressive.

95
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,000
You have an eidetic memory.

96
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,600
Really rare.

97
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,450
You flatter me, My Lord.

98
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,960
I'm far inferior to you, My Lord.

99
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,410
My compliment is serious.

100
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,050
Don't be scared.

101
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,860
When I answered,

102
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,720
you didn't check the book at all.

103
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,570
It means you remember everything.

104
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,690
You know when to push

105
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,330
and when to stop.

106
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,170
You avoid me.

107
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,240
You flatter me, too.

108
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,660
You...

109
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,210
You're interesting.

110
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,480
When you fought Ruo Wen,

111
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,600
you weren't scared.

112
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,090
In front of me,

113
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,210
what do you fear?

114
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,210
When I fought Ruo Wen,

115
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,120
in the worst case,

116
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,290
Enaqi convoys and I

117
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,090
would die in the Dead Zone.

118
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,120
Unless everyone in Enaqi dies,

119
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,480
there's always hope.

120
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,840
But if I enrage you,

121
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,600
Enaqi will have no future.

122
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,720
You're the sun of Enaqi.

123
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,480
Do you

124
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,640
truly mean this?

125
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,050
Truly, I do.

126
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,120
I will wait

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,450
until you open your heart to me.

128
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,930
I believe

129
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,720
you will surprise me.

130
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,720
That day will come.

131
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,530
My Lord,

132
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,290
don't leave me here alone.

133
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,930
I’m scared.

134
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,360
My Lord,

135
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,480
you wear too little.

136
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,000
Get in for some rest.

137
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,840
I shouldn't disturb you.

138
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,880
Please allow me to go back.

139
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,690
Away you go.

140
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,840
If I can't get drunk,

141
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,530
what's the point of drinking?

142
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,340
Chief,

143
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,690
it's very late.

144
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,720
Are you done making the map?

145
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,570
Not yet.

146
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,150
Before you finish it,

147
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,360
neither you nor I will sleep.

148
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,940
Fine.

149
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,600
What makes him so angry?

150
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,530
Your men are really dumb.

151
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,530
They don't take care of you.

152
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,060
Here. You eat first.

153
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,570
Too hot. Get it down for me.

154
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,210
Don't waste food.

155
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,090
What do we

156
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,600
come here for?

157
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,880
To kill someone.

158
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,240
Kill someone?

159
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,760
Chief, we've handled local guys.

160
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,000
Where are the rest?

161
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,100
It took them such a long time.

162
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,570
Are they scared away?

163
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,630
No.

164
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,170
It's not time yet.

165
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,960
They just haven't come back.

166
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,450
Hurry up, men.

167
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,530
Hey, you guys.

168
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,690
Horse, catch up.

169
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,840
Guys,

170
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,550
get moving.

171
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,990
Rush them. Hurry.

172
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,880
Watch carefully. Don't drop anything.

173
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,870
Catch up.

174
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,900
Let's go back and drink.

175
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,340
Move.

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,790
- Catch up.
- Hurry.

177
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,570
- All right.
- Tie the horse.

178
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,450
Come on. Catch up.

179
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,930
Get them in.

180
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,270
Put everything there.

181
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,640
Come on. Hurry.

00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,330
Finish the job and drink.

185
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,720
Run! Run away!

186
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,060
Mr. Dong,

187
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,240
robbed innocent people again, huh?

188
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,390
No.

189
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,660
All right. Want to run, huh?

190
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,530
Go ahead.

191
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,810
I'll count to five.

192
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,120
Don't get caught.

193
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,600
You stand there.

194
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,820
One.

195
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,790
Two.

196
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,720
Five.

197
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
Mr. Dong,

198
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,390
I gave you a chance, but you failed.

199
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,740
I caught you so soon.

200
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,950
Boring, indeed.

201
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,930
Release me.

202
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,740
I'll leave the desert and never come back.

203
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,640
Release you?

204
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,480
Do you guys get it?

205
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,600
He wants to live.

206
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,760
I really do.

207
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,530
What about you guys?

208
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,000
- We do.
- We do.

209
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,240
Tell me. Do you want to live?

210
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,410
Kneel, all of you.

211
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,480
We want to live.

212
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,710
- Kneel.
- We want to live.

213
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,530
Kneel. Kneel for a life.

214
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,580
Kneel.

215
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,330
I want only ten men.

216
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,760
Whatever you do,

217
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,960
the last survivors

218
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,990
will leave with me.

219
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,360
Ten?

220
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,410
No problem.

221
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,570
You. Come over.

222
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm the 10th.

223
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,170
I'm the 10th.

224
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,640
I really am.

225
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,880
Release me. I'm the 10th.

226
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,630
Let me go.

227
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,120
Let me go.

228
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,210
See?

229
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,690
To survive,

230
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,880
he killed his man.

231
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,350
In his eyes, you are worth nothing!

232
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,210
Shut up. Ruo Wen, shut up!

233
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,530
Dong Bahe,

234
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,570
you exploded my den.
You have a death wish.

235
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,270
Bandits don't do this.

236
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,350
Then tell me.

237
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,480
What do bandits do?

238
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,840
Tell me.

239
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,290
Who can tell me?

240
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,930
What should bandits do?

241
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,840
We, Desert Rankers,

242
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,760
don't kill our own men

243
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,760
or rob poor people.

244
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,700
You guys...

245
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,090
To stay or to leave,

246
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,690
make your own choice.

247
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,580
We want to follow Chief Ruo Wen.

248
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,970
We'll serve you and always be loyal.

249
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,120
Good.

250
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,340
Very good.

251
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,600
Take them in.

252
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,950
Get up.

253
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,120
Let's drink and eat!

254
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,510
Smells so good.

255
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,920
Wine and meat.

256
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,530
We should follow Chief Ruo Wen.

257
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,190
Tastes so good.

258
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,890
- Delicious.
- So good.

259
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,920
The mutton tastes great.

260
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,920
Guys, enjoy yourselves.

261
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,230
- Cheers.
- Let's drink.

262
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,330
Cheers. Come on.

263
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,840
Scared?

264
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,730
Not at all.

265
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,810
I just...

266
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,090
I don't like this.

267
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,880
This is how Desert Rankers live.

268
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,490
If you're not used to it,

269
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,120
you can leave at any time.

270
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,090
- Will you go with me?
- Let's drink.

271
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,060
No.

272
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,120
The Dead Zone is gone.

273
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,840
Where will you go?

274
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,870
None of your business.

275
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,770
I offer to take you away

276
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,570
because I want to save you.

277
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,290
Now, you have nowhere to stay.

278
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,910
Will these men

279
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,160
still follow you?

280
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,290
You can ask them

281
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,200
if they will still follow me.

282
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,640
Will you be a bandit forever?

283
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm asking you.

284
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,710
Come on. Whatever I ask you,

285
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,090
you never answer.

286
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,730
Look at me.

287
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,600
Will you be a bandit forever?

288
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,400
Ruo Wen,

289
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,880
I've never seen this before.

290
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,250
Madwoman,

291
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,920
you shouldn't have drunk this much.

292
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,200
I can keep drinking.

293
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,900
Feels so good.

294
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,970
So good.

295
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,830
Put everything on the horse.

296
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,690
All right.

297
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,900
Make sure you pack everything.

298
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
Take this.

299
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,910
Lead a group of men

300
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,230
to check around in Masui.

301
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,070
Later, I'll join you.

302
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,030
Yes.

303
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,580
Don't forget the goods.

304
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,540
Chief,

305
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,840
the new lord is profligate
and he reigns poorly.

306
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,840
We can easily take down Masui.

307
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
Do we need to check?

308
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,110
Masui has been guarded for a century

309
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,380
- for some reason.
- Pack carefully.

310
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,680
Attacking a city is a big deal.
We have to be serious.

311
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,630
Move that away.

312
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,850
- You two...
- As usual.

313
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,160
Take some men and we're going to Yunpei.

314
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

315
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,600
- Chief, what about this woman?
- Make way.

316
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,270
What?

317
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,190
Chief.

318
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,340
Feed the horse.

319
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,220
Let's go.

320
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,770
Fine. My money is gone again.

321
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,620
Guys back there...

322
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,110
Cheer up. Stop sleeping.

323
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,310
Come on.

324
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,670
Let's go.

325
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,050
Come on.

326
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,250
Catch up.

327
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,340
Let's go.

328
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,730
Don't go.

329
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,290
I can drink more.

330
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,360
Ruo Wen.

331
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,120
What a man! He didn't wake me up.

332
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,300
Ruo Wen?

333
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,200
Ruo Wen!

334
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,970
Terrible man.

335
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,400
Want to get rid of me with money?

336
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,290
I don't care for money!

337
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,220
(Yufu Pavilion)

338
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,440
Xiaolian,

339
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,840
do you think
His Lordship really likes me?

340
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,190
Congratulations, My Lady.

341
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,250
Everybody is talking about last night.

342
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,260
Two ladies were summoned.

343
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,010
Only Lady Youjia
was favored by His Lordship.

344
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,530
Oh, the servants.

345
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,770
How dare they gossip about the ladies?

346
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,810
Why is my heart still thudding madly?

347
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,290
Did I not have enough sleep last night?

348
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,630
Oh, My Lady.

349
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,290
You're just crazy about His Lordship

350
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,250
and your heart is racing.

351
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,350
Bad girl. Aren't you ashamed?

352
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,120
The rewards are here.

353
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,190
My Lady,

354
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,400
rewards from His Lordship.

355
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,050
His Lordship is very satisfied.

356
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,090
Congratulations, My Lady.

357
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,090
Bring my gratitude to His Lordship.

358
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,970
I will

359
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,680
have your present sent later.

360
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,710
Put them down.

361
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,970
I'll take my leave, My Lady.

362
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,640
See you, Mr. Zhu.

363
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,570
My Lady, so many things.

364
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
What?

365
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,880
Go ask Her Grace
what happened last night.

366
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,640
How can I ask?

367
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,990
Go if you want.

368
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,530
I just don't dare.

369
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,630
Forget it. When she wants to talk,

370
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,160
- we will know.
- I'm fine.

371
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,920
Don't be curious.

372
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,390
Your Grace.

373
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,600
Glad you're fine.

374
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,820
Yepei.

375
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,950
Lianhuan.

376
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,540
In the Lord's Mansion,

377
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,770
we have to behave very carefully.

378
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,440
His Lordship knew we ran into Ruo Wen.

379
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,920
I guess

380
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,770
he had a thorough investigation

381
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,730
on our whole trip.

382
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,830
Because of Ruo Wen,

383
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,920
His Lordship...

384
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,150
This morning, His Lordship
greatly rewarded Lady Youjia.

385
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,920
Everybody here is gossiping.

386
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,110
Last night, two ladies were summoned.

387
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,770
Only Lady Youjia was favored.

388
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,730
It has nothing to do with that.

389
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,680
Get back to your work.

390
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,920
His Lordship is here.

391
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,220
Greetings, My Lord.

392
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,120
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

393
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,530
You may rise.

394
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,910
I'm here

395
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,160
to give you a present.

396
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,880
See if you like it.

397
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
(Dune Volume)

398
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,250
Thank you, My Lord.

399
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,200
I love it.

400
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,970
Leave us.

401
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
Sit down.

402
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,120
Don't be nervous.

403
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,190
Read it aloud.

404
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,440
Do everything hard.

405
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,120
Minutes count.

406
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,810
Nation belongs to a lord.

407
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,490
But not an emperor.

408
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,970
Do you know what it means?

409
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,050
One word.

410
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,470
Domination.

411
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,330
Be specific.

412
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,570
D-0-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N.

413
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,160
All together,

414
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,490
it is "domination".

415
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,530
The last two lines are the explanation.

416
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,810
The meaning is...

417
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,160
In the vast desert,

418
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,360
someone can reign over one region.

419
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,200
But no one has unified it.

420
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,160
So, he can be a lord.

421
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,970
But not an emperor.

422
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,770
Do you also think

423
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm not an emperor?

424
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,880
I don't dare to judge.

425
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,400
But you showed me this riddle.

426
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,570
I guess you agree with it.

427
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,250
Don't bother what I think.

428
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,250
Just tell me what you think.

429
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,730
In the vast desert,

430
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,050
oases are scattered.

431
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,750
Some of them even move from time to time.

432
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,330
Loose sand and united people...

433
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,840
It is really hard

434
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,970
to unify the desert.

435
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,730
Good point.

436
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,490
Na Qida,

437
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,780
the late lord of Yunpei

438
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,390
didn't come to this conclusion

439
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,640
until he traveled around.

440
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,840
But you explained it precisely.

441
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,970
You're a hero.

442
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,880
You have infinite wisdom

443
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,840
and unmatched power.

444
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,270
Enough.

445
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,570
Take your time to read.

446
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,050
Another day, I'll come and talk.

447
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,290
See you, My Lord.

448
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,050
You have big ambitions, too.

449
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,050
(Father,)

450
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,230
(Mother,)

451
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,490
(I find someone who can help.)

452
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,640
(I will avenge you.)

453
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,900
Chief.

454
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,640
Some bad news. Some good news.

455
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,200
Which do you want first?

456
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,200
I'll start with good news.

457
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,200
Na Zhan summoned Miss Beishuang last night.

458
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,950
I know.

459
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,900
What kind of good news is that?

460
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,970
How do you know?

461
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,400
I guessed.

462
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,860
Did she go?

463
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes. She had to go.

464
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,250
However,

465
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,730
she returned in the middle of the night.

466
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,120
Last night, only Lady Youjia slept there.

467
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,100
Really?

468
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,400
Is that true?

469
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,570
Good news, isn't it?

470
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
What's so funny?

471
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,880
You hid that information.

472
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,050
Messing with me, huh?

473
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,380
What's the bad news?

474
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,120
The bad news is...

475
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,500
We sneaked in many times

476
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,600
to look for Mr. Rong.

477
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,840
But so far, we haven't found him.

478
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
Chief,

479
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,570
do you think Na Zhan has...?

480
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,540
No.

481
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,490
Before getting what he wants,

482
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,920
Na Zhan will not kill him.

483
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,290
Keep searching these days.

484
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,300
Xinwei,

485
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,290
women are weak.

486
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,200
Now, the desert is in wartime.

487
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,290
Don't worry, Mother.

488
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,440
I will protect you.

489
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,440
You've grown up.

490
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,090
We can't predict the future.

491
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,290
But you have to remember

492
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,810
what I'm going to say.

493
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,150
The Desert Scroll

494
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,160
is from an old friend of your father's.

495
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,220
That year, this book

496
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,250
helped Masui out of the pandemic.

497
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,570
This is one of the total volumes.

498
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,330
The other four volumes

499
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,500
not only record spectacles of the desert

500
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,490
but also the secret oases.

501
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,570
The greatest book of all time.

502
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,840
I've heard about it.

503
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,920
Mother, are you saying

504
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,880
it can change the world?

505
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,640
Xinwei,

506
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,730
if we collect all the volumes,

507
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,190
Enaqi will stop living a life

508
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,570
where it may vanish at any time.

509
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,190
We also don't need

510
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,730
to rely on any city.

511
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,120
That old friend

512
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,840
also gave us the Architecture Volume.

513
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,160
But your father has been keeping it.

514
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,920
I don't know where it is.

515
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,400
That man also said,

516
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,060
the Desert Scroll

517
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,330
keeps a great secret.

518
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,250
It won't be revealed
until the five volumes are collected.

519
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,020
The Herb Volume we have

520
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,540
(Herb Volume)
is the first volume.

521
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,160
It's the most important one.

522
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,400
The most valuable information is...

523
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,090
Where the twin fruit tree grows.

524
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,360
The keyword of the next volume

525
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,950
also lies

526
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,970
in the introduction of this tree.

527
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,600
We won't read it together

528
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,120
until we find the next volume.

529
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,970
The Dune Volume

530
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,730
isn't the second volume.

531
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,860
Yepei.

532
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,810
When did you get me

533
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,200
this blanket?

534
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,400
Your Grace, His Lordship just came.

535
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,970
When he saw you sleeping, he left.

536
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,440
Maybe he put it on you.

537
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,020
(Shuang)

538
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,180
(Yun, Shuang)

539
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,900
Zhu Jun,

540
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,290
have you seen anyone
with an eidetic memory?

541
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,530
I haven't.

542
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,250
Huang Beishuang has that.

543
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,770
She reads the book
and remembers everything.

544
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,290
She's wise and insightful.

545
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,680
There are totally five volumes.

546
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,290
They complement each other.

547
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,250
To read all the volumes

548
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,330
and digest everything

549
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,200
are what I really want.

550
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,630
I'd like to see

551
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,290
if she can do this.

552
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,490
If she succeeds,

553
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,490
she will work for me.

554
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,490
When I unify the desert,

555
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,090
she'll be my most important helper.

556
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,010
My Lord,

557
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,850
congratulations.

558
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,320
It's too early to celebrate, though.

559
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,970
Everything

560
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,410
needs good fortune.

561
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,790
Right?

562
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,890
It's thoughtful of you, My Lord.

563
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,280
It is always hard

564
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,680
to control a wise guy.

565
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,640
Soon,

566
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,410
it will be the annual Lantern Festival.

567
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,950
My Lord, everything
goes smoothly this year.

568
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,280
Even the moon is rounder.

569
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,350
God must have blessed

570
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,830
the prosperity of our city

571
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,180
