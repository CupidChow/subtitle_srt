Someone's indeed on the hook.

Let me think about it.

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,020
Rat,

27
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,580
there's no way you're getting away.

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,460
Just surrender!

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,180
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

30
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,550
Encircle the Library.

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,550
Let no one get out.

32
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
Yes.

33
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,460
- Shoot!
- Yes.

34
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,830
After him.

35
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,900
You guys, go this way.

36
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,780
Let's go this way.

37
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,220
And you, go check over there.

38
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,060
Hurry.

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,940
Your Grace.

40
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,180
Your Grace.

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,100
Qingyun.

42
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,010
Your Grace.

43
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,140
What happened?

44
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,460
Hurry. Save him.

45
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,460
Come on.

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,820
Slow down.

47
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,500
Be careful.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,740
Where is he?

49
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
My Lord,

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,140
I failed to find him.

51
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,860
Here, we lost all trace of blood.

52
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,940
Yunfang Pavilion.

53
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,980
Mr. Huo, bear the pain.

54
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,820
A poisoned arrow.

55
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,140
Leave the rest to me.

56
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,020
You watch at the door.

57
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,420
(Yunfang Pavilion)

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
Your Gr...

59
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,380
My Lord.

60
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,180
What happened?

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,260
Someone broke in.

62
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,580
Are you all right?

63
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,060
I appreciate your concern.

64
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,460
I've been in the room

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,060
and didn't hear anything.

66
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,500
That kind of rebel has evil intentions.

67
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,060
Beishuang,

68
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,300
you should stay alert.

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,540
If I meet this guy,

70
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,740
I'll let you know, My Lord.

71
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,140
Hope you won't meet him.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,500
Thanks for your concern.

73
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,260
I guess it's a mouse.

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,980
Only mice creating
a disturbance in the night.

75
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Beishuang,

76
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,540
where is this blood coming from?

77
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,100
My Lord,

78
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,420
you scared me.

79
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,460
Confess!

80
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,220
It hurts.

81
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,580
How is your hand injured?

82
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,540
When I opened the wardrobe door,

83
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,660
I cut myself on the copper handle.

84
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,340
I had no time to wrap it yet.

85
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,140
Why didn't you say so?

86
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,460
I didn't want you to worry.

87
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,100
Anyway,

88
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm fine.

89
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
Get some rest early.

90
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,340
So do you, My Lord.

91
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,380
(Yunfang Pavilion)

92
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Let's go.

93
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,020
Your Grace.

94
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,460
Are you all right?

95
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,260
Go close the gate from the inside.

96
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,220
Yes.

97
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,860
I have to squeeze the blood.

98
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
Yell if it hurts.

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
Such a little injure

100
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,580
is nothing.

101
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,260
Does it hurt?

102
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
It doesn't matter.

103
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,130
After I wrap you up,

104
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,220
I'll take care of it.

105
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,180
Remember.

106
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,460
Whatever it happens

107
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
or whoever you defend,

108
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,820
don't risk your life anymore.

109
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,030
Risking it for me is less unworthy.

110
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,060
Your life was in danger.

111
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
I didn't have a choice.

112
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,580
You know, I'm not a nice guy.

113
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,660
I can tell

114
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,300
if you are a nice guy.

115
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,620
And I know fairly well

116
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,780
if I should save you.

117
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
I failed my job.

118
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,940
Punish me, My Lord.

119
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,700
We've set this trap for so long.

120
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,900
But he escaped.

121
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,380
The prey fell into the trap,

122
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,740
but you failed to get him!

123
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,180
My Lord,

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,580
I've searched the whole mansion.

125
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,740
How can a man like him

126
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,340
disappear without a trace?

127
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,740
There's a trace in Yunfang Pavilion.

128
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,900
My Lord, do you mean

129
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,340
Lady Beishuang?

130
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,540
So, you were aware of it, My Lord.

131
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Orders, My Lord.

132
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,060
I'll go get him by law.

133
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,100
You're always so impatient.

134
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,460
Get up.

135
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,140
Tonight, put Rong Huo into the dungeon.

136
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,100
I'd like to see

137
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,620
what these guys can do.

138
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Yes, My Lord.

139
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,940
One more thing.

140
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,020
When I rechecked the Library,

141
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,700
I found someone secretly
helped him to escape.

142
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,060
Interesting.

143
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,900
They're like loaches.

144
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,700
He wasn't killed
by the first poisoned arrow.

145
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,900
This time,

146
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,980
he still has no symptoms.

147
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Can he be

148
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,260
invincible to poison?

149
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,580
You're awake?

150
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,940
Come on.

151
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,420
Take some decoction.

152
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,820
Be careful.

153
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,820
Thank you for saving my life.

154
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,540
But I should leave.

155
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,140
Not until you get better.

156
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
If you die somewhere,

157
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,340
I'll feel guilty.

158
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,980
Na Zhan is suspicious of you.

159
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,140
If I keep staying here,

160
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,100
you'll be in danger.

161
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,660
I've got a plan.

162
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,380
You just stay and get well.

163
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,900
After that,

164
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,140
I won't keep you anymore.

165
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,140
And...

166
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,820
The soft armor I gave you...

167
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,980
Why didn't you wear it?

168
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,060
I forgot.

169
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,260
You have to wear it all the time.

170
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,140
Otherwise,

171
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,260
give it back to me.

172
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,460
All right.

173
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,460
It's been two days.

174
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,980
Why has nothing happened here?

175
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,340
Have these rebels

176
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,620
just disappeared?

177
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,260
Don't worry, My Lord.

178
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,740
I will find them.

179
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,660
Leave us.

180
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,260
Zhu Jun.

181
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,380
Go with me to see Lady Youjia.

182
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,660
Yes.

183
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,940
This is what you cooked?

184
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,660
Taste it yourself.

185
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
How salty!

186
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,300
Did you even put a salter in it?

187
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,980
Let me taste it.

188
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,980
Nice cooking.

189
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,220
The cooking competition is coming.

190
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,300
If His Lordship tastes this,

191
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,220
I'll lose my position.

192
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,380
Confess.

193
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,220
Are you a real chef?

194
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,460
I think you're a butcher.

195
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,140
The pot is bad. I'm not to blame.

196
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
How dare you talk back?

197
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,140
Tonight, I'll give you a new pot.

198
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,100
If you still can't cook well,

199
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,980
I'll have you clubbed to death!

200
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,140
You have strong killing intent.

201
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,780
- You...
- Killing what?

202
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,500
My Lord.

203
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,100
You heard it wrong.

204
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,100
Willing, actually.

205
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,100
Zhu Jun.

206
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,140
Get Lady Youjia some wormwood.

207
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,460
Yes, My Lord.

208
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,140
My Lord,

209
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,780
before you came,

210
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,860
why didn't you tell me?

211
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,780
I could have welcomed you.

212
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,980
A rebel broke in.

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,260
I came to check on you.

214
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,620
Our mansion is so heavily guarded.

215
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,300
How did he break in?

216
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,580
Did you get him, My Lord?

217
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,860
Who are you?

218
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,880
For your information,

219
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,020
I'm a chef from the Zhenqu Tribe.

220
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,700
Come over.

221
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,140
Show me your hand.

222
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,620
Quite a lot of calluses.

223
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,340
You must be skilled in swords.

224
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,180
Are you really a chef?

225
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,260
Don't be kidding, My Lord.

226
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,500
I hold kitchen knives and pot handles.

227
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,700
So I have the calluses.

228
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,380
I don't use swords or something.

229
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,540
Did you cook this?

230
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,380
Lady Youjia did.

231
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,420
Chopsticks.

232
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,180
My Lord,

233
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,820
let me fill your cup.

234
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,660
Lady Youjia...

235
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,220
Nice cooking.

236
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,660
My Lord, tonight,

237
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,940
will you stay at my place?

238
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,100
I've got you

239
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,900
a present.

240
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,500
Keep it for now.

241
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,140
After I'm done working,

242
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,260
I'll come over.

243
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,220
See you, My Lord.

244
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,900
Lady Youjia.

245
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,500
Lady Youjia.

246
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,860
His Lordship praised my cooking.

247
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,820
Without you,

248
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,300
I wouldn't know
His Lordship loved me this much.

249
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,620
What do you want?

250
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,780
I'll reward you.

251
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,620
Maybe later.

252
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,420
So, it's really you

253
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,740
who was often up there.

254
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,380
You're badly injured.

255
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,860
How can you drink like that?

256
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,140
The wine heals me.

257
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,620
You're just an alcoholic.

258
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,140
Don't deny it.

259
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,660
The Spirit is strong
and detoxifies everything.

260
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
One cup gets people drunk for three days.

261
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,580
But I've been drinking it.

262
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
It's like water to me.

263
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,020
So, I'm never poisoned.

264
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,700
To me,

265
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,980
it's simply water.

266
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,620
Drinking it

267
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,020
can also reduce the pain.

268
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,100
One wine, two effects.

269
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,860
Such amazing wine.

270
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,820
Let me taste some.

271
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,300
Tastes bad?

272
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,140
I thought so when I was little.

273
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,980
But to survive,

274
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,940
I had to drink.

275
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,180
Gradually, I got used to it.

276
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,300
To survive?

277
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,940
In my childhood,
many people tried to kill me.

278
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
Shot me or poisoned me.

279
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,660
The slightest lapse

280
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,140
might get me killed.

281
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,780
From this day on,

282
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,860
you're Huo Qingyun,

283
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,940
my illegitimate son
who wandered away from home.

284
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,420
Understand?

285
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Why can't I use my real name?

286
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
Because you have to live.

287
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,860
Of course.

288
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,380
As my son,

289
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,900
life will also be hard.

290
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,020
But at least,

291
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
bad guys in Yunpei won't target you.

292
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
Do you get it?

293
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Yes, Uncle.

294
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,660
Yes, Father.

295
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,620
(Chamber of Politics)

296
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,180
I witnessed a boy of my age

297
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,940
was poisoned

298
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,500
and he spit blood.

299
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,220
In the end, he lost his legs.

300
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,300
Since then,

301
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,620
I've been drinking the Spirit.

302
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,660
Why did they not even let go of a kid?

303
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,660
Because that's a cold place

304
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,300
where people kill.

305
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,300
Your home?

306
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't have a home.

307
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,060
What about your parents?

308
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,020
They died.

309
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm sorry.

310
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,180
Why?

311
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,220
It's not your fault.

312
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,460
It's sad for both of us.

313
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,820
My parents died, too.

314
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,940
I'm sorry.

315
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,340
Like you just said,

316
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,500
don't say sorry.

317
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
It's not your fault.

318
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,380
(If one day,)

319
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,110
(you know your mother
died because of me,)

320
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,740
(will you still say this?)

321
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,140
Why don't you ask

322
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,980
how I was injured?

323
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,460
If you want to tell me

324
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,660
or when you can tell me,

325
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
you will do it.

326
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,540
I'm here in Yunpei

327
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,460
for an old man.

328
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,980
The one at the lantern show?

329
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
Yes.

330
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,820
He is Rong Huo.

331
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,900
I have to get him out.

332
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,060
But now,

333
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,540
I can't tell you the reason.

334
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,460
He's the man

335
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,420
in the secret chamber of the Library?

336
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,900
Clever girl.

337
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,340
That day, I tried to get him out.

338
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,100
But I was ambushed by Na Zhan.

339
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,380
Without Ruo Wen,

340
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,980
I wouldn't have escaped easily.

341
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,260
Ruo Wen helped you?

342
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,260
But I don't know what he's up to.

343
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,220
I escaped and survived.

344
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,980
But my plan failed at last.

345
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,940
Na Zhan is deceitful and overcautious.

346
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,980
After such a big scene,

347
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,660
I don't think

348
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,460
you'll have a second chance.

349
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,660
Is there anything

350
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,420
I can do for you?

351
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,220
No.

352
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,100
It's my own business.

353
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,140
If you want to distance yourself from me,

354
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,140
you don't have to tell me this.

355
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,140
I take you as my confidant.

356
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,260
But we have our own missions.

357
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,540
It is time

358
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,420
to go our own ways.

359
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,820
Fine.

360
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,500
Then,

361
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,700
let's

362
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,700
go

363
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,300
our own ways.

364
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,100
You drank too much.

365
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,700
It's my fault.

366
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,860
It's not.

367
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,900
When I was little,

368
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,740
I drank some rice wine
from the Yue's in Masui

369
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,140
behind my mother's back.

370
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,180
But I wasn't drunk.

371
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,060
This little wine is nothing.

372
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,220
Come on. Keep drinking.

373
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,740
Drank wine when you were little?

374
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,260
Oh,

375
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,580
the Yue's also sells rice cake.

376
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,060
Tastes great.

377
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,780
Since I came to Yunpei,

378
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,580
I've never had any.

379
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,980
You're drunk.

380
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,100
- Get to sleep.
- I'm not drunk.

381
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,740
So cold.

382
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,860
Let me warm you.

383
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,940
You're cold.

384
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,780
Why are you here again?

385
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,220
I'm here all the time.

386
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,660
I just decided to forget you.

387
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,340
Why are you here again?

388
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,340
Why are you?

389
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,420
So, you want me to leave?

390
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,420
No.

391
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,740
Why?

392
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,820
When you're around, I feel safe.

393
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,580
When you're away,

394
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,460
I always have a feeling of loss

395
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,060
as if I were an empty pot.

396
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,460
The wind blows away.

397
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,060
The water flows away.

398
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,300
Nothing can stay.

399
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,380
Let me do it.

400
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,220
Come back here.

401
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
Let's get out.

402
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,260
Stop looking. Come on.

403
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,460
Those who loved me

404
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,180
and protected me

405
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,820
are all gone.

406
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,780
Have you seen
the tumbleweed in the desert?

407
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,180
I'm just like it.

408
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,460
I travel with the wind

409
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,980
and have nowhere to stay.

410
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,340
I thought

411
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
I wouldn't rely on anyone.

412
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,780
But destiny sent you.

413
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
You make me feel safe.

414
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,340
I get back the feeling
of relying on someone

415
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,700
and the happiness of being protected.

416
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,460
But you will leave me

417
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,380
just like they did.

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,140
(Maybe you will)

429
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,460
(hate me then)

430
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,180
(and won't forgive me.)

431
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,060
(But before that day comes,)

432
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,500
(let me selfishly stay by your side)

433
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,660
(and make it up for you.)

434
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,260
So,

435
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,900
most of you were abducted?

436
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,340
Yes.

437
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,420
I know I'm wrong.

438
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,860
I shouldn't have done such an evil thing.

439
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Glad you know that.

440
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,380
Do you know how many girls you've ruined?

441
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,620
I won't do it anymore.

442
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,900
I just won't.

443
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,540
Then confess.

444
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,100
How many girls did you abduct?

445
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,860
About... About 30.

446
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,420
Including those who died of sickness,

447
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
it's about 130.

448
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,100
Fox,

449
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,340
watch her to write down

450
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,500
the letter of confession.

451
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,620
Then send them to prison.

452
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,980
No, no. Don't be angry, Miss.

453
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,300
Please don't. I...

454
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,460
In my opinion,

455
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,980
we don't need to take the trouble.

456
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,180
I can just kill her!

457
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,060
Mercy, man.

458
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,900
Mercy, please.

459
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,820
Wait, wait.

460
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,540
- Show some mercy.
- This is Yunpei.

461
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,980
We have to obey local rules.

462
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,740
You'll live, then.

463
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,900
Have this old woman

464
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,220
sign the deed.

465
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,820
Zuixiang Brothel

466
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,500
will be mine.

467
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,460
Great.

468
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,980
This is great.

469
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,420
Why do we need this place?

470
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,860
I'm going to show your chief.

471
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,420
Whatever I want to do,

472
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,860
I can always do it.

473
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,060
You want to please Chief.

474
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,970
But the two of us are errand boys.

475
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,460
Oh, my brothel.

476
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,940
This place will be a restaurant.

477
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,860
Girls, you'll work for me.

478
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
We'll enjoy a great life together.

479
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,100
From this day on,

480
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,740
this is where Desert Rankers

481
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,260
will stay in Yunpei.

482
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,380
Oh, no. I've lost everything.

483
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,440
Sounds good.

484
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,210
Yeah.

485
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,180
Where is Ruo Wen?

486
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,180
(I'll go with you.)

487
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,660
(You're just in time.)

488
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,940
(When are we setting off?)

489
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,100
(What exactly are you up to?)

490
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,860
(What? Don't dare to take me away?)

491
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,140
She wanted Huo Qingyun to hear that?

492
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,420
Does she or does she not want to leave?

493
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,180
She has to go with me, anyway.

494
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,260
Open the door.

495
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,900
It's morning. Why are you not up yet?

496
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,540
Lady Youjia wants some sweet soup.

497
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,780
Let her starve to death.

498
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,100
How... How daring!

499
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,660
How dare you curse Lady Youjia?

500
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,820
I'll count to three.

501
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,180
Open the door immediately.

502
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,300
Or I'll make you suffer!

503
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Are you deaf?

504
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,860
Did you hear me?

505
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,100
You have a quick temper.

506
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,340
I have a nerve, too.

507
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,700
Take me to Your Ladyship.

508
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,020
- Lady Youjia.
- My Lady.

509
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,220
Xiaolian?

510
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,100
My Lady.

511
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,220
Save me.

512
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,020
How dare you?

513
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,500
Are you insane?

514
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,420
What do you want?

515
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,420
- Somebody!
- Don't yell.

516
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,700
Or you'll scare my dagger.

517
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
It has no eyes.

518
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,860
Do I look like a chef?

519
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,220
So, you're not the chef from my tribe?

520
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,220
You have a poor eye.

521
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,740
I'm Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers.

522
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,820
You're Ruo Wen?

523
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,140
Do I not look real?

524
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,140
You do.

525
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,980
So, you're the man
who robbed Huang Beishuang?

526
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,060
Still asking?

527
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,220
Why are you here?

528
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,820
- My Lady.
- What do you want?

529
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
First,

530
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,020
cooperate with me.

531
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,540
Do whatever you're told.

532
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,140
Second...

533
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,260
Well, the second...

534
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,860
How about this?

535
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,860
You dance for me now.

536
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,740
Serve me

537
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,920
the way you serve Na Zhan.

538
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,340
Serve you?

539
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,780
Any questions?

540
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,820
I don't serve people.

541
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,700
Fine.

542
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,220
You can refuse.

543
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,700
I don't think Na Zhan loves you too much.

544
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,060
If I cut

545
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,380
your pretty face,

546
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,140
will Na Zhan still come to see you?

547
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,340
It doesn't matter, though.

548
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,020
You're gorgeous.

549
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
You'll be pretty with a disfigured face.

550
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,620
You can be my wife

551
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,700
if you like.

552
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,500
I... I'll serve you.

553
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,060
Like I said,

554
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,740
dance for me.

555
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,980
Why do I suddenly
want some sweep soup?

556
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
Mr. Ruo Wen,

557
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,660
shall I go make some sweet soup?

558
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,540
Let's go.

559
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,220
About my identity,

560
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
if the fourth guy knows,

561
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,660
you'll suffer more than a disfigured face.
