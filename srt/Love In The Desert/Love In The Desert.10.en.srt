Your Grace.

26
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,110
I can't buy threads anywhere.

27
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,220
How's that possible?

28
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,060
Did you search everywhere?

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,110
I did.

30
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,030
Yepei.

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,990
Don't forget our rival.

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,550
That's way too wicked.

33
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,260
Your Grace,

34
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,180
what do we do, then?

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,460
I get it.

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,740
I'll steal some tonight.

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,700
Such an idiot.

38
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,670
Why would she

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,990
let you steal her threads?

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,390
Then what do I do?

41
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,950
I don't know, either.

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,070
Are you all right?

43
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,990
(Horse-unhitched Tree)
Sabotage it now?

44
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,980
I...

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,230
The root of the Horse-unhitched Tree

46
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,390
is rough and pliable.

47
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,070
It's tailorable.

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
Lianhuan.

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,740
Dig out some of the roots.

50
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,670
Lianhuan.

51
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,070
You strip the bark off the root.

52
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,230
Yepei.

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,390
You and I

54
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,390
reel off the silk and rub it
into fine threads.

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,910
But...

56
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,020
To peel and reel is hard enough.

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,300
To make it into thin threads

58
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,950
for the eye of the needle

59
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,070
would be way too difficult.

60
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,340
Your Grace.

61
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,900
Your Grace.

62
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Does it hurt?

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,580
It's all right.

64
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,060
Your Grace, how about you get some rest?

65
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm really fine.

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,510
Let's go on.

What about you?

104
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,020
You could have climbed up walls.

105
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,710
But you walked and stopped
like an old man.

106
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,620
To lure me here?

107
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,140
If you didn't want to get me, you wouldn't.

108
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,380
A thief sneaked in.

109
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,860
Why would I not get him?

110
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,000
You caught the thief.

111
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Punish him now.

112
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,110
Before that,

113
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,860
I want to know

114
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,700
why he sneaked in.

115
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,500
For one thing

116
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,700
and one man.

117
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,110
What thing?

118
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,700
What man?

119
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,150
Some old stuff.

120
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,500
Some old friend.

121
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,030
Liar.

122
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,470
You want to see me,

123
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,830
but you just deny it.

124
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Aren't you a liar, too?

125
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,030
I'm not.

126
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,580
Fine.

127
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,230
The other day,

128
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,710
I read about something.

129
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Why don't you interpret it?

130
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,980
Go ahead.

131
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,990
The wind blows away the clouds.

132
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,260
The frost in the sky is desolate.

133
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,310
You...

134
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,990
When did you see that?

135
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,380
I wrote it casually.

136
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,670
Don't take it seriously.

137
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,780
It's been a long time.

138
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,860
You've learned to lie.

139
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,500
I learned that from you.

140
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,140
What are you really doing here?

141
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,290
I told you.

142
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,490
For some old stuff.

143
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,860
Why were you disguised as a performer?

144
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,950
To see you.

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,830
Nonsense.

146
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,350
Don't get me involved.

147
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,900
You have a death wish,

148
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,310
but I want to live.

149
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,490
So, you actually want to see me

150
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,350
but just don't dare to.

151
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,950
Don't be silly,

152
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,060
or I'll call for help.

153
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,190
Your Grace.

154
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
Is that you talking?

155
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,140
Leave. Get out of here.

156
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,180
Stop risking your life.

157
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,700
When I'm out,

158
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,260
I may not come back again.

159
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,380
I don't care.

160
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,430
Yepei,

161
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,110
I'm in bed.

162
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,740
(Yufu Pavilion)

163
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,830
How does it look?

164
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,470
Amazing, My Lady.

165
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,070
His Lordship will love this.

166
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,230
This time,

167
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,830
I'll see how she can overwhelm me.

168
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,710
You love this patio, huh?

169
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,470
It's cool here.

170
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,230
You walked in like that.

171
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,740
What if guards find you?

172
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,380
It's where the late lord died.

173
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,380
Now, it's late.

174
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,520
Nobody will come.

175
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,270
And you're waiting for me.

176
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,660
Who told you that?

177
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,740
Why did you send away Lianhuan and Yepei?

178
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,990
It's too late.

179
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,990
They're asleep.

180
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,190
So, I came at a bad time.

181
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
Wait.

182
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,020
Since you're here,

183
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
do some work before you leave.

184
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,310
The color...

185
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,590
Before soaked in water,

186
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,230
such threads can't be dyed.

187
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,660
Did you try so hard to come here

188
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,140
just to do such rough work?

189
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,230
Don't try to provoke me.

190
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,470
You know what I want.

191
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,660
Even you don't know what you want.

192
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,830
How would I know?

193
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,920
What do you look at me?

194
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,310
I certainly know what I want.

195
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Then keep thinking.

196
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,610
Don't tell me.

197
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
You know that, too.

198
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,910
Get up.

199
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,860
Have I lost weight?

200
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,660
Don't ask questions.

201
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Don't make fun of me.

202
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,590
I missed you too much.

203
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,190
Don't be glib.

204
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,980
Let me see.

205
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,480
Don't laugh when you're injured.

206
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,470
You even bit your finger
to write something.

207
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,070
Where's the note?

208
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,070
Terrible handwriting.

209
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,030
I dumped it.

210
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,070
Press it.

211
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,780
The rest of it...

212
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,950
You do it for me.

213
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,550
- I...
- I know you want something in return.

214
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,310
I've made up my mind.

215
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,540
After it's done,

216
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,830
I'll give you a present.

217
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,590
Don't laugh when you're injured.

218
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,740
Oh, My Lord.

219
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,950
Lady Youjia

220
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,310
really has amazing embroidery skills.

221
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,540
I checked it carefully.

222
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,950
My Lord, the hunter in the embroidery

223
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,780
seems to be you.

224
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,350
She did go all out on this embroidery.

225
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
Zhu Jun,

226
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,780
I love this embroidery of hunting.

227
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,190
Get a craftsman to frame it.

228
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,950
I'll hang it up.

229
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,100
Yes.

230
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,500
Why hasn't Lady Beishuang's embroidery

231
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,710
been delivered yet?

232
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,620
It was delivered.

233
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,100
But...

234
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,860
Bring it up.

235
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,470
The wristbands...

236
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,710
They look rather rough.

237
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,830
My Lord, Lady Beishuang is out there.

238
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,990
She has something to tell you.

239
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,500
Get her in.

240
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,230
Get in here, Lady Beishuang.

241
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,710
Greetings, My Lord.

242
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,550
Lady Beishuang,

243
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,830
what do you mean?

244
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,670
Youjia's embroidery

245
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,630
is highly collectible

246
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,470
in either technique or aesthetics.

247
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,630
But my embroidery

248
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,470
has some other purpose.

249
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,340
It does?

250
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,860
Lianhuan.

251
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,500
General Wu, I've heard

252
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,740
you have great martial arts

253
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,390
and your sword is sharp.

254
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,300
Why don't you try and see

255
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
if you can pierce my embroidery?

256
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,940
Get it to me.

257
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,580
What is it made of?

258
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,710
My Lord,

259
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
I made this

260
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,470
with the root bark
of the Horse-unhitched Tree.

261
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,340
It can be used to repair the roof.

262
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,540
It's waterproof and fireproof.

263
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,740
Some hunters also make it

264
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,470
into protective gear and armor

265
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,670
to prevent the biting
or attacking from beasts.

266
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,190
I read the Herb Volume and got to know

267
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
the threads made of such root bark

268
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,780
can resist blades.

269
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,230
So, I made the wristbands.

270
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,950
My Lord, who do you think wins?

271
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,580
I really

272
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,710
love these wristbands.

273
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,500
But letting you win

274
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,630
over the wristbands

275
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,060
would be unfair to Lady Youjia.

276
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,670
After all, it's a needlework competition.

277
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,260
Whatever falls out,

278
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,950
it is my honor to help you, My Lord.

279
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,540
My Lord,

280
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,540
about the winner...

281
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,300
There's hardly a winner.

282
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,230
How about...?

283
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,230
Umm...

284
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,430
In ten days,

285
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,580
the two ladies

286
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,230
can cook for His Lordship

287
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,670
and see who's the winner.

288
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,020
What do you think, My Lord?

289
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,990
You had a terrible idea.

290
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,300
If Huang Beishuang had used the threads,

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,780
she couldn't have defeated us.

292
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,260
But now,

293
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,870
she took advantage by accident.

294
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,030
My Lady, I...

295
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,470
I didn't know why she could use

296
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,740
such a dirty trick.

297
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,860
Forget it.

298
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,990
Huang Beishuang is rather scheming.

299
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,820
She used some root bark

300
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,630
to make a pair of wristbands

301
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,150
and made His Lordship happy.

302
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,710
In the next competition,

303
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,020
we must not take her lightly.

304
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,630
Don't worry, My Lady.
Next time, we will win.

305
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,510
My Lady.

306
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,870
Take this.

307
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Pendants for sale.

308
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,870
Take a look.

309
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,960
Let's go over there.

310
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,300
As the supervisor of the arsenal,

311
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,070
Qin Duo doesn't come out.

312
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,030
Chief,

313
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,470
is the intel reliable?

314
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,060
It's been a while.

315
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,870
There's no sign of him.

316
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,790
Be patient.

317
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,420
Chief.

318
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,660
Chief,

319
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,870
Boa Agents sent the intel.

320
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,380
Princess Xinwei is found.

321
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,630
- She is?
- Where is she?

322
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,190
She was sold to a brothel

323
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,710
named Zuixiang Brothel.

324
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,340
Come have a look.

325
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,540
The two of you go with me.

326
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,460
Do two things in one place.

327
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,790
Let's go check it out.

328
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,750
Chief,

329
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,020
what is a brothel?

330
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,390
Ask him.

331
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,300
You should at least have heard about it.

332
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,910
I'd like to see it.

333
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,750
Let's go.

334
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,270
- Watch her.
- Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

335
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,280
- How's that mad girl?
- Madam.

336
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,390
Thank God you're here.

337
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,470
It's been five days.

338
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,910
She hasn't eaten much.

339
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,950
But she's still fierce.

340
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,540
We don't dare to get in there.

341
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,100
Come on.

342
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,340
You're still inexperienced.

343
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,870
You should move circuitously.

344
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,340
That's right.

345
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,990
So, we're waiting for you.

346
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,830
Count on me.

347
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,580
Be careful.

348
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,950
- Just a mere girl.
- Come on.

349
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,500
I will make you obey.

350
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,900
Come out!

351
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,440
Get lost!

352
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,700
- Get out of here.
- Make way.

353
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,580
Hey, I don't buy this.

354
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,100
- When my man is here...
- How daring?

355
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,780
He'll take down this place!

356
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,380
Get out!

357
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:39,830
Get out of here!

358
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,630
Oh, Madam.

359
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,950
Are you all right? Get up.

360
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,060
Bah. You terrible girl.

361
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,500
How dare you resist?

362
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,740
If you didn't look pretty,

363
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,820
I would have sold you as a maid!

364
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,670
How ungrateful you are!

365
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,510
Get lost!

366
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,300
Madam, what do we do?

367
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,460
Keep her here for some days.

368
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
Let's go.

369
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,780
- Close the door.
- Yes.

370
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,620
Fierce, indeed.

371
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,150
Screw you.

372
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,060
Gentlemen,

373
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,540
the sun is still out.

374
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,950
How about you wait for a while?

375
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,150
I can't wait.

376
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,670
Good things always take a while.

377
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,100
The girls haven't finished

378
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,190
their makeup.

379
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,760
- Freeze.
- What do you want?

380
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,610
Please don't.

381
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,780
Get me the pretties girls here.

382
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,340
Sir, let go of me.

383
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,150
I'll get them to you, all right?

384
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,300
How about the girl upstairs?

385
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,350
Let her entertain them.

386
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,150
Sir,

387
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,820
it's still early.

388
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,780
The girls

389
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,100
aren't ready yet.

390
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,710
But the other day,

391
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,910
we had a new gorgeous girl.

392
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,910
She's just a little bit shrewish.

393
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,100
If you like her,

394
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,910
I can even give her to you for free.

395
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,230
Where's she? Bring her to me.

396
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,230
Go get her. Hurry.

397
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,140
All right.

398
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,260
She'll be brought to you.

399
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,990
Move. Behave yourself.

400
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,830
Let go of me.

401
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,200
- Get her down.
- Let go!

402
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,040
Behave yourself.

403
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,950
You've starved for days

404
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,810
- but still struggle.
- Stop.

405
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,820
- Come over.
- Let go of me.

406
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,140
Move.

407
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,430
Sir, there she is.

408
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,030
Ruo Wen?

409
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,070
Where have you been?

410
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,710
They know each other?

411
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,020
Do I know you?

412
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,630
You get the wrong guy.

413
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,910
Not at all!

414
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,870
Where have you been?

415
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,390
What took you so long to save me?

416
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,820
Oh, they know each other.

417
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,740
I took my men here for some fun.

418
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,060
If I knew you were here,

419
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,830
I wouldn't have come.

420
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,740
Do you know what I've been suffering?

421
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,430
They bullied me, starved me,

422
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,270
and even forced me.

423
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,870
No, no.

424
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,190
- We didn't.
- That's not true.

425
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,060
You're fierce, aren't you?

426
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,100
How could they bully you?

427
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,580
That's right.

428
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,620
How did they bully you?

429
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,580
Show me.

430
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,820
Get out of the way!

431
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,780
- Behave.
- Oh, sir.

432
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,950
Please don't.

433
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,820
You want to know how they bullied me, huh?

434
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,430
That's what they did to me.

435
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,540
Like this.

436
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,950
- They kicked me and hit me.
- Mercy, Miss.

437
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,790
Stop hitting me.

438
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,830
Please stop.

439
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,190
Stop.

440
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,330
♪Unexpectedly, my life is worth my while♪

441
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,390
Feel good now?

442
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,060
Then think of how

443
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,910
you'll repay me.

444
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,150
What do you want me to do?

445
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,830
Ruo Wen.

446
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
Ruo Wen.

447
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,540
Tonight, we'll use your place.

448
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,780
You'd better cooperate.

449
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,580
All right. No problem, sir.

450
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
Chief,

451
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
we've got news.

452
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,860
Sit down.

453
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,990
With Ge Xinwei's portrait,

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,520
our men asked some people in Enaqi.

455
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,580
They all said

456
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,150
she is the princess of Enaqi.

457
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,870
She's been naughty and wild.

458
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,740
I also sent someone
to Masui to confirm it.

459
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,460
It's indeed the Lady of Masui

460
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,230
who died outside our city gate.

461
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,390
So, the two of them fooled everyone

462
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,220
and switched identities.

463
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,740
I guess this is destiny.

464
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,780
Your Lordship, a woman outside the city

465
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,060
claimed to be the Lady of Masui.

466
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,230
She wanted to see you

467
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,780
and seek asylum.

468
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,230
Soldiers of Masui have caught up

469
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,740
and are trapping them at the city gate.

470
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Orders, Your Lordship.

471
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,540
Will we help?

472
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,390
I once pushed my luck.

473
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,900
I wished

474
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,340
I heard that wrongly.

475
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,180
Unexpectedly,

476
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,260
I indeed got her mother killed.

477
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,100
Chief,

478
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,500
since ancient times,

479
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,990
the mother's murder

480
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,470
can never be forgiven.

481
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,140
Your engagement with Miss Beishuang

482
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
may not be fulfilled.

483
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,420
Your Grace,

484
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,870
have something to eat.

485
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,190
You didn't sleep last night.

486
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,260
You should get some rest.

487
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,910
Later, we'll prepare

488
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,150
for the cooking competition.

489
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,950
What if you're too exhausted?

490
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,070
Your Grace?

491
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,710
According to the Herb Volume,

492
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,980
the twin fruit tree originates
from the north desert.

493
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,060
At first,

494
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,710
it wasn't hallucinogenic.

495
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,260
Transplanted in the south desert,

496
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,620
it became hygrophilous and waterlogged.

497
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,230
Then its sap was hallucinogenic.

498
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,710
Plants are always dependent on climate.

499
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,510
Maybe

500
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,230
the Climate Volume is the second.

501
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,990
Your Grace.

502
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
Your Grace.

503
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,910
Enjoy your food, gentlemen.

504
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,670
I'll get some girls to you.

505
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,150
Come on. Come this way.

506
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,190
Come over. Sit here.

507
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,900
Enjoy the food and drink.

508
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,870
Come on. Fill my cup.

509
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,020
How do you like the dishes?

510
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,340
What are you waiting for?

511
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,060
Fill his cup.

512
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,820
- That way, please.
- All right.

513
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,910
Come on. Sit in there.

514
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,190
She's the new girl. Hope you don't mind.

515
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,870
(Zuixiang Brothel)
See you, Mr. Wang.

516
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,870
Bye. Welcome next time.

517
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,710
Or I'll miss you.

518
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,820
Welcome next time.

519
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,190
Come in, please.

520
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,910
Welcome, Mr. Qin.

521
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,990
- There you are, Mr. Qin.
- Come in.

522
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,340
Are you a new servant?

523
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,870
You're sharp-eyed.

524
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,230
Come on, gentleman.

525
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,260
Are there any new girls?

526
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,190
When you're here,

527
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,670
we offer all kinds of girls.

528
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,780
I'm bored of the same girls.

529
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,620
Mr. Qin,

530
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,780
we have a new girl.

531
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,230
Really gorgeous.

532
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,550
Shall I take you to her?

533
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,870
- Sure.
- This way, please.

534
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,020
- Go.
- Come, please.

535
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,100
This way.

536
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,230
How do you like the dishes?

537
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,070
This way, please.

538
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,750
Come on.

539
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,550
There you go.

540
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,510
Pretty girl.

541
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,510
Good.

542
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,300
She's gorgeous, indeed.

543
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,670
Mr. Supervisor,

544
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,340
how about I give her to you?

545
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,820
That'd be great.

546
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,230
Be patient.

547
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,070
Take your seat.

548
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,630
- Come on.
- Hurry.

549
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,230
Drink some wine

550
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,780
and get more excited.

551
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,820
How do you know I'm the supervisor?

552
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,150
In Yunpei,

553
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,470
everybody knows you.

554
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,100
Clever boy.

555
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,300
Tell me what you want.

556
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,950
Can you really offer

557
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,740
what I want?

558
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,390
We can make a fortune together.

559
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,780
I'll make you rich.

560
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,830
Nice.

561
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,580
Beautiful and vigorous.

562
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,910
I love it.

563
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,340
Be patient, Mr. Supervisor.

564
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,150
She's gorgeous.

565
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,710
But you have to be careful.

566
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,910
She's a femme fatale.

567
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,710
I'm not scared.

568
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,100
Shall I give you an offer?

569
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,020
Work for me

570
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,260
and you'll get an official post.

571
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,910
Get out of here now.

572
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,380
Get out.

573
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,190
Now!

574
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,140
Get out!

575
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,510
Chief,

576
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,910
will it work?

577
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,190
Will she lose out?

578
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,060
I saw her make others lose.

579
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,100
She loses out? Never.

580
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,150
Don't think I don't know

581
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,540
you and that servant set a honey trap.

582
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,580
What do you want from me?

583
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,340
I just don't want this to rub me.

584
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,710
Oh, really?

585
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,340
Now, it no longer rubs you.

586
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,670
Time to make me happy.

587
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,140
Where do you think you can run?

588
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,430
Don't be scared, pretty.

589
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,100
As long as you make me happy,

590
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,580
you can tell me whatever you want.

591
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,630
Pretty, here I am.

592
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,310
- You have a death wish!
- Outrageous!

593
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,740
How dare you?

594
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,900
Scared?

595
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,380
Not at all.

596
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,300
Don't try to be strong.

597
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,580
Move aside.

598
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
Chief.

599
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,020
(Beishuang,)

600
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,470
(in this world,)

601
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,990
(I'm the worst guy for you.)

602
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,060
(The engagement set by our fathers)

603
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,950
(chained me.)

604
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,870
(When I tried to break out,)

605
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,270
(I got your mother killed.)

606
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,540
(Destiny actually brought you to me.)

607
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,350
(But I lost you.)

608
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:46,430
(Who am I to approach you?)

609
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,310
(How do I have the face
to beg you for forgiveness?)

610
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,350
I knew you would come.

611
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,380
What's wrong?

612
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,220
What happened?

613
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,860
Nothing.

614
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,190
It's late.

615
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,860
Get back to sleep.

616
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,870
I should leave.

617
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,500
Wait a minute.

618
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,470
An armor made of the root bark.

619
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
You don't like it?

620
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,390
- Then I...
- I like it.

621
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,340
Get some rest early.

622
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,580
Today,

623
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,430
you look a little bit weird.

624
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,310
I'm just tired.

625
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,900
It makes sense.

626
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,910
It's late, after all.

627
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,910
You should go back.

628
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,870
If anything bothers you,

629
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,350
you can tell me about it.
