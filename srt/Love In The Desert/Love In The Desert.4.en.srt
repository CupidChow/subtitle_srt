Where are they?

25
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,990
I just saw them here.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,260
Search carefully.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,090
Yes.

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go.

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,940
You go there.

30
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,990
Go check over there.

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,900
Search carefully.

32
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,780
Yes.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,540
There they are. After them.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,540
After them.

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,910
What about Feita?

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,070
Feita isn't an ordinary horse.

37
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,630
Let me help.

38
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,620
No, thanks. I'm fine.

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Don't move.

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,420
How do you feel?

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,740
Any better?

42
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,390
Have they gone far?

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,860
Yes.

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,350
Let's get out of here.

45
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,420
All right.

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,510
Finally, you're tired enough to rest.

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,630
Rest?

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,860
In your dreams.

49
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,020
- Then why do we come to a post?
- Water for sale.

50
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,230
Water for sale.

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,460
To get the city map of Masui.

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,690
- I can't count on you.
- Water for sale.

53
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,830
Buy some water now or never.

54
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,180
Come on, sir. Have a look.

55
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,390
(Water)
Here's your water.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Thank you, sir.

57
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,990
I know water in the desert
is more precious than gold.

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,350
But this is way too expensive.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,950
He could have robbed us.

60
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,140
But he gave us some water.

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,830
Stop nagging, will you?

62
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,790
No. I can't let it go.

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,630
I'll go get the money back.

64
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,900
This isn't where you can make a scene.

65
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,700
It's a nice place. If...

66
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,860
No if.

67
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,630
I mean,

68
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,270
if you can flatter me,

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,020
buy me a big dinner,

70
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,900
let me sleep well,

71
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,670
and get me a sedan,

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,020
maybe I'll be happy enough

73
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,580
to give you what you want in advance.

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,990
If you want to rest,

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,550
beg me, then.

76
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,950
If you want to make a wish,

77
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,110
visit a temple.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,300
Miser.

79
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,540
Come on.

80
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,230
This is the White Horse Post
where people are everywhere.

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,380
What if Desert Rankers find us?

82
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,940
We can hide among crowds.

83
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,110
Sir, will you check in?

84
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,310
Leave your horse to me.

85
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,740
This lady looks so pretty.

86
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,580
Yeah.

87
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,820
Tonight, I can sleep tight.

88
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,740
Why do they stare at you like this?

89
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,030
They aren't staring at me,

90
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,670
but you.

91
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
In this case,

92
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,790
will I be in danger?

93
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,820
You're pretty. Men want to look at you.

94
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,550
Let's get in.

95
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,660
Chi...

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,260
(Sha Qu)
The door is open and in you came.

97
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,990
For food or for accommodation?

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,420
Accommodation for two.

99
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,620
All right. A fancy room.

100
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,460
- Two.
- Two.

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,460
Two rooms.

102
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,550
Please come this way.

103
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,310
Gentlemen.

104
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,470
Sorry, gentlemen.

105
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,710
We're closed.

106
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,470
It's on the house.

107
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,940
Sorry, sorry.

108
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,150
- Leave, please.
- All right. See you.

109
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,500
- See you.
- Let's go.

110
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,670
I'm terribly sorry.

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,980
(Henan Inn)

112
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,740
(Henan Inn)

113
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,740
(Horse-unhitched Tree)

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
(Eternal Winter Grass)

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,180
How did you get the Scroll?

116
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,590
In my childhood,

117
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,380
I got it from my father's friend.

118
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,350
Do you remember what he looked like?

119
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,300
Times have changed.

120
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,860
It's been a dozen years.

121
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
I don't remember.

122
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,060
Why do you ask?

123
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,410
And why do you want this book?

124
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,940
In the desert, everybody knows

125
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,590
the collection of the volumes
leads to great success.

126
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,380
I'll exchange it for money and get married.

127
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,790
Then, wish you a great wife.

128
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,150
It can't be that easy.

129
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,990
Fate of love, you know.

130
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,470
Before going through a lot,

131
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,030
a couple won't be together.

132
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,390
I should go.

133
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,940
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

134
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,420
- Chief.
- Chief. Ch...

135
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,810
Chief,

136
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,790
it's been 15 years.

137
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,300
Rong Huo finally appeared
in the desert again.

138
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,510
According to our scout,

139
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,990
he was seen in a border town of Yunpei.

140
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,710
He was all alone without a servant.

141
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,500
He told stories about history
to make a living

142
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,500
in different inns and restaurants.

143
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,790
Then, let's go to Yunpei.

144
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,230
We have to find Rong Huo.

145
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,790
Yes. We're deep in the desert.

146
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,940
We have to be careful.

147
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,260
Chief, they're dark guards of Tiandu.

148
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,060
Looks like our track transpired.

149
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,550
Go check it out.

150
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,300
In five days, we'll meet at Henan Inn.

151
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,140
Yes.

152
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,030
Spies in Tiandu

153
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,950
have been detected.

154
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,350
- Put an end to it.
- Yes.

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,830
Why is there a red flag?

156
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,950
It's a local rule.

157
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,620
Red flag means it's full.
Yellow flag means business.

158
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,860
We have to sleep in the open again.

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,050
I don't think so.

160
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,590
Look, behind the lantern

161
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,500
is a black flag, right?

162
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,230
Indeed.

163
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,860
It's the argot of Boa Agents.

164
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,500
I guess this is a place

165
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,260
for intelligence exchange.

166
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,070
I can get what I want in there.

167
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,350
Later, playact with me.

168
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,620
Before that,

169
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,230
promise me three things.

170
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,990
Such a woman of deals.

171
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,950
Speak.

172
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,070
I haven't decided yet.

173
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,860
But you have to promise me now.

174
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,470
How annoying!

175
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,590
I'll take it as a yes.

176
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,700
Remember.

177
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,190
If you lie, a donkey will kick your crotch

178
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,340
and you can't have a baby.

179
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,380
I...

180
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,310
Fine.

181
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,470
When we're in, do what I tell you.

182
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
We'll pretend to be brother and sister.

183
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,340
Deal.

184
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,830
Chief,

185
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,950
all the spies have been killed.

186
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,500
They'll make a comeback.

187
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,670
Keep watching.

188
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,790
Yes.

189
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,830
Chief, the latest news.

190
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,350
Na Zhan's men kidnapped Rong Huo.

191
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,110
Still, they beat us.

192
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,990
Map Yunpei's Lord's Mansion soon.

193
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,380
Yes.

194
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,430
Chief,

195
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,230
that lady...

196
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,430
I happened to save her.

197
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,220
What's so funny?

198
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,740
That's good.

199
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
I just think

200
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,310
it's the first time I've seen you

201
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,540
take a lady with you.

202
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,620
Quite new.

203
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,020
Mind your own business.

204
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,550
Chief,

205
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,500
where did you get it?

206
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,910
Sir.

207
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,470
Dear guests,

208
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,660
we're closed today.

209
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,950
Didn't you see the red flag?

210
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,540
I have an eye disease.

211
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,740
I didn't see the flag.

212
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,310
Honey.

213
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
We're brother and sister.

214
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,660
Honey,

215
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,380
are you avoiding me again?

216
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,230
Don't be kidding.

217
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,740
Honey,

218
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,590
last time, we slept in the forest

219
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,110
and I caught a cold.

220
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,780
Then, I had an eye disease

221
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,190
and haven't recovered yet.

222
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,470
I don't want to live in the open again.

223
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,860
We are horse dealers.

224
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,780
Do us a favor and offer a room.

225
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,310
- Just for one night.
- Gentleman,

226
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,430
it's not that I don't offer a room.

227
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,260
No room is available.

228
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,230
Will you let me sleep in the street?

229
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,620
If anything happens,

230
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,590
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

231
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,350
I'm so young and have no baby

232
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,260
before that happens.

233
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,190
As the old saying goes, saving a life...

234
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,430
Saving a life is... Honey.

235
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,990
Is greater merit.

236
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,620
That's what I mean.

237
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,430
Do us a favor

238
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,710
and help us out.

239
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,710
We really don't have a room.

240
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,470
Let's go upstairs and check.

241
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,740
Hey, guests.

242
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,150
Wait.

243
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,500
Please wait here for a minute.

244
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,540
Honey, it really worked.

245
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,620
Who's your honey?

246
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,500
He hasn't gone far.

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,340
It's invulnerable.

248
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,790
And here.

249
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,830
Chief,

250
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,900
a couple came downstairs.

251
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,070
The woman claims to have an eye disease.

252
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,350
But I don't think

253
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,900
they're businessmen.

254
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,020
Her husband looks like a bandit.

255
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
Bandit?

256
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,700
Ruo Wen.

257
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,830
Ruo Wen of Desert Rankers?

258
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,740
We can't let him see us.

259
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,260
Do something to hold him up.

260
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

261
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,140
In the vast desert,

262
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,310
whoever leaves never comes back.

263
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,660
May I ask

264
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,860
if you're here for accommodation?

265
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,900
Yes, indeed.

266
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,540
Can you

267
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,620
offer us a room?

268
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,540
Too bad.

269
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,110
No room is available.

270
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,380
If you don't mind,

271
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,190
our shed in the backyard

272
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,900
can be offered for free.

273
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,860
Prick up your ears and listen.

274
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,470
We want a room.

275
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,270
Guys,

276
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,990
this isn't where you can make a scene.

277
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,260
Honey, I'll go upstairs and check.

278
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,100
Let me go.

279
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,140
Honey, come have a look.

280
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,110
A vacancy, isn't it?

281
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,910
There's a vacancy.

282
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,500
Come on.

283
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,620
You're dishonest.

284
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,950
You rejected business.

285
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,950
Oh, my poor memory.

286
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,830
I certainly do business.

287
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,140
But Miss,

288
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,830
are your eyes all right?

289
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,710
They sometimes work.

290
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,540
I... I think

291
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,190
I'm blind again.

292
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,780
Then, enjoy your stay.

293
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,660
Such a soft bed.

294
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,710
Haven't enjoyed it for a long time.

295
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,150
Get up.

296
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,740
Sleep on the ground.

297
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,270
You...

298
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,430
Feels so good.

299
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,660
What do you want?
Don't even think about it.

300
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm here to do business,

301
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,190
not to do anything with you.

302
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,660
I don't want to please you, either.

303
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,950
Get up. I'll take the bed.

304
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,670
Make some room for me.

305
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,340
(Henan Inn)

306
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,620
Why am I here?

307
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,140
- You...
- I didn't touch you.

308
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,230
Why am I in your room?

309
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,380
I brought you over.

310
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,710
You lit the knockout incense?

311
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,540
Soothing incense.

312
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,070
To make you sleep better.

313
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,260
If I had used the knockout incense,

314
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,430
you wouldn't be awake now.

315
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't do this again.

316
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,140
Chief, Ch...

317
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,140
The door is open.

318
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,230
So, I came in.

319
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,470
Gentleman,

320
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,350
you shared one room.

321
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,830
But you have to pay for two.

322
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,340
We will.

323
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,470
Look at this lady.

324
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,710
Will she not pay?

325
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
Don't worry.

326
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,540
I won't.

327
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,710
Why does it happen all the time?

328
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,940
Wait.

329
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,860
Ruo Wen is here.

330
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,430
I'll go get you something to eat.

331
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,260
(What is Ruo Wen doing here?)

332
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,230
Stop.

333
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,070
I said, stop.

334
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,580
Me?

335
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,870
Have we met somewhere?

336
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
Don't turn around.

337
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,060
Or you'll die today.

338
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,180
I don't think so.

339
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,260
We haven't met before.

340
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,630
I look pretty normal.

341
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,780
I get the wrong guy.

342
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,140
Sir,

343
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,340
two bowls of beef noodles.

344
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,740
All right. A minute, please.

345
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,710
The clothes he wears

346
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,300
look like those of the owner.

347
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,150
He may be a Boa Agent, too.

348
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
He took the noodles upstairs.

349
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,630
Someone else must be in his room.

350
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,020
Keep an eye on them.

351
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,910
I have things to do.

352
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,940
Off you go.

353
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,780
(Since it's a place
for intelligence exchange,)

354
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
(I will find what I want.)

355
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,190
(The city map of Masui must be here.)

356
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,820
(Account Book)

357
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,390
Where is it kept?

358
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,260
(Has she left?)

359
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,150
(I don't think so.)

360
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,780
(Yesterday, her bed was warm.)

361
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,910
(If she had left last night,)

362
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,910
(Ruo Wen would have sensed that.)

363
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,390
(If she didn't leave...)

364
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,070
You...

365
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,070
Let go.

366
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,470
Are you all right?

367
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,630
- Yes.
- What are you doing here?

368
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,150
I was going to ask you.

369
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
Aren't you on your way to Yunpei?

370
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,100
It's a long story.

371
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,150
I can't explain it now.

372
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,470
Fine. Don't bother.

373
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,030
Take this back.

374
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,070
Who are you?

375
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,870
She's my friend.

376
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,150
I'm Ge Xinwei,

377
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,140
Ninth Princess of Masui.

378
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,470
Ninth Princess?

379
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,060
What's your relationship with Ruo Wen?

380
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,540
And who are you?

381
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,780
Why do I have to tell you?

382
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,780
I'm a friend of hers.

383
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,190
We'll come back to that.

384
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,660
Tell me.

385
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,470
Why are you with Ruo Wen?

386
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,780
Long story.

387
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,540
Ruo Wen kidnapped me.

388
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,670
Later, in the Dead Zone,

389
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,950
I met my clansmen of Enaqi

390
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,740
and knew you ran away.

391
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,990
So, I tricked him out,

392
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,990
buying you some time to save them.

393
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,740
No wonder Ruo Wen was away
when we went back there.

394
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,580
Run away.

395
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,950
If Ruo Wen sees you,

396
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,150
he won't let you go.

397
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,820
What are you doing here?

398
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,580
I lied to Ruo Wen

399
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,260
about a treasure in Masui.

400
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,820
But I don't know the way to Masui.

401
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,390
So, he brought me here

402
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,230
to get the city map.

403
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,270
Wait.

404
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,020
Aren't you the princess of Masui?

405
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,060
How do you not know the way back home?

406
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,230
Such a silly man.

407
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,780
For Masui's sacrificial ceremony,

408
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,990
I'm wanted as an offering.

409
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,190
If I don't stall for time,

410
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,020
shall I rush to get killed?

411
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,740
Why don't you go with us?

412
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,940
No need.

413
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,100
Now,

414
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,950
Ruo Wen is my man.

415
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,540
So, rest assured. I'm safe,

416
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,390
You actually matter. Just leave.

417
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,150
Or you'll miss the marriage ceremony.

418
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,990
Before he leaves, we can't get out.

419
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,710
He wants the map of Masui, right?

420
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,230
I have it.

421
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,420
(Henan Inn)
Sir.

422
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,310
The bill, please.

423
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,240
All right.

424
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,940
Let me check.

425
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,950
Why are you blind again?

426
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,340
Sorry.

427
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,990
My eyes sometimes don't work.

428
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,870
You know what?

429
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,950
The wine costs a lot.

430
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,470
Even if you're blind, you have to pay.

431
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,430
I didn't mean to break it.

432
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,500
Just some wine.

433
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,020
(City Map of Masui)
It was actually in my way.

434
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,020
You must be asking for trouble.

435
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Trouble? What do you mean?

436
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,150
You think I can't afford it, huh?

437
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,820
Honey.

438
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,100
What happened?

439
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,150
Just some wine.

440
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,070
Take the money.

441
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,170
Let's go.

442
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,260
Fine. It's enough.

443
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm blind.

444
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,270
Did you get it?

445
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,620
(City Map of Masui)

446
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,740
With Ge Xinwei's portrait,

447
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,540
travel to Enaqi and Masui.

448
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,670
Confirm who she really is.

449
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,250
When it's done,

450
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,470
I'll go to Yunpei and join you.

451
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,190
If I guess correctly,

452
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,500
the owner is a Boa Agent.

453
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,030
How do you know?

454
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,710
The totem on his pendant is a boa.

455
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,670
The boa of the desert goes anywhere.

456
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,870
Boa Agents, actually.

457
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,230
You observed quite carefully.

458
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,030
I learned it from you.

459
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,710
In case of trouble, I stay alert.

460
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,470
The two of you are quite familiar.

461
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,950
Just old acquaintances.

462
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,150
You're the princess of Enaqi.

463
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,020
How do you know
the Ninth Princess of Masui?

464
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,910
We're old acquaintances, too.

465
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,540
Let's go.

466
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,620
(City Map of Masui)

467
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,470
Fox,

468
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,430
can we really see them here?

469
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,860
We will.

470
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,740
It's the only path to Yunpei.

471
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,940
Stop.

472
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,430
Pull the reins.

473
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,790
Catch up.

474
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,900
Stop right there.

475
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,230
They want me. You leave.

476
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,100
No way.

477
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,470
Shoot!

478
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,300
Feita, go back.

479
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,540
Leave! Forget about me!

480
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,420
Huo Qingyun!

481
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,310
After them!

482
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,580
Who told you to come back?

483
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,710
You promised

484
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,910
to escort me to Yunpei.

485
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,260
Feita will ride you there.

486
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,340
You made the promise.

487
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,310
You have to do it.

488
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,870
I'll keep my promise.

489
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,710
I'll escort you to Yunpei.

490
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,230
Don't worry. I won't die.

491
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,870
We're arriving in Yunpei soon.

492
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,300
They wouldn't dare to run after us.

493
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,700
(Yunpei)

494
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,990
Huo Qingyun.

495
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,100
(Juyun House)

496
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,430
Wait.

497
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,090
Here in Yunpei,

498
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,100
you'll marry someone else.

499
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,060
Will you still take off my clothes?

500
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,710
You're dying.

501
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,950
Don't try to be serious.

502
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,230
I say this for your own good. I...

503
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,150
Do you rush to kill me

504
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,740
and get back the Desert Scroll?

505
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,660
Yes.

506
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,340
So heartless.

507
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,710
I'm heartless?

508
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,710
I shouldn't have saved you.

509
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,100
You had to.

510
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,540
Or you can't get the Desert Scroll.

511
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
I don't want it.

512
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,670
Leave it to your wife in the underworld.

513
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,530
(Such a deep wound.)

514
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,990
(The arrow is even poisonous.)

515
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,470
(Why is his pulse still so strong?)

516
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,490
(And...)

517
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
(He doesn't look like he's poisoned.)

518
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,670
Bear it.

519
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,340
Are we even

520
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,390
for what we owe each other?

521
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,190
No, of course.

522
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,030
Terrible.

523
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,660
Don't move.

524
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,260
I clearly remember

525
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,500
you owe me one promise.

526
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,710
So, the fever didn't burn your head.

527
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,190
Then keep that in your mind.

528
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,470
For your lifetime.

529
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,470
My lifetime?

530
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,990
After you get married,

531
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
can we still meet?

532
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,430
Take the decoction and keep your energy.

533
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,190
A poisoned arrow shot you.

534
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,950
Why did it not attack you?

535
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,990
Maybe I'm lucky enough.

536
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,380
I'm cold.

537
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,950
It feels so smooth.

538
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,670
Much better than the one

539
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,950
of the inn owner, huh?

540
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,260
Liar.

541
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,060
You lied a lot.

542
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,780
In the desert,

543
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,020
you pretended to be an escort.

544
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,100
I never said I was a nice man.

545
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,540
At that time, we didn't know each other.

546
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,740
When I was in danger,

547
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,590
revealing my identity as a Boa Agent

548
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,020
would get me killed.

549
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,230
The desert is dangerous.

550
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,100
Soon, you'll know.

551
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,430
Black jade and gold stripe.

552
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,230
What does it stand for?

553
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,180
Guess.

554
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,870
Chief of Boa Agents.

555
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,260
So, you knew it.

556
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,190
I've heard a lot about you.

557
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,780
Rather infamous.

558
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,500
So, did you come

559
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,910
for the Herb Volume?

560
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,870
Yes, I did.

561
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,830
What about now?

562
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,630
What do you think?

563
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,710
A Boa Agent like you

564
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,670
really lives up to his reputation.

565
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,060
What do people say about me?

566
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,190
Boa Agents are mysterious.

567
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,710
They wander in the desert,

568
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,300
holding the secrets of all cities.

569
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,340
However,

570
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,340
in my eyes,

571
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,150
they all have evil intentions.

572
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,340
Chief of Boa Agents is this kind of man.

573
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,740
Like master, like subordinate.

574
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,340
So, in your eyes,

575
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm this kind of man?

576
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,310
Yes.

577
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,670
All alone,

578
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,540
you went deep into the desert.

579
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,580
What were you up to?

580
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,900
(Bright Glory)

581
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,620
My Lord,

582
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,100
the marriage passes we received

583
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,260
have been registered.

584
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,270
Tell me about it.

585
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,190
Big or small,

586
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,230
there are 130 tribes.

587
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,150
You picked 32 tribes.

588
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,540
As of today,

589
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,950
21 of them have actually arrived.

590
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,780
Those from weak tribes are lost.

591
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,820
They ran into the bandits or exiles.

592
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,150
The name, age, appearance,

593
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,150
and background of 21 envoys

594
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,710
have been recorded.

595
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,150
Greetings, My Lord.

596
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,550
Speak.

597
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,230
Rong Huo is handled
in the dark chamber

598
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,430
of the Library.

599
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,780
Watch him closely.
Don't let down your guard.

600
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,230
Yes.

601
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,780
What have Boa Agents done?

602
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,990
Nothing.

603
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,500
But I guess soon they'll know.

604
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,870
These guys sell military
and political secrets

605
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,060
and they sneak in everywhere.

606
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,580
If we aren't careful,

607
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,300
Yunpei will get into big trouble.

608
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,260
You can't be too careful.

609
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,790
Yes.

610
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,790
Leave us.

611
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,820
Is anyone sent from Tiandu?

612
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,540
No. Tiandu

613
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,150
has sent no one.

614
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,420
Go on.

615
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,260
In the last two hours of the registration,

616
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,870
envoys from Enaqi arrived,

617
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,260
saying they were robbed
by bandits and escaped.

618
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,470
So, they had no offerings.

619
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,540
And I didn't see their princess.

620
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,540
She didn't take the roll call, either.

621
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,540
I guess she hasn't arrived yet.

622
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,910
I assume...

623
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,180
Forget it.

624
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,230
(Na Zhan, Lord of Yunpei)
Dead men mean nothing to me.

625
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,910
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

626
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,750
My Lord.

627
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,620
Don't leave me.
