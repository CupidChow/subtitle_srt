24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,750
Is anyone on the hook?

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,580
Everything has been peaceful.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,630
Nothing happened.

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,150
It doesn't feel right.

28
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,630
Enlighten me, My Lord.

29
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,670
What is not right?

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,700
The lantern fair

31
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,700
was heavily guarded.

32
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,030
But the bandits broke in.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,470
These days,

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,780
why do they not do anything?

35
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,020
Bandits are arrogant.

36
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,790
Maybe they think

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,140
the most dangerous place

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,790
remains the safest.

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,510
My Lord,

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,140
shall we transfer the soldiers

41
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,900
from the Library and the Prayer Pavilion

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,300
to the Mortuary Temple?

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,700
The Mortuary Temple is unobstructed.

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,070
Once the bandits appear,

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,740
we can hunt them down.

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,510
Go get it done.

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,540
Yes.

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,950
The other piece

49
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,580
should get moving, too.

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,990
How can we win with such ordinary dishes?

51
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,900
She can do many tricks.

52
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,460
If she wins His Lordship's favor again,

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,270
I'll lose my position.

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,020
My Lady,

55
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,390
what do we do?

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,580
Go write a letter to my father

57
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,070
and ask him for help.

58
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,300
Ask him to send me
all the chefs from my tribe.

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,270
Yes, My Lady.

60
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,350
It will be done.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,830
Did I offend him?

62
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,140
Who did you offend?

63
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
His Lordship?

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,860
That'd be terrible.

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,990
You don't know anything.

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,950
Don't say that.

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,300
Yepei.

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,540
Lianhuan.

69
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,990
In Enaqi,

70
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,420
did you learn to cook?

71
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,620
I can make ordinary dishes.

72
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,420
But dishes in Enaqi are rather simple.

73
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,620
I don't think His Lordship will like them.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,350
Yunpei is rich in resources.

75
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,150
And there are many kinds of food.

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,550
- Lianhuan.
- Here.

77
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,300
Go to the kitchen
and ask about His Lordship's preference.

78
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,460
Yes.

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,900
(No worries.)

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,180
(You've learned the Herb Volume by heart.)

81
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,350
(I believe understanding the Dune Volume)

82
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,110
(is just a matter of time.)

83
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,820
(After you succeed,)

84
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,350
(I'll give you a big present.)

85
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,430
(What do you say?)

86
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,540
(The Desert Scroll)

87
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,150
His Lordship is too busy to be disturbed.

88
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,500
My Lady, please go back.

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,230
I'm here for something important.

90
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,820
Please tell His Lordship, Mr. Zhu.

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,060
It's not that I don't tell him.

92
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,620
Don't give me a hard time.

93
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,940
If I have to be scolded,

94
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,300
I really...

95
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,180
- You know we...
- Get her in.

96
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,590
There you go, My Lady.

97
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,820
Greetings, My Lord.

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,910
You don't usually

99
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,750
come to see me.

100
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,180
I'm here to ask for punishment.

101
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,420
Punishment for what?

102
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,380
The needlework competition.

103
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,260
Do you mean

104
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,620
the armor made of root bark?

105
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,990
That is a great contribution.

106
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,260
What is wrong?

107
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,230
To win the competition,

108
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,670
I bragged, regardless of the truth.

109
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,230
Armor made of the root
can make our soldiers invincible.

110
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,860
But large-scale planting won't work.

111
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,390
Why?

112
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,780
First,

113
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,710
trees in Yunpei don't have strong roots.

114
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,060
Less productive.

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,740
All the root bark in my house

116
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,870
is only enough for a pair of wristbands.

117
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,830
Second,

118
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,940
the climate in Yunpei is unpredictable.

119
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,060
Different from that in the north desert.

120
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,470
You mean this kind of tree

121
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,500
doesn't grow very well in Yunpei,

122
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
right?

123
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,030
Not really.

124
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,420
After I read the two volumes together,

125
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,300
I've learned a lot.

126
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,790
I get to know
where this kind of tree grows

127
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,470
and what kind of soil is the best.

128
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,230
I should keep reading.

129
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,230
But I don't have the Climate Volume.

130
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
Within a short time,

131
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,030
I'm afraid I can't advance.

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,790
You can't advance?

133
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,310
Yes.

134
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,990
For now,

135
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,230
I've tried many times
to solve the climate and soil problem

136
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,590
with the volumes I have.

137
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,660
Be patient.

138
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,940
After you

139
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,260
totally understand the Herb Volume,

140
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,620
I'll give you the Climate Volume.

141
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,420
You have the Climate Volume?

142
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,700
Of course.

143
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,420
Why would I lie?

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,620
(Just as I predicted,)

145
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,860
(Na Zhan has the Climate Volume.)

146
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
You've been watching the key all day long.

147
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,990
But you don't tell me

148
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,100
what it is used for.

149
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,500
Weird.

150
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,820
On the register, there are over 100 girls.

151
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,030
Why are there only 30

152
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,500
in Zuixiang Brothel?

153
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,910
You love this place?

154
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,460
Not really.

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,710
I'm just curious.

156
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,390
And...

157
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,470
I have a new mission.

158
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,700
What is it?

159
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,300
None of your business.

160
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,300
Why don't you just stay here?

161
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,380
Don't leave me behind again.

162
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Come on, man.

163
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,110
Without a woman around,

164
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,950
you can't even comb your hair.

165
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,230
So shaggy.

166
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,430
You look like a beggar.

167
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,850
Don't try to be strong anymore.

168
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,620
- Don't move.
- I'm talking to you.

169
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,270
Worried?

170
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Chief.

171
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,870
I don't want you to be a burden.

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,310
Chief, we checked it out.

173
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,830
In Yunpei, there are four arsenals.

174
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,310
They're located in four directions.

175
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,070
Qin Duo is the supervisor of the east.

176
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,420
Every morning, the watchmen change shifts.

177
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,230
Then the arsenal is weakly guarded.

178
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,780
We can sneak in at that time.

179
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,140
Get more men with us.

180
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,100
We'll do it tonight.

181
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,580
Yes.

182
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,780
Tonight, you'll snatch Yunpei's weapons?

183
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,190
Keep combing.

184
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,380
You just talk tough.

185
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,380
Do you want to go?

186
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,070
It's men's work.

187
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm not going.

188
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,220
Besides,

189
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,500
I have bigger fish to fry.

190
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
If you dare, make this place

191
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,990
where we can always stay in Yunpei.

192
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,190
Can you?

193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
Chief,

194
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,020
more soldiers are sent
to the Mortuary Temple today.

195
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,990
It's uncovered.

196
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,310
I can detect nothing.

197
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,470
The Temple is for ancestors.

198
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Extra soldiers are indeed weird.

199
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,260
Except this place,

200
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,380
we should check
the Library and the Prayer Pavilion.

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,140
They're guarded by very few soldiers.

202
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,620
It's hard to know Na Zhan's crafty plan.

203
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,110
Give up on the Temple now.

204
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,070
Yes.

205
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,820
(Zuixiang Brothel)
Cheer up, girls.

206
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,110
Smile. Smile.

207
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,550
Mr. Wang, come in, please.

208
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,780
- Come on.
- Welcome.

209
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,160
- Come in.
- Entertain them.

210
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,380
Gentleman, come in.

211
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,660
You're always welcome.

212
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,260
Give them a good time.

213
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,220
- Chief.
- Chief.

214
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,430
Is it done?

215
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,830
- Yes. Don't worry.
- It's done.

216
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,990
After we took away the weapons,

217
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,950
we put back the empty boxes

218
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,900
where they used to be.

219
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,500
Within a year or two,

220
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,780
no one would know

221
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,350
we ransacked the arsenal.

222
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Oh, boy.

223
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,780
You've finally used your brains.

224
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,740
Fox, watch and learn. Use your brains.

225
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,100
But Chief,

226
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,350
the Mansion is more heavily guarded.

227
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,430
Shall we fall back now

228
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,310
and sneak back in when it blows over?

229
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
Yeah.

230
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,430
Is she really that important?

231
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,900
Do you have to risk your life?

232
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,900
I never know what danger is.

233
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,230
Her eyes make me uneasy.

234
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,660
To invade Masui

235
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,860
and guard against Yunpei,

236
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,990
we have to get prepared.

237
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,700
- But...
- No buts.

238
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,190
Wait for me outside the Mansion.

239
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,460
Chief,

240
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,110
if Princess Xinwei asks
where you have gone,

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,660
what shall we say?

242
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,260
You're clever, aren't you?

243
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,900
Why do you even have to ask?

244
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,740
Figure it out.

245
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,140
- How to reply?
- Clever, aren't you?

246
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,100
Show off again, huh?

247
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,950
I...

248
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,740
Tell me how I can rely. Come on.

249
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,300
(Jade Restaurant)

250
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,280
Fancy pendants.

251
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,430
It's so heavily guarded.

252
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,070
I don't stand a chance to sneak in.

253
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,730
Yes.

254
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,070
This is where His Lordship lives.

255
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,140
Common people like us can never get in.

256
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,900
What's wrong, sir?

257
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,740
Get lost.

258
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,540
Waiter.

259
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,470
Sorry. Sorry.

260
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,700
Waiter.

261
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,780
Be right there.

262
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,590
Gentlemen, the same old food?

263
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,190
- Yes.
- Here.

264
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,020
Your boot is dirty.

265
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,190
Let me wipe it.

266
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,670
Wait a minute.

267
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,380
Let's do a good job

268
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,860
and take back the chefs from Zhenqu soon.

269
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,260
Lady Youjia will greatly reward us.

270
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
This time,

271
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,430
we'll make a fortune.

272
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,740
So soon?

273
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,860
Yes. I set off
upon receiving your letter.

274
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,540
What about the men I sent to get you?

275
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,590
Men?

276
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,860
I didn't meet them.

277
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,590
Did my father send you alone?

278
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,310
Do you think...?

279
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,830
Oh, no.

280
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,470
My Lady, do you think I'm not enough?

281
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,470
No, of course.

282
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,020
It is too hasty.

283
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,860
I thought Father

284
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,540
would send me at least three chefs.

285
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,780
It makes sense.

286
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,910
Forget it.

287
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,540
Since you came alone,

288
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,780
you must have some skills.

289
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,740
Show me.

290
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,110
Step aside and watch.

291
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,190
If I cut off your head,
I'll make soup with it.

292
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,500
You've got quite a temper.

293
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,710
Well done.

294
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,580
Does it satisfy you?

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,930
Impressive.

296
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,590
Father sent me such a good chef.

297
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,860
Xiaolian, take him
to the kitchen to register.

298
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,620
My Lady, in the competition,

299
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,990
we will win.

300
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,710
Before you taste some,

301
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,710
I have something to say.

302
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,430
First,

303
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,070
if it's delicious, tell me honestly.

304
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,950
If it's not, tell me honestly, too.

305
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,700
Second,

306
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,260
however it tastes,

307
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,830
give me your opinion.

308
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
There you go.

309
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,980
Taste this.

310
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,910
How does it taste?

311
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,310
Delicious.

312
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,220
Tastes great.

313
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,780
Which tastes best?

314
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,150
All the dishes.

315
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,430
Yeah. All the dishes.

316
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,950
Be specific.

317
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,190
There are vegetables and meat.

318
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,230
Neither too salty nor light.

319
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,340
Yepei.

320
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,550
Lianhuan.

321
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,500
This competition

322
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,140
is about getting the oasis.

323
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,190
Be serious.

324
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,430
The meat smells fishy
and isn't palatable.

325
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,230
This dish is overcooked.

326
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,310
Too oily and mellow.

327
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,070
But Your Grace,

328
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,140
I really think they taste great.

329
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,470
They're better
than what we ate in Enaqi.

330
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,580
In Enaqi, there was
no fresh fruit or vegetables.

331
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,340
We mostly eat the meat of beasts.

332
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,910
It's either boiled or roasted.

333
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,260
Nothing special.

334
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,710
Yeah.

335
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Before I came here,

336
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,390
I never knew
there were so many kinds of food.

337
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,780
In Yunpei, I've gained a lot of weight.

338
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,390
Enaqi will have an oasis.

339
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,100
Just like people in Yunpei,

340
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,470
they can eat anything.

341
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,910
But our top priority

342
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,870
is to win the cooking competition.

343
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,470
How about

344
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,580
we get a local chef to teach you?

345
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,060
His Lordship always eats here.

346
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,500
Even if I learn something,

347
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,950
it won't be impressive.

348
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,950
I need a recipe.

349
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,630
Recipe?

350
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,260
Where can we get one?

351
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,670
From the Library, of course.

352
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,630
I'll go take a look.

353
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,430
If you like the dishes,

354
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,470
eat them up.

355
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,510
Don't waste food.

356
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,620
Let's eat.

357
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,390
I've wanted the meat.

358
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,540
It must be delicious.

359
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,550
You eat more, too.

360
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,750
I will.

361
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,060
(In the 310th year of Yunpei,)

362
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,390
(Lady Su was exiled
for a terrible mistake.)

363
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,790
(Nobody knew she was pregnant.)

364
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,740
(So, the Lord's son was missing.)

365
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,470
(After many search attempts,)

366
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,460
(Biographical Record)
(blessed by God,)

367
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,150
(in the 320th year of Yunpei,)

368
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,540
(Lady Su's son Na Zhan
returned to Huayu Mansion.)

369
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,340
(It's hereby declared)

370
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,260
(that Na Zhan will be the heir.)

371
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,940
(The fire in the Library that year)

372
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,320
(burned for three days and nights.)

373
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,190
(But this record has survived.)

374
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,870
(Such a counterfeit.)

375
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:36,300
(Library)

376
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,140
(Yunpei Recipe)

377
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,820
I thought you had left.

378
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,300
What are you doing here?

379
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,710
What about you?

380
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,330
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

381
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,070
Let's hide.

382
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,990
Come on.

383
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,980
What did you just say?

384
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
You...

385
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,190
I asked if we should torture him.

386
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,710
Do you think an old man like him

387
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,230
can survive  a night of torture?

388
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,260
But except that,

389
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,100
we don't know what else to do.

390
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,580
Let me think about it.

391
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,340
Why did you bite me?

392
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,190
Have you been too busy lately?

393
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,390
What do you want?

394
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,790
Where have you been?

395
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,740
What do you mean?

396
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,420
I didn't go anywhere.

397
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,540
The cooking competition is coming.

398
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,150
You haven't cooked anymore.

399
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,780
I suddenly want
some stewed mutton of my tribe.

400
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,670
Go cook some now.

401
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,420
Give it to me tonight.

402
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,580
Where's the mutton?

403
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,540
There's a lot in the kitchen.

404
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,150
When you're done, I'll come get it.

405
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,150
Make three more dishes

406
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,150
and some soup.

407
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,540
Light soup.

408
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,300
Her Ladyship has had too much heat.

409
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm talking to you.

410
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,470
Do you hear?

411
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,020
Then why does she want mutton?

412
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,740
None of your business.

413
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,430
You have good taste in food.

414
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,580
Who's that?

415
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,910
Aren't you busy?

416
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,020
To what pleasure do I owe this?

417
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,620
You left something in the Library.

418
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,740
(Yunpei Recipe)

419
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,990
Wait.

420
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,150
I left before you.

421
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,390
How come you got here first?

422
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,020
I can climb up walls.

423
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,100
Don't you remember?

424
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,590
What are you looking for?

425
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,500
There's a passageway, right?

426
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,780
These days,

427
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,910
did anything happen?

428
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,500
Or is it because I...?

429
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,620
You what?

430
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Did I mess with you?

431
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,360
No.

432
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,260
Never mind.

433
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,870
I shouldn't have asked.

434
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,670
Thank you for today.

435
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,180
You may leave.

436
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,470
You shouldn't have come.

437
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,190
Don't come anymore.

438
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,070
Huang Beishuang!

439
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,950
I have a bone to pick with you.

440
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,500
- Ruo Wen?
- How did you get in?

441
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,340
Ruo Wen.

442
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,230
Hide in here.

443
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,420
I'll go stop him.

444
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,100
Do you want everybody to know

445
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,230
I hide a man in my chamber?

446
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,310
Ruo Wen is a danger.

447
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,580
What if he kidnaps you?

448
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,430
Whatever.

449
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,100
None of your business.

450
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,260
Don't interfere.

451
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,870
Get out of the way.

452
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,670
You've got something.

453
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,230
You managed to sneak in.

454
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,710
Huang Beishuang,

455
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,190
get packed and leave with me.

456
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,310
I don't want to be rude.

457
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,430
If the two of you
want to come, come along.

458
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,710
You can serve us.

459
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,260
Don't brag.

460
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,710
Go look in the mirror.

461
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,990
I'll go with you.

462
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,100
You're just in time.

463
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,670
When are we setting off?

464
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,100
Your Grace.

465
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,100
Huang Beishuang, what are you up to?

466
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,990
What?

467
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,420
Don't dare to take me away?

468
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,910
Who said that?

469
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,910
Since I met you last time,

470
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,820
I've never forgotten your eyes.

471
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,950
Why's the mystery in your eyes?

472
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,580
The answer is right in you.

473
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,910
You have to go with me.

474
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,230
Desert Rankers have lost their den.

475
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,340
Go with you?

476
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,540
Where can we go?

477
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,260
Huang Beishuang, you reminded me.

478
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,300
You blew up my den.

479
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,710
I'll get you back for that.

480
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,740
Don't make a move.

481
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,340
Who's actually making a move?

482
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,070
Ruo Wen,

483
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,740
you killed dozens of my clansmen.

484
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,150
Even including my old wet nurse.

485
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,190
I blew up your den

486
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,670
just to take revenge.

487
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,710
We're even.

488
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,820
I killed a lot of people.

489
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
Your men follow you.

490
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,260
You're not a decent man.

491
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,190
That's why your men are malignant.

492
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,060
Stop arguing

493
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,580
over this meaningless stuff.

494
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
Check over here.

495
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,020
This is Huayu Mansion.

496
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,150
You can't do whatever you want.

497
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,830
You may leave.

498
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,740
He has left.

499
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,390
Why do you still hold your dagger?

500
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,820
So, will you go with him?

501
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,740
You were eavesdropping, weren't you?

502
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,340
What?

503
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,340
Didn't catch that?

504
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Ruo Wen is complicated.

505
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,500
You can't easily deal with him.

506
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,110
None of your concern.

507
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,390
I can solve the problem.

508
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,020
Stop having a tantrum.

509
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,260
Huayu Mansion is always dangerous.

510
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,580
Now, Ruo Wen is here.

511
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,910
You can't be too careful.

512
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,950
You coax me

513
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,870
and you remain indifferent.

514
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,670
Sometimes, you care for me.

515
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,500
Sometimes, you ignore me.

516
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,270
I understand.

517
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,060
You're a changeable man.

518
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,270
Some is true and some is false.

519
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,820
Now, what is this about?

520
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,340
You're my best friend in need.

521
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,150
I don't want you to be hurt.

522
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,230
That's all.

523
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,150
You should worry about yourself.

524
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Don't come anymore.

525
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,670
Yepei, Lianhuan.

526
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,180
Here.

527
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,470
Your Grace.

528
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,100
There's a passageway in this room.

529
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,300
Find it and seal it.

530
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,070
Passageway?

531
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,300
Passageway? Where is it?

532
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,380
Your Grace.

533
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,340
I found this in the corner.

534
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,260
It looks really old.

535
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,060
Maybe it belongs to the previous owner.

536
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,310
What is this?

537
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,870
Put it away.

538
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,020
Idiot.

539
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,210
Why are you always careless?

540
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,070
I'm not.

541
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,820
(Library)

542
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,700
(Library)

543
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,790
Since we parted in Tiandu,

544
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,870
it has been 15 years.

545
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,230
I've never been to Tiandu.

546
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,910
I've never seen you before.

547
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,790
Mr. Rong Huo.

548
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,390
Come on. Leave with me.

549
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,180
Move.

550
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,390
- No!
- Come on.

551
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,710
Boy,

552
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,030
listen to me.

553
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,630
Forget what happened today.

554
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,020
Don't tell anyone about it.

555
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,820
Never tell anyone

556
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,390
what happened
in the Lord's Mansion of Yunpei,

557
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,950
not even your name.

558
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,180
Understand?

559
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,060
Only in this way

560
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,500
can you survive.

561
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,470
We have to go.

562
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,860
Hurry.

563
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,660
Mr. Rong Huo,

564
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,740
can't you stay?

565
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,340
If I stay with you,

566
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,020
you'll be in danger.

567
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,580
Boy,

568
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,710
remember.

569
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,340
You have to live.

570
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,260
Will we meet again?

571
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,990
When you're well prepared,

572
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,790
come get me.

573
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,150
Where can I find you?

574
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,270
I believe

575
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,620
you will find me.

576
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:25,990
Qingyun?

577
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,310
It's really you.

578
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,180
These days,

579
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,310
you've had a hard time.

580
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,620
Oh, boy.

581
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,060
What took you so long?

582
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,990
I thought

583
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,430
I could never see you again.

584
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,310
Now, you've grown up.

585
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,790
Even if I die,
I'll have nothing to regret.

586
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,750
Mr. Rong Huo,

587
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,100
let's not talk now.

588
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,750
Let's get out of here.

589
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,940
I'll take you out.

590
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,220
- All right.
- Let's go.

591
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,060
