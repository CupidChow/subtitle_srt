Madwoman.

Madwoman.

26
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,540
What?

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,860
You're badly thirsty.

28
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,550
Drink it unless you want to die.

29
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,510
Come on.

30
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,110
So, you really faked your death.

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,910
Otherwise,

32
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,670
I couldn't have left Fentian.

33
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,020
I think you just did that

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,550
to be together with Huo Qingyun.

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,070
Still looking at my eyes?

36
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,270
You have

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,830
my mother's eyes.

38
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,190
Is she alive?

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,260
No.

40
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,940
Thank you

41
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,850
for saving my life.

42
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,510
When will you save me once?

43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
You're a survivor.

44
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,390
I don't think I'll get the chance.

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,550
When I get the Desert Scroll,

46
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,670
I'll help you.

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,270
Is it possible

48
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,790
that Mr. Rong Ruo fell in here?

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,950
Ruo Wen.

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,580
Huang Beishuang.

51
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,990
- Ruo Wen!
- Huang Beishuang!

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,300
We came in from the same entrance.

53
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,790
How come they're missing?

54
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,900
Why is she staying with Ruo Wen?

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
How do I know?

56
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,460
Wait.

57
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,630
Ruo Wen,

58
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,260
if you miss legs or arms,

59
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,710
I won't let you go.

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
Ruo Wen!

61
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,070
Where's Ge Xinwen?

62
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,310
In Tiandu.

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,720
Back there,

64
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,200
I'll give her to you safe and sound.

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,620
- It's chaotic.
- Be careful.

66
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,300
She'll be safe in Tiandu.

67
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,710
Let her stay there.

68
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,470
All these years,

69
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,060
you've been drifting in the desert.

70
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,740
Your men have witnessed

71
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,470
how hard it was.

72
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,470
You care for them

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,910
and you care for people.

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,550
You just don't care for yourself.

75
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,820
You're telling me.

76
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,510
Ruo Wen,

77
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,500
there are many kinds of love.

78
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,860
But yours is the purest.

79
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,940
You're emancipated
beyond the reach of the world.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,150
Just like your sword.

81
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,990
You can protect yourself

82
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
and pacify the world.

83
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,620
You'll stick to your heart, right?

84
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,070
My Lord,

85
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,990
here's collapsed quicksand.

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,230
Have they already...?

87
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,620
Send some men down there.

88
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,950
Get down and check.

89
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,990
Yes.

90
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,790
My Lord, it's a karst cave!

91
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,310
Cave?

92
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,910
So, this is what they were looking for.

93
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,230
I'll get down personally.

94
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,470
Have a squad patrol up here.

95
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,590
Once you find them,

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
kill them.

97
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,260
Yes.

98
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,430
(Before dark,)

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,670
(we must get to Sanjiang)

100
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,350
(and join His Lordship.)

101
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,350
This place is dangerous.

102
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,500
Even the slightest lapse

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,740
will get us killed.

104
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Time is running out.

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,350
How about we split up?

106
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
I look for the Scroll

107
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,113
and you look for the exit.

108
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,020
Stay alert.

109
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,470
- Ruo Wen.
- Huang Beishuang.

110
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
- Ruo Wen!
- Beishuang!

111
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,830
Watch out!

112
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,310
Thanks.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,600
Let's go.

114
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,210
Ruo Wen!

115
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,100
Beishuang!

116
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,030
- Qingyun!
- Ruo Wen!

117
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,870
Madwoman.

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,620
I've finally found you.

119
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,110
Why did you come out of Tiandu?

120
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,350
Why are you here anyway?

121
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,670
You came without my permission.

122
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,260
- Why can I not?
- You scared me.

123
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,180
- Let me see.
- I know I'm wrong.

124
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,710
- Are you hurt?
- Madwoman,

125
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,230
let me check on you.

126
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
You freaked me out.

127
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,580
Let me see.

128
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,470
- Are you hurt?
- Nothing.

129
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,700
Ruo Wen.

130
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,790
Why are you so badly injured?

131
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,480
The best healing powder from Tiandu.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,590
Apply it unless you want to lose your leg.

133
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,910
Hurry. Sit down.

134
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,510
Sit down here.

135
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,460
My Lord,

136
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,310
here's some blood.

137
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,070
Search.

138
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,670
Yes.

139
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,660
Looks like Mr. Rong

140
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,350
indeed survived.

141
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,700
Mr. Rong,

142
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,590
rest in peace.

143
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,830
You had a blood feud.

144
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,500
I will

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
always remember that.

146
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,670
Ruo Wen.

147
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,240
Ruo Wen.

148
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,740
In the 320th year,

149
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,780
my brother and I

150
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,950
traveled with Lord Na Qida of Yunpei

151
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,540
for several years

152
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,780
and wrote six volumes
of the Desert Scroll

153
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,870
to record the ways
of administration and maintenance.

154
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,500
This is the Tool Volume

155
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,540
for the reference
of desertification control.

156
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,740
In the 324th year,

157
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,620
Lord Na Qida

158
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,230
made his adopted son Na Zhan
supervise the city.

159
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,950
However, Na Zhan formed a clique

160
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,660
and held the tyranny.

161
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,230
People suffered.

162
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,980
(Held the tyranny. People suffered.)

163
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,540
In the 328th year,

164
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,460
Lord Na Qida

165
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,740
returned to Yunpei for political affairs.

166
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,060
Na Zhan and Eunuch Zhu Jun

167
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,380
poisoned him,

168
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,980
so he was grievously ill.

169
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,060
Go on.

170
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,180
Go on reading.

171
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,020
Freeze.

172
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,340
Go on reading.

173
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,940
I'd like to hear

174
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,740
what ridiculous things

175
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,300
those silly officials wrote.

176
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,620
Honey,

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,580
you couldn't be alive

178
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,340
without my blessing.

179
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,540
Na Zhan,

180
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,380
you killed Lord Na Qida of Yunpei

181
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,740
with evil intentions.

182
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,340
I will record your evildoings

183
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,740
in the history book.

184
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,100
All right.

185
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,660
But don't talk about this

186
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,860
before you get out of here alive.

187
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,660
The four of you

188
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,380
will rest here

189
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,900
with this skeleton.

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
Yunpei soldiers,

191
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,260
did you hear?

192
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,980
The Lord you serve

193
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
turns out to be so cunning.

194
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,460
Do you live up to your late lord?

195
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,580
Do you live up to your motherland?

196
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,780
Anyone who kills one of them

197
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,020
will get a thousand taels of gold.

198
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,180
Kill!

199
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,020
Watch out.

200
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,820
Ruo Wen, you have a death wish?

201
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,180
Let go of me. I'll kill him!

202
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,300
- Bring it on.
- Ruo Wen, let's die together.

203
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,380
Go.

204
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,490
- After them.
- After them.

205
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,450
After them.

206
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,100
Search separately.

207
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,900
Let's meet in an hour.

208
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,180
We have to find Chief at whatever cost!

209
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,300
Keep your eyes wide open.

210
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,900
Don't let go of even a bird.

211
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,020
Yes.

212
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,060
Qingyun, they've stopped.

213
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,140
Put me down.

214
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,820
Come on.

215
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,260
In this volume, Mr. Rong Ruo

216
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,460
marked where the edict was.

217
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,140
As long as we manage to escape

218
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,100
and get the edict,

219
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,860
we can do justice to everyone.

220
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,220
You can also take back

221
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,180
your throne of Yunpei.

222
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,900
I don't want that.

223
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,980
All I want is to rest the desert in peace

224
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,620
and grow old with you.

225
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,220
All right. No backing out.

226
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,740
You'll grow old with me.

227
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,420
You have my word.

228
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,420
Wait for me.

229
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,780
Come on.

230
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,660
Hold me tight.

231
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,220
If we manage to escape,

232
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,700
go to the Central Plains.

233
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,660
I won't go.

234
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,660
The meat there tastes bad.

235
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,300
I'm used to the free life in the desert.

236
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,900
Just for a few days.

237
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Can't you do this for me?

238
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,140
Go if you like.

239
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,620
Why do you have to take me?

240
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Dummy.

241
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,420
You never understand.

242
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,180
Your wound ruptures again.

243
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,420
It's all right. Just a minor injury.

244
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,620
Look, is that an exit?

245
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,500
But how can we get up there?

246
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,380
If we fail to climb up,

247
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,060
we'll fall and die.

248
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,260
Take this.

249
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,900
Come up here.

250
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,140
If you fall and die,
you'll just break my fall.

251
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,940
Fine. We'll die together if we have to.

252
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,460
Ruo Wen.

253
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,700
- So high.
- Don't look.

254
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,500
- High.
- Don't look down.

255
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,500
Madwoman.

256
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,870
Hold tight. You go up first.

257
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,140
No, no.

258
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,100
There aren't holds.

259
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,500
- You may fall.
- Stop talking.

260
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,100
Or we'll both die here.

261
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,260
Hurry. Get up there.

262
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
Hold me tight.

263
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,940
Does it hurt?

264
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,020
No.

265
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,340
It doesn't.

266
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,660
Hold me tight.

267
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,700
Madwoman, try harder.

268
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,940
Ruo Wen.

269
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,460
Let go.

270
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,020
No.

271
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,220
No.

272
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,860
I said, let go!

273
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,060
I won't!

274
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,380
You shut up.

275
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,820
I haven't been to the Central Plains.

276
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,100
How do you feel?

277
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,220
Madwoman, you had a death wish.

278
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,780
Let me check your hands.

279
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,780
Without a horse,

280
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,180
we can't get out of here.

281
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,900
Then, we'll die of thirst.

282
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,860
It's such a big place.

283
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,580
How can we get a horse?

284
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,740
Come with me.

285
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,940
All right.

286
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,540
Here it is.

287
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,540
Bandit Ruo Wen,

288
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,340
you're handing yourself over.

289
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,580
Put down your sword

290
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,820
and surrender.

291
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,380
His Lordship sent us to kill you.

292
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,980
Everywhere in Sanjiang,

293
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,820
our soldiers are patrolling.

294
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,380
Today, you can't get away!

295
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,460
If you resist,

296
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,860
you'll be both dead.

297
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,740
Charge.

298
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,260
Rather fiery.

299
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,580
Who do you mean, the horse or me?

300
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,860
Both.

301
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:32,140
(Sanjiang)

302
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,940
(Sanjiang)

303
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,660
Get down and check.

304
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,580
Yes.

305
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,620
My Lord, they were just dead.

306
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,260
Here are hoof prints.

307
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,900
Follow the hoof prints

308
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,540
- and go after them!
- Yes!

309
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,340
Oh, I wondered who it was.

310
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,380
It's you, Na Zhan, huh?

311
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,900
Where's our chief?

312
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,140
Your chief?

313
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,420
Why do you ask me about him?

314
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm looking for him, too.

315
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
I have a bone to pick with him.

316
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,980
What to pick with him?

317
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,860
Pick with me.

318
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,060
Arrogant bandits.

319
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,900
How dare you stop us?

320
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,380
You're going to die today!

321
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,060
Guys,

322
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,540
they think we're pushovers.

323
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,660
I'll risk it all now.

324
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,180
In this fight,

325
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,660
even if I die,

326
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,980
as long as I take Na Zhan

327
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,260
to the netherworld,

328
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,050
when I see Chief,

329
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,280
I can still be proud,

330
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,340
right?

331
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,300
Guys.

332
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,340
Guys.

333
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,980
Listen.

334
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,860
If you move forward,

335
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,300
fight them with me

336
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,700
and kill them.

337
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,140
If we meet in the netherworld,

338
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,940
we'll still be brothers.

339
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,260
If you fall back,

340
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,420
go anywhere you want.

341
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,780
From now on,

342
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,900
our brotherhood is all over.

343
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,220
In the future,

344
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,260
never say you're one of Desert Rankers.

345
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,300
Guys,

346
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,020
think of our life with Chief Ruo Wen.

347
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,860
It's worth it, huh?

348
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,140
- Yes!
- Yes!

349
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,380
Guys,

350
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,740
charge

351
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,660
and kill!

352
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,540
Come on. Careful.

353
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,100
In the desert,

354
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,660
we'll die of exhaustion

355
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,020
before we go very far.

356
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,740
Without a horse,

357
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,700
we can't make it out.

358
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,460
Unless we're totally hopeless,

359
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,220
do not give up.

360
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
Come on.

361
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,300
Let me carry you.

362
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,580
No.

363
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
You're injured.

364
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I can walk myself.

365
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,340
Qingyun,

366
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,060
we were in danger many times

367
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,860
and we got over it.

368
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,420
If we die here,

369
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,100
I won't have regrets.

370
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,060
I'm to blame.

371
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,460
I got you involved.

372
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,620
Nonsense.

373
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,900
To confront everything with you,

374
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,220
I'm satisfied enough.

375
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,460
Don't lose it anymore.

376
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,740
I promise you.

377
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,460
I won't let go of your hands again.

378
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,060
Before sunset,

379
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,873
we have to reach Sanjiang!

380
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,580
I've stolen time for the past 15 years.

381
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,180
You're awake?

382
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,780
It's warm here.

383
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,940
Ruo Wen,

384
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,580
after everything is over,

385
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,820
I'll marry you.

386
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,940
You always claim to be
the First Lady of Fentian.

387
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,220
Fox and Wolf call you Madam for a reason.

388
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,700
I want a grand wedding

389
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
with a great dowry.

390
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,113
I want to be your rightful wife.

391
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,900
I want you to love me.

392
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,180
Madwoman,

393
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,660
love doesn't exist if we die.

394
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
What I care for

395
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,900
is your promise.

396
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,660
I'll give you a promise.

397
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,220
Come on.

398
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,820
Listen.

399
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,060
Staying here isn't safe enough.

400
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,540
Na Zhan will send reinforcements

401
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,980
to Sanjiang immediately.

402
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,540
When more soldiers are here,

403
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,860
we can't leave at all.

404
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,780
What are you going to do?

405
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,740
We're leaving right now.

406
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,700
All right.

407
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,660
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

408
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,260
Go to see Fox and Wolf.

409
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,620
Ask them to come and help soon.

410
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,520
Why do you not come up?

411
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,380
We can share the horse.

412
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,340
No. It doesn't ride fast on the sand

413
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,220
when carrying two guys.

414
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,580
If they know you're here,

415
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,380
they won't let you go.

416
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,140
Don't worry. Na Zhan can never get me.

417
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,620
- Leave.
- I'm worried about you.

418
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,740
Leave. Hurry.

419
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,180
Ruo Wen.

420
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,340
They're in the forest.

421
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,260
Get them alive.

422
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,220
Ruo Wen?

423
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
Where's that woman?

424
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
She's dead.

425
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,260
Dead?

426
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,940
You're heartless, indeed.

427
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,420
Even when your woman is dead,

428
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,780
you still look so calm.

429
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,820
Ruo Wen,

430
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,567
I've always wanted to ask you something.

431
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,780
Do you know

432
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,620
what's in the edict

433
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,260
Rong Ruo kept?

434
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,340
Be patient.

435
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
You'll see him soon.

436
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,740
I should have killed you in Fentian.

437
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,940
It's not too late now.

438
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,740
You kind of have

439
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,140
your father's quick temper.

440
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,620
If you turn yourself over to me now,

441
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
for the sake of Rong Huo,

442
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,820
I can keep you alive.

443
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,780
You have to ask

444
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,380
if my sword approves.

445
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,460
Be patient.

446
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,260
I have a big present for you.

447
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
Where are they?

448
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,580
Answer me!

449
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,140
Where are they?

450
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,220
Guess.

Stop!

455
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,340

No.

470
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
