(Zhan Bie is on his way
to kill Huo Qingyun. Help him.)

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,140
My Lord,

26
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,670
Lord Qingyun remains the same.

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,270
Bingci Pavilion is heavily guarded.

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,550
We can't get in.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,670
How many more days
do you think he can live?

30
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,630
My Lord,

31
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,950
it's not that I worry too much.

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,830
I just think everything is
going too smoothly.

33
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,460
What if there's a trap?

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,300
My Lord, I recommend someone.

35
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
Chief.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,270
General Wei has reported

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,300
Yunpei soldiers

38
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,860
repelled Guhe before us

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,700
and saved Enaqi people.

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,740
They're encamping in the desert

41
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,950
and will head for Yunpei the next day.

42
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,910
Besides,

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,110
the Lord

44
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,390
has got a physician

45
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,230
to diagnose you.

46
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,790
Shall we stop them?

47
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,910
Not now.

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,460
Let them come.

49
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,123
Let's solve problems one by one.

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,580
He's coming at this time.

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,700
I'm afraid...

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,060
I've mostly recovered.

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
They'll just come here

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,460
to see how many more days I can survive.

55
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,420
Very well, then.

56
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,830
Let's put an end

57
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,860
to this act.

58
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,670
My Lord.

59
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,670
Brother.

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,390
I'm not very well

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,900
and I can't get up for you.

62
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,790
Please forgive me.

63
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,510
Don't stand on ceremony, Qingyun.

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,230
Throughout the desert,

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,620
I've found the best physician.

66
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,350
Have him check on Qingyun.

67
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,980
Please, physician.

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,830
You wait here.

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,700
His pulse bounces fast.

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,300
It's too messy to be counted.

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,030
It's the pulse of death.

72
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,420
Feel it again.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,470
Do you have any good ideas?

74
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,140
I'll do the acupuncture first.

75
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,790
But I can't assure you anything.

76
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,030
Maybe he can just live
for a few more days.

77
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,260
Please do your best.

78
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,670
Why do you want to kill me?

79
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,630
Huo Qingyun,

80
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,150
you killed my mother!

81
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,230
I didn't do that.

82
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,460
Liar.

83
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,230
This is the evidence.

84
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,180
The squad escorting his mother to Yunpei

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,260
hasn't reported yet.

86
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,110
Maybe something happened on their way.

87
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,550
Don't find an excuse.

88
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,030
How can I trust you?

89
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,100
Qingyun,

90
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,820
this man deserves to die!

91
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,070
Zhan Bie,

92
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,350
believe it or not,

93
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,910
I didn't kill your mother.

94
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,500
I won't kill you, either.

95
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,190
Tell me.

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,940
Who told you I was here?

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,550
Qingyun,

98
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,820
you're being too softhearted.

99
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,150
He'll be a trouble to you

100
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,550
and Tiandu.

101
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,180
It's thoughtful of you, Brother.

102
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,500
I admire it.

103
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,420
Qingyun,

104
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,620
sorry I failed to protect you.

105
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,740
How's your injury?

106
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,030
Why didn't you send a message?

107
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,590
I've been worried.

108
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,260
Brother,

109
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,740
the lashes devitalized me.

110
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,350
I need some rest.

111
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,500
I won't see you out, then.

112
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,750
All right.

113
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,590
Huo Qingyun,

114
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,620
you're really lucky.

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,150
You survived again.

116
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,950
My Lord,

117
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,710
I think that token

118
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,470
is from Boa Agents.

119
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,420
Boa Agents?

120
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,150
Lord Qingyun

121
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,820
will never play second fiddle.

122
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,260
If it's something of Boa Agents,

123
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,670
he must be the head.

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,350
Oh, my brother.

125
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,230
He's really capable.

126
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,660
Recently,

127
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,260
considering how he treats you,

128
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,670
he still cares for you.

129
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,350
I guess he won't kill you

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,820
in a very short time.

131
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,740
Let's bide our time.

132
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,060
We will get a chance.

133
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,060
I'm the Lord of Tiandu.

134
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,670
But I live such a humble life.

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,820
How can I fight him?

136
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,470
Na Zhan is cunning.

137
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,500
He's always snobbish.

138
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,110
I'll ask Boa Agents to stay alert.

139
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,950
Chief,

140
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,430
I interrogated some Guhe people.

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,070
They got their weapons

142
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,780
from Yunpei.

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,780
Na Zhan had a deal with them.

144
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,990
They regularly invade
small northern tribes.

145
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,420
As for the oases and plunders,

146
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,380
Yunpei takes 70%

147
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,500
while they take 30%.

148
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,110
Now, when the north desert is in chaos,

149
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,380
they want to annex small tribes

150
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,380
and grow stronger.

151
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,780
Again, Na Zhan

152
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,990
sent some bandits

153
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,950
and pretended to catch them.

154
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,310
Besides,

155
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,990
the commander of Yunpei wants to migrate

156
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,163
Enaqi people to the south.

157
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,110
Since they've come,

158
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,900
make all of them stay.

159
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,990
My Lord, a tip-off.

160
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,060
(Zhan Bie failed. Huo Qingyun lives.)

161
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,230
Liu Qi is such a loser.

162
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,990
Huo Qingyun lives.

163
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,260
Looks like the Lord of the North

164
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,470
has nine lives.

165
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,270
Lady Beishuang.

166
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,990
What's bothering you?

167
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,110
My Lord, it's been days.

168
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,990
Any word from our army?

169
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,860
Tiandu

170
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
has detained my reinforcements

171
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,830
and all the people in Enaqi.

172
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
Tiandu?

173
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,700
Why?

174
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,470
I believe you know it best.

175
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,500
Someone in Tiandu

176
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,140
wants to negotiate with me.

177
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
Who?

178
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,990
Negotiate on what?

179
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,470
Huo Qingyun.

180
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,620
I guess you know what he wants

181
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,140
before I tell you.

182
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,780
I won't approve.

183
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,990
I'd rather lose those soldiers.

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,950
But too sad.

185
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,740
Your people have to die, too.

186
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
My Lord,

187
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm the First Lady of Yunpei.

188
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,140
As I'm related to Enaqi,

189
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,140
they also belong to Yunpei.

190
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,500
If they die,

191
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,020
people will think less of Yunpei

192
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,070
and Tiandu will want more to invade us.

193
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,980
So...

194
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,100
My Lord,

195
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,350
please think twice.

196
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,470
With every good reason,

197
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,500
we must not concede.

198
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,380
What do you want to do?

199
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,740
I ask for some soldiers

200
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,620
to take my clansmen in.

201
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,430
Have you made up your mind?

202
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,660
You'll confront Huo Qingyun.

203
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,140
Since he wants me to go,

204
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,950
I will go.

205
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,860
If you can take back

206
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,660
Huo Qingyun's head,

207
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,350
I will give you

208
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,110
whatever you want.

209
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,020
Thanks for your trust, My Lord.

210
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,310
I'll do my best.

211
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,740
(Fengtian Pavilion)

212
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,110
Yunpei soldiers, on my command.

213
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,100
Here.

214
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,020
The Lord of the North
take Enaqi people hostage

215
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,500
as well as Yunpei soldiers

216
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,660
to provoke us.

217
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,780
Today, please

218
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,310
go to Tiandu with me.

219
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,190
We'll take back our families and friends.

220
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,540
The fearless guys

221
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,830
will be meritorious!

222
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,740
We're fearless!

223
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,220
(Fengtian Pavilion)

224
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,980
(Huayu Mansion)

225
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,710
Watch her closely.

226
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,500
For any abnormalities,

227
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,340
execute her immediately.

228
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,860
Yes.

229
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,260
Why, My Lord?

230
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,740
I want Huang Beishuang and Huo Qingyun

231
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,900
to become enemies in front of everyone.

232
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,710
It's hard to read minds.

233
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,140
Who loves first

234
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,070
will have his Achilles' heel.

235
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,310
If Huang Beishuang really kills him,

236
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,310
we'll have nothing to worry about.

237
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,830
If Huo Qingyun

238
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,230
detains Huang Beishuang,

239
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,430
he'll be spurned by people.

240
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,070
By then,

241
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,190
we will

242
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,590
have an excuse to start a war.

243
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,950
If she comes back with nothing,

244
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,620
the beloved woman

245
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,860
of Huo Qingyun

246
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,190
will be in my city.

247
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,500
I can threaten him with her.

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,430
By then,

249
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,660
when we fight a war,

250
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,260
he'll have to concede.

251
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:05,220
(Cheng'en Pavilion)

252
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,310
Be careful.

253
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,950
I'm exhausted.

254
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,950
Why are there so many affairs in a city?

255
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,140
My legs have fallen asleep.

256
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,940
You're capable, you know.

257
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,430
Come on. Be careful.

258
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,540
Didn't you say
you didn't like this outfit?

259
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,620
Then, don't wear it.

260
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,500
I like it.

261
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,310
Of course, I do.

262
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,950
Fine. If you like it,

263
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll make more for you.

264
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,670
Go ahead.

265
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,700
Chief.

266
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,270
Madam.

267
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,550
Speak.

268
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,430
Here's our chance.

269
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,540
Enaqi people are kept hostage by Tiandu.

270
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,110
Huang Beishuang has gone there.

271
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,310
- Just wait.
- All right. Thanks, Madam.

272
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,110
They look so mysterious.

273
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,110
What are they up to?

274
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,470
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

275
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,350
- Chief.
- What?

276
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,500
Miss Beishuang

277
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,500
is resting in Yunpei's camp.

278
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,420
Did you say I asked to see her?

279
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
She said it wasn't time yet

280
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,580
and she needn't come early.

281
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,470
Can you talk to me?

282
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,430
Talking for a mere moment

283
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,310
will satisfy me.

284
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,230
I won't disturb anyone else.

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,670
I just want a quiet talk with you.

286
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,710
You shouldn't have sneaked in.

287
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,550
These days,

288
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,230
I've been missing you all the time.

289
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,540
I keep thinking of our old days.

290
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,950
You shouldn't have come.

291
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,750
Leave.

292
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,670
I want to see you.

293
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,910
Tomorrow, we'll negotiate.

294
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,670
Hope you won't be sentimental anymore.

295
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,180
Hope you'll make the best choice

296
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,470
for your own city.

297
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,620
You...

298
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,580
Huo Qingyun, let me go!

299
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,190
How dare you kidnap me?

300
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,020
Are you insane?

301
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,740
When did you know
I was the Ninth Princess of Masui?

302
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,313
After you married Na Zhan.

303
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,820
Then how did you manage to remain calm

304
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,230
when you faced me?

305
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,630
In the eyes of you,
the head of Boa Agents,

306
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,500
everyone in this world is nothing.

307
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,500
It's my fault
to get your mother killed.

308
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,060
But my love for you is so true!

309
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,910
Love?

310
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,230
Isn't it absurd

311
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,430
to talk about love now?

312
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,580
I know you won't forgive me.

313
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,190
But I have something great to do.

314
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,130
When everything is settled down,

315
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,740
I'll kill myself in front of you.

316
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,910
I don't want such empty talk.

317
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,300
I swear to avenge my mother.

318
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,390
I gave you this dagger.

319
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,190
A few days ago, Zhan Bie assassinated me.

320
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,780
You sent him.

321
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,470
Right?

322
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,100
Answer me.

323
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,210
Yes.

324
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,540
I want to kill you.

325
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,430
Now, you have the dagger back.

326
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,340
Do it.

327
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,940
What are you waiting for?

328
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,260
You think I don't dare?

329
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,190
Can't do that?

330
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,430
So, you still care for me.

331
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,390
Killing you is mercy for you.

332
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,820
I'll make you live

333
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,820
with this guilt.

334
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,150
Huang Beishuang,

335
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,100
in your eyes,

336
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,470
I see more than hatred.

337
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,540
Feita will ride you back.

338
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,540
The Lord of the North,

339
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
release them.

340
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,910
The north desert is my territory.

341
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,340
Even anyone from Yunpei

342
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,910
can't take advantage here.

343
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,430
Will you stick to your stubborn plan

344
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,950
and be cursed in the world?

345
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,300
I don't care.

346
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Today,

347
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,620
you can hate me

348
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,870
or complain about me.

349
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,580
I'll keep you anyway.

350
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,340
I'll keep you by my side!

351
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,470
Do you know what it means?

352
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,230
A war against Yunpei.

353
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,540
So what?

354
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,940
Good boy.

355
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,030
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,860
Huo Qingyun,

357
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,540
keep your promise.

358
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,230
Release Enaqi people and Yunpei soldiers.

359
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,670
Or I'll kill Feita.

360
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,060
Do you think

361
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,990
I'll release them

362
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,340
for a mere horse?

363
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,660
Someone else may not.

364
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,710
But I can.

365
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,340
Will you really do this to me?

366
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,300
♪Who will hug me in the dark?♪

367
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,910
This is your everything.

368
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,700
I can't afford to keep it.

369
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,620
Trust it with someone else.

370
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,210
♪Then I hear you calling me♪

371
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,140
♪You tolerate everything in me♪

♪We're twin birds in the dark♪

373
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,350
Huang Beishuang,

374
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,380
to you,

375
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,100
I'm always gentle.

376
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,470
But if I can conquer you with power,

377
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,870
I won't hesitate.

378
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,540
Don't force me.

379
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,990
If you want to die in my heart forever,

380
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,580

you and I

are over.

391
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,473
For the rest of our lives,

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,150

In this world,

404
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,390
I have no family or friends.

405
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,950
You're the only one

406
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,750
I can trust it with.

407
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,590
Promise me.

408
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,500
Unless I'm dead,

409
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,060
you won't open it.

410
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,830
All right.

411
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,380
You have my word.

412
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,030
Say no more.

413
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,500
Pretend it's a dream.

414
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,470
When you wake up,

415
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,910
forget everything.

416
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,580
But the fate isn't.

417
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,300
Remember what you promised me.

418
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,030
It's for you.

419
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,420
Whatever I promise you,

420
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,470
I'll keep my word.

421
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,660
Young Lord.

422
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,230
Mr. Rong Huo,

423
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,230
be seated, please.

424
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,340
Young Lord, don't worry.

425
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,630
If I survive to the very end,

426
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,230
I will record your story

427
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,460
where you exchange captives for a horse.

428
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,300
Even in a thousand years,

429
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
people will still remember it.

430
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,380
Mr. Rong Huo,

431
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,740
don't make fun of me.

432
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,990
Young Lord,

433
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,780
don't force anything.

434
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,540
In life

435
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,390
or in love.

436
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,650
She and I

437
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,060
are over.

438
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm an avenger of blood without a future.

439
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,500
I shouldn't have involved her.

440
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,990
If Tiandu and Yunpei

441
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,910
have to fight a war,

442
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,150
what will you do?

443
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,990
Don't let Na Zhan know your weakness.

444
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,190
Otherwise,

445
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,300
you'll be threatened.

446
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,580
By then, all our efforts

447
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,340
will be in vain.

448
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,210
I get it.

449
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,670
A boy died for you.

450
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,630
Make his death worth his while.

451
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,820
Are you saying...?

452
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,870
Na Qida, the 49th lord of Yunpei,

453
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,020
hereby announced.

454
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,780
"My son Na Zhan
has great strength of character.

455
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,150
He's very like me

456
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,150
and will inherit everything of mine.

457
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,740
So, he will take the throne

458
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,390
and reign over the city."

459
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,630
Congratulations, My Lord.

460
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,990
Na Zhan,

461
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,990
how dare you fake the edict?

462
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,670
Don't you fear the retribution?

463
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,670
Fake?

464
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,150
This edict was written by Father.

465
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,660
Mr. Rong,

466
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,300
don't be silly.

467
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,870
- General Wu.
- Here.

468
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,470
Go with Mr. Rong to get my brother here

469
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,910
for Father's funeral.

470
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,100
Remember.

471
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,190
There's a plum mark

472
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,190
on his shoulder.

473
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,780
Do you remember Rong An?

474
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,870
Mr. Rong Ruo's son?

475
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,300
He has a plum mark on his shoulder.

476
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,190
To save your life, my brother

477
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,060
switched you and his son

478
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,820
and gave Rong An to Na Zhan.

479
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,340
A sinister man like Na Zhan

480
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,780
wouldn't let the boy live.

481
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,820
I was too little

482
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,060
to notice that.

483
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,260
Plum mark?

484
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,710
Mr. Rong Huo,

485
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,190
what does the plum mark

486
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,910
look like?

487
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,190
Look, Young Lord.

488
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,190
On his left shoulder.

489
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,870
Young Lord, why do you ask?

490
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,230
Mr. Rong Huo,

491
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,790
Rong An

492
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,470
may still be alive.

493
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,300
Oh, no. Desert Rankers.

494
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,310
- Yunpei devils!
- Protect Her Ladyship!

495
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,310
How dare you break into our territory?

496
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,550
- Guys.
- You have a death wish.

497
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,510
Kill as far as you!

498
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,100
We're just here for Desert Rankers.

499
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,180
After them!

500
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,670
Protect Her Ladyship!

501
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,380
My Lady!

502
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,310
After them!

503
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,990
My Lord, you've lost weight.

504
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,950
Get some rest and take care of yourself.

505
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,820
I can barely eat or sleep.

506
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,430
I understand.

507
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,630
But he has the military power.

508
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,390
We can't control him.

509
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,300
What can we actually do?

510
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,430
He survived several times.

511
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,670
In the future,

512
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,300
it's harder to kill him.

513
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,260
My Lord, we can't just do nothing.

514
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,670
Let's invite him to Yunci Spring

515
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,990
and do something accordingly.

516
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,940
Chief.

517
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,940
Chief,

518
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,020
I searched secretly

519
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,470
and found this note

520
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,060
in Liu Qi's room.

521
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,180
(Zhan Bie is on his way
to kill Huo Qingyun. Help him.)

522
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
I knew it.

523
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,700
I'll go get him here.

524
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,660
Wait.

525
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,390
This isn't the best time.

526
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,990
Do not alert him.

527
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,820
Your Lordship.

528
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,700
Greetings, Your Lordship.

529
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,860
What's up?

530
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,110
Your Lordship,

531
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,270
the Lord invited you to Yunci Spring
for political discussions.

532
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,990
