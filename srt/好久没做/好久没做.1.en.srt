00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,780
- Four hundred thousand won?
- Yes, 400,000 won.

Four of them.

179
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,380
I don't think 400,000 won is enough to go back and forth.

180
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,770

- Five hundred thousand won?

- Five hundred thousand won.

182

How long are you saying you'll take?

All right, then. I'll be waiting over there.

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,140
Should I give you some pocket money so you can do stocks?

348
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,030
Aunt Jin, it's okay.

349
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,370
I'm making money on stocks with the allowance from my parents.

350
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,380
Really?

351
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,420
How much do you make?

352
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,460
I don't have enough seed money to make a lot yet.

353
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,130
I think I make about one million won a month.

354
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,050
That much?

355
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,740
It's still far from enough.

356
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,860
Se Yeon, is something bothering you?

357
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,410
Why are you drinking so much?

358
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,740
Unni...

359
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,130
does you two shake the sheets these days?

360
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,010
I haven't heard that phrase in a while. "Shake the sheets."

361
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,650
I got so stressed because of that these days.

362
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,670
I became an alcoholic.

363
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,060
At night, I can't sleep without alcohol.

364
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
Do you see my hand shaking?

365
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,290
You do shake a bit.

366
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,730
Jeong Su always had a strong libido.

367
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,230
We always did it once a day.

368
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,700
That was the only joy in my life.

369
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,330
I didn't know Jeong Su was like that.

370
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,700
He's a good man.

371
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,510
He was a good man.

372
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,590
But about a year ago, he suddenly started turning bad.

373
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,880
The frequency of doing it decreased from once every three weeks to once every three months.

374
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,170
We don't do it at all anymore.

375
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,410
And this is what I'm most suspicious about.

376
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,820
I gave it a check recently.

377
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,600
Check what?

378
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,730
It wasn't the same as before.

379
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,640
What are you talking about? His size?

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,380
The length or the thickness?

381
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,470
The amount of semen.

382
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,560
Jeong Su.

383
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,250
Jeong Su, I'm a little embarrassed to say this to you, but...

384
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,890
What is it?

385
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,360
Gosh, where should I even start?

386
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,630
Gosh. Hey, can I tell you mine first?

387
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,010
Huh?

388
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520
I think I'm in deep trouble.

389
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,970
His amount of semen isn't the same as before.

390
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,620
Before, when he came in my mouth, it would overflow.

391
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,050
But these days, it's about the same as a small gulp of saliva.

392
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,960
He really comes like a little rat.

393
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,560
Se Yeon, you were a good swallower, huh?

394
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,440
Right. You have to have a taste for it.

395
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,300
Yes, I'm a good swallower.

396
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,250
Maybe it's because I haven't swallowed these days.

397
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,240
I'm having all kinds of thoughts.

398
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,730
I even wondered if another woman could be swallowing them.

399
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,560
I think my girlfriend's cheating on me.

400
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Girlfriend?

401
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,210
Are you talking about Se Yeon or what?

402
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,420
Se Yeon is my wife.

403
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,990
I'm talking about my girlfriend.

404
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,800
So, you have a wife and a girlfriend?

405
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes, that's right.

406
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,000
But that's not the issue right now. The problem is she's cheating on me.

407
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,290
That's the problem? Can that even be an issue?

408
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,490
Hey.

409
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,980
I said my girlfriend is cheating on me!

410
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,720
That means you're also cheating.

411
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,610
Oh, you think I'm a crazy bastard right now.

412
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,550
Sure, that's possible.

413
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,750
However, you can love two people.

414
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,430
You wouldn't get what I'm saying right now.

415
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,710
But you're bound to understand once the time comes.

416
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,540
Mark my words.

417
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,400
You can only love up to two people.

418
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,660
It's not love starting with the third.

419
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,650
I also want to consume some protein.

420
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,620
I should've eaten a lot when I had the chance.

421
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
But it was so fishy for me.

422
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,820
Unni, are you serious?

423
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,150
How long has it been since your last time?

424
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,720
Me?

425
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,000
When was it again?

426
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,310
I don't even remember.

427
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,950
Unni, what do we do?

428
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,680
How can you live for years holding back?

429
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,130
I don't hold back.

430
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,800
I'm a grownup, so I take care of it alone.

431
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,110
Unni, please wake up!

432
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,830
That's called safety frigidity.

433
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,190
It's the same as saying

434
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,370
you won't be hit or die when there are missiles flying around in the East Sea right now!

435
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,380
When people starve, they start jumping over other house's walls.

436
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,020
You get what I'm saying, right?

437
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,470
I'm sure you're both starved right now.

438
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,410
Be careful.

439
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,090
Hey, you can tell me what you were embarrassed about. What is it?

440
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah.

441
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,860
Jeong Su.

442
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
- I've got a favor to ask of you.
- What is it?

443
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,130
-When it rained a lot last time-
- That's perfect.

444
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I also have a favor to ask of you. Can I go first?

445
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,220
- What is it?
- Come with me to this place right now.

446
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,050
Right now? To where?

447
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,880
You'll have a good time, too.

448
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,280
I need to go with you to make a good alibi.

449
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,240
Where are we going?

450
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,220
<i>L, love it! G, go for it!</i>

451
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,400
<i>L, love it! G, go for it!</i>

452
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,850
<i>L!</i>

453
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,180
<i>G!</i>

454
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,320
<i>Check your messages, Noona.</i>

455
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,090
<i>Whoa, how could we meet like this? What a coincidence!</i>

456
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,150
<i>How can you do this to me, Noona?</i>

457
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,150
<i>You said you like Kia.</i>

458
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,270
<i>L, love it! G, go for it!</i>

459
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,760
Where are you going? Where-

460
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,850
Stay here just a moment!

461
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,520
I really came to watch baseball, and I saw you.

462
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,650
I was really surprised.

463
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,440
I should've hit you up and come with you. What an idiot.

464
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,250
What the heck...

465
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,200
I was really surprised because you were cheering for LG.

466
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,120
Jeong Su, I like both teams, Kia and LG.

467
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,930
If you're a real baseball fan, it's fine to support both teams.

468
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,760
How can you do that?

469
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,370
Why don't you just support and cheer for all teams if that's the case?

470
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,440
That's just a fickle and crappy fan.

471
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,760
Does that man like LG?

472
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,620
I'm starting to get grossed out by you now. How can you follow me here?

473
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,300
Noona...

474
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,440
I came to watch baseball, too! See?

475
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,570
I'm so disappointed in you.

476
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,640
Are you going to keep throwing shitty balls at me like this?

477
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,170
You were throwing only strikes, but what happened?

478
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,150
You're in a serious crisis right now if this was baseball.

479
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,950
That was your third ball count, and all bases are filled.

480
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,470
It's a full count. What are you going to do?

481
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,210
Won't you pull yourself together? Do you want to be switched out?

482
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,730
Switched out? That's harsh!

483
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,400
- Will you go home right after watching baseball with that man-
- Jeong-

484
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,110
Su...

485
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,170
Yes, Noona.

486
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,560
Go. I'm going to have some fun and go home. So hurry on home.

487
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,640
You need to think about your wife at home, too.

488
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,380
You'll call me, right?

489
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,270
Okay, okay, I'll call you.

490
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,270
You have to go home today, okay?

491
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,190
I'll rest assured and go now.

492
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,760
- Don't follow me.
- Okay.

493
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,550
I'll watch it on the TV or on my phone.

494
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,010
Gosh, my gosh... Aigoo!

495
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,800
Noona, I'm sorry!

496
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,190
I'll throw only strikes from now on!

497
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,960
Go!

498
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
Thanks.

499
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,320
I don't think I could've come and seen this crap all alone.

500
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,600
Why do you think Noona keeps seeing me?

501
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,440
Because you drive a Porsche?

502
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,340
Hey, my noona isn't like that.

503
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,790
Her car's a Bentley, man.

504
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,200
Hey, what are you going to do if you get caught?

505
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,250
I'll never get caught.

506
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,910
That would be betraying my wife, you idiot.

507
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,730
I don't betray.

508
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,910
Gosh, the suspension is different on this.

509
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,560
Your car's so nice. When did you buy it?

510
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,470
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

511
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,150
It's my wife's car.

512
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,610
I bought it for her two months ago on our wedding anniversary.

513
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,040
How nice. You're good to your wife and

514
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,180
to your lover, too.

515
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,790
Samuel, it's about time you got back up now.

516
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,280
Of course, I want to get back up.

517
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,370
Jeong Su, so while we're on the topic-

518
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,400
We both worked so hard.

519
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,310
That's all that matters, man.

520
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,040
Hey, failing once with a startup isn't the end of the world.

521
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,160
Since you failed once, you just have to avoid doing the same.

522
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,140
You and I failed it together, but how are we so different?

523
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,470
You know, I have my in-laws.

524
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,820
Anyhow, I'll contact you again.

525
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,350
So, stop driving the taxi, and let's do something together.

526
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,420
Isn't your Seoul National University degree a waste?

527
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,730
Hey, are Seoul National University graduates not allowed to drive taxis?

528
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,110
Huh?

529
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,720
- Hey, what's the matter? We're friends.
- How could you say that...

530
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,260
You're scaring me. Don't do that.

531
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,340
I can't drive the taxi even if I wanted to.

532
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,270
While you were buying this Porsche, my taxi was flooded and died.

533
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,510
What are you saying?

534
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,210
I'm saying it was flooded and totaled.

535
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,570
My insurance won't even cover it.

536
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,460
Wait, didn't Jin take out a loan to buy it for you?

537
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,170
Jeong Su, that's why I need to ask you for a favor.

538
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,790
I know.

539
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,040
What?

540
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
You think I'm that dull?

541
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,390
You know?

542
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,730
Samuel.

543
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,050
Yes.

544
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,980
I consider you to be my only friend.

545
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,240
Thank you so much, Jeong Su.

546
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,540
That's why I don't want to lose you.

547
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,570
I don't think there should be any lending or paying back money between friends.

548
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,820
Honestly, I want to just buy you a taxi. It probably doesn't even cost much.

549
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,740
But what would happen to our relationship, then?

550
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,030
We'll just be uncomfortable as a lender and a borrower.

551
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,920
I'll be good so we don't become a lender and a borrower.

552
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,680
Can I borrow just 20 million won, Jeong Su?

553
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,390
I've been wanting to say this a while back, but you kept cutting me off.

554
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,900
- With that money, I can start again with a used car.
- No, no.

555
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,710
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

556
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,310
No, I can't.

557
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,400
No means no.

558
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,740
What's the matter?

559
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,970
I just took a shower.

560
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,520
I even shaved down there.

561
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,070
Don't you want to see my barren hill?

562
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,670
Good job. It must be hygienic.

563
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,170
Hey, Rim Park Samuel, wake up. It's not the time to sleep.

564
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,980
Why?

565
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,130
Are we what they call a sexless couple?

566
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,870
What's wrong? It's nothing new.

567
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,220
What are you doing right now?

568
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,690
It's natural to suddenly start like this.

569
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,730
This is too sudden. I'm not even ready.

570
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,450
Let's do the stuff other people do, too.

571
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,480
Try to focus here.

572
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,880
I don't like doing it out of the blue like this.

573
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,840
You're doing well, okay?

574
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
You're like a marshmallow, and you're getting there.

575
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,450
Gosh, hold on, hold on.

576
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,620
No, you're getting there.

577
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,920
Stop, stop. No more.

578
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,800
What's the matter with you now?

579
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,250
I don't like doing it out of duty like this. Are you doing this because you love me?

580
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,330
Why are you bringing in love now?

581
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,150
It's love when you're together for life.

582
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,910
And love can come while having sex, too!

583
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,840
Do you even know what I ate for dinner last night?

584
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,210
Are you saying I need to know all that to touch your stuff? That's petty!

585
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,830
Let's not do this. I'm really not in the mood for this, Woo Jin. Sorry.

586
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,310
I'm getting suspicious here right now.

587
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,020
Who knows if you're having affairs out there?

588
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,750
There's an old saying that goes, "When people starve, they start jumping over other house's walls."

589
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,020
How could I even fathom having an affair?

590
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,510
Affairs are for people who can afford it, like Jeong Su.

591
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,050
What did you say?

592
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,050
Is Jeong Su having an affair?

593
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,670
Is he?

594
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,210
Apparently so.

595
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,590
This better not be a way out of doing it.

596
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,110
It's not.

597
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,400
Gosh.

598
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,260
Here. Have some honey water.

599
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,760
I saw Jeong Su using two phones.

600
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,800
He has a separate phone he uses for his affair.

601
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,100
Greedy bastard.

602
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,000
Se Yeon was drinking herself to death because of him.

603
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,180
But he made another phone?

604
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,970
This is what Jeong Su said. What was it again?

605
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,610
He said you can...

606
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,940
love up to two people.

607
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,960
But it's not love starting with the third one. What a lunatic.

608
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,050
I think a man's phone is his dick.

609
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,360
Having two phones means having two dicks.

610
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,680
What about deliverymen?

611
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,350
Some have like five phones.

612
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,330
I was saying figuratively.

613
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,120
I was joking, too.

614
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,520
Anyhow, these bastards just become fearless once they make some money

615
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,010
and start having two dicks.

616
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,410
Once I've found out, I won't let it slide.

617
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,710
What are you going to do?

618
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,380
What else? Destroy one of your friend's dicks.

619
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,190
How will you do that? Don't.

620
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,290
I'll tell Se Yeon right away.

621
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,750
- What?
- She was already conflicted because of it.

622
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,810
This is their problem. Let's just look the other way.

623
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,820
I can't do that.

624
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,460
I'm off.

625
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,150
I'm fucked.

626
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,760
[Song Se Yeon]

627
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,010
<i>Hi, Unni. I was about to call you, too.</i>

628
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,280
Se Yeon...

629
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,830
Why? What's wrong?

630
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,010
<i>What? You're the one who's got a problem.</i>

631
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,210
<i>Are you okay, Unni?</i>

632
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,660
What do you mean?

633
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,830
<i>I heard his taxi was flooded.</i>

634
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,120
<i>But it can't even be covered by insurance.</i>

635
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,420
<i>How unfortunate.</i>

636
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,600
Sorry?

637
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,910
<i>Samuel asked Jeong Su for some money, but Jeong Su didn't lend him any.</i>

638
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,820
<i>I'm sure Samuel was hurt. What should we do?</i>

639
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,390
I know...

640
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,260
Why?

641
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,040
Why did you come all the way to my house? What is it?

642
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,760
Hey, Jeong Su.

643
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,720
I was in the middle of a chess game for 100,000 won!

644
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,110
Jeong Su, this is bad.

645
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,160
What is it?

646
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,440
My wife found out about your affair.

647
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,820
What?

648
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,770
Get over here!

649
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,060
She said she'd tell Se Yeon.

650
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,990
You know how she is, right? She'll do it if she says so.

651
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,830
You crazy punk, why would you tell her?

652
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,300
I'm sorry. I didn't know my lips were so loose, either.

653
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,050
Have you gone mad?

654
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,260
Are you crazy?

655
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,930
What do we do?

656
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,300
Gosh, I'm fucked. Totally fucked. Seriously, fuck!

657
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,200
This is nuts.

658
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,880
Gosh, you crazy bastard!

659
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,700
Will you take responsibility for destroying my family?

660
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,850
I came to tell you for your sake so you can prepare in advance.

661
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,680
Hey, this won't do. Where's Woo Jin right now?

662
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,010
Why? I need to meet Woo Jin right now.

663
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,190
- Wait here for a second.
- Hey.

664
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,520
Hey-

665
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,440
Jeong Su! Geez...

666
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,960
Damn it!

667
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,650
What are you doing, asshole? Hurry up and get in!

668
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,200
Should I get on my knees?

669
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,540
Please don't do that.

670
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,510
I'm really going to kneel.

671
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,910
- H-Hey-
- No, this is between Woo Jin and me.

672
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,100
Why are you doing this to me? I'm working here.

673
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,120
What a nuisance.

674
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,510
I did have an affair and...

675
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:55,200
my lover was also having an affair.

676
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,290
What you're thinking is true.

677
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,610
Good for you.

678
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,850
I believe Se Yeon needs to know about this as well.

679
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,570
If Se Yeon finds out, she'll be scarred for life.

680
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,310
Why would you make the issue larger?

681
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,540
Why did you do it when you know so well?

682
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,220
I can't look the other way because I have a close friendship with Se Yeon, though it's short.

683
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,510
It'd be violating my philosophy of life.

684
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,200
Philosophy of life?

685
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,660
Yes.

686
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,760
Take him.

687
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,320
Why?

688
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,830
- Hey!
- What's that idiot doing?

689
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,560
Is he going to run away?

690
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,440
He came on his own to kneel, and he's suddenly running away?

691
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,190
Hey, he's coming back.

692
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,490
I just went to get my phone.

693
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,330
- What?
- Why come back? You should've just left.

694
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,860
One second. Let me catch a breath before saying important stuff.

695
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,350
What's he doing right now?

696
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,120
What's gotten into you?

697
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:11,210
Could I please be punished for my sins in the form of a fine instead?

698
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,070
- What?
- Sorry?

699
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,160
Woo Jin, please make an exception to your life philosophy just this once.

700
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,540
Instead, I'll pay for the price.

701
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,850
I'm imploring you to protect my family right now.

702
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,100
Hey, don't cross the line, okay?

703
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,200
You're really something else.

704
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,100
- Money is everything, huh?
- No, I really don't think that.

705
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,350
This is just my last resort.

706
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,110
If I miss this, I'm dead right away.

707
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,710
Don't you see how desperate I am?

708
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,530
Please save me this once.

709
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:50,420
Can't you at least hear the amount I have in mind?

710
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,790
Let's hear you out, then.

711
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,300
How much will you pay me?

712
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,430
What are you doing right now?

713
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,120
Okay, okay.

714
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,220
- Three million won?
- No.

715
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,490
- Thirty million won.
- Thirty million won?

716
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,860
It's 30 million won.

717
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,220
This is big money for me, too.

718
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,250
Let me add this in case you misunderstand.

719
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,320
I'm absolutely not saying this is the price of your philosophy of life.

720
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,560
Thirty million won is just the maximum amount I can give you right now.

721
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,320
I need to give you this much at least to be assured.

722
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,950
I know it, too.

723
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:53,320
In your eyes, I'd be nothing more than

724
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,940
a cheater and...

725
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,350
a son of a bitch.

726
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,960
I know it...

727
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,770
but I really want to protect my family.

728
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:07,130
I know it doesn't make sense.

729
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:15,480
But I really love my wife with all my heart.

730
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,610
I can give both of my eyes to Se Yeon and

731
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,860
I can give her my heart, my liver, everything I have.

732
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,250
I see.

733
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,740
I really don't want to lose Se Yeon.

734
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,630
Also, my Young Guk-

735
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,700
How could I watch her grow up under divorced parents?

736
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,790
I can make the electronic transfer right away.

737
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,550
That's why I brought my phone.

738
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,800
This money really won't cause trouble

739
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,380
b-because it's clean money, Woo Jin.

740
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,120
Jeong Su, stop it. What are you doing? I can't bear to watch you!

741
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,540
Convince her, for my sake, please!

742
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,270
Aigoo.

743
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,530
Fine. Let's do that.

744
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,640
What's gotten into you now?

745
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,070
Aigoo, thank you so much!

746
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,550
Huh?

747
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,320
Jeong Su!

748
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,470
I'm sorry.

749
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,260
By chance,

750
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,490
did you do this to me on purpose?

751
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:55,200
Since I wouldn't lend you money, did you resort to threatening me for money?

752
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,660
It's not like that. But I've got nothing to say even if you think so.

753
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,510
Good job.

754
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,030
You're supposed to make money this way, dirty and sly.

755
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,530
Since you took my dirty money, you're the same as me.

756
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,150
Don't you go around acting all nice anymore!

757
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,530
Okay, I-I understand.

758
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,650
If you're done with me, get lost and

759
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,630
let's not ever meet again.

760
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,370
I'm really sorry, Jeong Su.

761
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,180
You've taught me a big lesson today.

762
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,690
I'm really not going to trust anyone from now on.

763
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,470
Thank you!

764
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,930
Did he leave?

765
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,550
Why did you do that? That wasn't like you.

766
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,690
We need to get you another taxi, don't we?

767
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,780
How did you find out?

768
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,030
Why did you keep it a secret?

769
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,070
I'm sorry.

770
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,040
Anyhow, there's no need to feel guilty.

771
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,840
He's not even a friend.

772
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,510
He wouldn't even care if you live or die.

773
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,930
If you die, he'd come to your funeral just to act kind and give the condolence money.

774
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,330
Look into a car.

775
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,730
We need to get you your job back.

776
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,400
We own all the cars here.

777
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,050
Many of the cars are in mint condition.

778
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,950
The one you saw on the internet is over there, sir.

779
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,200
But if you find one you like better while looking around...

780
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,350
- Which is totally natural for people, right?
- Right.

781
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,460
If you do, please feel free to let me know at any time.

782
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,150
I'll be more than happy to assist you.

783
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,230
Excuse me, what's the mileage on this car?

784
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,740
Oh, my! You know your cars, don't you, ma'am?

785
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,030
This car didn't get driven much. It's got 20,000 km.

786
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,790
Is 20,000 km a lot?

787
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,080
Well, 20,000 km is more or less a new car.

788
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,930
Really? How much is it?

789
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,250
Woo Jin, this is a Grandeur.

790
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,360
Well, this is a Grandeur, so the price is a bit high.

791
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,850
Honey, this is too much. Are you sure it's okay?

792
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,080
Should I continue your consultation with this car?

793
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,940
Whoa, one moment, please.

794
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,070
Yes, please do.

795
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,330
Whoa, you're really cool, ma'am.

796
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,930

This is a Grandeur.

800
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,520
It's different.

801
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,320
Raise the volume.

802
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,230
Wow, the speaker is killing it.

803
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,850
It's not easy to maintain this position.

The position where only my butthole is barely covered.

805
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,000
But things work out somehow since we live together, right?

806
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,450
- Samuel.
- Huh?

807
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,650
We lived diligently all this time, right?

808
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,190
We did. We worked so hard.

809
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:42,380
Whatever we make goes out as interest payment, so we can't even eat properly.

810
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,750
Right, we can't even buy coffee.

811
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,260
Isn't it unfair that this is what we get for living diligently and working hard?

812
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,230
Look at us now!

813
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,760
We've got no future, to be honest.

814
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,970
No matter how hard we work, this is probably it for us until we die.

815
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,140
What's that?

816

Huh? Your blacklist?

818
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,690
I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky, but I know many people like Jeong Su.

819
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:19,280
People who aren't satisfied with what they have and keep wanting more.

820
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,680
People who even go after what they shouldn't go after?

821
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,390
Let's...

822
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,620
not live like this anymore.
