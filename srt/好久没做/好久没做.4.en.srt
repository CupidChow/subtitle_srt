181
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:10,750
Hey, what are you thinking these days?

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,550
You better get yourself together.

183
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,060
Should we just leave?

185
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,370
She'll break all our bones
if we mess with her the wrong way.

186
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,490
Don't worry. She's not the one we'll mess with.

187
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,970
What if she comes for revenge?

188
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,920
How can I help you?

189
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,600
Are you trying to apply?

190
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,960
We're still deciding.

191
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,400
Would I be able to do that, too?

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,850
Aigoo, of course. Come inside and talk.

193
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,020
Yes, we'll give it some more thought.

194
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,200
This church is a parking lot for expensive cars.

195
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,300
- I'll go ahead. Park and come inside.
- O-Okay.

196
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:34,160
He wants us to start anew.

197
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,320
Every end is a new beginning.

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,170
Some people are clumsy in putting an end, and

199
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,410
some people are clumsy on starting anew.

200
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,550
If you can't do it, you need to learn.

201
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,480
Where can you learn it, though?

202
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,100
God's people like us must find
the answer in the Bible.

203
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,890
Who is our God?

204
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,350
He's the alpha and the omega,
the beginning and the end.

205
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:08,140
You can put an end to things
and start anew when God is with you.

206
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,780
We're sure to face more hardships in the future.

207
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,600
However, we must have faith
that God is always by our side.

208
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,230
Don't give up your hope,
for God will be by our side.

209
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,300
God clearly made a promise to Jacob.

210
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,280
"For I am with you."

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,890
When God is with you, you find joy in hardship,
regardless of what happens to you.

212
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,130
She should've gone before coming in.

213
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,740
It means our lives are pieces of work that God is working on.

214
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,130
Turn your lives into the most beautiful things for God to see...

215
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,490
- Hey, come outside.
- as we strive for holiness...

216
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,460
This is stalking. You know that, right?

217
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,020
I came to pray.

218
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,920
Why did you come all the way here?

219
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,030
Didn't you miss me?

220
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,540
I didn't know I'd end up like this again because of you.

221
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,180
I should've just ignored it when you contacted me.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,180
You should've.

223
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,050
I guess I shouldn't have met you again.

224
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,980
I think my illness came back these days.

225
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,960
I can't focus on work,

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,920
I can't sleep at night,

227
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,910
and I can't really eat.

228
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,450
I thought I would fall apart and die at this rate.

229
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,480
That's why I came.

230
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,040
Me, too.

231
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,690
I also can't really eat these days.

232
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,820
I want to kiss you.

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,090
We're in church.

234
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,770
Can I hug you, then?

235
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,380
Don't leave me again. I'll do better.

236
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,890
What? What is it?

237
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,840
You can't really see them from outside.

238
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
Did you record their voice?

239
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,230
I did, but you can't really hear them.

240
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,760
Gosh, this couple's really hard.

241
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,630
- We can't secure evidence.
- Okay.

242
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,450
Let's go outside and wait, okay?

243
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,900
Okay.

244
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,220
Let's go.

245
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,450
Oh, they came out.

246
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,820
- You want a bite?
- Hey, hey.

247
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,730
Mother-in-Law.

248
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,440
Father-in-Law.

249
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,860
Husband.

250
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,810
- Peace be with you.
- How harmonious.

251
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,790
A harmonious family.

252
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,750
They're getting in the car. Follow me!

253
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,250
Looks like she lives with her parents-in-law.

254
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,870
No way.

255
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,740
It must be tough.

256
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,050
Let's go, let's go, come on!

257
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,310
No, no, no!

258
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,850
Gosh, it closed.

259
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,780
What do we do? Huh?

260
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,120
- I'll take it from here.
- Wait.

261
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,600
Hey!

262
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,560
Will you be okay?

263
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,350
Aigoo, good job.

264
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,670
Aigoo, let's go inside.

265
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,010
- Aren't you hungry?
- What are you doing? Let's go.

266
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,390
There was so much traffic.

267
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,010
Let's go eat lunch.

268
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,330
Yes.

Sure.

274
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,840

Oh, right. Darling.

- You know the thing on Saturday, right?
- Yes.

281
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,700

Why does she run a workshop when they're rich?

289
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,840
Wouldn't it be a hobby?

290
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,810
That's one expensive hobby.

291
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,820
How much would the maintenance cost?

292
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,990
They might own the building.

293
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,970
We're a couple this time.

294
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,360
Sure thing.

295
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,130
Get closer.

Yeah?

301

Aigoo.

My goodness.

303
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,910
Not all luxuries are the same, right?

304
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,470
I could really see the effort behind each one.

305
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,200
But didn't we agree to make it simple?

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,960
This is too much pressure on us.

307
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,670
This is the simplest I can make.

Hey, Sweetheart.

Aigoo, your mother must've had a tough time preparing all this.

My mother loves making these things.

313
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,060
It's not much, but it's to show our sincerity.

That's true. You're really something else, Mom.

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,740
Do you even know how much
it costs to raise a child these days?

356
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,320
It even costs more to raise one into a doctor.

357
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,630
And when it's time to marry off your child,
you're reminded of your investment.

358
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,900
Even so, you got this from Sister-in-Law.

359
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,770
It's mine anyway, so what does it matter? Goodness...

360
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,200
Hey,

361
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,880
if we send this to your in-laws,
we beat them in their game.

362
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,290
How dare you tell a person to come and go

363
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,060
with that finger of yours!

364
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,370
Want me to cut off your finger and put it in the beef belly hot pot?

365
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,820
That damn beef belly hot pot.

366
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,210
Beef belly hot pot, beef belly hot pot!

367
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,670
Beef belly hot pot, beef belly hot pot!

368
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,300
In-laws, in-laws.

369
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,040
In-Laws, get lost!

370
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,210
In-Laws, in-Laws, in-Laws, get lost!

371
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,520
- It's hard, right?
- Yes.

372
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,690
There's something I want to do.

373
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,300
What is it?

374
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,250
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

375
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,630
Hurry up and hold on!

376
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,720
- You'll die.
- Didn't you even watch "Beat"?

377
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,630
"Beat" or whatever, just hold on!

378
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,800
It's nice!

379
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,160
Is it nice?

380
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,390
Here we go!

381
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,070
How is it? Is it hitting?

382
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,880
I can't tell.

383
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,490
Don't waste that precious thing.

384
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,550
Just swallow right after you take a puff.

385
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,440
Where did you get it?

386
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,650
None of your business.

387
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,760
I went through so much to get it to make you happy.

388
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,430
This isn't a cigarette smell, right?

389
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,110
<i>Why are you so pretty?</i>

390
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,990
<i>I was always pretty.</i>

391
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,170
No, it isn't.

392
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,960
Crazy fuckers.

393
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,450
- <i>Shall we go in?</i>
- Judging by the mood, we'll get something today.

394
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,340
Get clear shots.

395
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,510
Woo Jin, I really can't photograph this couple.

396
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,560
Can you take it?

397
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,880
Why?

398
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,690
They're ladies.

399
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,090
Gosh, we've got such a gentleman here.

400
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,020
<i>- Hey, this feels a little weird.</i>
<i>- It's a little weird, right?</i>

401
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,110
<i>Let's go in now.</i>

402
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,340
<i>Hurry up and go in.</i>

403
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,080
<i>Hey, come here. Take this off now.</i>

404
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,240
<i>- Look, I'll get naked first.</i>
<i>- What the heck?</i>

405
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,280
Whoa, your abs are fucking sexy.

406
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,740
<i>Hey, spread them.</i>

407
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,530
<i>Here I go.</i>

408
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,330
<i>Spread them!</i>

409
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,420
<i>Hey, that tickles!</i>

410
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,600
<i>Whoa, this is nuts!</i>

411
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,450
<i>I'll suck you off everywhere.</i>

412
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,310
<i>So, you won't have a spot without my saliva.</i>

413
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,390
<i>How did you manage to hold back?</i>

414
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,050
<i>I thought I was going to die!</i>

415
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,280
<i>That's why I hit you up.</i>

416
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,980
<i>- You like this?</i>
<i>- Yes, it's nice to do it in a tent.</i>

417
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,910
<i>- Hold on.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

418
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,720
<i>- Hold on.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

419
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,500
<i>Shit, my phone.</i>

420
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,110
<i>Shit!</i>

421
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,750
I need to go now.

422
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,510
- Why?
- <i>M-My clothes.</i>

423
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,690
What the heck? Where are you going?

424
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,250
I'm sorry, but I have to go right now.

425
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,350
Wait, you're really leaving?

426
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,160
Yes, I've got to go.

427
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,390
Shit. Seriously, why do you always leave so suddenly like this?

428
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,650
I suddenly get called every time at this moment!

429
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,970
I'm also scared to death.

430
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,520
Hey, let me ask one thing.

431
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,990
Yes.

432
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,260
Do you really love your husband?

433
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,280
My husband? Of course I do!

434
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,690
- My husband is worth 300 million won in cash.
- Three hundred million?

435
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,100
That's what I spent on wedding favors.

436
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,140
So, how can I not love him? I have to love him.

437
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,240
Hey, if you leave like this,
you won't ever see me again.

438
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,050
I really don't know what to do, either.

439
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll have to leave for now.

440
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,800
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

441
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,240
If you leave like this, we're really over!

442
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,750
Gosh, I'm sick of this!

443
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,080
Just break up!

444
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Come on, why?

445
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,390
They broke up again?

446
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,500
Why do they keep breaking up?

447
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,980
It doesn't matter, even if they break up now.

448
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,900
We've got the evidence.

449
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,540
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

450
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,490
Gosh, you scared me!

451
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,580
Bravo!

452
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,130
You're reeking of perfume.

453
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,960
What are you doing here?

454
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,560
And you? What are you doing here?

455
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,110
I know, huh? Seriously, what am I doing here?

456
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,450
What's with the driver service?

457
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,900
Are you drunk?

458
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,690
Oh, I had a sip.

459
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,580
I only had a sip.

460
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,690
But why put on so much perfume when you're coming home?

461
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,500
Do you have a smell you want to hide or something?

462
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,180
What are you saying?

463
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,330
I always liked perfume.

464
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,330
You know it, too, right?

465
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,440
You're acting weird these days.

466
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
How so?

467
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,240
First off,

468
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,780
you come home late too often.

469
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,970
Also, you laugh a lot, very often. Yes.

470
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,820
And your face is looking lively.

471
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,290
You weren't like that- You're different right now.

472
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,060
- I am?
- Yes.

473
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,310
Let me just ask frankly.

474
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,810
What is it?

475
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
Are you cheating on me?

476
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,000
What?

477
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm asking if you've got a man.
I've got a gut feeling.

478
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,440
You've got a man, right?

479
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,270
A man?

480
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,720
A man?

481
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,070
What man? I wouldn't see a man.

482
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,720
You're really not seeing a man?

483
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,230
I'd never see a man.

484
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,260
Can you swear to God, then?

485
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,015
Can you swear on our son's life?

486
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:23,605
Yes, I swear to God and on our son's life.

487
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,160
It must be true.

488
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,520
Your eyes aren't shaky at all.

489
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,530
Of course.

490
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,180
[Pictures, blackmail, voice recordings]

491
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,470
Will this be enough?

492
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,440
"If your payment is even 1,000 won short, these same documents will be

493
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,080
- Yes.
- delivered to your in-laws and the dentist's office."

494
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,360
[At 11 p.m. on Friday, September 8th, leave 40 million won in cash in the motorcycle without a license plate in front of your lover's home.]

495
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,060
Should we try...

496
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,270
and put in some effort tonight?

497
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,400
Suddenly? Put in effort?

498
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,850
Because there's something I prepared.

499
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,360
What is it?

500
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,660
Did you buy Dom Perignon or something?

501
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,550
What Dom Perignon...

502
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,890
Dom Perignon is nothing.

503
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,740
I stole this earlier.

504
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,510
Why are you so funny?

505
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,650
Why are you eating bread in such a funny way?

506
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,060
Are you a pig?

507
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,650
Yes, I'm a pig.

508
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,430
Honey, I don't think we've laughed like this in a long time.

509
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,310
W-Wait, you were over there before.

510
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Shouldn't we do it before it wears off?

511
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,190
Do what?

512
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,380
- Sex.
- Sex-

513
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,410
Do what? Say it one more time for me.

514
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,430
Sex!

515
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,710
What is sex?

516
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,990
Want me to teach you?

517
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,500
Yes.

518
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,870
Aren't we doomed if we still can't do it in this state?

519
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,290
We were doomed a long time ago. Didn't you know?

520
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,660
- You knew?
- Y-Yes.

521
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,200
I thought you didn't know!

522
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,030
The loans, the crimes, and sex, too.

523
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,740
My life is doomed.

524
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,590
W-Wait, I need to throw up. Wait...

525
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,000
Gosh, I'm hungry.

526
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,860
- About last night-
- Let's not do it ever again.

527
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,750
Y-Yes.

528
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,290
All the documents are ready, right?

529
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,990
- Yes.
- Let's not make any mistakes.

530
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,270

W-Whoa, hey, hey, are you okay?

534
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,480
What the hell? Did you miss me?

What's this?

536
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,070

- Anyone come to mind?
- There is.

542
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,240
I do.

543
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,750
You.

544

- You're kidding, right?
- I came to check whether it was you.

546
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,900
Man, that's too much.

547
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,700
- How can you even think that?
- It's a reasonable suspicion.

548
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,300
I've done quite a number on you all this time.
And you need money, too.

549
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,610
You gave me that that day to fuck me over, right?

550
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,430
How can you say that?

551
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,650
True, like you'd say you did it even if you're the one.

552
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,640
Fuck, how can you suspect me even if you're in shock?

553
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,170
Of all people, you?

554
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,030
Whether it's you or not, let's call it quits with this.

- Samuel!
- Yeah?

We're fucked. Cho Won is after us.

585
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,940
What?

586
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,980
Why's she here?

587
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,650
Hold on tight!

588
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,290

Get in for now. Come on!

594
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,260
- Where? Go in where?
- Whoa!

595
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,860
Hello.

596
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,670
- Lean back, lean back.
- Lean back?

597
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,560
Wait, lean back? W-Who are you?

598
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,410
Hello, sir.

599
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,890
Who are you two?

600
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,070
Are you self-harming insurance frauds or something?

601
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:23,460
No, we didn't get hurt. We're fine.

602
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,650
- You didn't get hurt?
- No.

603
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,280
Aigoo, I'm glad.

604
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,480
We're not hurt, but your car's a bit damaged, sir.

605
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,980
S-So I was wondering if we could talk.

606
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,750
That's bad. That can't happen.

607
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,550
- She's coming.
- Should we get off and look?

608
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,100
- A-Ahjussi, wait-
- Should we talk at a bodyshop?

609
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,200
It was only a small scratch.

610
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,300
I'm not the owner of this car.

611
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,200
This car is my CEO's car.

612
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,930
- Who's this now?
- Sir, do you have a business card?

613
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,550
If you give me your business card, I'll fix it like it's new.

614
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,260
I don't have a business card yet.

615
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,250
Isn't it too narrowminded to think
everyone in this world has a business card?

616
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,440
- My bad.
- Do you have a pen?

617
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,770
On my hand.

618
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,840
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

619
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,210
- Thank you.
- I see you.

620
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,380
I'll open the door, so let's run together.

621
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,890
- Take care.
- Thank you, sir.

622
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,620
Hey!

623
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,030
Huh?

624
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,640
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hey! Shit!

625
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,750
These motherfuckers!

626
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,080
Huh?

627
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,080
Engine, start! Hurry!

628
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,440
Hurry!

629
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,400
Geez. Where did these fucking rats go?

630
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,900
You're fucking dead!

631
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,200
Hey!

632
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,560
Stop there!

633
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,570
- Don't come!
- Pull over!

634
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,020
Fuck!

635
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,120
Hey.

636
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,840
Don't come, don't come!

637
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,490
Hey, look in front of you!

638
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,490
Gosh, I told him to look ahead. What a fucking idiot.

639
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,070
Shit...

640
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,680
What's this? Why the fuck is it empty?

641
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,180
Damn it!

642
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,800
Shit!

643
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,540
You're dead, you fucking bitch.

644
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,920
Excuse me.

645
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,310
Are you okay?

646
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,820
Hello.

647
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,580
Hello.

648
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,710
I'm okay, sir.

649
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,130
- Y-You're...
- Let's go.

650
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,440
the one from earlier, right?

651
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,850
The bag.

652
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,010
Are you injured or what?

653
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,450
I'm sorry, sir.

654
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,760
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

655
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,300
Where is he?

656
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,050
<i>The customer is not answering the phone.</i>

657
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,300
<i>After the beep, you'll be connected to the voicemail-</i>

658
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,770
Fuck!

659
00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:39,600
What the fuck are you going to do, huh?

660
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,200
- I'll beat you up.
- What?

661
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,370
Hey, you fucking nutcase.

662
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,320
How the fuck are you this strong?

663
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,150
- It's only the beginning. Clench your teeth.
- Fuck-

664
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,500
Fuck-

665
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,640
Hold on.

666
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,020
One second.

667
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,980
Gosh, hold on for what?

668
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,110
Wait, hold on!

669
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,820
I'm really sorry-

670
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,680
Hold on-

671
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,530
One second, please-

672
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,100
It hurts too much.

673
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,730
It hurts? You need to be hurt.

674
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,600
Could you stop hitting me and talk this out?

675
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,790
- Talk?
- It hurts too much.

676
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,070
You want me to talk to you?

677
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,790
I'm really sorry.

678
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,780
I'll give back everything.

679
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,080
Please stop hitting me.

680
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,030
Okay, give it back.

681
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,320
Here.

682
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,350
It hurts.

683
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,910
Gosh, this cheeky little... shit...

684
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:21,070
Soo Ji, I caught the fuckers who blackmailed you.

685
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,630
I told you it wasn't me.

686
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,650
I got the geese back, too.

687
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,230
Don't worry now.

688
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,030
<i>Just let those people go.</i>

689
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,880
<i>And let them keep the bag, too.</i>

690
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,510
No, I'm going to kill these fuckers.

691
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,720
Do you know what's inside the bag?

692
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,330
It's 375g of gold right there.

693
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,600
It's what my dad gave my in-laws when I got married.

694
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,120
But they...

695
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,740
almost ended up at a funny place.

696
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,220
So, I just gave them to those people.

697
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,080
So, why would you give these people such a valuable thing?

698
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,390
<i>I paid for my wrongdoing for having an affair.</i>

699
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,100
And my in-laws also need to pay for their wrongdoing.

700
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,960
Just consider we're all paying for the consequences.

701
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,690
What are you saying?

702
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,600
<i>I'm sorry for suspecting you.</i>

703
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm also sorry for giving you a hard time.

704
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,430
No, I can't...

705
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,650
I can't break up with you.

706
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,260
Cho Won.

707
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,060

Yes. Will my husband be okay?

736

He lost a lot of blood, so we were worried.

737
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,150
But his CT scan came back normal.

738
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,720
It's a light concussion.

Welcome.

After trading gold for 40 years,
my eyes are the scale. I can tell this is 375g.

375g?

747
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,920
375g of gold would be...

748
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,600
about 28 million won...

749
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,660
in the current market price.

750

- No.

It's in great condition.

If I add the bag...

754
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,820
it'd be at least 40 million won.

755
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,200

The price of gold is going up a lot right now.
