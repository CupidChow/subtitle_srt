00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,480
so great for skincare, too.

178
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
All right.

179
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,780
You should have some, too, Honey.

180
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,130
Try eating these forever.

181
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,680
A shot* will do the job.
(Referring to botox shots)

182
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,660
Why don't you make a report about providing stones for Daeyang Corporation?

183
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,210
- Oh, that's-
- If you've got time to make these wraps,

184
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,910
make sure to report promptly.

185
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,160
Bring all the receipts, too.

186
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,580
Yes.

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,650
Get closer to him! Get closer!

188
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,600
Stop rushing me. I'm already getting closer right now.

189
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Give me your hand.

190
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,170
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

191
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,830
Her jaws are dislocated.

192
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,440
She's hiking when her jaws are dislocated.

193
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,790
Her stamina is crazy.

194
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,770
That's why they go around eating eels.

195
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,550
Anyhow, the bill for eels came out a lot.

196
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,870
Did I eat them because I wanted to?

197
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,840
They don't sell single portions, so I had to eat two portions.

198
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,420
They're looking over here.

199
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,920
- Act like we're a couple.
- We're originally a couple.

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,460
Rosy, Mommy's here.

201
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,220
What did you say?

202
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,680
She's asking...

203
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,960
why you didn't come for a while.

204
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,920
My jaws were dislocated, so I couldn't come.

205
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,090
My dear Rosy, I miss you.

206
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,260
I also miss you, Mommy.

207
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,980
Don't worry about me here and

208
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,350
take good care of your jaws.

209
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,340
That's what she said.

210
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,610
Rosy, Mommy will come more often now

211
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,310
with ahjussi.

212
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,870
Please be careful.

213
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,720
All right, hang in there now.

214
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,440
Hey, follow me.

215
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,280
Rosy, Rosy?

216
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,620
Is it a dog's name?

217
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,280
[R.I.P. Rosy, 12/22/2009]
Rosy?

218
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,520
<i>They must be going on the freeway.</i>

219
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,770
<i>Wait, I shouldn't be exiting here.</i>

220
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,520
<i>Shit.</i>

221
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,620
How far are they going to go?

222
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,460
The ocean is too much.

223
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,840
- Be careful now.
- Yes.

224
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,550
Is that a guitar?

225
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,690
Okay!

226
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,110
- This is nuts.
- Hello.

227
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,350
They're on a boat.

228
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,330
Excuse me, where do the boats go from here?

229
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,930
Over there.

230
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,940
What's over there?

231
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,930
Oh, that place is a lodge.

232
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,490
A lodge?

233
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,670
A lodge?

234
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,160
Oh, those things floating on water are lodges?

235
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,880
That's right.

236
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,030
Hello!

237
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,990
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

238
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,560
Hello!

239
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,040
They ignored me...

240
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,530
What are those people doing?

241
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,670
Whoa! Hey.

242
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,870
Did you come to fish?

243
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,260
This is part of the job, okay?

244
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm pretending to be fishing right now.

245
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,600
It's here! It's here again!

246
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,940
Whoa, is it a rockfish?

247
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,000
- Is it a rockfish?
- What a nutjob.

248
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,430
I can hear you, okay?

249
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,670
W-Whoa.

250
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,760
Whoa, it's so strong!

251
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,450
Whoa.

252
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,630
Gosh, it's so fun.

253
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,770
Wow, your skills are...

254
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,670
Noonim, what can't you do, seriously?

255
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,930
Here.

256
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,620
Here you go. Have a bite.

257
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,090
Here. You, too.

258
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,430
All right.

259
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,080
By the way, Noonim,

260
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,280
your jaws are taking a while to heal.

261
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,470
Gosh, when will I get a chance for another learning session?

262
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,010
I think it'll be possible.

263
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,980
My, you don't need to overextend yourself.

264
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,400
They've got a good vibe going.

265
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,420
I think they're going to do it tonight.

266
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,010
They came this far. They'll do it, right?

267
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,360
Please.

268
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,030
Get to it.

269
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,700
Hey, they're going inside.

270
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,910
- Going in.
- Go in.

271
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,080
- Go in, go in.
- Go!

272
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,570
They went in!

273
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,760
It's set.

274
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
I think we'll have to cross over, too.

275
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,050
How will we go there?

276
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,460
One of us will have to cross the water, right?

277
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,980
Go! Keep going!

278
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,770
Huh?

279
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,630
Baek Ho?

280
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,970
Yes, Noona.

281
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,780
Baek Ho.

282
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,880
Skip the honorifics.

283
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,220
Okay.

284
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,590
All right.

285
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,700
Try slapping my butt.

286
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,150
What?

287
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,120
You watched YouTube again, Noona.

288
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,900
One more time.

289
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,630
Noona, you like this?

290
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,310
- Whoa!
- Huh?

291
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,550
Why is the window open?

292
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,550
Go that way!

293
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,370
Hand...

294
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,160
The towel! Where's the towel?

295
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,110
The picture! I got the pictures!

296
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,380
Good job.

297
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,720
Are you okay?

298
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,640
You're going to catch a cold.

299
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,860
You're skipping honorifics, huh?

300
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,660
Is our partnership mode off?

301
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,170
Yes.

302
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,030
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,400
I was too vicious with you.

304
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,860
No, I'm sorry. I was being too...

305
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,610
petty with you.

306
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,900
You're cold, right?

307
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,650
I should've bought soju at the mart that ripped us off earlier.

308
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,290
We have soju.

309
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,410
How do we have soju?

310
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,860
Soju?

311
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,750
Right here.

312
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,930
I stole Baek Ho's at the other lodge over there.

313
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,020
Why are you so cool these days?

314
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,300
Soju is the best when you're cold.

315
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,150
Should we try what you wanted to do last time?

316
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,450
What?

317
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,040
Putting in effort.

318
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,020
Complimenting each other?

319
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,810
The one where we have sex with words.

320
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,760
Should we try it out?

321
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,220
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

322
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,790
How are you supposed to do it?

323
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,990
You just need to do it like you're doing phone sex.

324
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,870
We did it when we were dating.

325
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,710
We did.

326
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,380
Shall we try? Are you down?

327
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,270
Of course.

328
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,920
Let's go.

329
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,490
Ring, ring.

330
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,670
Ring, ring.

331
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,790
Hello?

332
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,610
Oh, hello.

333
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,360
Hello.

334
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,050
Hi, could you tell me your name and where you live?

335
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,500
My name is Jin, and I'm on water.

336
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,840
Ms. Jin who is on water, nice to meet you.

337
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,230
A-Are you alone right now?

338
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,920
Yes, I'm alone in the room right now.

339
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,280
Oh, you're alone in the room. I'm alone, too.

340
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm alone in a freight truck right now.

341
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,140
You're alone, too.

342
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,110
Do you mind telling me what you're wearing right now?

343
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,020
Shorts and a tank top.

344
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,500
Shorts and a tank top?

345
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,680
That's sexy.

346
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,550
Shorts and a tank top are sexy?

347
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,650
Yes.

348
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,620
You've got quite a taste.

349
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,210
Are you wet right now, by chance?

350
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,100
My entire body got wet today.

351
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,540
From my head to toe, it's all slippery.

352
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm also moist.

353
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Where are you moist?

354
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,840
Why do you ask when you know?

355
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,160
You have such a nice voice that I started dripping as soon as I heard you.

356
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,650
Could you spread your legs, please?

357
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,220
My legs?

358
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,690
Yes.

359
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,350
I'll start sucking your ear now.

360
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,270
You made me spread my legs but sucking my ear?

361
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,030
O-Oh, I didn't explain this to you.

362
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:43,460
I like to start sucking from the top and move my way down.

363
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,630
Okay, you can start.

364
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,650
I'll start now, then.

365
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,500

366
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,660
Your neck.

367
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,990
Your breasts.

368
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,620
Lick, lick.

369
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,000
Going lower.

370
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,020
Going lower.

371
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Take off your pants, please.

372
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,620
- Suddenly?
- I want to suck, too.

373
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,610
I only like the lower half.

374
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,140
But I'm not wearing pants today. I'm actually...

375
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,740
not wearing anything right now. I'm butt-naked.

376
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,510
You're quite the seductive man.

377
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,890
Oh, my. You're standing hard.

378
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,870
Since when was it hard like this?

379
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,410
When you said, "hello."

380
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,010
I see.

381
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,350
I'll suck now.

382
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,430
You were for real.

383
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,050
How do you kiss again?

384
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,260
Let's work at it.

385
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,710
We really did it.

386
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,810
Is it alcohol?

387
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,880
Can't say no completely.

388
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,640
It's not easy to make money.

389
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,290
Yes.

390
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,250
I think we spent 500,000 won on this business trip alone.

391
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,340
We spent a lot.

392
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,940
It's fine. We just need to make that much more.

393
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,900
We secured the evidence, too. Let's get to it now.

394
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,110
How much should I ask from each person?

395
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,740
How's 10 million won each, so 20 million won total?

396
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,030
When will we save 100 million won at that rate?

397
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,980
We have to make at least 50 million won per job from now on.

398
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,900
Fifty million- 50 million is too much, isn't it?

399
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,300
Not at all. It's not much if they split it.

400
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,940
But the woman didn't seem to have much money.

401
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,720
Then, to make it fair, Young Ae can pay 20 million won, and Baek Ho can pay 30 million won.

402
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,070
So a total of 50 million won. How is that?

403
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,660
Okay, okay.

404
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,560
Sounds good.

405
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,420

Who should I send it to first?

412
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,980
Okay, Young Ae can come first to Rosy's grave.

413
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,620

Why can't you?

428
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,250
We skipped it, so I never got to try.

536
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,340

537
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,510

but one text from me, and your life is fucked, okay?

546

547
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,870
My fist is diamond, you scum!

548
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,030
Your life must also be pretty twisted to be doing something like this.

549
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,680
My wife didn't hire you?

550
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,650
No, she didn't.

551

Do you have a wife?

552
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,940
No.

553
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,980
I don't.

554
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,260
How old are you?

555
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,110
I don't think I can tell you because that's my private information.

557

Let me see that.

558
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,380
I'm a person who keeps promises.

559
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,610
I can give you the money you demanded.

560
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,790
Oh, really? T-Thank you.

561
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,360
However, as I told you before, the process will be a little complicated.

562
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,770
For me to give you the money you want, I have to use my company's funds.

563
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,060
So, sign a contract with me.

564
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,410
What contract-

565
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,390
There's no need to complicate this matter, but what else can we do?

566
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,050
This business was started with my father-in-law's money and

567
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,180
my wife still does all the bookkeeping herself.

568
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,990
That's why we need a contract.

569
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,340
So, w-what kind of a contract are you talking about?

570
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,050
I saw you were pretty good at taking pictures.

571
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,540
- I am?
- When I look at your pictures,

572
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,340
we're beautiful.

574
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,290
So, let's have you take some pictures of my stones.

575
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,010
I'll exhibit some of the pictures you'll take on my homepage.

576
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:51,480
I will also make a calendar to give out to my wife's church and clients.

577
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,220
S-Sir, thank you for the compliment, but for me to sign a contract,

578
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,750
I have to expose all of my personal information, don't I?

579
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,050
Do you still not trust me?

580
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,150
Well, I can trust you-

581
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,660
I'm also going to be emptied and kicked out if they find out I cheated.

582
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,790
I'd be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

583
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,860
It's good for you and me, so isn't this a good contract?

584

What? Whoa!

591
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,880
My man, even if photography is done at the asking price, 50 million won is too much!

592
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,320
N-No, I can't. You'll also be in trouble if I go back with that money.

595
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,740

You're the third most famous photographer in Korea starting today.

602
