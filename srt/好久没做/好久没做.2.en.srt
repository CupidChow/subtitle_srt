A regular room is 40,000 won, and a suite is 50,000 won.

353
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,620
We'll take the suite.

354
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,790
Sure.

355
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,440
Are you asleep?

356
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,660
No.

357
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,520
Why did you ask for hourly booking earlier?

358
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,370
I said it out of habit.

359
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,870
We always booked by the hour when we went to motels.

360
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,790
That was ages ago, huh?

361
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,200
You liked suites, so we always booked suites.

362
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,290
You remember all that.

363
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,610
I have a good memory.

364
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,690
It's been a while since we slept under the same blanket, right?

365
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,080
What the heck?

366
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,670
It's been a while.

367
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,000
Gosh.

368
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,060
By any chance, is this...

369
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,260
What?

370
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,410
a signal?

371
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,810
A signal?

372
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,200
Sex?

373
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,980
I just hugged you because it's been a while since we hugged.

374
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,380
Oh, a free hug?

375
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,970
Do you want to do it now?

376
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,670
Not really.

377
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,240
But we're not doing our duty as a married couple,

378
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,170
so I feel like we should.

379
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,740
It's only sex if we do it when we want to.

380
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,050
Don't you think we'll never have sex again at this rate?

381
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
You think so?

382
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,380
Actually, I also think doing it with you will feel like doing it with my brother.

383
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,370
But shouldn't we still try our best?

384
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,310
We're a married couple, after all.

385
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,450
What does "trying" entail?

386
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,940
Should we close our eyes and have you penetrate me?

387
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,950
That's called mating. Animals do that.

388
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,240
Even cows don't do it like that these days.

389
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,300
I think they gather as a group and rut during mating season.

390
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,340
Can't people rut?

391
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,070
I heard somewhere that telling each other

392
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,170
what they like about each other...

393
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,070
can be helpful. Should we give it a try?

394
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,830
You think that's going to make us horny?

395
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,210
Well, we can just give it a try.

396
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,670
Giving an effort.

397
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,300
Fine.

398
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,380
Shall we start?

399
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,860
Yeah.

400
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,480
Me, first?

401
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,750
Oh, I like your fingers.

402
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,590
Your thick fingers.

403
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,910
Fingers like these are probably better than most penises.

404
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,660
Thank you.

405
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,970
I think...

406
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,210
you have exceptional leadership.

407
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:47,650
You have quick judgment, great determination, and willpower.

408
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,730
You're an admiral material. A natural.

409
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,710
- Thank you.
- Sure.

410
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,520
Oh, I like your double eyelids.

411
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,570
They're natural. Free.

412
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,800
They're completely free.

413
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,990
I think you're unexpectedly

414
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,980
on the loyal side.

415
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,020
You stay by my side when I have a hard time and cheer me on.

416
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,860
You unexpectedly have a good personality, but people just don't realize it.

417
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,580
Unexpectedly?

418
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,320
What else is there?

419
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,380
This is pretty great.

420
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,490
Right?

421
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,590
Yeah, I'm sleepy.

422
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,220
What do you call it?

423
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,570
It's like A.S.M.R.

424
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,940
Exactly.

425
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,020
Should we try something else next time? Something more stimulating.

426
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,970
Like having sex with words.

427
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,960
Having sex with words?

428
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,910
Should we try it?

429
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,080
Let's sleep.

430
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,610
We need to leave at 4 a.m. and stand by.

431
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,670
Let's sleep.

432
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,310
- I'm turning off the lights.
- Okay.

433
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,940
This job is great. We get to stick together.

434
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,530
It's been a long time since we've been together this long since we got married, hasn't it?

435
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,480
How nice.

436
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,120
By the way, about that asshole prosecutor.

437
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,310
I guess people like us can't touch the hair on the heads of people in high places like him.

438
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,370
He did seem pretty particular.

439
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,180
But we got both of these people's addresses and family photos in a day.

440
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,470
We can easily harass them if we set our minds to it.

441
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,800
Isn't that infuriating?

442
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,920
Now that you mention it, it is.

443
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,940
It's probably that easy to harass us if someone sets their mind to it, too.

444
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,030
Since we're easy pickings.

445
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,870
Probably.

446
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,010
The light turned on!

447
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,480
He must be awake.

448
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,370
He woke up early.

449
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,500
[NS Savings Bank]

450
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,150
We're prioritizing female clients.

451
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,360
Why would you prioritize females for a loan?

452
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Since females don't serve in the military, there's less chance of them running away.

453
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,120
And statistically, their repayment rate is higher.

454
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,790
The interest rate may vary depending on your existing loans and credit score.

455
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,970
You can expect it to be up to 24% per year.

456
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,800
24%?

457
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,550
Isn't that too high?

458
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,240
Is it?

459
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,210
Shall we take a selfie?

460
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,580
Okay, that's enough.

461
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,280
Wow, the interest rate here is ruthless.

462
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,370
It's 24%.

463
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,840
The legal maximum interest rate.

464
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,710
Everyone here looks young.

465
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,150
They must not know how scary interest rates are.

466
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,680
You think they don't know?

467
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,280
They're all in the same situation as us.

468
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,420
They'll end up like us soon.

469
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,490
There must be a lot of office affairs.

470
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,220
Exactly. I took a photo of everyone just in case.

471
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,770
Good job.

472
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,690
What time is their lunchtime?

473
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,830
Probably at noon.

474
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,120
Yeah? Let's see what they do during lunch.

475
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,640
Okay.

476
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,100
Where did they disappear to?

477
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,380
This is where we parked after them.

478
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,320
Where did we park again?

479
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,910
- There?
- Over there?

480
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,510
Oh, this must be their hangout.

481
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,170
This is where I dropped off Ga Young last time, too.

482
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,020
Their car...

483
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,490
Our car.

484
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,220
Their car?

485
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,420
Let's go. Let's go.

486
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,490
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

487
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,750
I was ravenous. I feel better now.

488
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,040
- Is it good?
- Both are fucking great.

489
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,110
I'm going crazy, too.

490
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,960
Did you want to get eaten by me?

491
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,440
Yeah, if I could get eaten by you, I can do anything except get a divorce.

492
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,940
What? Huh?

493
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,850
Hurry up and come. We have 10 minutes left.

494
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,310
Okay.

495
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,090
I'll get on top.

496
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,220
Curse for me!

497
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,200
You motherfucker!

498
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
Oh, you son of a bitch!

499
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,660
More, more! Keep it going!

500
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,130
You horny son of a bitch!

501
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,300
Why do you live like that?

502
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,240
- What?
- You piece of shit!

503
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,890
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit!

504
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,790
- You son of a bitch!
- Yes, I'm a son of a bitch!

505
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,800
You motherfucker!

506
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,750
They stopped.

507
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,480
Why did they stop?

508
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
- Why are you back?
- He came.

509
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
The guy came.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,310
- He came?
- I think they'll come out soon.

511
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,020
Really? Does that make sense?

512
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,020
How could they eat and come in under 20 minutes?

513
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,390
I mean, isn't that enough time?

514
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,900
What are you talking about?

515
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,080
I heard somewhere that...

516
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,350
it takes about seven minutes for an average man to come.

517
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,770
Seven minutes?

518
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,440
Yeah, that's what I heard.

519
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,370
All this trouble for just seven minutes?

520
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,590
I want to cry. Shit...

521
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,550
Oh, they came out.

522
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,490
We got something.

523
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,850
I think this pretty much covers it.

524
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,820
Okay. Car sex, check.

525
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,760
- Clear out.
- Clearing out.

526
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,170
Okay.

527
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,280
On Friday at 12:40 p.m.,

528
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,190
leave 20 million won in cash inside the fire hydrant

529
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,700
in the rooftop parking lot you use as your master bedroom

530
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,100
and disappear.

531
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,330
Or else, we'll expose your adulterous affair.

532
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:24,250

00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,380
Exactly seven million?

708
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,090
This is cool, though. We really earned money by doing this.

709
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,350
- Is that all to the letter?
- No, there's more.

710
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,160
"I sincerely beg of you.

711
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,740
I want to protect my family. Please help me.

712
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:13,810
Can you just think that someone with too much love
made a mistake because I couldn't contain it?"

713
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,480
Why did he get caught spreading that love?

714
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,400
"If you turn a blind eye this once,
I'll live quietly all my life in repentance.

715
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,780
I don't know who you are, but I didn't call the police.

716
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,900
I hope you can get this money

717
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,240
and relieve some of your anger.

718
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,610
I'm in your hands."

719
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,600
No, my anger can't be relieved.

720
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,520
We asked for 15 million won.

721
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,220
And that was being considerate.

722
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,310
In the end, this person loved his family only to that extent.

723
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,700
A love worth exactly seven million won.
What an irresponsible bastard.

724
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,500
A bastard like him should learn his lesson, huh?

725
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,720
That stings.

726
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,250
Oh, that stings.

727
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,700
Enough.

728
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,860
Father, I didn't want to ask you,

729
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,160
but where did you get your eyebrows done?

730
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
Why?

731
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,810
Do I look a little dumb?

732
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,590
- Not at all.
- No, you don't.

733
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,400
It really suits you. Right?

734
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,770
Father, did you get them done in Seoul for your 70th birthday?

735
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,680
Yeah, that's right.

736
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,450
These eyebrows are expensive.

737
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,640
Our Samuel did a good job.

738
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,220
Father's 70th birthday feast is quite luxurious.

739
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,860
Where's Woo Jin?

740
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,880
Long time no see!

741
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,170
Sorry, the youngest one is late.

742
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,430
- Shalom.
<i>- Shalom!</i>

743
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,740
It's been a while since meeting my sisters-in-law,
so I couldn't come empty-handed.

744
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,420
Some rice cakes for Father.

745
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,420
And I prepared some skincare products...

746
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,150
- You shouldn't have!
- to lavish my sister-in laws' skin.

747
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,640
You even prepared ours? Aigoo!

748
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,300
Whoa!

749
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,560
What in the world...

750
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,860
We couldn't do much for you all this time.

751
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,650
Let us catch up big time today.

752
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,860
For Father.

753
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,750
Give some to Father.

754
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:34,240
This is delicious.

755
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,480
Father, this is called Shui Jing Fang.

756
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,620
It's high-quality alcohol.

757
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,700
What the? It's 399,000 won!

758
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,060
- Are you crazy?
- It's Father's 70th birthday.

759
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Good job.

760
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,600
Shui Jung Fang?

761
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,790
I get to drink this after 20 years.

762
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,010
I think it was when my father-in-law was my age.

763
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:05,610
I decided to be generous and took him to travel to China.

764
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:12,360
The alcohol I bought my father-in-law was Shui Jing Fang.

765
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,670
But now...

766
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,590
he's gone.

767
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,090
And his daughter's gone, too.

768
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,970
Come on, it's a happy day today.

769
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,660
Yeah.

770
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,100
Gosh, that's nice...

771
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,730
Have some more.

772
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,890
- Sure.
- Easy, easy.

773
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,970
How did you know about this place?

774
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,750
You don't even have money.

775
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,320
Well, somehow.

776
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,980
Woo Jeong!

777
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,080
What the heck?

778
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,930
What's up?

779
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,010
What is this? Money?

780
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,380
What else? It's the money for our genius's lesson fee.

781
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,040
Hey, it's really money!

782
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,460
What the heck?

783
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,900
Let's teach Sung Ji, no matter what.

784
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,610
There wasn't a genius like her in our entire family.

785
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,900
We need to take responsibility and teach our genius.

786
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,810
You guys are penniless, too, though.

787
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:46,720
My daughter is important, but my sister is important, too.

788
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,950
Samuel found work again.

789
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,600
Really? That's great!

790
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,780
So just accept it.

791
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,270
I shouldn't take this,

792
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,260
but I will.

793
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,530
Sorry, Woo Jin.

794
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,690
I'll put it to good use!

795
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,140
Hey!
