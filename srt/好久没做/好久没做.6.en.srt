(The First Night)

4
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:34,922
Woo Jin.

5
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,301
Woo Jin. It's me, Samuel.

6
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:48,852
You're late.

7
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:50,730
The food has gone cold.

8
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,650
I'm sorry. I came in a hurry...

9
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,771
as soon as I got your call.

10
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:56,031
Weren't you home?

11
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:57,781
You dressed up.

12
00:01:02,572 --> 00:01:03,582
Please take this first.

13
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:10,042
Your place is very nice.

14
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:11,792
I cleaned up.

15
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:19,972
Woo Jin.

16
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:21,390
Yes?

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,802
Would it be okay for me...

18
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,891
to hold your hand?

19
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,722
Why would you ask me that?

20
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:28,481
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

21
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,522
Just hold my hand. It's nothing. Here.

22
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,321
From now on, you don't need to ask.

23
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,871
You can jump me mindlessly.

24
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,201
I don't want to be mindless with you.

25
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,671
Woo Jin, how do you say such things...

26
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:53,131
so naturally?

27
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,421
Why? Does it make me unattractive?

28
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,382
No, I like it. It's just that I'm bad at it.

29
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,721
Samuel, have you always been timid?

30
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:01,972
I'm not timid.

31
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:06,562
People tell me that I'm careful.

32
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:11,980
You aren't frustrated with me, are you?

33
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,062
I love it.

34
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,271
People who are opposites make a good pair.

35
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,192
That means...

36
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:19,941
we're the perfect pair.

37
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:20,942
Yes.

38
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:28,122
Woo Jin.

39
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,122
Would it be okay for me to kiss...

(3 Years of Marriage)

41
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,141
I don't know what's wrong with me.

42
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:54,771
I can't come.

43
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,731
Shall we stop?

44
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:08,622
I don't know what's wrong with me.

45
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,461
Is it because of the medicine for hair loss?

46
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:19,342
Don't try so hard.

47
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,342
Should I stop taking the medicine for hair loss?

48
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,051
No. Hair is important to you.

49
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,842
Don't worry about it.

50
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,222
While it's important...

51
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,652
Let's think of it as the weather.

52
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:41,611
Some days are sunny while other days are cloudy.

53
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:47,782
Thanks.

54
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,542
Can we have sex today?

55
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:00,042
If you want to have sex, just jump me.

56
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,592
I just wanted to ask if you had the urge.

57
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,261
If you jump me and suck on my skin,

58
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,392
the sexual urge will come.

59
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:12,512
Is that so?

60
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:14,522
Today,

61
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,561
I'll jump you.

62
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm a bit tired today.

63
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,191
I go to work in the morning tomorrow.

64
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,202
Is that so?

65
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,662
Let's sleep.

66
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,712
I'm not tired right now.

67
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,251
Do you want to go to bed first?

68
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,631
What are you going to do?

69
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,462
I'm going to use the computer and go to bed when I'm tired.

70
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:47,931
Sure.

71
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,092
Good night.

72
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,861
- What? - What are you doing?

73
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,652
Nothing.

74
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:09,071
- I'm going to open the door. - Okay.

75
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,792
What do you think?

76
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,171
- Did you buy lingerie? - Yes, I did.

77
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,592
It's pretty.

78
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,592
It's about time...

79
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,051
the weather turns sunny.

80
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:31,762
Right.

81
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,102
Let's make an effort.

82
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,931
- Come to the bedroom. - Okay.

83
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,491
Be honest.

84
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,912
You don't see me as a woman anymore, do you?

85
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,371
It isn't like that.

86
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,962
You're still cool and sexy.

87
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,381
It's my fault.

88
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:10,762
Your mouth and body say two different things.

89
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,801
I don't know what to believe, to be honest.

90
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:20,772
I'm the one who's frustrated, okay?

91
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:25,652
You aren't the only one who's frustrated.

92
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,902
I bought something like this because I was frustrated.

93
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,571
Don't you know how hard it is to do something I'm not used to?

94
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,662
Putting this on and knocking on your door...

95
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,201
was hard for me.

96
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:38,332
Do you know how hard it is to have a problem getting it up?

97
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,751
It's because of my medicine.

98
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,412
Can't you be understanding and wait for me?

99
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:44,832
Must you push me?

100
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,712
Until when do I need to be understanding?

101
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,301
Let's just get a divorce.

102
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,512
How could you say it so easily?

103
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,181
You shouldn't have said that.

104
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,272
You like spending time alone, right?

105
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:03,352
Spend time alone all you want.

Gosh.

123
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,941
What's that backpack? I haven't seen it before.

124
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:01,571
Haven't you seen it before?

125
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,571
What?

126
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,201
Where have you been?

127
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,331
Work.

128
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,292
Work? Isn't it your day off?

129
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:18,581
Not that work.

130
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,211
The work we used to do.

131
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,341
Didn't we agree to take a break from that work?

132
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,721
- We did. - Okay.

133
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,471
But some pushover showed up in front of me.

134
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,931
You were working on your own?

135
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,101
Why do all that on your own?

136
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:43,652
Because I was worried about you.

137
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,152
- Who is it this time? - It's...

138
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:50,282

139
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,492
A taxi driver?

140
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:54,081
You got money off a taxi driver?

141
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,752
No. The girl he was having an affair with.

142
00:12:58,162 --> 00:12:59,792
The driver didn't have much money.

143
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,382
I see. Did the lady have some money?

144
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,921
- What does she do? - Who knows?

145
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,921
She's a crazy wench for being in an affair.

146
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,762
Oh, right.

147
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,801
There was something interesting.

148
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,101
What is it?

149
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,482
They live in the same building as us.

150
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:19,811
The same building as us?

151
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,232
Yes.

152
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,482
Isn't it surprising?

153
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:28,951
Our building?

154
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:33,161
The girl's husband seems to be a researcher in Pohang...

155
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,912
and visits home in the weekends.

156
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,292
The girl looked pretty.

157
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,792
But she must've felt very lonely.

158
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,461
Why would she leave her competent husband...

159
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,091
and have an affair with a taxi driver?

160
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,011
What are you doing right now?

161
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,340
I'm just honestly answering your questions.

162
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:52,931
So are you saying that taxi driver...

163
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:57,721
is me?

164
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,232
Yes.

165
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,691
To you have evidence?

166
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,061
There won't be anything you could use as evidence.

167
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,652
I do.

168
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:09,112
They went into the same house together.

169
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:11,782
Isn't that enough to prove things?

170
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,742
The tailing for this case was too easy.

171
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:17,831
I didn't need to break a sweat...

172
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,671
because it was our next-door neighbor, you jerk!

173
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:24,580
This won't do.

174
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,882
You need some mental counseling.

175
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,090
You followed me around?

176
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,132
On top of that,

177
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:32,551
you threatened someone innocent?

178
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:34,892
Who do you think you are?

179
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:38,101
You've got it all wrong.

180
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:39,601
You've made a big mistake.

181
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,061
You are the one who made a big mistake.

182
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:43,851
Are you curious?

183
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,982
Are you curious if this bag has money in it?

184
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,402
I'm curious too.

185
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,032
I haven't checked yet.

186
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,032
But if this bag is filled with money,

187
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,200
what do we do?

188
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,320
Have you not thought about...

189
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,080
talking to me before doing all this?

190
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,201
Do you really think I haven't?

191
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:00,912
But your answer felt so predictable.

192
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:06,381
We can open it together and see what's inside.

193
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,460
I can assure you. There's no money inside this bag.

194
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:09,801
There was nothing between us.

195
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,220
Poor you. You won't make any money.

196
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,012
You're someone who's crazy for money.

197
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,590
You've gone through all that to spy on your neighbor.

198
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:18,012
- Poor you. - Okay.

199
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,101
Let's open it.

200
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,372
I see money.

201
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,252
And it's a lot of money.

202
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,170
There's money in it? Darn it.

203
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,050
There's money in it for a good reason.

204
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,261
What did you say to her...

205
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:55,631
for her to give you money?

206
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:56,931
What else would I say?

207
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,101
I used the exact same threats we used for this job.

208
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:01,392
You're...

209
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,191
evil.

210
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:07,941
Do you know that?

211
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:11,732
I do.

212
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,992
I made this money. Get your hands off.

213
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,152
Gosh!

214
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,581
Gosh!

215
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,841
You want to take things to the end, don't you?

216
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,131
Fine.

217
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,341
Can we go anywhere beyond this?

218
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,382
What right do you have to treat me like this?

219
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,392
- Why do you look so confident? - What are you talking about?

220
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:43,891
Even being on your knees won't be enough.

221
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,522
I saw everything that day!

222
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,022
It was two years ago.

223
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,022
The day you left home.

224
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:58,202
You don't see me as a woman anymore, do you?

225
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,991
I'm the one who's frustrated, okay?

226
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,451
- What about me? - Can't you be understanding...

227
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,201
- and wait for me? - Until when do I need to do that?

228
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:04,621
Let's just get a divorce.

229
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,042
You like spending time alone, right?

230
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:08,962
Spend time alone all you want.

231
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,120
The receiver cannot be reached. Please leave a message...

232
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,121
(Ms. Woo Jung A)

233
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:28,831
(Kim Sae Ro Mi)

234
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:32,871
(Running Responsible Jun)

235
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,341
(Lee Yul Do)

236
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:39,051
(Dog)

237
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:44,841
(Call)

238
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,472
You must be crazy.

239
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:50,851
(Dog)

240
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,492
(Dog)

241
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:10,161
Hey there, long time no see.

242
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:12,411
Were you checking my profile?

243
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,672
That's nonsense.

244
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,381
But how did you know I was in Seoul?

245
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,212
What a joke.

246
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,591
I called you by mistake.

247
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,051
Let's have some fun together.

248
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,522
Hey, come to Grand Suite Room 1069.

249
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:32,522
Let's meet up.

250
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:34,482
The night view is amazing here.

251
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:36,482
You're still the same, aren't you?

252
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:40,321
Why would I go there?

253
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:42,692
Forget it.

254
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:46,282
There happens to be a Dom Perignon here.

255
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:50,371
No matter how crazy I am, I won't go to you.

256
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,121
You're just a piece of trash.

257
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,571
I'm done watching the night view. I'll get going now.

258
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,161
It's going to rain soon.

259
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:29,032
Stay a little longer.

260
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,661
I'm going to head back before it rains.

261
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,621
The night view here is even better with the rain.

262
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:37,042
You know that.

263
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,712
What are you staring at?

264
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:43,922
Don't look so pretty, you crazy wench.

265
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,091
I look awful right now.

266
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,631
I don't have any makeup on.

267
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:49,512
You really don't know yourself.

268
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,682
You look amazing without any makeup, you wench.

269
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:54,022
Stop cursing, you crazy jerk.

270
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:58,851
You feel great hearing me curse, don't you?

271
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,232
You insane piece of trash.

272
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:02,982
Get lost, you jerk!

273
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,611
That was so sexy.

274
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:12,161
Why aren't there any girls who can curse like you?

275
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:14,870
Idiot.

276
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:17,542
I missed hearing you curse too.

277
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:25,551
I know you missed me too.

278
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:27,881
No?

279
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,841
A dog would stop pooping to hear that.

280
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:31,932
I'm married.

281
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,012
Don't you dare think about messing with me.

282
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,182
You're married. I'm married.

283
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,811
That's what I call fair play.

284
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:40,810
I'm not a piece of trash like you.

285
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:41,901
As if.

286
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,861
You're just like me.

287
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:47,031
You're a cute girl who can't lie and acts all tough.

288
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:48,032
Gosh.

289
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,032
Be honest.

290
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,991
You feel frustrated because the world doesn't know...

291
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:55,331
how cute you are after getting married, don't you?

292
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:02,831
What? Why are you crying?

293
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:16,141
Is the married life that tough on you?

294
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:20,982
Being married is like that.

295
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:24,361
Do you get how tough it is for me now?

296
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:26,901
You're just a piece of trash.

297
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:29,070
Fine. I'm just a jerk.

298
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,952
- Don't cry. - Get off me.

299
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,202
I'm the jerk.

300
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:36,202
But a lot people lean and cry on jerks like me.

301
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,792
You can do the same. Cry all you want on me.

302
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,581
Stop.

303
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,831
- Stop. - Stay still.

304
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:48,422
You know how honest I am, don't you?

305
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:52,551
I have an erection.

306
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:56,851
You crazy jerk.

307
00:22:58,682 --> 00:22:59,932
In the midst of all this?

308
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,481
Yes.

309
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:03,061
Do you still want to sleep with me?

310
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:04,442
Yes.

311
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:07,482
Hey, look.

312
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:09,070
- Here. - What's wrong with you?

313
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:11,531
Check. You feel it, right?

314
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:13,742
Darn it. Is sex all you think about?

315
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:15,242
You filthy animal.

316
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,411
You're the one looking all sexy.

317
00:23:19,202 --> 00:23:20,452
Why are you putting the blame on me?

318
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:47,901
Don't get the wrong idea.

319
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:50,821
I have no feelings for you.

320
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,371
Have all you want, you bad wench.

321
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,331
Yes. I'm a bad wench.

322
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,081
And you're an animal.

323
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,462
Yes. I'm an animal.

324
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,411
I saw everything that night.

325
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,131
I followed you because I got worried.

326
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,341
The hotel looked very nice.

327
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:01,222
In front of that hotel,

328
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:04,811
I thought about all sorts of things.

329
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,432
"Should I follow inside?"

330
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:12,022
"Wouldn't it be better if I just turn a blind eye?"

331
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:15,821
Why didn't you just follow me in?

332
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,952
I waited for about an hour, and you came out.

333
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:25,661
Who were you with...

334
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,371
that day?

335
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,512
I just went to see a friend.

336
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,851
You went to a hotel to see a friend?

337
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,732
Did you sleep with the friend?

338
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:03,492
If I tell you honestly, will you tell me too?

339
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,081
Yes.

340
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:20,131
It was just that one time.

341
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,841
You slept with that jerk you call a friend, didn't you?

342
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:26,932
Who is it?

343
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:29,772
Jung Ki Seok.

344
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,232
Your ex?

345
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:35,151
But I swear. It was just once, and there were no feelings attached.

346
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,192
How can you sleep with anyone when you don't have feelings?

347
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:40,110
How is that possible? Are you an animal?

348
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:41,992
I'm in the wrong. It's all my fault.

349
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:44,781
I'm regretting it too. I won't make excuses.

350
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:47,032
Just make excuses! Why wouldn't you?

351
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:49,661
You have to make excuses all night, and that won't be enough.

352
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:52,621
I'm sorry. I'm in the wrong.

353
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,841
Do you realize what you have done?

354
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:03,472
It's your turn now. Be honest with me.

355
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:05,471
There's nothing for me to say.

356
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:07,511
Be honest with me! I was too!

357
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:10,272
What do you want to know? Whether I slept with her or not?

358
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,100
I didn't sleep with her.

359
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,482
That doesn't make any sense.

360
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:18,320
You were with her in her place, and nothing happened?

361
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:19,982
No, nothing happened.

362
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:22,532
We...

363
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,361
"We?"

364
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:28,161
I see. It's "we" now?

365
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:31,952
We're cleaning mates. We only cleaned together.

366
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,171
"Clean?"

367
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:36,461
We were both serious about cleaning,

368
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:38,672
so we helped each other when we did clean-ups. That's all.

369
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,672
We didn't do anything.

370
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,131
She came to our house too?

371
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,182
Yes.

372
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,782
You're one crazy jerk!

373
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:14,542
She must've seen my cosmetics, clothes, and even my underwear!

374
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:19,081
Did she touch my blanket? Tell me.

375
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,631
We helped each other clean, so...

376
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:25,380
You're one big back-stabber, aren't you?

377
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:28,432
I didn't tell you on purpose in case you'd get the wrong idea.

378
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:30,932
But all we did was cleaning. I swear.

379
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,060
If you only helped each other clean,

380
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,182
then why did she put in so much money?

381
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:35,481
Are you really going to hide like a coward until the end?

382
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:38,271
What do you mean I'm hiding? I'm telling you all the facts.

383
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,650
Then what did you do for 30 minutes...

384
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,192
when you went to her house last time?

385
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,732
Did you clean with her that late at night?

386
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:50,411
That night, she wasn't feeling well.

387
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:54,410
So I brought her medicine...

388
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:56,292
and watched her until she fell asleep. That's all.

389
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,830
I could do that much for her. It's not like she's a stranger.

390
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:02,041
Who brings medicine and puts your neighbor to sleep...

391
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,091
just because she's sick?

392
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:08,131
You loved her, didn't you? Answer me!

393
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,682
Did you love her?

394
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,012
Yes, I liked her.

395
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:18,561
To be honest, I needed someone to talk to.

396
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:21,061
You don't listen.

397
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,401
But she listened to me.

398
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,992
After seeing her,

399
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:30,360
I realized how lonely I had been...

400
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,621
thanks to her.

401
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:35,702
You were lonely? Didn't you have too many debts to feel lonely?

402
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:37,580
While you were bumming around...

403
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:39,211
after you irresponsibly quit your job...

404
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:42,131
and your business went bust, I worked day and night...

405
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,002
to protect our family.

406
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,171
That's why I had no time to feel lonely!

407
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:48,471
So you were the only one who worked hard to protect our family.

408
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:50,472
And I did nothing, right?

409
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:53,601
Do you know how uneasy you make others feel?

410
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:56,141
Why do you think I couldn't get my dong up?

411
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:58,182
Use your brain to think, will you?

412
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,890
Who would want to sleep with someone...

413
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:01,942
who continuously humiliates others?

414
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,111
How would anyone get their dong up?

415
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:08,571
Fine. That's why I slept with Jung Ki Seok.

416
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:11,570
No matter how much I humiliate and curse at him,

417
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,070
he gets horny whenever he sees me.

418
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:16,452
Right. I also got horny whenever I saw Min Soo.

419
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:20,212
You're finally telling the truth.

420
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:22,251
You were horny?

421
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:24,252
Yes, I was horny.

422
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,090
With you, I get anxious and restless...

423
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:30,971
because your mood changes every ten minutes.

424
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:33,641
I felt like I'd get angina.

425
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:35,641
But after meeting someone so considerate...

426
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,682
who cares about how I feel,

427
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:41,191
I felt so stable that I got horny.

428
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:42,851
But at least I didn't play dirty with her...

429
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:45,311
like you did.

430
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:48,401
Is that so? You were so darn pure?

431
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:51,492
Have you masturbated with her in mind or not?

432
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:56,371
Seeing how you can't answer, you must have.

433
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:58,241
You're so darn pure and clean, aren't you?

434
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,871
What about you? How many times did you do it with Jung Ki Seok?

435
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:02,120
Did you even use condoms?

436
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,292
That's enough.

437
00:31:04,081 --> 00:31:06,751
At least I didn't develop feelings with him like you did...

438
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,301
and act like a tragic character in a soap opera.

439
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:12,091
You couldn't even ask me about it for the two years, and what?

440
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:13,801
Did I even use condoms?

441
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,681
No, I didn't. Darn it! So what?

442
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:17,850
You're filthy.

443
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:19,432
You're even filthier.

444
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:21,390
You act all sweet outside, but on the inside,

445
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,890
you think of someone else's wife...

446
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:24,141
and masturbate.

447
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:27,111
You were with me physically, but your heart was with her.

448
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:28,981
That's even more deceiving.

449
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:30,071
"Deceiving?"

450
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:33,321
You must not know what that word means.

451
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:34,911
What's deceiving...

452
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:38,282
is to sleep with anyone whenever you feel horny!

453
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:41,252
Why didn't you just sleep with her?

454
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,121
I'd find that more understanding.

455
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,752
Oh, you couldn't get it up even with that woman next door.

456
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,711
That must be why you couldn't do it.

457
00:31:49,712 --> 00:31:52,131
If you could get it up, you'd have done it already.

458
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,561
What are you doing? What's gotten into you?

459
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:02,311
You think I can't get my dong up?

460
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:06,151
I'll show you. Watch.

461
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,361
- Have you lost your mind? - Yes, I have.

462
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:11,610
Gosh, talking with an animal turns me into an animal.

463
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:14,281
I guess it was a good thing to go crazy. Darn it. Look.

464
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,531
Are you showing off that you have a dong?

465
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:19,320
Move. Look. I'll show you how my dong gets up.

466
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:20,660
You like dongs. Look.

467
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:21,951
- Stop it. - It's up, isn't it?

468
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,501
- Don't touch me. - Stop it!

469
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:24,711
Don't you touch me.

470
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:28,130
Hey. Do you like it? Look! It's up! Look.

471
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:30,291
Darn it, it's finally up! Is it okay if I touch it?

472
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:33,762
I got it up in front of you! I'm a beast, aren't I?

473
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:38,641
What was that?

474
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:42,811
A rock?

475
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:46,811
Hey. Someone threw a rock at our house.

476
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,192
Darn it. You're being so low.

477
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:52,860
How could you take that in this situation?

478
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:54,781
I'm trying to make up for the trouble you caused.

479
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,991
It's my money! Don't touch it!

480
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:59,281
This isn't your money! It's Min Soo's!

481
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:00,951
It's money from an adulteress, so it's mine!

482
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,791
She didn't cheat on her husband, so we must return it to her!

483
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,370
Whose side are you on? Let go!

484
00:33:06,371 --> 00:33:07,501
- Let go! - Let go!

485
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,172
- Let go! - Let go!

486
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:13,841
Darn you.

487
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:19,261
Darn you.

488
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:23,011
Don't do it. Stop it!

489
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:26,350
Stop! Darn it! Do you think...

490
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:29,600
I don't get mad because I don't feel angry?

491
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:33,401
Why do you make a kind man like me burst out in anger?

492
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:36,741
Good job doing the laundry. Make sure to dry and fold them.

493
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:40,451
Am I your dog? You fold them!

494
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,282
Do you even know how to fold them?

495
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:44,992
Hit me.

496
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,160
- Move. - Hit me. Just hit me.

497
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,502
Stop it. Gosh.

498
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:51,962
- Don't do this. - Hit me.

499
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:53,212
Stop it!

500
00:33:53,792 --> 00:33:55,712
Stop it. Hey!

501
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:57,761
- Hey. Don't come near. - Let go of me.

502
00:33:57,762 --> 00:33:59,632
- Let go. - Don't come near.

503
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:02,511
Darn it.

504
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,061
- Gosh. - Oh, no!

505
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:09,942
Darn it!

506
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:17,442
Darn it.

507
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:31,712
That darn little jerk...

508
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:39,261
Hey! Where are you going?

509
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:59,152
Turn on the hazard lights and pull over to the side!

510
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,241
I've always listened to you.

511
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:06,121
But I won't from today. Darn it!

512
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,200
It's so exciting because I don't have to listen to you.

513
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,001
You'd better pull over.

514
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:11,542
No. I won't.

515
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,542
You'll regret it!

516
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:16,342
I won't.

517
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:25,221
Darn it. Make way!

518
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:29,721
Darn it.

519
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,442
Here I go.

520
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,152
Darn it.

521
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:07,302
Open it.

522
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:10,511
Darn it.

523
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:12,811
What?

524
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:14,101
"What?"

525
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,351
What?

526
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:30,281
Hey!

527
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:33,792
Hey!

528
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,621
I opened it. Stop it. What a lunatic.

529
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:47,132
That little...

530
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:49,681
Hey!

531
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:53,391
Give that to me.

532
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,560
Darn it.

533
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,522
Let go. I'm going to kick you.

534
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:02,021
Let go. I'll kick you.

535
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,022
Hey!

536
00:37:22,962 --> 00:37:24,132
She's gone insane.

537
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:29,092
This is money, your favorite. Pull yourself together!

538
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:31,140
It feels great to go insane, like you said!

539
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:33,100
You've always been crazy. You can't be any crazier than this!

540
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,810
- Let go. - Please stop.

541
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:36,431
- Let go. - Stop!

542
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:37,640
Hurry up.

543
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:38,942
Stop it!

544
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,732
If I can't have it,

545
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,241
no one else can have it either!

546

(7 months later)

547
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:17,781
Isn't this apartment very clean, considering how old it is?

548
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,121
Well, it is cleaner than I thought,

549
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:21,911
but it is an old apartment.

550
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:25,381
It's no big deal because you can renovate it.

551
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:28,001
I can put you in touch with a company...

552
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,212
that will give you a good rate.

553
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:32,220
Do you happen to know who lived here in the past?

554
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:35,181
The owners lived here.

555
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:39,391
A newlywed couple, just like you!

556
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,692
They were such a loving couple.

557
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:45,902
They moved to a better place because great things happened to them.

558
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,571
This place must bring good luck to those who live here.

559
00:39:48,572 --> 00:39:51,321
Great things happened to everyone...

560
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,031
who lived here in the past.

561
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,530
We'll sign the agreement.

562
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,701
Really?

563
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:03,292
My gosh, they finally found the right tenants.

564
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,671
Then I'll contact the owners...

565
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,002
and set up an appointment right away.

566
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:11,341
For two years... My gosh.

567
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,970
You made the right decision.

568
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:15,431

569
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:17,971
Excuse me.

570
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:20,511
Do you know if the people who lived here have moved?

571
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:22,431
Yes, I think so.

572
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:25,232
This couple here will move in soon.

573
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:27,772
- Who are you? - Hey, don't.

574
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:31,402
I'm a courier.

575
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:34,402
- Gosh. - My goodness.

576
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:38,201
- Are you all right? - Yes.

577
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:40,451
- He's a courier. - I see.

The ones that used to order bottled water in bulk.

582
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:56,680
- Unit 609? - Yes, they've moved.

583
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,720
That's good news.

584
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,430
Every time I walk by that unit, my arms hurt.

585
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:03,140
You got injured because of them. When I think about it,

586
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:04,181
I still get so angry.

587
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,391
I'm in a good mood today.

588
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,731
How about we go for those giant pork cutlets? It's been too long.

589

00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,302
sleeping in your car when you can sleep at Dad's place?

610
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,632
It's ridiculous.

to pick up smoking after age 40?

I'm not nagging him. I'm just saying these things out of concern.

You're doing it out of concern, but it's still considered nagging.

Just leave him be.

626
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:17,581
That's not love.

627
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:21,591
I have to say, people these days don't know what love really is.

- It's not freedom. - That's right.

631
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:30,680
Love is all about restraining them, tying them down,

632
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,522
- and obsessing over them. - That's right.

633
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:36,022

It's about...

667
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,172
I'm going to start talking.

668
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:08,132
But just keep eating.

669
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:10,802
Don't look at me.

670
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:14,221

How have you been?

673
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:43,411
I told you not to look up.

674
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:50,252
You haven't changed one bit.

675
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:52,672
You still do as I say.

676
00:47:58,261 --> 00:47:59,681
I haven't been doing that great.

677
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:04,061
It was hard.

678
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:08,982
That apartment was the only thing we had left...

679
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:11,942
after our divorce.

680
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:18,451
It feels weird that even the apartment will no longer be ours.

Lately,

682
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:27,292
I've been thinking a lot about the time when we bought the apartment.

683
00:48:30,092 --> 00:48:32,962
We bravely took out that huge loan...

684
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:37,721
and were so happy about becoming homeowners.

685
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:41,931
I've been thinking...

686
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:47,692
I mean, we were so happy together.

687
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:51,191
I've been doing a lot of thinking to figure out...

688
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:52,362
how we ended up like this.

689
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:56,741
And I've concluded...

690
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:05,792
that I should really let you go now.

691
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:12,132
Yes, I've made up my mind to do that.

692
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:15,552
And I've realized...

693
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:22,811
that there was something I must do before I can let you go.

694
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:26,061
I want to do it now.

695
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:38,652
I'm sorry, Samuel.

696
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:46,081
It's all my fault that we ended up like this.

697
00:49:51,212 --> 00:49:53,462
I think having me by your side...

698
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:56,132
was enough to satisfy you,

699
00:49:57,592 --> 00:49:59,681
whereas I expected too much from you...

700
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:02,092
because I took you...

701
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,761
for granted.

702
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:09,391
I...

703
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:18,072
I feel like...

704
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,661
I ruined you when you were so kind and bright.

705
00:50:27,752 --> 00:50:28,911
I'm so sorry.

00:51:37,272 --> 00:51:38,652
No.

713
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,991
You checked in too many times this month, so no.

714

00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:24,362
you've been upgraded to a suite room.

726
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:27,280
- Oh, my gosh. She's insane. - Goodness.

727
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:28,700
What? You saw that, right?

728
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:30,411
Woo Jin is good. She knows how it's done.

729
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:32,292
Woo Jin, I love you.

730
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:36,542
Thanks to you, I'll spend a sweet end of the year with my Tweetie.

731
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:38,462
Have a good night, sir.

732
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:39,711
Woo Jin.

733
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:41,342
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

734
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:44,922
- Tweetie. - Stop calling me that.

735
00:52:46,052 --> 00:52:47,391
- These are so pretty. - I know, right?

736
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:54,101
Checking out.

737
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,141
Yes, thank you.

738
00:53:00,482 --> 00:53:01,522
Are you busy?

739
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:03,572
Should we just go?

740
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:13,621
Merry Christmas.

741
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:18,712
I am going to try taking a trip this Christmas.

742
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:21,092
The place I'm going to is...

743
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:24,132
none other than my own room.

744
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:29,220
We can take trips no matter where we are.

745
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:33,510
Yes, we may think we know everything about our own rooms,

746
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,681
but I think that's a misconception.

747
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:41,060
Even in a small room, there are many parts...

748
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:42,572
(Ms. Woo Jung A)

749
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:48,571
Hello?

750
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:51,240
Hey, divorced lady. What are you doing on Christmas?

751
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,701
I'm with my friends.

752
00:53:52,911 --> 00:53:54,951
Don't make me laugh. You don't have any friends.

753
00:53:55,241 --> 00:53:56,581
Stop talking nonsense and come to my house.

754
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,911
The kids say they want to blow out the candles with you.

755
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:00,461
Sung Ji, do you want to talk to Auntie?

756
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:03,172
Can't you hear me? I said I was with my friends.

757
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:06,342
Are you really? You're not going to mope around, are you?

758
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:08,132
No.

759
00:54:08,471 --> 00:54:10,971
- I'm hanging up. Bye. - Hey, wait.

760
00:54:22,862 --> 00:54:23,902
Who is it?

761
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:27,491
Woo Jin. It's me, Samuel.

762
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:53,761
Seriously, you...

763
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,311
What are you doing here during the holiday season?

764
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,561
And what are you doing home alone during the holiday season?

765
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:04,772
Haven't you found a man?

766
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,072
Are you curious about that?

767
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:15,991
I don't think I'm obligated to tell you such private things.

768
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:18,621
You don't anymore.

769
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,302
The strawberries are good.

770
00:55:34,552 --> 00:55:36,351
Yes, there was a good harvest this year.

771
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:39,011
How about your family? Are they all doing well?

772
00:55:39,272 --> 00:55:42,022
Yes, they're all doing fine. Is your sister doing well?

773
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,272
Yes.

774
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:46,982
Don't you want some wine?

775
00:55:47,902 --> 00:55:49,281
Gosh, no.

776
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:53,362
There's some beer in the fridge.

777
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,491
No, I drove here.

778
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:58,871
Okay.

779
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,542
Never mind. Let's drink. I'll drink.

780
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:04,331
Let's drink.

781
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:14,802
Back when you lived alone,

782
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:17,302
you called me to an apartment like this.

783
00:56:18,802 --> 00:56:21,351
- Do you remember? - Oh, I remember.

784
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:24,811
You used to practically live at my apartment.

785
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:26,061
I did.

786
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,612
We were so cute back then.

787
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,192
Right.

788
00:56:39,871 --> 00:56:41,121
How about this house?

789
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:43,661
Hasn't anyone been here?

790
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:47,252
Why on earth are you curious about that stuff?

791
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,712
Well, of course I'm curious.

792
00:56:50,632 --> 00:56:51,922
You're my ex-wife.

793
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:55,971
Do you want me to tell you?

794
00:56:57,721 --> 00:56:59,181
Well... I guess someone was here, then?

795
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:04,141
No, no one has been here.

796
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:08,402
Why didn't you try meeting some people?

797
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:16,362
Oh, remember that prosecutor we gave up on catching?

798
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:17,780
- The hostess bar guy? - The guy with the mole here.

799
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:18,910
Shui Jing Fang, the Chinese restaurant?

800
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:19,991
- Yes. - Yes?

801
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:22,451
That guy came to have an affair with another woman earlier.

802
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:25,502
I thought of you a bit.

803
00:57:30,752 --> 00:57:32,712
Gosh, that darned prosecutor.

804
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:50,772
Go ahead.

805
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:34,822
Why are you doing this? Are you drunk?

806
00:58:37,942 --> 00:58:38,942
Right. Sorry.

807
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:25,871
We're divorced.

808
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,371
We can still have sex.

809
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:29,792
That's true.
