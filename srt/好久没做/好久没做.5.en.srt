182
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,207
The horsepower?

183
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,897
This is...

184
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:44,807
Well...

185
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,777
I'm asking because I'm curious,

186
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:51,117
but may I ask why you keep asking about the horsepower?

187
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:53,577
Well, can't I?

188
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,807
Aren't cars about horsepower?

189
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,137
Well, yes, cars are about horsepower, but

190
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:03,617
people usually don't ask about horsepower
at a rental car company.

191
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,477
It looks like it has plenty of power.

192
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,647
You can outrace almost any car with this, right?

193
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,877
Yes, ma'am. Well, pretty much all cars.
It's quite powerful.

194
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,217
You have a good eye for cars.

195
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,837
I'll change to this car.

196
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,707
[Seoul - Vacant]

197
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,437
What do you mean, no?

198
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,237
You see.

199
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:13,307
It is nice.

200
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,607
Am I unappealing if I don't have that? Let's go for it.

201
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,937
- No, don't you ever buy an imported car.
- Am I unappealing if I don't?

202
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,227
I said no!

203
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,277
Gosh, it's fun.

204
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,427
Should I buy a car?

205
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,547
A car.

206
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,807
It's nice if you have a car.

207
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,317
I...

208
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:40,597
thought about buying a car if I got a girlfriend.

209
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:43,127
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

210
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,517
Do you think you will need a car soon?

211
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,267
I don't know. I'm not sure yet. Well...

212
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,627
Should I buy one or not?

213
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,347
That's up to you. You do what you want.

214
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:11,937
Woo Jin, what was your ex-boyfriend like?

215
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:17,117
He was just an ordinary guy who cheated on me often.

216
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:23,637
Woo Jin, I sincerely...

217
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:26,307
want to help you heal

218
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,927
from all your past wounds.

219
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:32,387
I mean it.

220
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,177
Can I really trust you?

221
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:38,427
Yeah.

222
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:40,527
You can.

223
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,887
Think about it carefully before you answer me.

224
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,277
I actually tend to get hurt quite easily.

225
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:48,297
I am answering you after thinking about it carefully.

226
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:55,207
Can I trust you, too?

227
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,387
Yeah.

228
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:02,307
Then from now, let's be honest with each other.

229
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,837
- If our feelings have changed, let's just say so.
- Okay.

230
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:08,277
Then, as long as those words aren't spoken,

231
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,227
we can both be at ease.

232
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:14,647
Sounds good. I'll tell you everything!
All of it, whatever it may be.

233
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,377
I'm going to buy a car, then.

234
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:18,667
Nice.

235
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:23,067
- Let's get in the taxi.
- Oh, it came?

236
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,807
I'll get in first.

237
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:55,477
Could you take off your jacket for me? It's cold.

238
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:56,997
You're cold?

239
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,157
Cover yourself so you're warm.

240
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:09,737
Let's use it together.

241
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:11,237
Together?

242
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,737
Customer, customer.

243
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:32,537
We're here. Please get up. We're here.

244
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:39,787
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

245
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:32,977
Yeah?

246
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:34,157
<i>Are you busy?</i>

247
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,847
What?

248
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,597
I'm working.

249
00:25:37,597 --> 00:25:38,917
How late are you going to work?

250
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,237
<i>Well...</i>

251
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,837
I'll work for another two hours.

252
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:46,537
Don't pick up annoying customers.

253
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,607
That's not something I can control.

254
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,297
Make sure to eat something.

255
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:54,297
Okay. Are you at the hotel right now?

256
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:56,037
Yeah, it's a bit busy.

257
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,867
We're both working hard, I see.

258
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,377
<i>Good luck.</i>

259
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,337
Ma'am.

260
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:24,897
Ma'am?

261
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:27,657
I'm Officer Park Hyung Jin of Songpa Police.

262
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:30,427
You can't park here. Please move your vehicle.

263
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,867
Can I move it a bit later? I have an urgent emergency.

264
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,987
You can't. Please move your vehicle.

265
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:41,017
I'll move it in 10 minutes, so just give me a ticket.

266
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,107
I was going to let you off with a warning,
but if that is what you want...

267
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,797
Yeah, just give me the ticket.

268
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:49,787
I will penalize you for illegal parking
on September 27th at 21:10.

269
00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:51,497
Do you agree to this?

270
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,257
Yes, I agree.

271
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,577
Ma'am, you have to move your car right away.

272
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:58,657
Okay. Have a nice day.

273
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:08,117
<i>Wow, it's been a long time since I heard this song.</i>

274
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:10,537

[1 year ago]

276
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,327
Excuse me...

277
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,777
Excuse me.

278
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,927
Sorry?

279
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,997
Yes?

280
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:21,057
The thing is, I'm all out of wheel cleaner.

281
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:26,467
I'm really sorry, but could I just pay you
a small fee and borrow it for a moment?

282
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,767
Oh, yes, I do have a wheel cleaner.

283
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:32,667
How much should I pay you to borrow it?

284
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,507
Gosh, no. Just use it and return it to me when you leave.

285
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,907
Oh, no, no. Then I'd feel too bad.

286
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:43,697
It's okay. I totally understand how this
can happen as someone washing their car.

287
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:47,827
You're so generous.

288
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,517
All right.

289
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,527
I'll help you.

290
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:09,037
Oh, no, no. It's all right.

291
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,277
Let's go.

292
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,577
Well, gosh, it's really all right...

293
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,527
Oh, thank you.

294
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:29,247
Joon Ho started crying and said he would quit.

295
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,887
- Yeah.
- He doesn't know how valuable his job is.

296
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,587
I know, right?

297
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:36,227
In any case, I gave him a scolding.

298
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,767
Oh, hello.

299
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:17,797
I was just grateful for letting me borrow this last time.

300
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:18,907
You didn't have to...

301
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,237
It was a two-for-one sale.

302
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,267
Please take it. I should repay you for your kindness.

303
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,917
Thank you, I'll use it well.

304
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,727
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:35,017
By chance, do you like beer?

306
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,377
Pardon?

307
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,317
Hello!

308
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:42,843
- I brought this for you.
- Again?

309
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,647
It's nothing.

310
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,967
Just sharing things as neighbors.

311
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:52,387
It would be rude to keep saying no when you
keep offering. So I'll gratefully accept it.

312
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,497
Gosh, I should give you something, too...

313
00:30:57,777 --> 00:31:01,047
If it's okay with you, would you like to come inside for a moment?

314
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,157
Will that be all right?

315
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:23,317
Wow, how do you cut watermelon like this?

316
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,817
You're so good.

317
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:28,817
Aigoo, I just tried to copy what a blogger did.

318
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:33,197
My husband only eats fruit when it's cut for him.

319
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:36,177
My wife only eats fruit when it's cut for her, too.

320
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:38,367
Please eat.

321
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,167
I really like watermelon,

322
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:48,067
but I'm home by myself mostly
because we are a weekend couple.

323
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,977
So, a whole watermelon is too much for me.

324
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,267
Oh, you're a weekend couple, I see.

325
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:54,967
I really like watermelon, too,
but since it's just the two of us,

326
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,357
we don't really buy a watermelon.

327
00:31:57,357 --> 00:31:59,477
I get to eat it, thanks to you.

328
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,282
What is your name? We're neighbors, after all.

329
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:07,807
Oh, me? I am...

330
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:08,846
Min Soo.

331
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:11,671
Oh, it's Min Soo, I see. I am Samuel.

332
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:14,071
- Muel, I see.
- Yes.

333
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:27,517
There's no bad smell in your house, Muel.

334
00:32:27,517 --> 00:32:29,817
It's so strange. You live right next door.

335
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:33,037
It drives me crazy because a foul odor
comes up from the drain in my house.

336
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:38,737
I did a lot of research because our building is old and has a foul odor.

337
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:40,787
So, I think I found a solution.

338
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,457
Oh, really?

339
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:43,597
How?

340
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,017
Gosh, this is...

341
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:48,257
it's a bit hard to explain with words.

342
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:53,257
Should I go and fix it for you?
It'll only take a moment.

343
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:57,597
I think it's because the odor prevention cap is loose on the hose.

344
00:32:57,597 --> 00:33:00,557
If you tighten this...

345
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,737
tighten it well...

346
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,467
there should be less odor.

347
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,567
By the way, your house is so clean.

348
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:18,157
I noticed that your bathroom was really clean, too.
Do you have a cleaning tip?

349
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:20,117
Oh, right...

350
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,397
What if...

351
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:26,927
we help each other with cleaning?

352
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:29,727
We can share tips and information

353
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:32,757
and go to your house one week, and my house another week.

354
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:38,337
If we take turns like this to help each other,
it would be less of a burden for both of us.

355
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,547
Cleaning mates...

356
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:48,157

- Let me see your foot.
- I bought these yesterday, though.

I should see your face and talk if I want to
get to the inseminating point. It's all good.

00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:55,617
Okay. Then, should I prepare your medicine?
