worried his dad might lose his job.

33
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,810
Exactly.

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,310

They said that being born this way...

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,450
made us at fault.

39

You over there.

40
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,939

Even though we didn't technically do anything wrong,

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,789
we were told to take responsibility.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,099

Are you here to see me off?

47
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,949
And here I thought I had no friends in this school.

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,689
We were both accepted through the equal education project.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,759

who told the Anti-Bullying Committee.

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,840
Why didn't you say otherwise?

55
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,590
Would anything have changed if I said...

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,250
it was someone else?

57
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,159
I'll get going, then.

58
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,280
I submitted more than enough evidence,

59
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,590

but the incidents weren't all that severe.

63

185
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,090
for improper use...

186
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,049
can be punished with expulsion.

187
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,389
Read Article 37 of the Disciplinary Act.

188
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,460
And you also committed fraud...

189
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
by tutoring a student after lying about attending Hanguk University.

190
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:49,399
Do you have any idea how many phone calls...

191
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,500
the family has been placing...

192
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
to this school and the Education Office?

193
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,039
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,649
Once it's proved you also stole from them,

195
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,379
you'll be expelled anyway.

196
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,419
So beg for their apology or leniency...

197
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,519
Hold on.

198
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,620
I stole from them?

199
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,690
The family has photos as proof, so stop denying it.

200
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,299
How can there be proof when it isn't true?

201
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,500
Unbelievable.

202
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,929
Could Na Yeon have...

203
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
- I can't believe it. - Same here.

204
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,509
She threw her conscience out the door.

205
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,179
- How shameless. - I told you it wasn't true.

206
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,220
How could we not buy it...

207
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,320
when she lied without batting an eye?

208
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,990
- Exactly. - Unbelievable.

209
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,259
With acting skills like that,

210
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,960
there won't be anything she can't do.

211
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,759
- Unbelievable. - I can't believe it.

212
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,899
- Look. - She has some audacity.

213
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,600
- Is she actually here? - No way.

214
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,509
- I can't believe it. - How can she come to school?

215
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,940
- How shameless. - How can one lie like that?

216
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,179
- Unbelievable. - Can you believe it?

217
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,990
Exposing Kim Hye In, the fake rich kid on social media.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,070
At the latest brunch party,

219
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,169
they talked about couples engaged as kids.

220
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,769
Even those who date and marry end up divorced in ten years,

221
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,179
so they had doubts about arranged marriages lasting.

222
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,210
Is that so?

223
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:45,850
They were obviously talking about you and me!

224
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,090
You know, the second daughter of J Distributions's CEO.

225
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,320
She acts all innocent...

226
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,519
but rubs you in all the wrong places!

227
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,440
The second daughter of J Distributions's CEO?

228
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,470
Yes, I know her.

229
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,769
What are you up to?

230
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,440
- Are you looking at other girls? - No, it's not that. Babe, look.

231
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,210
She goes to our school, but I don't recognize her face.

232
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,190
Judging by her photos,

233
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,549
she can't be a nobody.

234
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
- Right? - Yes.

235
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,090
But the fact that we don't recognize her...

236
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,490
means she's from an insignificant family.

237
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,799
Or maybe this is a lie.

238
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,559
What?

239
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,399
Either way, Baek Je Na would have a field day with it.

240
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,710
She loathes the underprivileged...

241
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,210
that run wild while taking advantage of our school.

242
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,639
I don't loathe them. They just appal me.

243
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,250
Those who are truly privileged don't bother to show off.

244
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,350
Give me the phone.

245
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,549
Let me see her sick face.

246
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,500
What is it? Do you recognize her?

247
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,740
(Kim Hye In)

248
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,380
It was just flipped to inactive.

249
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,250
What the heck?

250
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,279
(What a joke.)

251
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,819
(Unbelievable.)

252
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,490
Switching your account to be inactive...

253
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,950
doesn't erase what was done.

254
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,160
She dressed up in another's house in someone else's clothes...

255
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,490
pretending to be well off.

256
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,089
The gold spoon she had turned out to be fake.

257
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,029
I'd drop out of school from the humiliation alone.

258
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,660
Rather than dropping out,

259
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,960
she should transfer to Cheongdam International High.

260
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,329
That's hilarious.

261
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,839
To think that she talked about transferring to the school...

262
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,640
while trying on a school uniform she stole.

263
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,650
(You're a fake.)

264
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,500
I bet you think it's over.

265
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
My mom's going to press charges...

266
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,900
against Lee Sun Ju who lent you her student ID card.

267
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,170
Try paying the settlement with all that you have,

268
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,809
you penniless fraud.

269
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,150
Unbelievable.

270
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,119
Before you leave,

271
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,019
you should at least apologize to us.

272
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,289
Apologize?

273
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,700
I committed a mortal sin...

274
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,539
by pretending to be rich when I'm the opposite.

275
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,440
How's that?

276
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,369
(School Director Seo Hee Soo)

277
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,779
Someone's here to see me?

278
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,609
Send in whoever it is for now.

279
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:16,089
I apologize for the commotion I caused...

280
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,160
during your admissions interviews.

281
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,730
Isn't that all in the past, though?

282
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,200
Also, you're apologizing to the wrong person.

283
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,829
It should've been made out to Kang Na Yeon and her family.

284
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,200
Well,

285
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,640
Kang Na Yeon...

286
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,309
I'm apologizing so that you can reconsider her admission.

287
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,180
Even if I apologize to them,

288
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,720
they wouldn't show me leniency...

289
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,779
if Na Yeon doesn't get into the school.

290
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,890
That tells me the apology...

291
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,589
isn't coming from the heart.

292
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,660
Well...

293
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,730
I admit what I did was wrong,

294
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,500
but I have good grades.

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,470
I get all As, and my school record is clean.

296
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,869
Something must've come over me.

297
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,309
I've been a good girl up until now.

298
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,849
Getting expelled from school, being wrongfully accused as a thief,

299
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,210
and having someone innocent...

300
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,579
get sued because of me?

301
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,490
I believe the punishment is too dire.

302
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,990
If you let her punish me like that, you will be making...

303
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,730
my already-miserable life worse.

304
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,900
So please,

305
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,970
could you...

306
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,410
consider this as a way of saving a poor kid...

307
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,180
and cut me some slack?

308
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,950
For someone who gets good grades,

309
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,079
you sure are foolish.

310
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
Sorry?

311
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,950
What good would it do...

312
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,259
to save an unfortunate student?

313
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,160
Honour? Money?

314
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,859
If I give in to your tears...

315
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,930
and allow Kang Na Yeon to attend this school,

316
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,970
I guess...

317
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,910
that'll net us tens of thousands of dollars.

318
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,839
But if you're smart,

319
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,480
you should be calculative.

320
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,650
If I turn a blind eye...

321
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,079
to the hideous incident witnessed by dozens of parents...

322
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,319
just to earn some chump change,

323
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,759
who would want to send their children...

324
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,460
to our school?

325
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,559
- But... - Consider this as a life lesson.

326
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,230
Nothing you or anybody does should change the outcome.

327
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:45,940
Actually,

328
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,869
the outcome should be unchangeable.

329
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,480
That's what gives it its value.

330
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,920
But still, you...

331
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,690
Mr. Lee, please escort this student out.

332
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,299
I'll leave even if you grab me.

333
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,569
I just need to use the restroom.

334
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,609
You have to return your visitor's pass at the gatehouse...

335
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,410
if you want your student ID back.

336
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,039
This is it.

337
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,109
This hits the spot.

338
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,890
How is this a life lesson?

339
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:12,720
My pathetic life.

340
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,329
What did I do so wrong?

341
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,259
Darn it.

342
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,869
Why isn't she leaving?

343
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,269
What are you doing here?

344
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,210
Gosh.

345
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,210
You crazy pervert.

346
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,980
How long have you been hiding in there?

347
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,480
Noble, my foot.

348
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,089
The students here are twisted.

349
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,420
Hey! Not the cops.

350
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,160
- Listen to me. - Let go.

351
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,059
You should at least hear me out.

352
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,960
Check the exhaust fan above the last stall.

353
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,599
You'll see my cigarette pack.

354
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,529
I'm just a smoker. It's no big deal.

355
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:06,799
Cut the nonsense. Aren't you a student?

356
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,309
Let's say you're telling the truth.

357
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,869
Why were you in the women's restroom?

358
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,309
Stop anyone in the hallway and ask them...

359
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
if there are any girls...

360
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,480
who use this bathroom.

361
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,980
What are you saying?

362
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,829
Last year, a girl...

363
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,000
gave...

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,599
birth in this bathroom.

365
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,339
Oh, my gosh.

366
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,710
So no one uses this bathroom.

367
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,869
They think it's unsettling and full of negative energy.

368
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,509
Darn it. If it wasn't for Seo Do Eon,

369
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,910
I would've gone to the rooftop.

370
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,609
I didn't want to come here either.

371
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,220
This was my last resort.

372
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,589
Gosh, darn it.

373
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,630
Sorry about that.

374
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,940
Who are you, by the way?

375
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,970
You're not even a student at this school.

376
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,980
It's also not the entrance exam season.

377
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,880
What? Aren't you the bucket girl?

378
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,319
Where on earth are the applicant interviews being held?

379
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,559
Gosh, I was actually dying to know who you were.

380
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,599
What was that about?

381
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,970
You sure have a lot you're curious about.

382
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,339
Who in the world takes a bucket to their interview?

383
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,539
What did you use it for? Tell me.

384
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,839
I used it to ruin my life. What are you doing to do about it?

385
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,660
Here you go.

386
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:11,690
(Dismissal time: 4:30pm)

387
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,500
- You're leaving, right? - Yes.

388
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,430
(Kim Hye In)

389
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,970
Goodbye.

390
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,259
Here.

391
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:48,869
Thank you.

392
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,539
What do you mean? You get to take care of your business,

393
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,769
while I get to go for another smoke.

394
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,970
So we're even.

395
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,910
- Just tell me that. - Sure.

396
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:07,119
Do you see that Porsche Boxster in the parking lot?

397
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:08,650
Box what?

398
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,630
That red sports car that can be seen from even a million miles away.

399
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,630
That is Director Seo's most prized possession.

400
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,470
But will anything change if you beg him again?

401
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,839
You should know from experience.

402
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,339
He's not lenient.

403
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,779
Then should I just sit on my hands...

404
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:37,380
and watch my own life go down the drain?

405
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,819
Why are you getting mad at me?

406
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,619
You're the one who threw the water at the girl.

407
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,660
I guess I wish you good luck.

408
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,789
I'm leaving now.

409
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:51,730
Good luck, Bucket.

410
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,500
Whatever.

411
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,869
You pervert.

412
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:41,579
Right.

413
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,650
He also has another car he rides at times. Should I have told her?

414
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,559
When is he going home?

415
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,230
Oh, no.

416
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,319
Wait. What is that?

417
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,599
(Kim Hae In)
