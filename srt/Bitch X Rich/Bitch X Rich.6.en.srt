Hey. Get her.

Thank you for helping me.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,809
I just happened to see you when I was passing by.

19
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,209
You seemed to be in a tight spot.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,390
By the way, are your feet okay?

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,988
I was running away frantically.

22
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,390
I didn't even know I wasn't wearing shoes.

23

Wait here then.

24
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,379
Do you want to put these on?

25
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,020
I know they are dirty,

26
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,150
but it's better than not wearing any shoes.

27
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,159
Right. I should be grateful to get any shoes at this point.

28
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,259
Thank you.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,729
Gosh. You're helping me out a lot today.

30
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,198
Right. I just transferred to this school.

31
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,240
I know you.

32
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,240
Hye In. You're Kim Hye In, right?

33
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,479
Have we met before?

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,379
Well, actually,

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,590

(Cheongdam News)

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,639
To sum it up,

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,239
money holds sway over us,

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,309
and the status of one's family is power...

41
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,139
at Cheongdam International High School.

42
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,509
That means Baek Je Na is royalty. That's it, right?

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,650
Yes.

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,589
That's why no one can stand up to Je Na and her entourage.

45
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,650
Her entourage is called...

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,090
the Diamonds.

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,090
To be honest, people like us rarely get to talk to them.

48
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,960
But I crossed Baek Je Na on my first day at this school.

49
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,569
My days here are totally doomed.

50
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,069
But even if you didn't cross Baek Je Na,

51
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,909
since you transferred to the school through the equal education project,

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,139
the kids would have bullied you anyway.

53
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,819
Gosh, how comforting that is.

54
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,650
Sorry. I must have sounded too inconsiderate.

55
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,689
No. You don't have to apologize for something like that.

56
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,230
You're the only student who seems to be sane...

57
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,459
out of all the students I met here.

58
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,069
Right. You're not the only one, actually.

59
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,410
I think I need to go somewhere.

60
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,279
Already?

61
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,220
If they barge in here, it will put you in a tight spot too.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,620
Since no one is outside, this might be my chance.

63
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,250
Thank you so much for everything today.

64
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,029

65
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,628

Why are you bringing her up now?

Today is the one day we have a meal together as a family.

We're not supposed to have a meal with a random stranger.

Speaking of which, that's why we're all here today.

125

It's about time that you tried to get to know her more.

Why would I do that?

138
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:55,090
I told your father that I wanted to have a meal with you today.

139

We'll be family soon.

140

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,100

145
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,889
I'm okay. I just skinned my knee a bit.

146
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,460
Your school uniform got dirty.

147
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Let me apologize on their behalf.

148
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,669
If you want, I'll get you a new school uniform too.

149
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,038
No. They are the ones who bullied me.

150
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,269

151
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,879
Well,

152
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
I'm not sure if you know, but my dad is the school director.

153
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,250
It's a sense of responsibility.

154
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,350
You don't have to say no.

155
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,620
But still. I'm just one of many students here.

156
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,799

164
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,570
What's wrong with that?

165
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,840
When I become Cinderella,

166
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,009
I can marry a prince.

167
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:34,080
What's so great about marrying a mere prince?

168
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,189
When you marry him,

169
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,120
you'll have to cook for him, clean, and do his laundry.

170
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:42,888
It's better to be rich, so you can eat anything you want...

171
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,429
and do anything you want.

172
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:48,769
Is that so?

173
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,370
What an idiot.

174
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,840
Marrying a prince would make you rich by default.

175
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,549

177
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,990
briefly wondered about it.

"Can I dream about becoming Cinderella?"

179
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,429
So...

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,059
answer me.

181
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,679
If that's what you want.

182

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,419
Who killed her?

184
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,059
You saw it that night.

185
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,840
Who pushed her off the rooftop?

186
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,940
I knew it.

187
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,480
Screw becoming Cinderella.

188
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,090
If I tell you that,

189
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,919
what will you do for me?

190
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,090
- What's going on? - Is that really her?

191
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,258
- Are they dating? - What's this?

192
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,388
- No way. - Is this for real?

193
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,459
- Hey, this is crazy. - Gosh. Look.

194
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,829
- That's really her? - No way.

195
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,459
- What's going on? - Seriously?

196
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,870
This is crazy.

197
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,169
- Hey, look. - They're holding hands.

198
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,379
Hey, it's her.

199
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,279
That's her.

200
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,220
- I can't believe this. - No way.

201
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,330
Hey, equal education parasite.

202
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,000
What's this?

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What do you mean?

204
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,039
Don't play dumb.

205
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,240
What's going on with you and Seo Do Eon?

206
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,850
Why are you curious about that?

207
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,210
I see.

208
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,080
Is it because Seo Do Eon is a Diamond or something?

209
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,519
Which makes you his lapdogs.

210
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,529
What? This girl is a total nutcase.

211
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:04,730
You're not dating him, right?

212
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,299
He will never date you in his right mind.

213
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,930
It's not like she's pretty either.

214
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,699
- Even her body... - Are you serious?

215
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,440
Did we say anything that was untrue?

216
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,709
Anyone can tell...

217
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,839
Do Eon was just being kind to you.

218
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,549
You thought you were special and got ahead of yourself.

219
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,309
Being kind?

220
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,180
Yes. It was mere kindness, compassion, and pity.

221
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,460
Are you done?

222
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,859
I am.

223
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,529
I guess it's my turn to answer.

224
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,970
It's true.

225
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,970
Seo Do Eon...

226
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,640
and I are dating.

227
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,240
Hey, Do Eon.

228
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,109
Tell us yourself.

229
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,349
Are you really dating that crazy freak?

230
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,690
Kim Hae In.

231
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,619
Who killed her?

232
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,430
You saw it...

233
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
that night.

234
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,200
Who pushed her off the rooftop?

235
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,210
Don't tell me the Kim Hae In you like is...

236
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,789
Do you want to use this?

237
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,589
What? He has a girlfriend?

238
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,200
You approached me on purpose, didn't you?

239
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,699
All that talk about contacting you if I get in trouble...

240
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,930
was for a reason.

241
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,079
I told you. My dad is the school director.

242
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,450
I heard your call the other day.

243
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,250
So don't try to get out of this.

244
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,589
Then go and ask your dad, you jerk. What a bother...

245
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,599
You're the only one...

246
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,339
who can tell the truth.

247
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,839
If I tell you that,

248
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,480
what can you do for me?

249
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,420
So you will tell me?

250
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,990
Not right now.

251
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,420
It depends how you act.

252
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,569
Yes, we're dating.

253
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,970
So don't give her a hard time.

254
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,740
If that's all, I'm leaving.

255
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,589
No way. I think he really lost it.

256
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,660
"Yes, so don't give her a hard time."

257
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,299
What did I even do?

258
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,230
The most shocking thing...

259
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,700
is that she's not even pretty at all.

260
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,740
Why would he...

261
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,769
Goodness.

262
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,410
That's so random of him.

263
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,140
Does she know a secret of his or what?

264
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,579
You're not hiding anything from me, are you?

265
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,619
Of course not.

266
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,759
What's this?

267
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,730
I'd like to ask you that.

268
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,569
What did you do in your first two days here?

269
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,068
Please. You already know everything.

270
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:06,298
Why are you asking?

271
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,140
You mean, you actually hit Baek Je Na with your head...

272
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
and stole Seo Do Eon's heart?

273
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,779
You're interesting, Kim Hye In.

274
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,079
What the...

275
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,549
If it's really true, congratulations.

276
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,589
Did you stop me just for this nonsense?

277
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,630
Gosh.

278
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,069
No, I called you because it was really interesting.

279
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,170
Hey, Transfer.

280
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,180
Shall we do proper introductions?

281
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,140
Let's get along from now on.

282
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,910
Talk about a change in attitude.

283
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,579
It's not like we want to be friends...

284
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,088
but you're really dating Seo Do Eon.

285
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,759
No point in being enemies, right?

286
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,490
We're not like...

287
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,690
those dumb gorillas over there.

288
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,700
We're quick-witted.

289
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,630
Well, okay.

290
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,569
I agree that there's no need to make enemies.

291
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,710
Then it's settled, okay?

292
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,038
So tell us, how did you meet Seo Do Eon?

293
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,308
Who confessed first?

294
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,808
You already knew him, right?

295
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,279
There's no way you fell in love in a day.

296
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,979
Let me know if you have any tips for seducing a Diamond Six.

297
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,390
Me too.

298
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,319
Ask your questions one at a time.

299
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,220
Gosh, you're so noisy.

300
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,460
You're right. We can always ask you some other day.

301
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,500
There happens to be a Sorority Party on Friday.

302
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,400
Let's set a date so you can tell us all about it.

303
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:46,769
So... What party?

304
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,640
Sorority Party.

305
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,108
In simple terms,

306
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:55,349
it's a gathering for a girls-only club.

307
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,019
But don't think of it as a boring school club.

308
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,949
It's a place where us children...

309
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,460
of high net worth households...

310
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:08,660
mingle and socialize regularly. A private society, if you will.

311
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,130
And you're asking me to go there?

312
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,429
The exclusive party for high net worth children.

313
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,440
Of course, an equal education kid like you...

314
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:23,069
I mean,

315
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,538
commoners from the equal education project...

316
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,240
could never dream of attending it.

317
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,480
But you're dating Seo Do Eon.

318
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,719
Your boyfriend is a royal Diamond Six.

319
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,319
I'm sure you'll be an exception.

320
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,720
Who knows.

321
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,390
Whether you guys make an exception for me,

322
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,990
I don't think I should be there in the first place.

323
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,829
Are you kidding me?

324
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:48,529
Of course you should go.

325
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,869
When else will you get to go to such a fancy party?

326
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,209
Why would I go to their party?

327
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,009
Who knows what they'll do to me?

328
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,240
I'll be a fool to go.

329
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:04,279
What did you tell me when you got accepted?

330
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,819
You said the school was giving you benefits, not freebies.

331
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,989
Wasn't it your goal to enjoy...

332
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,759
all those benefits so you could turn your life around?

333
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,500
Go and network with those company heirs.

334
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,230
This is your golden opportunity to mingle with them.

335
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,799
Why are you getting scared?

336
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,900
Why are you so passionate for once?

337
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:34,480
I'm planning to quit the unemployed life...

338
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,180
and have been looking around for internships.

339
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,849
Even getting a mere internship...

340
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,819
requires connections.

341
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,490
I see.

342
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,029
I'm not sure what kind of...

343
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,970
dirty and unjust things will happen to you at the party.

344
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,199
But don't forget that your future...

345
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,309
will be filled with way dirtier and unjust happenings.

346
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,108
Yes, thank you for giving a piece of advice to a high schooler...

347
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,980
who's just trying to live her life.

348
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,279
So you're going, right?

349
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,618
No, I'm still not going.

350
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:18,119
Why not?

351
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,720
I can't even if I want to.

352
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,859
I don't have a dress for the occasion.

353
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,940
Hold on.

354
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,579
Come on.

355
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,789
Gosh, what should I do?

356
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,859
All the girls there will be wearing luxury dresses.

357
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,190
Instead of these children's costume rentals,

358
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,329
is there someone who can lend you a luxury dress?

359
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,970
As if I'll know someone like that.

360
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,539
I thought you knew one.

361
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,950
Who would I know?

362
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,779
Why not?

363
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,380
Really? You can lend me a dress?

364
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,990
Ms. Hye In... I mean, Hye In.

365
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,390
How did you get invited to the party?

366
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,759
Did you make a fuss again?

367
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,190
Come on.

368
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,230
I've heard of the Sorority Party.

369
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,200
It's the party you have to attend to join high society.

370
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,130
They have a strict filtering process...

371
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,200
so I couldn't find information on it.

372
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,309
This is great.

373
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,279
Go and give me a detailed account of it.

374
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,480
That's my condition for lending you my dress.

375
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:53,119
Gosh. Na Yeon, you're such a bright kid.

376
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,789
Of all the middle schoolers I know, you're the smartest.

377
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:58,660
It's nothing.

378
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,059
An account's a piece of cake.

379
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,028
Since you're lending me a dress,

380
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,359
I'll pay you even though it may not be enough.

381
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,700
Forget it. Why would I need chump change like that?

382
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,299
Keep it. Just make sure you keep my dress clean.

383
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,009
You know that party dresses cost more than 10,000 dollars, right?

384
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,180
Auntie, it's me.

385
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,318
- The dress I bought months ago... - Hey, can I call her "Big Sis?"

386
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,589
- Please pack that. - Come on.

387
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,359
Okay.

388
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,940
Come to this venue by 7pm tomorrow.

389
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,808
The guests will be verified at entry.

390
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:56,380
Show them this QR code.

391
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,849
You need a QR code and your student pass.

392
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,950
What a fuss...

393
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Goodbye.

394
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,990
Look, you're perfect.

395
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,390
How amazing.

396
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,559
You won't lose out to anyone.

397
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,359
What's wrong?

398
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,430
Why do you look so glum?

399
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,170
Now that I'm here,

400
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,640
I feel a bit intimidated.

401
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,269
Oh, gosh.

402
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,579
You're wearing an 8,000-dollar dress.

403
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,279
Why are you being so weak?

404
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,579
Aren't you going to be a débutante?

405
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,279
Debut... What?

406
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,349
Oh...

407
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,490
They mentioned it in an English series I watch.

408
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,489
That's what they call...

409
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,190
upper-class women who are first introduced to society.

410
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,430
We're not in medieval England.

411
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,970
Besides, I'm not from the upper class.

412
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:28,369
Hey!

413
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,769
Even though you were born a commoner,

414
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,778
it's true that you're stepping...

415
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,309
into high society through this party.

416
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:37,680
A débutante.

417
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,450
Goodness.

418
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,920
Even for Cinderella,

419
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,089
she went to the party...

420
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,589
before she met her prince.

421
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:50,789
Got it?

422
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,569
Just go for it.

423
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,970
There'll be no prince since it's a girls-only party.

424
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:04,539
But an exclusive connection who can turn your life around...

425
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,210
will be in there.

426
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,259
That's right.

427
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,359
If I can get just a little closer to you guys,

428
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,329
that's all I need.

429
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,999
Hey, Ga Young!

430
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,239
- You're so pretty. - Seriously.

431
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,210
- Pretty, right? - You're here already.

432
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,939
- Should I go? - I knew it.

433
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,108
I dressed up for today.

434
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:41,808
- Really? - Isn't it pretty?

435
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,508
By the way, can we hang out at your hotel?

436
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,518
Of course.

437
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,650
- Come next week. - This is so good.

438
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,919
It's different from what I thought.

439
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,788
- At first... - I wanted to wear that colour.

440
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,419
- I know. - I didn't see her.

441
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,858
It's a Valentine...

442
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,900
- My dad said... - You matched the colours.

443
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,299
I don't like it.

444
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,368
How have you been?

445
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,470
The pasta is really nice.

446
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,779
Isn't it delicious? I love this.

447
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,500
Oh, my!

448
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,799
Oops, sorry!

449
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:41,499
I know everything's free.

450
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,240
But aren't you taking them too blatantly?

451
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,180
Those brats! This dress is so expensive.

452
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,420
Gosh, my ankle.

453
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,650
Are you okay?

454
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,690
Wait.

455
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,230
Don't you know me?

456
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:04,460
I know you, though.

457
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,470
Nice to meet you. You're Do Eon's girl, right?

458
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,240
Why did you come?

459
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,809
I wasn't feeling like coming to such a casual party...

460
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,579
but someone said I should come for this.

461
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,349
So I came just for it.

462
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,618
Gosh, it's Baek Je Na. I wanted to be her Instagram mutual.

463
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,119
- Did someone call her? - She's so pretty.

464
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,589
- Oh, my. - She's gorgeous.

465
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,169
- It's Baek Je Na. - It's Baek Je Na.

466
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,200
- Oh, my gosh. - It's Baek Je Na.

467
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,469
Did someone call her here?

468
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,079
- Why did she come? - She usually skips these.

469
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,549
Just make sure...

470
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,319
you keep my dress clean.

471
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,890
This is...

472
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,029
definitely...

473
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,259
a trap.

474
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,869
Darn it.
