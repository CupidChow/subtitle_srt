(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)

00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,109
(All characters, locations, organizations, events...)

10
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,409
(in this drama are fictional.)

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,590
Sir, are you listening?

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,890
So what about the girl?

13
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,460
Is she dead?

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,530
She's in surgery. But it's not looking good.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,570
Did you check the security camera?

16
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,670
I marked it as under maintenance for the police.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,069
And I deleted the footage, but...

18
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,209
But?

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,010
I don't think she jumped off of her own free will.

20
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,379
Since she was one of the students in the equal education project,

21
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,719
her death won't cause that much trouble for us.

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,590
What's important to us...

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,930
is not the victim...

24
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,930
but the killer.

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,769
Listen up, Mr. Yoon.

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,980
No one will find out about what really happened tonight.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,420
The student killed herself due to academic-related stress.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,019
That's the story people will hear.

29
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:01,590
Korea is full of students who feel overwhelmed with school work...

30
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,060
and commit suicide.

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,400
This won't even make the headlines.

32
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:09,930
Do you understand?

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,639
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,610
But...

35
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,710
we have a small problem.

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,090
A witness?

37
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,689
No. That's actually good.

38
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,159
I'll take care of her.

39
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,439
(Bitch x Rich)

40
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,889
We have similar names.

41
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,530
(Kim Hae In)

42
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,759
Help!

43
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,930
Is anyone here?

44
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,139
Please help! She's dying!

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,509
Help!

46
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,710
I saw someone...

47
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,949
falling from the rooftop.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,960
- She was bleeding. - Please help! She's dying!

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I've never seen anything...

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,389
- like that in my life. - Help!

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,930
I was so terrified and shocked.

52
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,500
Oh, no. What do I do?

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,699
Calm down.

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,740
But you're certain that you saw somebody on the rooftop?

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,750
What a long day.

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,149
She should be going to school by now.

57
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,689
What's she doing? How come she still hasn't come out?

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,199
What? Why is she coming from there, not out of her house?

59
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,129
Hey.

60
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,300
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,370
What do you think?

62
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,970
You didn't answer your phone,

63
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,439
but I really needed to talk to you. So I'm here.

64
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,350
By the way, are you just coming home?

65
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,680
My phone died because it ran out of battery.

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,279
I was at the hospital all night.

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,720
That doesn't concern you.

68
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,290
What's this about? Why did you come all the way to my house?

69
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't tell me that you're here to see my dad...

70
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,430
because of what happened with Na Yeon.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,500
Goodness. Listen to yourself.

72
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,939
I'm here because I needed to talk to you.

73
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,740
I would like to ask you what on earth happened.

74
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:39,180
Even connections or money couldn't win over the school director.

75
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,050
How did you manage to get him on your side?

76
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,819
As long as you agree,

77
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,350
he will reconsider accepting Na Yeon...

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,850
to Cheongdam International High School.

79
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,920
What?

80
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,860
We'll drop the lawsuit.

81
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,089
And we'll tell your school that it was our misunderstanding.

82
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,100
What on earth are you talking about?

83
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,829
Mr. Kim.

84
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,269
- Bring that out. - Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,620
It doesn't matter how you get there. The important thing is that you do.

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,629
As long as my daughter gets into Cheongdam International High School,

87
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,660
there won't be any bad blood between us.

88
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,129
So could you please put in a good word...

89
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,300
about Na Yeon to the school director for me?

90
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,300
I have invested a lot of money, so she could get into that school.

91
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,910
But to grow my husband's business even bigger,

92
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,740
I really need to socialize, so I can build connections...

93
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,449
I don't have to explain this more. You understand me, right?

94
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,449
Please do this for me.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,459
Dad.

96
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,800
You didn't go to work?

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,129
Where were you last night?

98
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,370
Why are you coming home at this hour?

99
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,069
I crashed at my friend's house.

100
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,540
I was studying with her and then fell asleep.

101
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,350
Who's the woman you were talking to in front of the house?

102
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,420
And what's that in your hand?

103
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,819
Well...

104
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,790
It's nothing.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm sleepy and tired.

106
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,189
Dad, you should go to work now.

107
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,930
Stop!

108
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,470
You were gone without a phone call and made me worry all night.

109
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,600
So everything is fine and dandy if you say it's nothing?

110
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,899
If you...

111
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,970
caused trouble and are keeping it from me...

112
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,779
What is it that you want me to say?

113
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,410
- You little brat. - I know that...

114
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,480
if I were to get into trouble,

115
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,149
our family has no money or connections to fix that.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,420
Even if I cause trouble, I'll fix it myself.

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,759
So stay out of my business.

118
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,930
You...

119
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,210
(Missed calls)

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,620
(I don't think resolving a small problem will make...)

121
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,820
(I don't think resolving a small problem will make...)

122
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,190
(your already-miserable life any better.)

123
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,730
(Give me a call when you read this message.)

124
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,129
If you let her punish me like that, you will be making...

125
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,769
my already-miserable life worse.

126
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,480
Hello.

127
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,210
(Intensive Care Unit)

128
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,879
Her doctor said...

129
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I should prepare myself to say goodbye.

130
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,460
And her school said...

131
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,529
that she committed suicide...

132
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,929
due to academic stress when she's still breathing.

133
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,370
But her friends have been visiting...

134
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,639
to help me stay strong.

135
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,110
So I'm really grateful.

136
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,509
Hang in there, ma'am.

137
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,850
I'm sure Hae In will pull through.

138
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,690
By the way,

139
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,629
were there more students who came to see her other than me?

140
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,700
What?

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,009
You said her friends had come by.

142
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,110
Oh, that.

143
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,639
Someone from Cheongdam International High School...

144
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,179
came by to see her.

145
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,320
I was told that that student was Hae In's closest friend.

146
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,889
A friend? That's what...

147
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,019
the student said?

148
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:00,960
What is it?

149
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,929
It's impossible to make friends at that school.

150
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:12,370
(Police line, do not enter, under investigation)

151
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,379
That's the cafeteria. You can eat there.

152
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,210
What else?

153
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,690
Seo Do Eon?

154
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,990
What?

155
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,759
Nothing.

156
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,500
We just looked around the main building of the school.

157
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,970
In that annex building... What's that called?

158
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,340
The Chemistry Department, Biology Department, Humanities Department,

159
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,840
and some other departments are in that building.

160
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,539
You'll learn what's inside as you spend more time here.

161
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,639
Must I keep this up?

162
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,710
What? I thought you were going to give me a tour of the school.

163
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,519
But that's...

164
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,659
I'm forced to do this as a part of my disciplinary action.

165
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,059
But you see, I have a strong sense of responsibility.

166
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,929
Instead of giving you the tour, I will tell you some tips...

167
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,929
on how to survive here...

168
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:16,929
which will come in handy 100 times more.

169
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,240
Won't that even it out?

170
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,710
An invisible hierarchy exists in this school.

171
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,710
Your parents' wealth will determine your class.

172
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,320
You're not supposed to eat that.

173
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
You must not know that because you've never had it before.

174
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,940
- Hey. - Take that.

175
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,509
Clearly, you haven't played this before.

176
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,179
He never improves.

177
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,610
- He doesn't have to join us. - People like him spoil the mood.

178
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:08,320
That's why not knowing your place will never be condoned here.

179
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,259
You don't have money to hire an attorney anyway.

180
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,289
Forget about putting your name on the wall.

181
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:15,960
You can't even pay the tuition. That's why you're mooching off us.

(Honours Club: Contributors to School Foundation)

183
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,460
You can sue me...

184
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,269
if you have the money for it.

185
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,940
You know that my dad is a chief judge, right?

186
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,340
I got your back.

187
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,639
Gosh.

188
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,539
Our dear queen hates it when people act out of their place.

189
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,610
How loud.

190
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,879
Hey.

191
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,889
Point your name.

192
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,559
Where is it?

193
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,159
It's...

194
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,309
(Gold Club, donations over 100,000 dollars)

195
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,250
I see. There it is.

196
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:11,850
That's your place.

197
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,649
But...

198
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,559
showing that off to a student in the equal education project...

199
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,090
Isn't that embarrassing?

200
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:28,870
So even if you get lost,

201
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,039
shouldn't you at least know where your place is here?

202
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,769
So you don't end up there.

203
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,679
Oh, that?

204
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,250
My dad runs a plastic surgery clinic in Apgujeong.

205
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,450
I heard you studied in the UK.

206
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,590
So you really are clueless about our school.

207
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,190
If your dad is a clinic director,

208
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,629
you will barely survive here.

209
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,169
Can you handle it here?

210
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,509
So the Office of Education...

211
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,309
wants us to accept more students for the equal education project.

212
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,850
They want us to accept three more students...

213
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,149
which is 3 to 4 percent of each grade.

214
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,980
Hey, come on.

215
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,919
- Show it to me too. - What's going on now?

216
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,850
Show it to me too.

217
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,620
- Why keep it to yourself? - Gosh.

218
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,259
- Hey. - You should share that.

219
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,389
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,129
I heard you made the starting lineup.

221
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,070
Congratulations.

222
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,269
Athleticism must run in the family. Your dad must be thrilled.

223
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,740
Yes, I guess. Thank you.

224
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,139
Okay.

225
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,279
What is it? What's so great about this?

226
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,279
- Come on. What is it? - Hey.

227
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,599
(General Candidate)

228
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,309
(Equal Education Candidate)

229
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,619
Today, I'll be talking about youth suicide prevention.

230
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,650
I want to talk about managing your emotions.

231
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,759
Being honest about your feelings,

232
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,160
also known as having mental willpower,

233
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,230
is crucial in youth suicide prevention...

234
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,930
Guys.

235
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,470
Is this lecture boring?

236
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,940
- Yes. - It's so lame.

237
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,700
What's the point of these things?

238
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,769
What do you mean?

239
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,650
Just recently, one of your schoolmates...

240
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,849
jumped off the roof.

241
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,180
She's still in a coma.

242
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,519
This lecture...

243
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,890
is to prevent unfortunate accidents like that...

244
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,359
Was it unfortunate?

245
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,529
What?

246
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,569
I'm sure it was preventive enough.

247
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,410
Everyone must've learned from it.

248
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,490
I agree.

249
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,299
Big news. Did you hear about Kim Hye In?

250
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,099
What's your problem?

251
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,640
- What's going on? - Look. She's packing up.

252
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,720
- She's leaving out of shame, no? - I know.

253
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,190
I'd be embarrassed if I was her too.

254
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,920
It'd be embarrassing.

255
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
I know what you mean.

256
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,130
Move it.

257
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,799
Hey, Kim Hye In.

258
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,440
What now?

259
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,970
Seems like you still don't know what you did wrong.

260
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,809
It's not pretending to be rich when you're poor.

261
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,980
The fact that you were ashamed of being poor...

262
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,579
is wrong and shameful.

263
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,420
Even though my family isn't well-off either,

264
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,390
at least, I've never thought...

265
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,720
that my given environment was shameful.

266
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,730
Did I ask?

267
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,299
Get off your high horse.

268
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,200
Why, that brat!

269
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,970
Guys!

270
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:03,869
Guys, Hye In will be transferred to...

271
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,980
Cheongdam International High School.

272
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,410
No way.

273
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,380
It's not another lie?

274
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,380
- Oh, gosh. - Lucky her.

275
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,190
Goodness.

276
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,819
She's so lucky.

277
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,369
Did you have to quit your part-time job too?

278
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,769
Since when did Cheongdam International kids work?

279
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,869
I'm now a student there too.

280
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,309
I should act like one.

281
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh, please.

282
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,809
It's just a school. How incredible can it be?

283
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,779
Did you know? Scholars at Cheongdam International...

284
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,150
get lots of scholarship benefits.

285
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,220
According to the school director,

286
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,089
they'll provide us equal education students...

287
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,029
with tuition fees for college and school expenses.

288
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,200
We're also sent overseas for language studies quarterly.

289
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,240
Gosh. You sure love freebies.

290
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,940
They're not freebies but benefits.

291
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,539
Do you know...

292
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
what shocked me and made me go speechless...

293
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,250
when I first visited that school?

294
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,480
What did you see?

295
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,279
Forget it. There's no point telling you.

296
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:29,920
In any case, getting transferred to that school...

297
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,420
might be the only benefit and opportunity...

298
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,759
for me to turn my life around.

299
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,130
I've decided to bet my life on that school...

300
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,630
so stop mocking me.

301
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,700
When did I mock you?

302
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,839
I'm just sad to see you quit.

303
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,079
Without you, who will keep the expiring rice balls for me?

304
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,819
The night shift will be empty now that I quit.

305
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,019
Don't you want to take it?

306
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,049
No. I'm all good on that front.

307
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,690
But finish your story.

308
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,559
What kind of deal...

309
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,529
did you have with the school director?

310
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,539
How did this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

311
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,240
fall into your lap?

312
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,109
I got in since there happened to be an opening...

313
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,710
for equal education students.

314
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,880
Not some deal...

315
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,220
Didn't they reach out first?

316
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,390
No?

317
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,759
Oh, right.

318
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,130
I took out my savings I kept for college.

319
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,930
Once I'm in Cheongdam International,

320
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,529
I don't think I'll need it anymore.

321
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,269
This'll be the first and last time I'm buying grilled pork belly.

322
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,069
Come along if you want.

323
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,140
What? Grilled pork belly?

324
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,650
Seriously...

325
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,720
You're more rational than I thought.

326
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,390
What a sensible kid.

327
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:14,319
Let's go right now.

328
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,460
- Grilled pork belly! - Seriously...

329
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,859
- Are you that happy? - Of course.

330
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,630
You're leeching off a high schooler.

331
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,029
I'm hungry. You can be the adult today.

332
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
You haven't showered!

333
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,509
But I love you.

334
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,130
Thank you.

335
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,009
(Kim Hye In)

336
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,470
Is there anything you're looking for?

337
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,339
Oh, well...

338
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,450
Those shoes.

339
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,460
How much did you pay for these Mary Jane shoes?

340
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:55,460
I think they were about 800 or 900 dollars.

341
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,960
From what I remember, their shoes start selling at 1,000 dollars.

342
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,329
Would you like to try it on?

343
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,339
- This model costs 1,450... - I know.

344
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:09,539
These are the 1,450-dollar shoes, right?

345
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,339
I don't need to try them.

346
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,480
I'll take it.

347
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,720
I bought it.

348
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,789
If I count by minimum wage,

349
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,890
I paid for shoes that cost me 158 working hours.

350
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,869
Maybe I should've bought 10 pairs of 140-dollar shoes.

351
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,299
Gosh. I must've lost it.

352
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:41,569
No.

353
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,039
Only these are worthy of my luxurious uniform.

354
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,410
It fits my status.

355
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,529
Are you looking for something?

356
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,759
No, thank you.

357
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,130
I see you go to Cheongdam International.

358
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,099
They're not expensive. Why don't you get one?

359
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,730
It's a waste to wear just any jacket over this uniform.

360
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,509
That's true, but I spent a lot today.

361
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,880
Can I just try them on?

362
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,779
Of course. Please pass them to me.

363
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,980
Thank you.

364
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,819
Let me help you.

365
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,319
Could you put this on?

366
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,529
It looks so good on you.

367
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,829
Would you like to try this too?

368
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,970
Yes.

369
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,720
- Sorry. - Do you not have eyes...

370
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,460
Seriously? Do you think a "sorry" is enough?

371
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,130
Oh, no.

372
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,230
Goodness.

373
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,210
Oh, gosh.

374
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,890
I'm glad the shoes are fine.

375
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:15,890
How annoying.

376
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,309
(You look good in the uniform you got for killing someone.)

377
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,759
Was it the girl from earlier?

378
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,670
Hey.

379
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,170
I'm sorry.

380
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,650
Gosh, where did she disappear to?

381
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,720
This is so icky.

382
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,890
Goodness.

383
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,230
Oh, I forgot. My shoes!

384
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,140
What? Where did my shoes go?

385
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,069
I definitely put it here.

386
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,640
How could they disappear in that short period of time?

387
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,180
Where did they go?

388
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,170
Hey.

389
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,470
What's your issue?

390
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,940
I should be asking that.

391
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,980
What's your problem?

392
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,549
(Kim Hye In)

393
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,349
You're from my school?

394
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,250
And you dare act like this to me?

395
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,660
Don't people usually feign ignorance in this situation?

396
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,930
What are you talking about?

397
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:33,900
Are you a transfer student?

398
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,769
Do you know who I am?

399
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:42,869
I'm letting you off today since I had a terrible day.

400
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,440
Don't let me see you in school.

401
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,450
What an uncultured freak.

402
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,480
Uncultured?

403
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:57,490
That's rich coming from a thief!

404
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,859
Who said you could leave?

405
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,460
What are you doing? Have you lost it?

406
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,390
Jail is a luxury for people like you.

407
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,859
I'll teach you a lesson myself, so bark on if you dare.

408
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:16,609
(Bitch x Rich)

409
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,710
(Epilogue)

410
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,980
I'll get going.

411
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay. Thanks for coming, Min Sol.

412
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,890
By the way, ma'am.

413
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,500
You said there was another student...

414
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,470
who came from our school.

415
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,799
Do you know their name?

416
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,670
I'm not sure.

417
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,809
I don't remember the surname.

418
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,079
Oh, but the name was...

419
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,279
What?
