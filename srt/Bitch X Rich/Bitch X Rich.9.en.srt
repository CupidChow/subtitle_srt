How shameless.

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,420
She actually showed her face in school.

21
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,049
Tell me about it. Didn't her dad go to prison?

22
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,249
Did you see the reporters...

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,890
lined up outside the front gate today?

24
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:28,259
My mom said that her family has been notorious...

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,200
since my mom's school years.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,930
They're a bunch of lunatics.

What are you looking at?

28
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,510

Is this the zoo?

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,480
Look away.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,209
You pests!

32
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,319
She's the one who's trash.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,319
We only avoid her because she stinks.

34
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,789
What if she throws a fit like her grandma or father? Let's go.

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,329
Hey, she could be high. Don't you agree?

36
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,659
Why you...

37
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,429
Hey!

38
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,229
How dare you?

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
My family may have suffered a blow,

40
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,909
but it is still superior to yours.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
You're right.

42
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm high.

43
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,080
So what?

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,379
Je Na.

45
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,459
That had me startled. She deserved it.

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,529
Can you believe her?

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,228
- What's with her? - I knew it.

48
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,830
Serves her right.

49
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,870
How... How could you...

50
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,400
do this to me?

51
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,939
Back when we were kids, you said...

52
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,750
one must be in the same league to be friends.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
By that rule, it means you are no longer my friend.

54
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,319
Because your family will no longer be elite.

55
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,659
You didn't mind accepting what I offered...

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,460
when it suited you.

57
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,240
But now you have a problem with it?

58
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,409
You're the last person who should treat me this way.

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,908
Especially when you should forever be in my debt.

60
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,949
In your debt?

61
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,789
If only you knew how long I've dreamed of this moment.

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,610
(Bitch x Rich)

63
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,580
Pick up. Darn it.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
I specifically warned you...

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,829
to stay out of my line of sight until you graduate.

66
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,629
It's why I've been sticking to hallways that aren't frequented.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,638
I'm sorry if that still annoyed you. I'll be more careful.

68
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,769
You.

69
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,240
What game are you playing?

70
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,779
What do you mean?

71
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,009
Why are you associating with Kim Hye In?

72
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,750
Kim Hye In?

73
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,819
I don't know who you're talking about.

74
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,889
Are you kidding me?

75
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,620
It's not that.

76
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,258
There was someone else with a similar name,

77
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,089
so I couldn't be sure who you meant.

78
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,600
You're talking about Kim "Hye" In, right?

79
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,930
Oh Si Eun.

80
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,269
I don't know...

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,838
why you're being friendly toward a commoner...

82
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,209
whom you've always treated as vermin.

83
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,709
But put a lid on whatever you're cooking.

84
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,688
If it comes to my attention, I'll reveal your past actions and...

85
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,850
Where's your proof?

86
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,889
What?

87
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,860
Your little brother.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,199
Can you prove that I'm the reason Hanmyung Group's precious son died?

89
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,528
You said it yourself,

90
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,199
you psychotic cow.

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,268
That was when the great Baek Je Na...

92
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:37,480
was going to be heir apparent to Hanmyung Group and my BFF.

93
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,139
Wait.

94
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,050
Hold on.

95
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,948
Haven't our classes been levelled out again?

96
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:46,949
Why you...

97
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,790
Je Na, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,989
You still have...

99
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,719
that restraining order out against me,

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,329
so I can't be in your vicinity.

101
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,269
See?

102
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,670
I said you'd regret it.

103
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,970
You ungrateful brat.

104
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,980
You're too chicken to actually mess with me.

105
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,360
Back when we were kids, you said...

106
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,560
one must be in the same league to be friends.

107
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,069
By that rule, it means you are no longer my friend.

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,970
Because your family will no longer be elite.

109
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,479
- Did you hear that? - Gosh.

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,109
- Unbelievable. - How shameless.

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,750
- What a lunatic. - Exactly.

112
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,290
But...

113
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,829
don't you think...

114
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,000
our classes have levelled out?

115
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,540
Talk about an embarrassment for Hanmyung Group.

116
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,269
It's all over the news.

117
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,139
I read the article too. He said he found real love.

118
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,439
Poor lady.

119
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,278
She was his personal wallet,

120
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,948
but she lost him to his mistress.

121
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,149
- If it were me, I'd be humiliated. - Me too.

122
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,419
- He has a girlfriend. - That's what I read.

123
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,779
- Really? - Yes.

124
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,698
This lecture...

125
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,198
is to prevent unfortunate accidents like that...

126
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,438
Was it unfortunate?

127
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,240
Because of us, someone almost died.

128
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,980
You must be talking about Kim Hae In.

129
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,079
You should be wise about who you hang out with.

130
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,519
Not everyone can be considered as a friend.

131
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,550
Surround yourself with those who'll be beneficial to you.

132
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,889
Like Baek Je Na.

133
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,300
Darn it!

134
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,339
Where is it?

135
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,579
Darn.

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,720
Hye In.

137
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,259
I had something to ask you.

138
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,730
What is it?

139
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,929
Why did you lie to me?

140
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,860
Did you think I wouldn't know?

141
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,470
- Or... - What?

142
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,669
It was you that day.

143
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,110
Is it about your stolen shoes?

144
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:00,909
Is it about the note you received?

145
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,309
Or...

146
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,350
Is it about Lee Duk Min?

147
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,590
You crazy cow.

148
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,090
That's Oscar-worthy acting.

149
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,159
Are you some kind of psychopath?

150
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,459
The hidden camera and the threatening text...

151
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,730
were all you.

152
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,539
Technically, it was Lee Duk Min who secretly recorded you.

153
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,000
But I just happen to know what his pastime is.

154
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,870
This is a crime, you know.

155
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,309
But you committed a crime first.

156
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,049
What the...

157
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
The school uniform you got for killing someone...

158
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,789
looks good on you.

159
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,999
I have no idea what you think you know,

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,929
but there seems to be a misunderstanding.

161
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,870
I doubt the school director put you up to it.

162
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,409
It was probably the price for your silence.

163
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,339
The competition among equal education parasites...

164
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,940
are even worse.

165
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,179
Gosh.

166
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,149
Poor Hae In.

167
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,579
Outside the front gate...

168
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,720
It wasn't me.

169
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,820
I only happened to be at the scene that day.

170
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,590
But I really don't know who's at fault.

171
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,529
Is that so?

172
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,659
That's all I needed to know.

173
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,000
What?

174
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,740
I'm fine as long as you were there.

175
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,070
That's all it takes for you to testify.

176
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,139
You see,

177
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,549
I already know who did it.

178
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,549
It was Baek Je Na.

179
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,629
Where are you going? Sit and take this.

180
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,039
I'm still not in the mood to talk to you.

181
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,309
Come on. When will this cold war end?

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,649
You guys are being super childish.

183
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,548
If you're going to dampen the mood at our party...

184
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,919
rather than celebrating with us,

185
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,120
- you won't be let in. - Absolutely.

186
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,789
Make up before then.

187
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Then,

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,360
I'll come to the party with Kim Hye In.

189
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,470
What?

190
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,129
You lunatic.

191
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,539
This is you trying to annoy me.

192
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,539
What's wrong? Can't I bring her?

193
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,610
Because my girlfriend is once again not well off?

194
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,549
Let me ask you one thing.

195
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,049
What about Kim Hae In did you hate?

196
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
What the...

197
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,059
Was it you...

198
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,870
who asked me here?

199
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,870
You came.

200
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,970
I didn't think you would.

201
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,240
Have you lost it completely?

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,009
How dare an equal education parasite summon me?

203
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,980
But you showed up...

204
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,480
which means my threats worked.

205
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,679
What?

206
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,719
All I did was text you to ask if Ms. Ha...

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,018
was quitting her job because she was marrying...

208
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,960
a chairman of a large company.

209
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,490
And you came without hesitation...

210
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,029
as if I was talking about your father.

211
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,929
Where did you hear...

212
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,740
that outrageous rumour?

213
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,899
Right.

214
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,110
I'm the only one...

215
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,779
who realized that the rumour was about your dad,

216
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,080
so don't worry.

217
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,980
But...

218
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,179
Ms. Ha should watch her actions.

219
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,149
I saw your personal chauffeur...

220
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,289
pick her up at late hours a few times.

221
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,829
As if you know who my chauffeur is.

222
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,330
Kids who weren't born of money...

223
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,669
are cautious about their surroundings.

224
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,470
"The shoes she has on."

225
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,509
"What if I wore them?"

226
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,210
"The house she lives in."

227
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,409
"What if it were my house?"

228
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,379
"What if the chauffeur picking her up..."

229
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,490
"was in fact here for me?"

230
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,590
We're consumed by such thoughts.

231
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,429
So?

232
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,269
What do you want from me?

233
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,139
What I want?

234
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,539
Will you let me have it?

235
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,350
I can't tell you just yet.

236
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,990
Baek Je Na.

237
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,850
She loathed Kim Hae In.

238
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,490
You have no idea...

239
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:17,659
just how scary Baek Je Na can be.

240
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,428
She must've wanted Kim Hae In dead.

241
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,299
Especially since she was being blackmailed.

242
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,470
Baek Je Na?

243
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,840
And...

244
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,409
Kim Hae In was blackmailing Baek Je Na?

245
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,279
But...

246
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,549
it couldn't have been her.

247
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,580
Hey.

248
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,388
- What's your issue? - I should be asking that.

249
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,919
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,830
Are you a transfer student?

251
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,830
I'm almost certain. Baek Je Na didn't do it.

252
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,100
It didn't seem like she recognized me.

253
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,839
Why else has she been harassing you...

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,709
and trying to make you leave?

255
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,779
Well, that...

256
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,509
That...

257
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,419
But...

258
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,049
- You're wrong, Si Eun. First... - Okay.

259
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,590
Do this instead.

260
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,429
Just make Baek Je Na responsible.

261
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,029
What?

262
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,259
You witnessed the incident,

263
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,429
so testify that you saw her push Hae In from behind.

264
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,269
Are you truly a psychopath? What on earth...

265
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,370
As if you're Ms. Goody Two-Shoes.

266
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,679
Know your place, will you?

267
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,580
You psycho.

268
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,610
You're nuts.

269
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,559
I'll pretend I didn't hear your request.

270
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,629
And from here on out,

271
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,460
stay out of my life.

272
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,200
You pretending to be my friend was creepy enough.

273
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,399
Hye In, wait.

274
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,940
This wasn't a request.

275
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,610
I'm blackmailing you.

276
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,879
What are you getting at, you psycho?

277
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,918
I didn't pay...

278
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,258
that pervert Lee Duk Min big money...

279
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,730
to obtain this video for no good reason.

280
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,830
Can't you see the quicksand around you?

281
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:35,929
You...

282
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,070
I'm one click away...

283
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,809
from having everyone in school watch your dirty video.

284
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,539
Do you still not care?

285
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,350
Look at your face.

286
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,159
Sometimes, you can be disgustingly simple-minded.

287
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,429
You stripped for 5,000 dollars...

288
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,959
and transferred to a school after seeing someone...

289
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,700
fall from the roof.

290
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,140
Hey.

291
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,410
Do you like freebies that much?

292
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,220
Why are you doing this to me?

293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,089
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

294
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,400
What did I ever do to you?

295
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,099
It's not because you did anything wrong.

296
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,710
All I'm asking of you is one tiny favour.

297
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,179
Of course I remember that.

298
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,119
The maid who kept breaking the dishware when you were young?

299
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,288
She was sweet, though.

300
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,420
Her only flaw was her hand tremors.

301
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,759
Gosh, it was a joy to take a trip down memory lane.

302
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,970
They say it means you're old.

303
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,500
Come on.

304
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:20,869
I guess...

305
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,440
I miss those days.

306
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,980
Considering how it makes me laugh.

307
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,279
How are you in better condition at the hospital than at home?

308
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,250
Tell me about it. I must be made for this place.

309
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,920
Visit often, okay?

310
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,859
You want me to skip school often?

311
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,559
Life is short.

312
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,000
Students should play hooky once in a while.

313
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,029
I'll get going, then.

314
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,338
Why?

315
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,400
Stay here, Mom. It's chilly outside.

316
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,920
I'll get going.

317
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,528
Yes, the shareholders won't be fond of the uncertainty.

318
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,959
(VIP Room: Ms. Seo)

319
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,999
Ms. Seo's shares will probably be discussed...

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,829
at the general meeting.

321
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:27,799
If you consider the son who will soon be born,

322
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,240
this matter needs sorting out.

323
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,380
Yes, sir. I'll sort it out as soon as possible.

324
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,669
(Oh Si Eun)

325
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,038
(If you don't want your life going down the drain,)

326
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,999
(you'll do as I ask.)

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,838
What you ask?

328
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,369
But you clearly said you were blackmailing me.

329
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,480
But this really is a crime.

330
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,890
And Baek Je Na of all people?

331
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,430
Then my life will truly be ruined!

332
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,808
(Looking for Witness)

333
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,709
(Please call this number if you know anything...)

334
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,349
(about the suicide incident at Cheongdam International High.)

335
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,519
Right.

336
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,950
The crime has already been committed.

337
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I shouldn't have turned a blind eye.

338
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,559
I shouldn't have come to this darn school.

339
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,950
(Looking for Witness)

340
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,259
(Looking for Witness)

341
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm going crazy as is,

342
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,509
so why did you of all people have to show up?

343
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,039
Why are you biting my head off at the sight of me?

344
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,880
You agreed to ignore me.

345
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,279
So please just get lost.

346
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,789
What's going on?

347
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,519
Me and her.

348
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,729
We came to this school only to suffer,

349
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,890
so I was feeling bad for us.

350
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,730
I apologize for forgetting my place and getting greedy. Happy now?

351
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,970
There's no need to pity her.

352
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,099
What?

353
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,200
The Kim Hae In that died...

354
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,839
wasn't like you.

355
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,009
Were you the one who...

356
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:24,950
What?

357
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,019
Forget it.

358
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,420
Crying doesn't suit you.

359
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,289
Be yourself,

360
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,299
grab people by the hair,

361
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:42,730
and beat them up.

362
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,039
I thought you were going to power through and graduate?

363
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,740
You being nice is actually more annoying.

364
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,119
I was nice? Just now?

365
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,519
Well, you're crazy enough to make me give up.

366
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,430
(Oh Si Eun)

367
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,039
Also...

368
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,509
Be wary of Oh Si Eun.

369
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,450
(Oh Si Eun)

370
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,089
Seo Do Eon,

371
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,619
I'll accept your offer.

372
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,660
But help me out with something.

373
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,369
Hey, Seo Do...

374
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,799
What's going on?

375
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,109
- Did you two decide to... - Can you give us some privacy?

376
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,180
Why? What are you going to do?

377
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,919
- Don't tell me... - We're in our honeymoon phase.

378
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,279
What do you think? You know what I mean.

379
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,750
Right, Baby?

380
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,660
Yes.

381
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,960
Hurry up.

382
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:52,059
Hey, Seo Do Eon. You've changed a lot.

383
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,660
You weren't like this before.

384
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,869
Fine. I'll leave.

385
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,569
See you.

386
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,720
This isn't a joke, is it?

387
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,619
Shut it. Hurry up and look for it.

388
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,339
It's here.

389
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,170
But why won't it open?

390
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,309
- Darn it. - Hold on.

391
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,750
I found it.

392
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,130
Yes. Did you find it?

393
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,699
Yes. You know the drill, right?

394
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,028
Finish it off.

395
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:36,130
Of course. Bye.

396
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,339
What are you waiting for? Type in the password.

397
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,880
Okay.

398
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,509
But the thing is,

399
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,548
it was for personal use.

400
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,220
I wasn't planning on uploading it.

401
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,289
Does that justify your actions?

402
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,259
You creepy jerk. I can't believe you.

403
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:06,960
Everything needs to be erased for your classmates to be relieved.

404
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,829
Right?

405
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,670
Just type in the password to your cloud storage, you punk.

406
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,039
Okay.

407
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,220
And you have to complete the final task too.

408
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,220
Yes.

409
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,119
I better not see...

410
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,920
any of these videos anywhere.

411
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,490
I have a video of you on my phone too.

412
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,160
You'll be dead too.

413
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,569
Yes, sir.

414
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,099
If I erase everything, you'll delete my video too, right?

415
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,640
Why you little...

416
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,069
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,940
- Type your password. - Okay.

418
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,220
Yes, I'm the crazy girl who was acknowledged by Baek Je Na,

419
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,650
Kim Hye In.

420
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,920
I can't just let another crazy girl get the best of me.

421
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,630
- He's in his office, right? - Yes.

422
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,269
I heard.

423
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,670
I think...

424
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,450
What? What brings you here?

425
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,549
I was in the area, so I stopped by to have dinner with you.

426
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,250
But...

427
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,990
I didn't know Je Na would be here.

428
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,829
His one and only daughter came to visit him. What's wrong?

429
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,799
Do you feel uncomfortable because of me, Mom?

430
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,200
"Mom?"

431
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,000
Goodness.

432
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,868
A lot of people have their eyes on us.

433
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,710
Why did you already make her call you Mom?

434
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:01,439
I don't know what Je Na told you, but...

435
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,980
It's okay. It's totally understandable.

436
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:05,819
I'll get going then.

437
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,750
Why? Do you not want to have dinner with us?

438
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:12,118
He's right. You should come with us.

439
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,490
- Yes. - What do you like again?

440
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,259
I shouldn't bother you two on your date.

441
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,599
Also, I didn't come here to eat.

442
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,470
I came to watch my dad work.

443
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,569
So I could learn ahead of time.

444
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,980
Aren't you going on your date?

445
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,450
You're doing this on purpose, right?

446
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,359
Since when were you a sweet daughter?

447
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,789
What's wrong?

448
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:52,930
Is it even more annoying...

449
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,529
now that I'm sweet?

450
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,299
What?

451
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,699
People in conglomerate families...

452
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,109
act friendly with each other if needed.

453
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,210
You didn't even know that?

454
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,108
Did you say...

455
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,609
the baby in your stomach will be the heir of Hanmyung Group?

456
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,980
I wonder if he'll be able to...

457
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,289
against me.

458
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:21,089
On top of that, if he gets half of his genes from his mom,

459
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,588
it'll be difficult.

460
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,059
How dare you say that?

461
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,930
How dare you provoke me?

462
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,630
I'm Baek Je Na.

463
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,970
Listen carefully, Stepmom.

464
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,039
Your stepdaughter always gets revenge.

465
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,509
Whoever it may be.

466
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:04,799
(Oh Si Eun: D-5)

467
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,880
(Lee So Mang: I'll bring you Oh Si Eun's laptop soon too.)

468
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,450
Oh Si Eun.

469
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,390
Just you wait.

470
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,619
You're dead meat.

471
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,150
What is this?

472
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
What?

473
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,079
You silly, don't push.

474
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,789
- Hold on. - What?

475
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,528
(Kim Hae In)

476
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,500
There were others before you who changed here.

477
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:54,769
Lots of them.

478
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:57,869
Who in the world...

479
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,279
are you?
