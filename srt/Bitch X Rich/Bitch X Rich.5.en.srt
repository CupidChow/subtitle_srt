Then, it's her.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,490
The only daughter of Hanmyung Group's CEO.

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,659
Oh, Baek Je Na?

21
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,799
I hear she's gorgeous as well.

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,469
That's what I call a gifted life.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,840
I see. Her name is Baek Je Na?

24
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,280
What could someone like her...

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,280
lack in her life?

Whatever.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,680
It's so pretty.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,250
Je Na.

31
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,420
Gosh. Talk about rotten luck.

32
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,219
I don't spend all that money here...

33
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,219
just to share the space with a riff-raff.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,030
We apologize.

35
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,060
And now I've lost my appetite.

36
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,430
Bring the car around to take me home.

37
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,569
I'll also be walking out in these shoes.

38
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,810
Je Na, just a second.

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,310
What the... Who said you could acknowledge me?

40
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,479
Do you have a death wish?

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,419
I understand your hatred for me,

42
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,120
but the last thing I want is to be on the outs with you.

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,759
Am I supposed to be best friends with the broad who seduced my dad?

44
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,669
Who let the crazy cat out?

45
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,639
I feel bad about how this affected you,

46
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,969
but I don't feel any guilt toward your mother.

47
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,538
Let's be honest. I'm not the reason...

48
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,080
your parents drifted apart.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,680
I have no interest in your dad's company or his money.

50
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,750
Him being the CEO of Hanmyung Group doesn't mean much to me.

51
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,060
I love him for the man he is, and that's all.

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,090
I don't see how that makes me the villain.

53
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,068
You're buying a dress that costs more than your teacher's salary,

54
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,469
so cut this crap about your love being innocent.

55
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,180
Do you know why I see people like you as vermin?

56
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,948
I would've at least pitied you if you honestly said...

57
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,419
you were after his money.

58
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,719
You still have pride despite having nothing to your name.

59
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,609
I knew it. She told on me already.

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,740
(Dad)

61
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,680
Yes?

62
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,680
Ms. Je Na, he wants you to pick up.

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,490
Just say I'm not with you.

64
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,689
But he'll know that you're heading home.

65
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,419
Then, I'll just go somewhere else.

66
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,060
Don't you dare look for me.

67
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,189
Where did they go?

68
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,779
Hey.

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,250
- What's your issue? - What's your problem?

70
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,850
You're from my school?

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,519
And you dare act like this to me?

72
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,930
Don't people usually feign ignorance in this situation?

73
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,930
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,370
Are you a transfer student?

75
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,740
Do you know who I am?

76
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm letting you off today since I had a terrible day.

77
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:40,180
Don't let me see you in school.

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,949
What an uncultured freak.

79
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,350
That's rich coming from a thief!

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,949
Who said you could leave?

81
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,518
What are you doing? Have you lost it?

82
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,388
Jail is a luxury for people like you.

83
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,729
I'll teach you a lesson myself,

84
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,089
so bark on if you dare.

85
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,730
- Why you... - Let go of me, darn it!

86
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,069
You...

87
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,970
Darn.

88
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,268
- What do you think you're doing? - Stay still!

89
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,969
- Hey! - You thief!

90
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,740
Why isn't it coming off?

91
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,480
You thief. Just stay put.

92
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,279
- I paid a fortune for these. - Have you lost it?

93
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,370
(Kim Hye In)

94
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,579
Kim Hye In?

(Kim Hye In)

96
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,050
What...

97
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,160
Why were you in there?

98
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,569
I was looking for a book to read.

99
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,709
You're here early.

100
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,139
Judging by how worried the pastor was...

101
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,310
tells me that So Mang is acting up again.

102
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,319
Do you mean Lee So Mang in 12th grade?

103
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,990
Trouble caused on school grounds can be swept under the rug.

104
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,758
But he always...

105
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,089
gets into trouble somewhere other than on campus...

106
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,829
making it hard for us to do damage control.

107
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,629
Unbelievable.

108
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,769
You two aren't close, right?

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,939
Not really.

110
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,209
You should be wise about who you hang out with.

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,439
Not everyone can be considered as a friend.

112
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,680
Of course. Don't worry.

113
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,470
Lee So Mang?

114
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,370
I thought your dad would've grounded you.

115
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,469
I cashed that in for a punch to the face.

116
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,080
Who knew the pastor packed a mean punch?

117
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,379
My dad will go to the fiery pit. I'm sure of it.

118
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,229
All I'm asking is that you wrap it up for me like before.

119
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,759
How is that not possible?

120
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:22,370
I even have the receipt which says I bought it today.

121
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,399
With designer items, even shopping bags have price tags.

122
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,539
There are people online who sell the boxes and dust bags.

123
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:35,110
But I don't want to sell it for money.

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,879
I lost the bag and box because someone stole them.

125
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,820
I'm afraid we haven't come across this type of situation before.

126
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,000
This was the first designer item I bought,

127
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,669
but because of that crazy cow...

128
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,229
Ms. Je Na, what on earth...

129
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't say another word.

130
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,200
How dare she?

131
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,470
That crazy cow will get what's coming.

132
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,750
They say...

133
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,450
that decent shoes lead people to good places.

134
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,519
Do you know what shocked me the most...

135
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,590
when I first stepped foot...

136
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,960
on that school's campus?

137
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,059
What did you see?

138
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,669
A new world.

139
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,779
The school harboured a new world...

140
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,419
I was once oblivious of.

141
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,590
(Cheongdam International High School)

142
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,029
And I was enlightened.

143
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,370
I believed...

144
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,139
that my life was somewhat adequate...

145
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,850
only because...

146
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,580
I hadn't seen...

147
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,720
or experienced such things...

148
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,519
during the 18 years of my life.

149
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,999
I didn't know what I had to be jealous of.

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,239
Wait. I think I know this shop.

151
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,239
They sell an afternoon tea set, right?

152
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840
That's right. Let's go eat.

153
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,480
I was a loser whose world was tiny compared to theirs.

154
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,250
Ta-Da. Pretty, isn't it?

155
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,049
No way.

156
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,190
The clerk said it'd take a while to find the exact same stone.

157
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,490
I had it upgraded to replace the one you lost.

158
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,960
Oh, my.

159
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,960
- Let me put it on you. - Sure.

160
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,279
There.

161
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,279
It's pretty. I love it.

162
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,080
- Are you sure it's pretty? - Yes.

163
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,789
You can't see it properly.

164
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:35,990
This is torture.

165
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,460
You're being a gentleman, though.

166
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,759
Do you want some help?

167
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,129
Babe, why don't we just speed up the wedding?

168
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,200
It's not like we'll get to marry someone else.

169
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,529
Seriously, Je Na? Don't you know how to knock?

170
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,429
Hey, what happened to your face?

171
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,570
Did you injure yourself?

172
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,070
Babe, I'm hurting too. Can you relieve my pain?

173
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
What?

174
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,340
- Baek Je Na, you... - Darn it!

175
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,179
I'm fuming.

176
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,190
What is this about?

177
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,960
There's someone I must find.

178
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,230
You wait and see.

179
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,870
I'll make sure attending school is a living nightmare for you.

180
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,210
Welcome to Cheongdam International High.

181
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,980
I'll work hard until I graduate.

182
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,049
- As in how? - In every way.

183
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,590
I like how passionate you are.

184
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,419
This is the key to your locker.

185
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,018
Ask the student volunteer...

186
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,159
if you have any more questions.

187
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,559
- Right. I'll see you later, then. - Sure.

188
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,169
Bucket?

189
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,169
You...

190
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,850
Meeting like this again should be considered as destiny.

191
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:43,779
As if.

192
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,779
Come on, Bucket. Who knew we'd meet again like this?

193
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,789
Can you stop calling me Bucket?

194
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,460
Why? It's a nickname only we know about.

195
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,690
If I'm Bucket, that'll make you Sick Pervert.

196
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,190
Wait. That doesn't sound so bad.

197
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,158
I was bored at school anyway.

198
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,960
Enough with the nonsense.

199
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,039
Making a good impression on the first day is everything.

200
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,439
Anyway, I've seen most of the school myself,

201
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,210
so I don't need a tour.

202
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,480
This is where we should part ways.

203
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:14,950
Take care.

204
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,820
Wait, you can't leave like this.

205
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,378
What's your problem?

206
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,850
I'm not done telling you about the real juicy parts of the school.

207
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,048
I don't smoke,

208
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,189
so I don't need to know about the juicy spots.

209
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,129
I wasn't talking about the places to smoke.

210
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,100
If only you knew of the hierarchy within the school...

211
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,299
You should let go.

212
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,500
Seo Do Eon?

213
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,340
She's not interested.

214
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,110
Why are you grabbing on to her when she isn't interested?

215
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,450
How does this concern you?

216
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,720
Do you know her?

217
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,029
You're the one who's grabbing her without a cause.

218
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,900
Hey, Bucket. You don't know him, do you?

219
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,339
I can get to know her starting today.

220
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,979
Just because you are...

221
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,278
the heir apparent to CI Foundation...

222
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,519
doesn't make you her Prince Charming.

223
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,720
You're a diamond.

224
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,460
So act like one and be with your queen.

225
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,190
Bucket here lives in a different world.

226
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,670
Go off on your own.

227
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,980
But that makes me look like the bad guy.

228
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,690
You're a fun one,

229
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Bucket.

230
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,569
Sorry about that.

231
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,670
My grip was too strong.

232
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,180
It wasn't that bad.

233
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,220
Anyway,

234
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,759
I'm Seo Do Eon in 11th grade.

235
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,829
If school life gets hard for you,

236
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,900
call me anytime.

237
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,069
If that's what you suggest...

238
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I got it.

239
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,559
- I'll get going, then. - Sure.

240
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,369
Wait. I didn't tell him my name.

241
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,440
Seo Do Eon, my name is Kim Hye In.

242
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,170
H, Y, E. Hye In.

243
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,480
What he enjoys doing are costly activities.

244
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,420
Maybe his dad owns a super big company.

245
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,890
He has a girlfriend?

246
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,569
Sorry about that.

247
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,140
If you have eyes, use them.

248
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,779
Hold on.

249
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,650
Why does this feel familiar?

250
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,180
What the...

251
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,950
Is it their first time seeing a transfer student?

252
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,730
What? Why is this...

253
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,869
What was that?

254
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,779
I just tripped. Are you all just going to stare at me?

255
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,380
What are you doing?

256
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,720
I think it's her.

257
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,650
She said she'd be a transfer student...

258
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,819
who looks feisty and poor.

259
00:21:58,289 --> 00:21:59,289
What?

260
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,430
Do you know how curious I was?

261
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,929
I was dying to know...

262
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,429
what you did to make our school's queen so furious...

263
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,969
and why she couldn't find any information about you.

264
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,039
I thought maybe the president had your back or something.

265
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,769
What the heck are you talking about?

266
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,569
But you're...

267
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,680
an equal education parasite, aren't you?

268
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,210
What?

269
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:45,569
I thought...

270
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,269
good shoes took you to good places.

271
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,539
But...

272
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,980
the shoes that I mistook as mine...

273
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,079
She's over here!

274
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,519
took me to the fiery pit.

275
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,309
Kim Hye In?

276
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,779
Did you admit me after knowing everything?

277
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,220
What do you mean?

278
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,950
They're treating me like trash for being an equal education candidate.

279
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,549
You acted as if you cared by mentioning scholarships.

280
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,960
How are you going to take responsibility?

281
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,490
“Responsibility?”

282
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,499
You're the reason I came to this school.

283
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,829
You should take responsibility.

284
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,809
Right.

285
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,309
The annual tuition costs 100,000 dollars,

286
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,710
and others can't attend this school even if they want to.

287
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,619
Who should you thank for being here?

288
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,150
Hello?

289
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,920
I have an offer to make.

290
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:19,299
An offer that can change...

291
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,799
your miserable life.

292
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:27,569
I looked into it, and there was no evidence found at the scene...

293
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,970
or anything that could be of harm to the school.

294
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,380
It seems as though Kim Hye In was cooperative.

295
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,809
That's what she stated?

296
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,079
Yes, sir.

297
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,049
Kim Hye In said she didn't see the culprit's face.

298
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,990
All right. You may head home now.

299
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,430
(Cheongdam International High School Application for Enrolment)

300
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,400
The choice is yours, Hye In.

301
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:00,670
(Seo Hee Soo)

302
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,710
If you want, I can transfer you back to your old school.

303
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,380
Is that what you want?

304
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,650
That's not my point right now.

305
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,058
I was just saying you should do something about...

306
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,089
I see.

307
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,599
So, on top of your admission and scholarship benefits,

308
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:29,400
you want me to be responsible for your peer relationships?

309
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,339
You're still a child.

310
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,609
There's only one thing I can do for you.

311
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,349
Letting you in...

312
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:48,890
and out.

313
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,890
The rest is up to you.

314
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,259
So make a choice.

315
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,930
Will you grab the chance that's been given to you...

316
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,970
or will you return to your miserable past?

317
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,309
I can see that you enjoyed my special welcoming ceremony.

318
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
You...

319
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,480
Do you think you have an idea of who I am now?

320
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,480
That crazy girl from yesterday?

321
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,219
You were from this school?

322
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,319
How dare you?

323
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,518
Can't you tell after seeing all that's happened?

324
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,230
How are you so slow?

325
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Don't tell me...

326
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,230
Did you incite all of the students to go berserk...

327
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,000
on my first day of school?

328
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,700
Just because of what happened yesterday?

329
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,980
What? "Incite?"

330
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,910
Me?

331
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,349
Just because of you?

332
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,519
Who on earth are you?

333
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,650
I'm Baek Je Na, and since you got on my bad side,

334
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,990
you can consider your school life to be doomed.

335
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,240
(Who do you think is the most influential teen in Korea?)

336
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,470
(Baek Je Na)

337
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,009
I see. Her name is Baek Je Na?

338
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:34,150
I'm curious too.

339
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,548
What could someone like her lack in her life?

340
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,190
(Write a comment.)

341
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,029
I'm doomed.

342
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:52,900
You must be insane.

343
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:57,940
Seriously...

344
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,849
Hey. Get her.

345
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,980
- Je Na, are you okay? - Are you okay?

346
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,789
She's bleeding.
