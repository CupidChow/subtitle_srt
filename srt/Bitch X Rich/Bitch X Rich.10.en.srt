11
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,979
You silly, don't push.

12
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,759
- Wait. - What is it?

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,709
(Kim Hae In)

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,980
"Kim Hae In."

(Kim Hae In)

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,209
Kim Hae In.

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,140
What on earth happened to you?

18
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,579
Who in the world...

19
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,950
are you?

20
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,989
(Oh Si Eun: D-3)

21
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,030
You startled me.

22
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,569
Seo Do Eon?

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,400
What is it?

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,909
I just wanted to ask you something.

25
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,240
That was all.

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,520
So what is it that you wanted to ask?

27
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,020
Before I do that...

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,469
Are you sick?

29
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,770
You don't look good.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,139
I'm fine.

31
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,610
It might be because I haven't gotten a good night's sleep last night.

32
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,110
Just tell me what this is about. I'm busy.

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,180
It's nothing serious.

34
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,719
I have a favour to ask you.

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,919
What is it?

36
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,030
A date.

37
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,900
Woo Jin and Yul Hee are having an anniversary party.

38
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,810
What was that look?

39
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,219
Oh, right.

40
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,620
I could be humiliated at the party again.

41
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,879
Hey.

42
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,189
You pulled a pretty cute stunt.

43
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,158
How could you trust...

44
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,759
Lee Duk Min, that big slow poke, to get anything done?

45
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,329
Gosh. Seriously. This proves my point.

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,730
Fools like you will never get their way.

47
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,198
You see, I have your video. I'll never let you take it from me.

48
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,600
I could never let that happen.

49
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,480
The more I think about it, it's making me angrier.

50
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,180
- Should I just post it online now? - Okay.

51
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,410
Fine.

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,620
Give me some time...

53
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,750
to get myself ready.

54
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,059
The moment I tell people that Baek Je Na was the culprit,

55
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,499
I will be breaking the promise I made to the school director.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,899
Then I'll get expelled for sure.

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,769
It will ruin my life.

58
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,069
Hye In.

59
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,639
I've already given you plenty of time.

60
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,250
Then...

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,519
let me ask you this before I do anything.

62
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,019
What is it?

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,670
(Kim Hae In)

64
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,470
Oh, that.

65
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,709
I know that.

66
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,750
I told you about that, you fool.

67
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,720
Kim Hae In was threatening Baek Je Na.

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,920
So when Hae In died,

69
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,620
I was really sad.

70
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,458
She didn't even get what she wanted.

71
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,230
Who knew Je Na would do that to her?

72
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,800
Then...

73
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,569
you were behind everything?

74
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,610
That stupid girl.

75
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,849
Seriously. She should have used her brain...

76
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,310
to go up against Baek Je Na.

77
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,350
But you know what?

78
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,649
The biggest fool is Min Yul Hee.

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,819
She has no idea that her boyfriend cheated on her with Kim Hae In.

80
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,730
(Restricted Number)

81
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,069
- Wait. - What is it?

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,639
Do something. Come on.

83
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,009
I wonder if Seo Do Eon also knows...

84
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,620
that you like to sleep around with other guys.

85
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,120
You're poor, but you pretended to have self-respect.

86
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,120
You put on quite an act.

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,560
Even if Do Eon likes you now,

88
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,958
the moment he watches this video,

89
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,629
he won't like you anymore.

90
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,869
(Oh Si Eun: Remember the favour I asked you?)

91
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,269
Remember the favour I asked you?

92
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,069
You'd better do it.

93
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,648
(Remember the favour I asked you? You'd better do it.)

94
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,179
(Kim Hae In: You have to keep your promise.)

95
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,919
What is this?

96
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,590
It was you who lured me out here?

97
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,559
Was it...

98
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,830
really Baek Je Na?

99
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,970
Why would I make stuff up?

100
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,808
Don't waste your energy,

101
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,210
playing this pointless game of detective.

102
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,620
By the way,

103
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,090
that's the last thing you should be worried about.

104
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,889
What?

105
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,959
If you don't do what I say,

106
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,730
the entire school will watch your video.

107
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,299
Did you know?

108
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,899
You know the dead girl, Kim Hae In?

109
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,769
She begged me right where you're standing.

110
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,269
I'm just saying.

111
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,909
Bye.

112
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,899
I told you about this place.

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,169
The first-floor girls' restroom in the main building.

114
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,279
You told me no one would come here.

115
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,779
Hey.

116
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,830
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,870
I shouldn't have let Duk Min do it. I should have done it myself.

118
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,610
It's okay.

119
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,679
She's worse than what I've heard.

120
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,250
Hey, you just wait. Okay?

121
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,620
I'll fix this for you.

122
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,058
Forget it. Besides, how could you fix this?

123
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,129
Don't say that.

124
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,330
Gosh, that crazy girl.

125
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,110
Hey, let's report her to the police.

126
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,049
So Mang.

127
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,750
Do you know the first thing I learned...

128
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,279
after transferring to this school?

129
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,460
I don't have...

130
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,529
rich or powerful parents. So for equal education parasites...

131
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,500
like me,

132
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,769
no matter how hard we try,

133
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,870
some things can't be changed.

134
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,519
And that's how my family can keep making money. You know?

135
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
What?

136
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,559
Trust, hope, and love.

137
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,230
You know, the false hope that some things might change...

138
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,769
if they pray to the Almighty.

139
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,149
I'll grant you your wish.

140
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,419
Oh Si Eun.

141
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,889
You want me to scold her, right?

142
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,570
- Happy anniversary! - Happy anniversary!

143
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,969
Congratulations!

144
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,139
Gosh, you guys are amazing.

145
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,808
I really want to see you get married.

146
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,149
Yul Hee, I'm so jealous. Seriously.

147
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,079
Woo Jin prepared everything for me as a surprise.

148
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,489
- Good for you. - Gosh.

149
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,619
I had no idea he was throwing me a party.

150
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,820
No wonder. He suddenly changed the venue.

151
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,529
Hey, I'm buying everything here.

152
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,659
- Gosh. - Woo Jin is the best!

153
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,128
Can you take a picture of me and the flowers? Join me.

154
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,299
- Great. - Sounds good.

155
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,168
- Make me look pretty. - All right.

156
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,839
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

157
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,408
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 2, 3.

158
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,508
- You guys make a great couple. - Woo Jin, you look great.

159
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,710
- Gosh. Seriously. - You know? Woo Jin...

160
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,350
In 1, 2, 3.

161
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,018
- In 1, 2, 3. - You look so pretty.

162
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,778
- Smile. - How beautiful.

163
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,189
- You look so handsome, Woo Jin. - So pretty.

164
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,860
- Let's take a selfie. - The pictures look great.

165
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,128
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

166
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,870
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

167
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,340
You smoke?

168
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,309
Oh, this? Sometimes.

169
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,549
Do you want one?

170
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,350
No.

171
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:01,809
Seo Do Eon.

172
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,309
Why do you think...

173
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,480
something like that happened to Kim Hae In?

174
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,789
What do you mean?

175
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,259
You said you were close to that girl, Hae In.

176
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,429
You must at least have some idea why this happened.

177
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,939
Someone pushed Kim Hae In off the rooftop because...

178
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,570
the culprit wanted to kill Hae In.

179
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,070
The culprit must have had...

180
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,279
a motive or a reason.

181
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,480
Actually,

182
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,019
I'm curious about that too.

183
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,259
Hae In is such a sweet girl.

184
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,529
What could she have done so wrong...

185
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,500
that someone pushed her off the rooftop?

186
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,809
She's sweet...

187
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,080
and innocent?

188
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,919
You've never thought that you might be wrong about Kim Hae In?

189
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,389
What am I wrong about Hae In?

190
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,330
Nothing.

191
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,070
If I remember...

192
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,169
anything about the culprit,

193
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,269
I'll tell you.

194
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,950
Thanks.

195
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,690
There are times...

196
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,629
I think that I might have been wrong.

197
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,059
Really?

198
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,970
About you.

199
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,470
You, Kim Hye In.

200
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,409
- We'll win this round. - Let's just play one round.

201
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,309
Yes. I want to try it this time.

202
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,819
Should I move this?

203
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,450
Well, I want to hit the red one. How do I do it?

204
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,490
I'll teach you.

205
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:40,960
- Hey. - What?

206
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,700
Is that a famous brand?

207
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:46,970
What?

208
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,069
The necklace. The one Yul Hee is wearing.

209
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,279
What? Are you going to ask Seo Do Eon to buy you one?

210
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,519
That's expensive.

211
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,549
That's not why I'm asking.

212
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,430
Even if you have money, you can't because of the waiting list.

213
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,000
That's ridiculous...

214
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,119
I thought you were still upset at me.

215
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,430
You're not bullying Hye In now.

216
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,339
Are you watching me?

217
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,799
You've gone mad over a girl again.

218
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,140
You went on and on about how different she was.

219
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,380
Maybe, poor girls might be really your thing.

220
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:04,920
Watch your mouth.

221
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,089
I can't put up with that even if you're my friend.

222
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,420
I hate that...

223
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,000
sometimes, you remind me of my mom so much.

224
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,400
What about you? You're so drunk right now.

225
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,730
Hey!

226
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,139
It's you who threw away our friendship of 18 years...

227
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,339
over some girl.

228
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,109
You...

229
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,179
Do you really not know why I'm doing this to you?

230
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,319
Talk to me then.

231
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,589
Was there a time you actually told me everything?

232
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,329
Fine. I'll tell you everything.

233
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,589
Then be honest with me.

234
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,700
Hey, Kim Hye In.

235
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,599
You said you were certain it was a girl, right?

236
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,400
My father...

237
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,509
will not cover up something like this just for anyone.

238
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,250
She had to be from a powerful family he could benefit from.

239
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,380
Wait. You don't think I...

240
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,160
You think I killed her?

241
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,788
- Hey! - You've always hated her!

242
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,959
Come on, stop it.

243
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,000
You said it was good that she died!

244
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,029
Hey. Is being poor such a sin to you?

245
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,969
You're always bullying others!

246
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,838
It's because you're so naive. You don't know you're being fooled!

247
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,410
Come on, you guys.

248
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,539
Let's go, Je Na. What's wrong?

249
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,210
Fine, it's not a sin that Hae In is poor.

250
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,519
But she tried to extort me for money as a poor person.

251
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:49,819
Is that not a sin?

252
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,119
What did you say?

253
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,089
- Let's go, Je Na. - Let go!

254
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,960
You think it was just me?

255
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,740
She blackmailed that punk too.

256
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,369
Guess why?

257
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,848
Because Hae In slept with your boyfriend.

258
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,848
- Hey! - You think I wouldn't know?

259
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,519
Have you gone mad? What do you think you're doing?

260
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,089
Where are you going? Je Na!

261
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,729
- Don't you leave! - Stop it.

262
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,859
Baek Je Na!

263
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,099
- Hey. - Stop it.

264
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,970
Hey, Je Na!

265
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,440
Let go of me! Look at this punk.

266
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:57,049
(Restricted Number)

267
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,730
- Wait. - What are you doing?

268
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,059
Just do something, will you?

269
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,239
(You had better listen to my request.)

270
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
You had better...

271
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,869
listen to my request.

272
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,589
(Park Woo Jin)

273
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,159
Kim Hae In! What is this video for?

274
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,829
- What are you doing? - You know.

275
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,769
If Yul Hee finds out about this,

276
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:45,569
what will happen to your marriage?

277
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,099
Have you lost it?

278
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,740
Where are you?

279
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:53,380
Where are you? I'll find you and kill you!

280
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,450
Hey!

281
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:02,950
So?

282
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,690
What do you want from me?

283
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,329
What I want?

284
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Will you do as I ask?

285
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,569
Let me hear it first.

286
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,170
Also, stay away from me and my friends from now on.

287
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,609
Oh, one more thing.

288
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,809
Stop toying with Do Eon.

289
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,819
I know that you slept with Woo Jin already.

290
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,450
I...

291
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,220
- truly like Do Eon. - Why, you little...

292
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,160
I...

293
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,460
I've always disliked you.

294
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,299
What makes you so bold and arrogant?

295
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,599
Besides being born rich by chance,

296
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,569
how are you different from me?

297
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,309
What makes you better?

298
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,349
I'm just trying to turn my life around.

299
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,920
Is that such a sin to you?

300
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
How can you do this to me?

301
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,299
Today was supposed to be my happiest day.

302
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,930
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,670
I wasn't planning to tell you like that.

304
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,970
But I've thought hard about it.

305
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,140
That jerk Woo Jin is fooling you because you don't know...

306
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,619
I knew.

307
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,250
What?

308
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,359
I knew everything.

309
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,630
Now Woo Jin is wrapped around my finger.

310
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,029
Yul Hee.

311
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,869
For you,

312
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,279
you wanted to hide your dad's secret.

313
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,279
I have my own skeletons to hide too.

314
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,619
But then,

315
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,750
you...

316
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,960
ruined all of that today.

317
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,609
Hey, give me a ride.

318
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,950
I missed the last bus.

319
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,970
It's my first time bringing someone over.

320
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,180
What?

321
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,980
First time seeing such a small house?

322
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:04,890
Je Na.

323
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,200
Come here.

324
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,789
You...

325
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,960
Where did you get this?

326
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,190
I want to hit the green ball.

327
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,129
Then, move to the side and...

328
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,389
How about Balls 6 and 7?

329
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,430
Those are good.

330
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,660
He's the best.

331
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,599
Oh, gosh.

332
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,799
- Fine. - I'll help you.

333
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,849
Earlier, you said...

334
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,750
that this necklace couldn't be bought even if you had money.

335
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
No way.

336
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,200
Both Si Eun and Do Eon...

337
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:19,000
may think that you're the culprit.

338
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,569
But I know.

339
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,839
You're not the one.

340
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,549
Because this necklace...

341
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:37,250
was given to me by Hae In...

342
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,819
who fell that night.

343
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,170
Now you know...

344
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,940
who the culprit is.

345
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,118
I got you a better one since you lost it.

346
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,059
How pretty! I like it.

347
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,960
- Are you sure it's pretty? - Yes.

348
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,759
I can't see it at all.

349
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,269
Pretty, isn't it?

350
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,069
Does she know a secret of his?

351
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,779
You're not hiding anything from me, are you?

352
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,049
Of course not.

353
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,150
Have you really not done it with anyone else?

354
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:43,990
Of course not.

355
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,859
Who else would I do it with other than you?

356
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:50,660
You're right.

357
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,759
If you did, I'll kill myself.

358
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,930
Don't joke about things like that. It upsets me.

359
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,279
- Let me take this call. - Okay.

360
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:19,619
Listen.

361
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,390
If Yul Hee finds out about this,

362
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,609
you'll...

363
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:40,880
really...

364
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,509
be dead by my hands.

365
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,559
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

366
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,740
Yul Hee. Why are you here?

367
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,450
You dirty fox. How dare you touch what's mine?

368
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:17,809
How dare you touch mine!

369
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:21,220
Oh, gosh. What's your problem?

370
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,420
You're asking me?

371
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,660
You don't know why?

372
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,190
You witch.

373
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,430
Don't you know you'll get poisoned if you touch other's food?

374
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,299
You're just a vermin.

375
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,269
How dare you?

376
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,299
How dare a vermin like you touch my...

377
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,269
Stop it!

378
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:46,139
You're the one who should snap out of it.

379
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,880
What's so good about Woo Jin?

380
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,609
Hey!

381
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,548
You witch!

382
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,390
- You little... - Let go!

383
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,219
Let go!

384
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,289
Let go!

385
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,950
(Kim Hae In)

386
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,339
What's going on?

387
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,450
Why is Si Eun so quiet this morning?

388
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,090
Don't tell me So Mang really...

389
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,360
Tonight's the night, at 12am.

390
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,329
Of course, it's still the same.

391
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,829
There's no way it'll change.

392
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,690
(Director's Office)

393
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,880
Where are you now?

394
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,489
There's only an hour left to midnight.

395
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,659
I'll meet you first. Let's talk about it.

396
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,760
Let's strike a new deal.

397
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,070
What?

398
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,500
Strike a new deal?

399
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,909
Gosh, you're so brazen.

400
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,710
You're the one who didn't keep your promise.

401
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,510
I know the true culprit...

402
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,480
who killed Hae In.

403
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:45,980
Well,

404
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,150
I don't think that'll be news to me.

405
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,960
You're at school, right?

406
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,420
I'll be there in five minutes. Wait for me.

407
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,889
Let's talk when we meet.

408
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,130
You can decide for yourself...

409
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,130
whether I have more news for you.

410
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,550
(New post)

411
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,079
I don't need to see you again, Kim Hye In.

412
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,260
You're here.

413
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,189
How unexpected, though.

414
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,860
That you'd ask to meet me first...

415
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:45,710
Is this brat even in school?

416
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,409
Did she lie on purpose to screw me over?

417
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,539
In that moment,

418
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,340
I thought...

419
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,050
that was a deja vu.

420
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,030
I knew it.

421
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,369
This school...

422
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,980
is definitely cursed.

423
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,690
(Bitch x Rich)

424
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,949
(Epilogue)

425
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,219
Why did you do that?

426
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,590
I'm...

427
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:19,929
so confused.

428
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,630
Please wake up and explain to me.

429
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,710
Even if they're just excuses,

430
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,809
I hope you tell me something, at least.

431
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:31,900
