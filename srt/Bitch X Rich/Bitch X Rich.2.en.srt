(in this drama are fictional.)

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,350
Fess up when I ask...

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,780
nicely.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,189
Who tipped off the Anti-Bullying Committee?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,990
Who was it?

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,130
Look at you guys.

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,500
You're going to ignore me?

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,170
You're not going to answer me?

18
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,280
Hey, where are you going?

19
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,519
Where is Do Eon going?

20
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,590
That's enough!

21
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,859
You guys are the ones who bullied us for no reason.

22
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,870
- What have we done so wrong? - You startled me!

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,579
Hey.

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,439
You're basically telling me that it was you who told on us, right?

25
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,849
You got some guts.

26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,920
- Gosh. You... - I'm leaving.

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay. Already?

28
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:00,963
Gosh. I haven't figured out who tipped off the committee yet.

29
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:03,402
I was determined to find out who ratted us out...

30
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:05,773
even if I had to force-feed the water and then crush that rat.

31
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,802
Okay? Don't just stand there with your mouth glued.

32
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:11,672
Come on. Talk.

33
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,012
Why don't you drink it?

34
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:15,843
What?

35
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,223
You couldn't figure out who ratted us out.

36
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,292
Hey.

37
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:29,262
Jump into the water now.

38
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,142
Me?

39
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:46,042
Darn it.

40
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:55,022
You over there.

41
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:02,593
You asked what you had done so wrong.

42
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,403
Are you really that clueless?

43
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,172
Being born poor is your fault.

44
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:24,982
(Bitch x Rich)

45
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:26,313
Gosh.

46
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:29,823
- Gosh. No way. - It's so pretty.

47
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,323
Look at this.

48
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,123
I wanted this.

49
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,522
Gosh.

50
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:39,962
Where is this place?

51
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,163
The picture came out really nicely.

52
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,033
Oh, there?

53
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:47,672
The light in the kitchen at my house is great for selfies.

54
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,272
How much did you pay for these Mary Jane shoes?

55
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,313
I want to have shoes from this brand too.

56
00:03:55,742 --> 00:04:00,153
I think they were about 800 or 900 dollars.

57
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:01,552
What?

58
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:04,693
From what I remember, their shoes start selling at 1,000 dollars.

59
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:05,723
Right.

60
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,362
Do they? I got confused.

61
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:15,533
By the way, why do you only post them on Instagram?

62
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,532
You could have worn them to school at least once.

63
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,673
Right.

64
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,142
There was this student in my department in college.

65
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:26,943
She was gorgeous.

66
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:29,043
And she had a smoking hot body too.

67
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,452
Since she went to my school, she was probably smart too.

68
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,082
Seeing how she only wore brand designer shoes and clothes,

69
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,623
it looked like her family was rich too.

70
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:40,493
Driving an Avante was impressive for her age.

71
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,462
But she drove a Mercedes. What more do I have to say?

72
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:45,662
But you know what she told me?

73
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:50,332
She said she had never gotten any allowance from her parents.

74
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,142
Apparently, she had earned her own money since she was young.

75
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,412
Actually, I need to tell you something.

76
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:05,082
I have never gotten any allowance from my parents.

77
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,782
I work part-time jobs to buy everything.

78
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,452
I tutor middle school students.

79
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,352
Or I work at a convenience store.

80
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:14,063
Gosh. Really?

81
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:15,392
Yes.

82
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,032
Then what about all the brand designer items on Instagram?

83
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:20,332
That's why I asked her too.

84
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,662
"How did you manage to buy a Mercedes..."

85
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,873
"and the brand designer clothes?"

86
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:26,503
What did she say?

87
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,272
"Aren't parents..."

88
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,613
"supposed to feed me, clothe me, and provide a shelter?"

89
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,642
"My father will only let me borrow the car..."

90
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:38,253
"until I can buy my own."

91
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,113
"Except for those,"

92
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:42,852
"I did have to earn money on my own to support myself."

93
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,522
That's what she said.

94
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,923
My parents are supposed...

95
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:50,193
to provide for me with basic necessities like that.

96
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:54,363
But I make money on my own to support myself.

97
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:57,433
Gosh. No way.

98
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,573
So I didn't want to bring them to school and show them off...

99
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,472
because my parents bought them for me.

100
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:07,782
Besides, they are pretty expensive.

101
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,012
I might lose them too.

102
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:10,412
What?

103
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,512
Only you and I don't get this.

104
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,782
But she's super popular at my school.

105
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,823
She's got the looks, the brains, the body, and the money.

106
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,222
She's got everything.

107
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:22,563
Yet, she works part-time jobs to support herself.

108
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,092
She's known as the daughter every parent wants.

109
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:27,092
Hye In, that's really amazing.

110
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,402
And you get good grades too.

111
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,032
She's like the girls we read about online.

112
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,873
One of those daughters every parent wants.

113
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:37,212
Hey, can you upload more posts?

114
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,313
If you have more than 10,000 followers,

115
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:40,782
you can get a lot of offers for ads and sponsorships.

116
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,082
You won't even have to promote yourself then.

117
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:49,852
How much can you make if you get those offers for ads?

118
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:53,253
You'll at least make 3,000 or 4,000 dollars a month.

119
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:54,662
I saw my friends do it.

120
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:08,642
An executed purpose is a transaction...

121
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:11,043
in which the time and the energy spent...

122
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,043
on the execution are balanced against the resulting assets.

123
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:18,412
And the ideal case is one in which the former approximates...

124
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,152
to zero and the latter to infinity.

125
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,722
Who's sleeping in the back row?

126
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,563
Can you wake her up?

127
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:32,993
Come on. Wake her up.

128
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:34,902
That's Baek Je Na.

129
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,503
The only daughter of Hanmyung Group's CEO.

130
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,102
Does that give her the right...

131
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:41,902
to doze off in my class?

132
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,722
Wake up now.

133
00:07:58,392 --> 00:07:59,493
What is this?

134
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:02,592
When students get bad grades...

135
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,762
or their grades go down, I don't fault them for that.

136
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,092
But their attitude in class is a different story.

137
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:12,133
I know that you all come from prestigious families.

138
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:16,772
But as a student, you should be able to show basic manners.

139
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,282
An executed purpose is a transaction...

140
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,053
in which the time and the energy spent...

141
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:31,423
on the execution are balanced against the resulting assets.

142
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:35,462
And the ideal case is one in which the former approximates to zero...

143
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:37,632
and the latter to infinity.

144
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,202
Did you know?

145
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,403
Your pronunciation is awful.

146
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,813
I heard you were new here.

147
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:52,712
You're a contract teacher...

148
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,813
who doesn't even have the basic qualifications to teach here.

149
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,283
How dare you talk to me about my basic manners?

150
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,482
Know your place.

151
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,533
Right. Ma'am, the tutor is here.

152
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,002
It will take some time until Na Yeon gets home.

153
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,263
She's been coming early lately.

154
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,832
She comes early to prepare for her lesson.

155
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:20,433
Hello, ma'am.

156
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,872
Teaching Na Yeon must be a lot of work for you.

157
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,183
I should tell the lady to take better care of you.

158
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,283
It's okay. That's my job.

159
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,252
Gosh, don't say that.

160
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,423
Please check on her, so she has everything she needs.

161
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:38,823
Of course.

162
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:10,183
(Kim Hye In, posts, followers, following)

163
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,193
Okay.

164
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,462
I need to get a lot more followers if I want any ad deals...

165
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:18,793
on Instagram.

166
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,602
Since I post about the same stuff,

167
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,533
people don't seem that interested.

168
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:47,582
What are you doing in there?

169
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:53,252
Well...

170
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:55,592
I was going to use the bathroom,

171
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,563
but I was looking around because this looked so cool.

172
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,462
But still.

173
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,732
If you do that when you're alone, people might get the wrong idea.

174
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,602
Right.

175
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,832
What's this?

176
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:43,602
Gosh.

177
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,783
This is the uniform of the school only rich kids go to.

178
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,632
Excuse me.

179
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:09,803
Yes.

180
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,502
This is the school uniform...

181
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,502
of the high school Na Yeon will attend, right?

182
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,472
Why does she already have this?

183
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,842
Oh, that. The thing about that uniform is...

184
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,683
What was that called? Golden something. To sew...

185
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,112
the school uniform by hand with that special fabric,

186
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:28,882
she had to order the uniform in advance.

187
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:31,852
She probably ordered that at the best premium shop...

188
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,023
in Gangnam a year ago.

189
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,423
Her mother can be quite impatient.

190
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,492
Goodness.

191
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,163
What if Na Yeon doesn't get in?

192
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,332
No way. Not with the amount of money she poured into that.

193
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:47,273
Anyway, the school uniform was delivered in a limousine.

194
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,342
Make sure to hang it back safely.

195
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,273
Okay.

196
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:17,533
I got it.

197
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:26,673
Gosh.

198
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,482
It can't hold a light to my school uniform.

199
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,033
What should I write?

200
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,632
(Recent)

201
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:54,972
I should post this one.

202
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,073
I got to try on...

203
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:01,783
(I got to try on the school uniform...)

204
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:04,043
(of the famous Cheongdam International High School.)

205
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,413
(Should I transfer schools?)

206
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:09,023
(Post)

207
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:33,573
Lucky you,

208
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,683
Kang Na Yeon.

209
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,523
I'm home.

210
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:53,132
What? Why is she home already?

211
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,933
- You're home early. - Where's my mom?

212
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,773
She just went out for her gathering.

213
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,033
Great. Where did you put...

214
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,202
the school uniform that had arrived yesterday?

215
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:03,842
I want to post a picture on my Instagram.

216
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:05,673
- Go to the dressing room. - Okay.

217
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:12,882
Oh, no.

218
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:15,482
Why is this button so stiff?

219
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:19,053
Come on. It's not in there.

220
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:23,693
Gosh.

221
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,972
That goldfish housekeeper.

222
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,943
Why did she say that the school uniform was in the dressing room?

223
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:45,082
What if it's not in the room either?

224
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,952
Ma'am!

225
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,683
Please leave the room.

226
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,163
What's this?

227
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:14,912
(Notifications)

228
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:19,053
Is this Sun Ju?

229
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:31,533
(Where did you get your hair done? It looks great on you.)

230
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,733
(I wish my school uniform looked like that.)

231
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:39,733
(Aren't the shopping bags from luxury brands?)

232
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:40,832
(Is that her dressing room? Her clothes look so classy.)

233
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,783
(My Dressing Room)

234
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,553
This is nuts!

235
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,543
You're not Ms. Sun Ju...

236
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:19,013
but Ms. Hye In, is it?

237
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,313
Wait. That's wrong.

238
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,912
You're only two years older than me.

239
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,352
I'll just call you Hye In, okay?

240
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:34,253
I didn't mean anything bad. Believe me.

241
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,192
I don't care.

242
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:39,233
Doesn't falsifying academic records count as fraud?

243
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,162
My mom will sue if she finds out.

244
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:44,503
I'll tell her...

245
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,902
that I'm quitting due to personal issues.

246
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:51,743
Please don't tell your mom, okay?

247
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,882
Think of it as a favour for me. Please?

248
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:04,283
Okay, then.

249
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:05,692
Really?

250
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,092
Thank you so much, Na Yeon.

251
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,862
You're the nicest middle schooler I know.

252
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:17,862
I'll make sure to repay your kindness.

253
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:25,713
But I didn't say I'm letting you off.

254
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:30,543
What?

255
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:34,513
As you said,

256
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,953
I'll refrain from telling my mom.

257
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,453
However,

258
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:42,063
you should make it up for lying to me.

259
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:46,862
Do you have GS Pay?

260
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,503
It's 2 dollars and 80 cents.

261
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,023
- I'll pay with this. - Okay.

262
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:19,463
Transaction complete.

263
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:22,303
- Have a nice day. - Please take your card.

264
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,632
Are you done with Math?

265
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:30,142
Almost there.

266
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:39,682
(Kang Na Yeon)

267
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,953
Why are middle school problems so hard now?

268
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,823
I didn't learn this back then.

269
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:50,592
Come on. Do a proper job.

270
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,011
Use colour pens like this, too.

271
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,733
That brat will scrutinize this.

272
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,496
Fine. Why did you do such a thing in the first place?

273
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:10,935
You know, I just don't get it.

274
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,776
You always say this.

275
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:16,875
"I'll be an office worker if life works out. If not, a civil servant."

276
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,215
That's your future goal and dream.

277
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,046
So why would you pretend to be a rich girl?

278
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:27,056
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

279
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:29,355
What?

280
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,596
I didn't want to feel ashamed at first.

281
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,665
It's bad enough that I was born poor.

282
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,536
I hated the idea of being humiliated in front of others.

283
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,746
But then...

284
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,945
After I got a taste of it,

285
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:54,976
it felt pretty good.

286
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,346
My goodness.

287
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:01,816
Whatever.

288
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:04,655
It's a dream I'll never achieve in this lifetime or the next.

289
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:08,496
Social media allowed me to enjoy that illusion, at least.

290
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:15,236
Gosh, you talk like it's not your problem.

291
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:19,536
What? That's why I'm being punished now.

292
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,105
This is a punishment?

293
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:25,405
Some middle school kid's homework?

294
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:29,445
You should be grateful that you were caught...

295
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,316
by a nice girl like Na Yeon.

296
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,486
Nice? Says who?

297
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,786
That brat, Na Yeon...

298
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:41,526
is the meanest, most wicked, and vicious...

299
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,395
middle schooler I know.

300
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,496
She's a witch.

301
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,236
Look. Isn't this cute?

302
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,375
- How is it? - It's pretty.

303
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,276
- Is it cute? Should I buy it? - Yes.

304
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,405
How exciting.

305
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:04,615
Gosh.

306
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,895
Take a landscape one for us.

307
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,526
Come on. How can you take it when I'm blinking?

308
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:21,596
Hold it like this and take it.

309
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,375
Guys, move it.

310
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,435
Take it, quick.

311
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,026
Another one.

312
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,836
Goodness.

313
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,006
Ms. Sun Ju.

314
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,276
Thank you for today.

315
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,506
What's wrong?

316
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,875
Do you have more errands?

317
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,846
You're quick on your feet now.

318
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,145
Then...

319
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,046
I'll leave these to you.

320
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,455
(Shin Ha Neul)

321
00:24:54,455 --> 00:24:56,726
(Han Ji Soo)

322
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,165
(Yang Ha Eun)

323
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,226
What's this?

324
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,435
Now I have to do your friends' homework too?

325
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,405
You're too much.

326
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:11,175
Will you be okay raising your voice?

327
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:14,476
My mom is in the living room over there.

328
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,756
My exams are coming soon.

329
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,925
But I haven't studied because of you.

330
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,326
Do you know how important grades are in 11th grade?

331
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,996
You're not the only one with exams.

332
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,996
I also have an admission test next week.

333
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:39,205
Once I finish my admission interview,

334
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:41,976
there'll be no need for you.

335
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,046
Aren't I right?

336
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,316
I'll let you off since this is the last.

337
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:15,905
I read it a few times.

338
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,945
- I'll wake up at dawn. - I was going to study. You?

339
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:22,016
You're studying so hard.

340
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:25,385
- Isn't it Number One? - Why did I even bother?

341
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,365
Hey. You have a call.

342
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,125
What?

343
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,705
(Kang Na Yeon)

344
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:57,945
- Hello... - Why didn't you pick up?

345
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,786
I told you I have midterms today.

346
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:06,256
I left my script for the interview at home.

347
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,596
Gosh. Why didn't you pack it if it was so important?

348
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,526
Whatever.

349
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:15,435
Go and get it for me.

350
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:20,736
Did you call your mom?

351
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:25,006
Or perhaps the driver or housekeeper?

352
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:26,476
My mom isn't picking up.

353
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:27,816
The housekeeper is on leave,

354
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:30,915
and the driver won't even know what it looks like.

355
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:34,086
I won't be able to interview without the script.

356
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,256
What should I do?

357
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,296
My test is starting soon.

358
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,736
If I fail the interview for Cheongdam International,

359
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:49,635
I'm going to kill myself.

360
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,405
I'll also expose all your lies to my mom.

361
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,976
Hurry up!

362
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:12,526
Oh, gosh.

363
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:35,715
What is this?

364
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:40,955
Here it is.

365
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,425
She'll come if I call her.

366
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,695
When we went shopping, she came to carry our bags.

367
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,266
She has no dignity.

368
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,006
It'll be hilarious if she comes.

369
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,806
Will she really come?

370
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:03,036
What can she do if she doesn't come?

371
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,145
If I expose everything she did,

372
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,976
she'll be in deep trouble with my mom.

373
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:12,685
You're so mean...

374
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,455
for calling her over on her exam day.

375
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:15,885
I heard she's dirt poor.

376
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,955
She should at least get into a good university.

377
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:22,056
Who asked her to be born that way?

378
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,695
At least she gets to visit this school thanks to me.

379
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,236
She's here.

380
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:31,806
Hye In, over here!

381
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,675
See? What did I tell you?

382
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:37,645
She'll come if I ask.

383
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:40,915
Look at the poor high schooler.

384
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,215
Wasn't this urgent?

385
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:49,986
Oh, I forgot.

386
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:52,526
Thanks for this.

387
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:55,455
But...

388
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:59,695
I'm sad that our lessons are over.

389
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,135
I had fun thanks to you.

390
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:09,675
Am I the only one who's sad?

391
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:15,846
I'll put in a good word for you...

392
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,786
and ask my mom to give you a big bonus.

393
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:21,355
Bye, then.

394
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,986
I have to go for my interview.

395
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,125
Let's go.

396
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:29,596
So fast?

397
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,026
What a shame. That was fun.

398
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,536
Just come already.

399
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,076
You should have informed me in advance.

400
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,605
It's your fault. No retests.

401
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:49,816
Why did you not show up if you were worried about grades?

402
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:50,915
On an exam day, at that!

403
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,115
I heard she's dirt poor.

404
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,615
She should at least get into a good university.

405
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,756
When you're born poor, there's only so much you can do.

406
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,556
It's bad enough that I was born poor.

407
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:02,895
- Are you really rich? - One should live within...

408
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,425
- I hated the idea... - You're shameless.

409
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:06,996
Especially poor people.

410
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:11,826
Nothing's working out for me.

411
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:13,965
Excuse me.

412
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,476
Do you want to use this?

413
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,346
I'm good.

414
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,145
(Kim Hye In)

415
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,346
(Kim Hae In)

416
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:39,526
We have similar names.

417
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,145
Thanks for the hair tie.

418
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:17,826
(I'm sorry that I'm poor.)

419
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,736
We didn't choose to be born this way, darn it.

420
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,546
Dream is not to think only in mind.

421
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,076
Rather, it's to feel with your heart,

422
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,185
to write with your hand, and to do with your feet.

423
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,246
If you give me the chance...

424
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:41,715
to study at the prestigious Cheongdam International High School,

425
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,086
I'll work toward the dreams in my heart...

426
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,955
and become a talent that represents Korea...

427
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:48,756
- What's that sound? - Who's that?

428
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:50,496
Who is that?

429
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,965
- What is she... - That student...

430
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:10,945
What is she doing?

431
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:12,945
Kim Hye In?

432
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:29,195
Screw your dreams.

433
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,735
Your personality needs a makeover.
