Je Na.

12

You have a younger sibling now.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm 12 weeks pregnant.

14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,090
We'll be family soon.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,789
We don't have to be so hostile against each other.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,829
This is crazy.

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,369
What...

18
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:01,969
That little brat.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,640
Je Na.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,409
Gosh.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,250
Don't we have more booze in the cellar?

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,519
Gosh, my sweet daughter.

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,560
Aren't you a beauty?

24
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,688
Have you been drinking all day?

25
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,159
Only that explains how you're this drunk.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,299
Darn.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,030
Did you forget what your doctor said?

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,968
You have to be sober...

29
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,870
while on antidepressants.

30
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,640
How many drinks did you even have?

31
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,780
I heard the English teacher was pregnant.

32
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,180
Your dad must be over the moon.

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,620
He'd be even more delighted if it turns out to be a boy.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,750
She gave him something I couldn't give him.

35
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,890
Lucky you, Chairman Baek.

36
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,590
How can you say that right now?

37
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,530
I'm fine.

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm perfectly fine.

39
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,569
I'm the reason he got to be in that position,

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,400
so how dare he...

41
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,409
Our marriage had no substance to it anyway,

42
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,219
which is why I'm saying this.

43
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,889
So...

44
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,490
let me be like this just for today.

45
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,960
I'm celebrating my decision to divorce him.

46
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,800
I need more booze!

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,969
Mom!

48
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,638
I'm fine.

49
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,439
You're nothing but fine!

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,080
Get her some medicine.

51
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,979
Go on!

Hye In, breakfast is ready.

54
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,029
No way. That's super annoying.

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,360
It's just wrong.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,800
That's too bad.

57
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,539
I can't believe it.

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,139
Don't just stand there and take your seat.

59
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,509
Well, I don't have an appetite.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,650
Why is that?

61
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,550
Anyway, take your seat and have a bite. Here.

62
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,620
No way!

63
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,789
I hope we get along.

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,590
All right. There you go.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,889
Okay, let's eat.

66
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,188
- My gosh. - Unbelievable.

67
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,199
Let's eat.

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,830
We click, don't we?

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,198
Well, that was relatively easy.

70
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,840
- Dad. - Yes?

71
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,810
Could you...

72
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,379
give me some money?

73
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,509
Money?

74
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,919
What for? Is there something the school requires?

75
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,120
Well...

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,789
It's something like that.

77
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,529
I'm glad I got my salary yesterday.

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,029
How much do you need?

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,529
Well, it's...

80
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,939
Around 8,000...

81
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,269
How much is it exactly?

82
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,740
Eight thousand.

83
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,879
Keep it down, will you?

84
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,410
Eight thousand dollars.

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,889
Would that be possible?

86
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,060
What did you just say?

87
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,958
Eight thousand dollars? Hey.

88
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,029
Hey, open this door!

89
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,500
Have you lost your mind?

90
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,969
My weekly allowance is 80 dollars,

91
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,939
and you're asking for 8,000?

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,279
Do you even know how much Dad makes a month?

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,979
Let her be.

94
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,480
She must've meant something else.

95
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,878
Dad, come on!

96
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,850
No one speaks of an amount like that only to have it mean something else.

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,719
Getting into that Cheongdam International High...

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,489

99
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,089

100
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,930
Unbelievable.

101
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,839
You'll only pay for dry-cleaning for a dress that expensive?

102
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,979
You have one month...

103
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,850

104
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,778

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,360

109
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,300
that thought crossed my mind.

110
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,240
Tell me about it. It's gorgeous.

111
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,550
Gosh.

112
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,250
Hey, that's a pretty dress.

113
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,720

140

but someone said I should come for this.

It's Baek Je Na.

148
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,940
I can't believe it. What is she doing here?

149
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh, no. My dress!

150
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,850
Do you know how expensive this is?

151
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,830
That was on purpose, wasn't it?

152
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,090
Gosh, what did I do?

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,769
- What? - My gosh!

154
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,669
- Check out her dress. - It now has colour.

155
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,539
- Why is she doing this? - What's going on?

156
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,450
It looked expensive.

157

160
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,830

161
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,559
Hear this.

162
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,599
Unless you're reborn, people like you...

163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,970
will never rise above your lowly status.

164
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,870

165
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,139
And stay out of my way.

166
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,809
Baek Je Na.

167
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,610
You clearly need another lesson.

168
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,189
What's this? It's not like I did anything.

169
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,419
Could you please leave?

170
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,289
Why should I when she started it?

171
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,959
If anyone should leave, it should be her.

172
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,929
Why am I only being kicked out?

173
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,470
You idiot.

174
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,639
Why bother with who's right or wrong...

175
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,070
when they were employed...

176
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,309
by Baek Je Na?

177
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,500
No way.

178
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,909
Ms. Je Na,

179
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,980
Dr. Moon called regarding your mother.

180
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,388
I was told that it would be best for her...

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,029

183
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,408
Why are you suddenly asking that?

184
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,509
Fire her.

185
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,509
I ordered...

186
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,750
that everything should stay in place,

187
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,450
but I'm ticked off by how they're not.

188
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,689
But doesn't that call for a warning and not...

189
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,789
You see,

190
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,489
I believe...

191
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,928
that people as well as objects...

192
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,360
should stay in their rightful places.

193
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,929
When they don't,

194
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,970
I find it presumptuous.

195
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,610
("Chairman B's True Love, How Will It Affect the Succession?")

196
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:15,059
Kim Hye In must be scrambling right about now.

197
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,200
Then, I'll get going.

198
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,059
Being here with you has been fun...

199
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,299
I mean, it has been an honour.

200
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,399
- Right. I'll see you around. - Sure.

201
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,110
Baek Je Na.

202
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,250
You...

203
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,450
What did you do to Kim Hye In at the party yesterday?

204
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,989
Seeing how you came out here to take it up with me...

205
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,220
tells me that you're actually dating that equal education parasite.

206
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,029
I thought you were classier than this.

207
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,200
As if that's important right now.

208
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,230
Even if we weren't dating,

209
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,370
I was going to tell you to quit your childish bullying.

210
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,340
Because of us,

211
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,539
someone almost died.

212
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,450
You must be talking about Kim Hae In.

213
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,379
She's the one you actually like.

214
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,059
I was going to bring it up myself.

215
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,288
I don't know...

216
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,428
whether it's being poor or the name that does it for you, but...

217
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:27,200
- Hey. - Darn.

218
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,340
Here's some darn advice from your friend of 18 years.

219
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,169
Do Eon,

220
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,340
if you want to preach love, do it in your next life.

221
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,610
Although, I can't be sure if they'll still want you...

222
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,549
if you end up being born as a penniless commoner.

223
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,620
Unbelievable.

224
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,388
Men believe that being with the unfortunate...

225
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,960
equals as the love of the century.

226
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
How pathetic is that?

227
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,870
Don't speak like that about Hae In...

228
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,740
when you don't know the kind of person she is.

229
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,110
Hey, as if I wouldn't know.

230
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,679
You'll only end up...

231
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,879
like my mom.

232
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,850
They only wish to use us.

233
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:20,580
As a stepping stone in society.

234
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,319
Not knowing her place is why she fell...

235
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,590
I said that was enough!

236
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:31,960
Please.

237
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,870
You're the one who had no idea about Kim Hae In.

238
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,139
Meanwhile, all the other Diamonds knew.

239
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,429
- Oh, no. My dress! - Bucket?

240
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,429
I see she causes trouble...

241
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,200
in and out of school.

242
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,740
Unbelievable.

243
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,049
What was that?

244
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,789
Are you username Real Love?

245
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,059
Right.

246
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,659
You must be...

247
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,700
Average Broke High School Kid on the Peninsula.

248
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,170
- That's right. - Just a second.

249
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,440
I have it in cash, so let me count it first.

250
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,440
Sure thing.

251
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,740
What? Username Real Love?

252
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,150
You should be fried in the fiery pit.

253
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,950
Doesn't it sting your conscience to want a minor?

254
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,449
Who on earth are you?

255
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,390
Me? I'm Lee So Mang, the son of the Almighty's son.

256
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,490
The Almighty will see to it that your life ends.

257
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,960
So Mang, is that you?

258
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,630
You reckless brat.

259
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,200
Being short on money isn't an excuse for being reckless and stupid.

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,669
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,569
Being short on money is why I'm selling this.

262
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,680
- A secondhand deal? - Move.

263
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,578
It's brand new and hasn't been worn,

264
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,680
which is why I wanted to buy it for my girlfriend.

265
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,450
What's your problem?

266
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm really sorry.

267
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,809
Hey, wait.

268
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,480
Say another word, and I'll pluck your mouth out.

269
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,880
Hold on.

270
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,950
Hey, Kim Hye In.

271
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,190
Why are you prone to abruptly leaving?

272
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,829
Hey, Bucket.

273
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,230
Can't you acknowledge the person talking to you?

274
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,940
To be honest, the situation would've seemed shady to anyone.

275
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,470
But how is this something to be so angry about?

276
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,278
Because of you,

277
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,640
I had to give that guy a 50-dollar discount.

278
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,079
So...

279
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,049
you're not angry that I mistook the situation.

280
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,220
You're ticked off because you had to agree to a discount.

281
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,259
When it was only 50 dollars?

282
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,390
Only?

283
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,098
Why do you think I'm walking home at this hour...

284
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,799
when I don't even live close by?

285
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,269
Because you enjoy my company?

286
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,250
I doubt it's because the taxi fare is pricey.

287
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,519
For real?

288
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,660
Seriously?

289
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,289
Is that why you're walking home?

290
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,259
Do you know what ticks me off the most?

291
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,700
It's not the fact that I was humiliated at the party...

292
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,269
and was laughed at by everyone there.

293
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,910
It's the fact that I don't know what'll happen to me...

294
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,710
if I don't come up with the money for the dress.

295
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,849
My life hangs in the balance over 8,000 dollars...

296
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,289
which you kids see as chump change.

297
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,189
There was no need to fire off like that.

298
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,460
You said anyone could've mistaken that situation.

299
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,460
As if.

300
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,960
Be honest, will you?

301
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,470
If it were Baek Je Na and not me,

302
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,598
would you have gotten that disgusting idea?

303
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,170
Of course I wouldn't...

304
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,380
See?

305
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,720
So how much is it that you need?

306
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,730
- This absolutely crushed my style. - Darn it.

307
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,599
And here I thought you'd stylishly offer 8,000 dollars.

308
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,369
I never asked for a ride home.

309
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,740
You didn't have money for a cab and was walking home.

310
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,940
So Mang, are you really a student at Cheongdam International High?

311
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,449
Or maybe you're like me and got in through the program...

312
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,519
Hey.

313
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,719
My family can easily level...

314
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,089
with the other families there.

315
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,119
Nice. I'd kill for a chance to say that.

316
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,299
It's not all rainbows and butterflies, though.

317
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,940
Count your blessings, will you?

318
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,339
You'd know if you were in my shoes.

319
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,278
Would you like to be in my shoes in return?

320
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,710
- No. - Gosh, I'm curious.

321
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,779
Why are you still following me?

322
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,980
I have nothing better to do.

323
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,529
How much is it?

324
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,569
Is that 150 dollars?

325
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,339
So two hours a day...

326
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,609
(Brunch café, hourly rate 9.8 dollars)

327
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,379
There's no way this will work.

328
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,449
(Convenience store, night shift, 6 hours)

329
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,049
(Coffee shop, weekend shift)

330
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,990
Darn.

331
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,829
How has school been?

332
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,660
I heard you were sick.

333
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,930
Oh, right.

334
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,969
It hasn't been long since you started here,

335
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,809
but it sounds like your passion has run dry.

336
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,750
Read this and pick one.

337
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,449
(Scholarship Programs for Fall and Winter)

338
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,990
Wait, I'll be given a house?

339
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,930
But not for you to keep.

340
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,759
You receive monthly financial aid, right?

341
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,629
Anyway, this is a scholarship program...

342
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,000
that was newly designed for the second half of the year.

343
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,039
The benefits include rental housing.

344
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:54,598
There are some kids out there who don't even have...

345
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,109
a room to study in.

346
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,839
They should get to study, don't you think?

347
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,849
There are scholarships provided by companies too,

348
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,210
so read the pamphlet thoroughly.

349
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,029
(Equal education parasite)

350
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,079
(Equal education parasite)

351
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,259
This is bull.

352
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,329
The feeling's mutual.

353
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,170
Do you finally get it?

354
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
You can run around all you want,

355
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,569
but that won't change how worthless you are.

356
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,980
You people...

357
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,549
keep yapping at me to know my own place.

358
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,980
But I actually do.

359
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,890
How can I not when I'm reminded of it every day?

360
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,890
Knowing it all too well is more of the issue.

361
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:21,930
Actually,

362
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,400
it's you who doesn't know her place.

363
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,329
You still haven't learned your lesson.

364
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:34,170
You're known as a Diamond...

365
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,109
in this psychotic school for rich kids...

366
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,039
and have everything this world can offer you.

367
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:43,410
So for someone like that to be insecure enough...

368
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,180
to come after someone like me who has nothing?

369
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:47,980
That's crossing the line.

370
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,519
You think I feel inferior...

371
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,160
to an equal education parasite like you?

372
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,799
Yes, this is insecurity on full display.

373
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,670
You've been spending a lot of your time and effort on me.

374
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,440
You may not know this,

375
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,609
but there's a price on labour.

376
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,808
If you actually had seen me as vermin,

377
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,809
you wouldn't have given me the time of day.

378
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,509
You...

379
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,150
are annoying to a fault.

380
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,549
So much so that I want you dead.

381
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,130
I...

382
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,559
If you don't harass me...

383
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,970
Actually,

384
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
even if you do, I won't fight back.

385
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,839
So just think that I don't exist.

386
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:47,380
That way, we can both attend school in peace.

387
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
No.

388
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,359
I prefer things to be certain.

389
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,460
If I'm to pretend that you don't exist,

390
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,230
I'd rather have you drop out.

391
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,769
You want me to drop out?

392
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,940
Not for free, though.

393
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,839
I'll make it worthwhile.

394
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,380
What will be the adequate amount?

395
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,180
Well...

396
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,119
Oh, right. How about I pay for the dress?

397
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,390
I doubt you had the money to buy it,

398
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,789
and any rental store would request that you pay for damages.

399
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,130
Right?

400
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,609
I'll give you a week.

401
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,650
That's the time you have to drop out.

402
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,549
If you leave on your own accord,

403
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,890
I'll pay for the dress myself.

404
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,730
One more thing.

405
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,009
If you leave sooner than that, I'll toss in a hefty bonus.

406
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,609
Like you said, time is money.

407
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,759
Gosh.

408
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,349
What do you want?

409
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,029
I could've just ridden the bus to school.

410
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,769
Hey...

411
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,940
Do you think...

412
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,980
- you can do me a favour? - Why did you go to the party?

413
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,450
What?

414
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,519
Why did you go somewhere you don't belong...

415
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,960
and give the others a chance to bully you?

416
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,799
You're not even worthy enough.

417
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,099
At this school, people like you need to stay low...

418
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,769
and get out of everyone's sight.

419
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:37,710
Did I really have to tell you that?

420
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,750
I can't wait any longer.

421
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,650
The person who tried to kill Hae In...

422
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,660
Tell me who it is.

423
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,930
I've waited long enough.

424
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,640
By any chance,

425
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,079
is it someone I know very well?

426
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,380
Spit it out!

427
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,450
If I tell you,

428
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,259
will you lend me some money?

429
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,630
What?

430
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,960
You tell me first.

431
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:36,500
Will you lend me money if I tell you?

432
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,900
Depending on your answer,

433
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,339
I'll decide if I want to tell you or not.

434
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,480
This is a matter of life or death.

435
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,720
Are you making a deal with me?

436
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,890
I tried to understand when you asked me to fake our relationship.

437
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,390
But you know what?

438
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,828
Your name may be similar to Hae In's,

439
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,200
but you can't hold a candle to her.

440
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
She was also an equal education student,

441
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,509
but she never asked or demanded anything from me.

442
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,809
But here you are, asking me to lend you money.

443
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,450
So your answer is no, right?

444
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,289
Then I guess I'm done talking to you.

445
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,319
I'll get out.

446
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,430
Hey.

447
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,930
Hey!

448
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,710
To be honest,

449
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,179
I never thought of revealing the culprit's identity to you...

450
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,579
in the first place.

451
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,950
I know I made a promise with your dad to keep it a secret,

452
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,519
but honestly, I didn't even get a good look at the culprit's face.

453
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,059
What?

454
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,960
I only saw her silhouette.

455
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,369
So I only know that it was a girl.

456
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,109
It was a girl?

457
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,549
I should've kept it a secret for longer, but now you know.

458
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,490
Right. Also,

459
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,249
if what you said is true...

460
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,619
about having to stay low at this school,

461
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,289
how did Kim Hae In end up like that?

462
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:48,430
I thought you were in Diamond Six.

463
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,900
But you couldn't even protect the girl you like.

464
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,640
Even if she never asked for your help,

465
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,670
you should've taken care of her.

466
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,619
Why are you in a cold war with Seo Do Eon again?

467
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,360
You don't need to know.

468
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,329
I see. Is it because it's another Kim Hye In?

469
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,899
Well, I also can't get myself...

470
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,170
to understand him in that matter.

471
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,210
Why are you acting like you're any different?

472
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,449
Why?

473
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:41,880
How much do you know?

474
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,090
That's enough. Yul Hee's coming.

475
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,388
What were you guys talking about?

476
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,829
Nothing. Just a bunch of nonsense.

477
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,029
Anyway, do you think that equal education parasite...

478
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,300
will fill out a withdrawal letter?

479
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,239
Probably.

480
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,039
Do you know why poor people can't ever turn their life around?

481
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,150
It's because they risk their lives over chump change. Right?

482
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,449
I feel like I'm becoming smarter every day.

483
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,949
That's true.

484
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,219
Hurry up.

485
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,189
But...

486
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,030
- Come over here. - I don't feel like eating.

487
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,469
Haven't you been skipping lunch these days?

488
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:32,670
I've lost my appetite.

489
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,908
I packed this myself.

490
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,139
Can you at least try?

491
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,179
I worked hard to make it.

492
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,979
How is there...

493
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,150
such a kind-hearted girl like you at this school?

494
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,780
In my opinion, you're an angel without wings.

495
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,050
No, I'm not.

496
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,289
I'm not as nice as you think.

497
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:57,760
I just called you...

498
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,698
because I felt lonely...

499
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:01,900
eating on my own.

500
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,840
What did you do about the dress?

501
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,250
Well...

502
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,449
Gosh. The thing is,

503
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,489
it's not easy.

504
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:28,659
To me, 8,000 dollars is a lot of money.

505
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,659
Do you think I should just drop out...

506
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,659
and have Baek Je Na...

507
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,599
pay for the dress?

508
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,639
Trying to attend this school...

509
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,510
that's out of my league must've been the problem.

510
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:48,578
I think I should just...

511
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,550
There might be a solution.

512
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:52,980
What?

513
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,250
A way of getting enough money so you don't have to drop out.

514
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,730
What will you do if I say there's a method?

515
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,630
A method where you won't have to drop out.
