91
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,949

99
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,980
nothing.

103
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,930
This is great. But can you make a different pose?

104
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,930
Oh, my. Great!

105
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,268

- This... - Hey.

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,549
You said this was the last costume.

111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,450
Why do you keep adding one more outfit?

112
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,889
Are you playing a game with me?

113
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,059
This is the last one. I promise.

114
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,360
I'll pay you a bit more.

115
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,070
You'd better pay me for all the extra time I spend here.

116
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,970
What are you doing?

117
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,610
Under one condition.

118
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,110
Change into that here.

119
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,710
Are you kidding me?

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,950
If you do, I'll pay you 5,000 dollars more.

121
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,659
I know I made a promise with your dad to keep it a secret.

122
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,629
I only saw her silhouette.

123
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,860
So I only know that it was a girl.

124
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,940
Then Seo Hee Soo must know...

125
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,769
who the culprit is.

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,139
Gosh.

127
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:09,649
It's already been five years since our engagement.

128
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,220

130
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,519

131

This year...

132
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,490
Sweetie.

133
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,360
I'll just speak my mind.

134
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,500
You have to recognize my effort. You see that, right?

135
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,268
Of course. I do recognize your effort.

136
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,569
- Yes. Of course. - Gosh.

137
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,408
What kind of couple waits until their wedding night to make love?

138
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,210
Especially in this day and age.

139
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,250
Of course, I do find that side of you adorable.

140
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,120
But...

141
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,249
I let you do everything but the last part.

142
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,889
Right. I know that.

143
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,289
I do.

144
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,129
Then...

145
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,100
what about this year's anniversary?

146
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,669
No. You have been patient all these years.

147
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,809
Okay.

148
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,169
Gosh.

149
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,350
Seriously. I...

150
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,349
As soon as I turn 20,

151
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,949
I'll spend my parents' money to have a grand wedding.

152
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,620
It will be so fancy.

153
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,049
Gosh.

154
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,389
So you have never done it with other girls?

155
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,799
Never. With whom would I be doing that other than you?

156
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,100
Right.

157
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,240
If you did, I'm going to kill myself.

158
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,409
Don't even joke about that. It's upsetting.

159
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,720
- Let me answer this call. - Okay.

160
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,199
- Hello. - I told you not to call me.

161
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,360
I said it was an important day.

162
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,500
So what?

163
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,440
That's your problem, not mine.

164
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,509
How did Baek Je Na find out?

165
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,519
Listen to me.

166
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,059
If Yul Hee finds out about this too,

167
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,029
that will be the end of you.

168
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Got it?

169
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,470
- Right. The present. - What?

170
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,139
Is there anything you want for your present?

171
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,569
I already sent it to you.

172
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,538
What? Did you text it to me?

173
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,710
Yes. I sent you the link.

174
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,309
- That link was for that? - Yes.

175
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,808
I see. Okay. That's what you want?

176
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,349
Wouldn't that look great on me?

177
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,419
And...

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,389
Help!

179
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,990
Is anyone here?

180
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,388
Please help! She's dying!

181
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,559
Oh, no. What do I do?

182
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,730
What do I do?

183
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,529
Is anyone here?

184
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,009
Oh, no.

185
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,919
What do I do?

186
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,558
Wait. Come on. Wake up.

187
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,590
What do I do?

188
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh, no!

189
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,620
Did the girl say anything to you?

190
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,389
Do you remember anything else?

191
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,268
I'm going to have tea and sort out a personal matter.

192
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,570
So it will take an hour.

193
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,269
I'll call you when I'm ready to leave.

194
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,149
- Ms. Ha! It's been so long! - Ms. Kim.

195
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,450
Life's been good to you. No? You have a personal chauffeur now.

196
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,119
I'm kind of getting jealous now.

197
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,819
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

198
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,789
I haven't changed much. You're teasing me.

199
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,788
I'm the same.

200
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,298
Don't be so modest. The news of you marrying...

201
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:34,799
a mega-rich family spread all over the community website for teachers.

202
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,970
I think I know who he is.

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,069
Is it what I have been hearing?

204
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,379
Ms. Kim, I'll let you know once the news article comes out.

205
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,279
Okay.

206
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,308
But don't be a stranger to me or the other teachers...

207
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,519
now that you'll be entering high society.

208
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,350
I told you. I haven't changed.

209
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,759
Being rich doesn't make you special.

210
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,019
I'm marrying him because I love him for who he is.

211
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,929
Nothing will change.

212
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,230
Gosh. Only you would say stuff like that.

213
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,470
Je Na, are you all right?

214
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,839
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,809
I came by to say hello to the other teachers.

216
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,650
Are you sick? Why are you sweating...

217
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,450
Why do you care if I'm sick or not?

218
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,119
Didn't I tell you?

219
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,059
I told you to know your place and act accordingly.

220
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,430
Je Na, you're being harsh.

221
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,160
Ms. Kim, go ahead. I'll be there after I walk her to class.

222
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay. Sure.

223
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,640
Are you okay? Let me see.

224
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,769
Why do you have a fever?

225
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,809
You should be grateful that I'm being harsh verbally.

226
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,380
How dare you, you homewrecker?

227
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:58,450
Your mere pregnancy won't change your class.

228
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,819
What? Am I wrong?

229
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,859
I went to the hospital today.

230
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,859
You know what my doctor told me?

231
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,869
That my baby will look great in blue.

232
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,509
The baby I'm carrying...

233
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,380
is going to be the heir of Hanmyung Group.

234
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,549
A mere pregnancy?

235
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,588
What? You unbelievable...

236
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:37,890
Don't be so rude...

237
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,089
as I will be your mother.

238
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,329
A homewrecker?

239
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,829
I will not let you disrespect me like this again.

240
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,400
You'd better address me properly.

241
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,710
I'm the one who will give birth to your brother.

242
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,279
Your stepmother.

243
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,119
I heard the English teacher is pregnant.

244
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,549
Your dad must be celebrating.

245
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,018
He must be over the moon if it's a son.

246
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,990
The chairman is dating her.

247
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,160
Mom!

248
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,779
- Who are you? - Her Fri...

249
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm her senior.

250
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,250
Oh, I see.

251
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,859
You must be shocked. I'll take Je Na home.

252
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,299
I don't think she wants that.

253
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,569
Get me out of her sight. Quick.

254
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:26,529
So that was her? The chairman's second wife.

255
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,900
I thought those situations only happened in soap operas.

256
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,970
It seems worse in reality.

257
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,109
Even the invincible Baek Je Na can't do a thing about it.

258
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,779
Your life is also...

259
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,519
What was that for?

260
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,359
The things I hate the most...

261
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,130
are meaningless pity and hollow sympathy.

262
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,358
Gosh, your temper...

263
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,059
Just because you happened to see it,

264
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,599
do you think you have dirt on me now?

265
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,700
You must think you have it better than me.

266
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,769
What?

267
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,880
No matter how pathetic it gets,

268
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:15,950
people like you who feel superior while pretending to comfort me...

269
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,380
are disgusting, so get lost if you're done.

270
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,549
How ridiculous.

271
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,160
You think I came here to comfort the likes of you?

272
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,359
Why are you here then?

273
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,180
This is why I'm here.

274
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,519
I heard you abetted Na Yeon.

275
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm here to pay for the dress.

276
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,930
But what?

277
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,099
I feel superior while comforting you?

278
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,369
Even when you're in that state,

279
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,970
my life is much more messed up.

280
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,039
Why would I feel superior to you?

281
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,410
You have no idea what I did...

282
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,549
just for this chump change.

283
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,450
Change into that here.

284
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,250
Are you kidding me?

285
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,490
I'll pay you 5,000 dollars more.

286
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,769
There were others before you who changed here.

287
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,230
Lots of them.

288
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,410
If you don't want to, then don't.

289
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,210
I'm not the one who's more desperate.

290
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,450
It's you.

291
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,390
In any case, we're even with this.

292
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,799
So please, leave me alone.

293
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,368
Now, even if I'm treated badly,

294
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,769
I must stay in this school until graduation.

295
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,470
I'll hang on until I graduate...

296
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,480
so that my crappy life...

297
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,509
can get better by even the slightest bit.

298
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,380
Got it?

299
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,220
You're really a nutcase.

300
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,390
Nutcase?

301
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,099
What are you doing? Don't come near me.

302
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,369
I'll call the cops if you hit me again.

303
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,140
You think...

304
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,569
you're the scariest person in this school, don't you?

305
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,180
But you're wrong.

306
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,049
The scariest witch in the world...

307
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,980
is one who has nothing to lose.

308
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,890
Like me, right now.

309
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,089
You're not the only one.

310
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,599
Cut the nonsense.

311
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,329
That's what I call hypocritical.

312
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,240
A rich girl like you will still be better than me if you went bankrupt.

313
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,269
Anyway, I kept my promise.

314
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,480
Let's just get along peacefully.

315
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,279
Who knows?

316
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,950
You may become my employer in the future.

317
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,690
Don't you have any self-respect?

318
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:18,890
Self-respect?

319
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,559
I've already thrown that down the drain ages ago.

320
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,170
This is why you're no match for me.

321
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,170
Why, that...

322
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,680
Hey, Kim Hye In!

323
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,640
Don't act like you know me from now on.

324
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,480
Right back at you.

325
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,329
Gosh, I can't believe there's no one chasing me...

326
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,359
or making me mad this morning.

327
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,430
Well, I should focus on myself from now on.

328
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,900
I'll study hard and get the scholarship.

329
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,140
Looks like Kim Hye In didn't drop out.

330
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,150
Je Na said we should just let her be.

331
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,750
She's amazing.

332
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,219
She's probably the first to be let off like this.

333
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,420
Goodness.

334
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,049
What's gotten into you?

335
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,319
They won't bully you if I'm next to you.

336
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,059
Did Je Na put you up to this too?

337
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,000
Je Na?

338
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,269
No, she didn't.

339
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,380
What's going on between you two?

340
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,210
Mind your own business.

341
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll lay low and keep quiet from now on.

342
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,380
Anyway, sorry for everything.

343
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,589
See me after class.

344
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,230
I have no business with you anymore.

345
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,210
Don't leave first without me.

346
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,279
Let's go together.

347
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,078
Why is Seo Do Eon doing that?

348
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,980
Are they really dating?

349
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,660
I'll let you do whatever you want.

350
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,200
I mean,

351
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,430
I'll do whatever you want.

352
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,799
Are you nuts? What are you planning now?

353
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,609
Is it your turn now that I've settled with Je Na?

354
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:27,039
Besides, our fake relationship ended long ago.

355
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,849
- Help me. - With what?

356
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,778
- Hae In. - I've apologized.

357
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,690
I already told you everything.

358
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,219
I know my place now.

359
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,319
From now on, I'll be laying low in school.

360
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,490
Let's stay away from each other, please.

361
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,339
My dad is a terrifying person.

362
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:53,639
I know.

363
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,309
If he finds out that you don't know the true culprit,

364
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,579
what do you think he'll do?

365
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,859
Are you threatening me?

366
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,000
This is ridiculous.

367
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,369
You were the one who said I could never catch up to Hae In.

368
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,200
Did you pick up my dirty tricks already?

369
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,880
I'll make sure you're not affected.

370
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,549
I'm not going to report it. I just want to find out who.

371
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,680
I'll take care of the rest.

372
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,379
I said, I didn't see their face.

373
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,680
You said it was a girl.

374
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,990
I'll monitor my dad's actions...

375
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,589
to see if she's the one I suspect.

376
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,059
So stick with me.

377
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:53,528
Just continue dating me.

378
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,059
You're so frustrating.

379
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,839
Get lost. I'm leaving.

380
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,880
Whatever. Let's not think about him.

381
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,750
I just need to enjoy my freedom quietly...

382
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,690
and graduate from here quietly.

383
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,720
You're doing good, Hye In.

384
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,899
(You made your way into the school.)

385
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,670
(Now you're stooping so low?)

386
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,210
Under one condition. Change into that here.

387
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,569
I'll pay you 5,000 dollars more.

388
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,950
What should I wear?

389
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,119
Can you come over to help me choose an outfit later?

390
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,619
I want something that's extremely pretty and sexy.

391
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,519
So Woo Jin only looks at me even in our fifth year.

392
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,599
Do you really want to marry Woo Jin?

393
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,029
Of course. I've only thought it was natural.

394
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,269
You're too good for him.

395
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,740
What are you saying? You're acting weird these days.

396
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,779
Have you decided to ignore her?

397
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,849
Kim Hye In?

398
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,220
Yes. Getting involved with her is a bother.

399
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,259
Hye In!

400
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,869
Isn't that Oh Si Eun next to her?

401
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,400
Let's go.

402
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh Si Eun?

403
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,410
Oh, right. Did you manage to settle the money issue?

404
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:45,940
Nothing happened?

405
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,410
What?

406
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,579
Oh...

407
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,380
Of course, I settled it.

408
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,390
Gosh, that's a relief.

409
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,660
I was wondering if I should've gone with you.

410
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:03,059
I'm glad things went well.

411
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,829
- Lee A Reum. - Here.

412
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,900
- Go Hae Ju. - Here.

413
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,170
Kim Hye In.

414
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,509
Kim Hye In.

415
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,109
Oh, here.

416
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,180
- Lee A Ram. - Here.

417
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,619
- Park Young Chan. - Here.

418
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,660
Gu Min Ji.

419
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,430
(You okay? Hehe.)

420
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,839
- Jeon Min Seon. - Here.

421
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,750
(You look good in the uniform you got for killing someone. Hehe.)

422
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:47,059
(You look good in the uniform you got for killing someone. Hehe.)

423
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,740
(You okay? Hehe.)

424
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:00,739
(You okay? Hehe.)

425
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,019
(Hehe.)

426
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,649
How is there...

427
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,860
such a kind-hearted girl like you at this school?

428
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,389
In my opinion, you're an angel without wings.

429
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,760
No, I'm not.

430
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,570
I'm not as nice as you think.

431
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:36,050
(Bitch x Rich)

432
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,980
(Epilogue)

433
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,860
Hello, ma'am.

434
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,659
Hi, Si Eun.

435
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,159
How is Hae In doing?

436
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,199
She's still the same.

437
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,639
Did someone visit earlier?

438
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:07,840
Yes. A friend called Do Eon.

439
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,510
He said he was close to Hae In.

440
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,349
I see. Seo Do Eon visited.

441
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,518
Let me go out and take this call.

442
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay. Please take your time.

443
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,010
I'm here, Hae In.

444
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,650
Hae In, you're so lucky.

445
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,789
Like always, Do Eon only has eyes for you.

446
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,630
What did you do to seduce him?

447
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,699
You're like an evil spirit.

448
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:09,369
He's probably still smitten since he doesn't know what you did.

449
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,690
Under one condition. Change into that here.

450
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:34,099
I'll pay you 5,000 dollars more.

451
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,309
As expected, Hye In.

452
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,809
You always live up to my expectations.
