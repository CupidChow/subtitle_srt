Trying my best to make life work...

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,159
never really made a change.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,460
It's why...

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
I was never jealous.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,239
Close Cheongdam International High School.

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,269
- Close the school. - Close the school.

17
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,069
We are against specialized education.

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,840
- Against specialized education! - Against specialized education!

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
School for nobles, be gone.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,109
I'm sick and tired of this.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,810
Until when will they keep this up?

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,219
- They're just having a fit. - Close the school.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,650
If their children were allowed to attend the school,

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,120
they'll do cartwheels in a heartbeat.

25
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,260
Come on.

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,189
- They're so loud. - Thanks to having rich parents,

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,030
they think the world is beneath them.

28
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,969
I honestly don't have anything to wear these days.

29
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,909
That's how it always is, though.

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,219
Did you buy a new bag?

31
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,120
My dad got it for me. Pretty, isn't it?

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,319
How much was it?

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,390
He said he bought it at a premium. I think it was about 4K.

34
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm sorry, but we're fully booked until dinnertime.

35
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,500
What? But no one's at any of the tables.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,240
I don't see a lot of customers...

37
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,340
They were just lucky enough...

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,969
to be born with gold spoons in their mouths.

39
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,110
Welcome.

40
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:36,659
Wait.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Gosh.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,110
Hey, get down.

43
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,110
I'm done thinking. I'll take it.

44
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,250
Kid, are you sure you read the price tag correctly?

45
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,319
- It's 58,000 dollars. - Right.

46
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,349
I'm only taking this one...

47
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,719
since a more premium model will take time to be released.

48
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,060
Is there an issue with that?

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,889
What I'm trying to say...

50
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,129
is that students can't afford it.

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,729
Where else do students get their money?

52
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,770
From...

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,330
their moms, of course.

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,409
They have never earned a single penny in their lives.

55
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,340
(2,820 dollars)

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,379
Gosh.

57
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm sorry, Do Eon,

58
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,479
but this is too much.

59
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,789
I'd feel guilty to accept this.

60
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,189
Throw it out, then.

61
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,789
What?

62
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,759
But this...

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,930
This is hardly a burdensome gift.

64
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,930
How's that?

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,900
But...

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,810
For some reason, they think they're more worthy.

67
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,159
You solicited others to assault and bully impoverished students...

68
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,560
who were admitted...

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,930
through the school's equal education project.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,399
Ms. Baek, they say you are the ring leader,

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,199
so now's your chance to speak up for yourself.

72
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,970
Look here, Ms. Baek.

73
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,180
Don't you know that your father, Chairman Baek,

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,680
and the school's chairman...

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,209
also agreed to this meeting by the Anti-Bullying Committee?

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,949
The school is already being accused of specialized education...

77
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,250
for modern-day nobles...

78
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,759
This won't be taken lightly.

79
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,529
And we also have proof.

80
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,259
Exactly.

81
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,300
What was that?

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,980
- It was me. - No, it was me.

83
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,819
It wasn't Je Na. It was me.

84
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,750
- No, it was me. - It was me.

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,459
- I'm to blame. - I did it.

86
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,120
- Step outside. - It was me.

87
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,129
Should such a serious matter...

88
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,860
be investigated this lightly?

89
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,240
I see you're using a laptop made by my family's company.

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,970
That was released two years ago, though.

91
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,139
Should I get you the latest model?

92
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,279
If this is a school for nobles,

93
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,050
that makes me royalty.

94
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,660
Didn't you know that?

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
Those arrogant and conceited.

96
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,769
I now curse them.

97
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,339
She's a working poor?

98
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,870
You down-and-out.

99
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,310

100
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,550
Help.

101
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,949
Is anyone there?

102
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,279
Please help!

103
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,620
I wasn't born this way because I wanted it.

104
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,300
But it's true, right?

105
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,569
What about us is so different, anyway?

106
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,060
I want to be like you,

107
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,560

111
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,310
Just choose one, will you?

112
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,209
- I'm starving. - Sorry.

113
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,649

What's your take on Cheongdam International High?

115
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,759
Isn't the annual tuition 100,000 dollars?

116
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:41,029
It does give me a great sense of deprivation.

117
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,529
If I had the money, I'd love to go there.

118
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,769
But just having the money won't get you through the gates.

119
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,040
(Isn't the annual tuition 100,000 dollars?)

120
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,079
Anyway, I'm super jealous of the kids who go there.

when we were born into different worlds?

124
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,389
Why bother yapping about a world I could never enter...

125
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,149
that has nothing to do with me?

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,879

Yes?

You're here.

131
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,879
Hello.

132
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,350
Come in and have a seat.

133
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,460
You look a lot younger in person,

134
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,190
and it doesn't look like you in the photo.

135
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,230
Right.

136
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,370
It must've been quite the trip, so please enjoy.

137
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,370
Right. Thank you.

138
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,309
It wasn't that far away, so...

139
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,539
I doubt you've been to a neighbourhood like this.

140
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,850

What's premium...

143
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,029
seems that way even in the eyes of the ignorant.

144
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,970
You see, these cookies can't easily be obtained.

145
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,970
Do you know Seocho Hotel?

146
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,769
I'm good friends with the CEO's wife,

147
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,139
and these are precious cookies...

148
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:11,110
that were set aside for me by the hotel's patissier.

149
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,250
Please try some.

150
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,649
It's not like you'd get the chance to try one again.

151
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,419
Right. Of course.

152
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,759
You said that your daughter...

153
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,659
was studying to get into Cheongdam International High.

154
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,899
It's why I put together a curriculum for her.

155
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:35,830
- Would you like to go over it? - Gosh.

156
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,169
I expect no less of a good job from a student at Hanguk University.

157
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
Let me just cut to the chase.

158
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,379
You have probably heard this,

159
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,179
but math grades...

160
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,950
aren't a crucial factor regarding admissions.

161
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,220
Money and connections are what guarantee you a spot.

162
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,289
Then why do you need a math tutor?

163
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,190
Why, do you ask?

164
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:04,399
Because I'm worried that my Na Yeon won't be accepted...

165
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,230
despite all the money we spend and strings we pull.

166
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,940
Just because she lacks in math a little.

167
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,970
However, I don't want either of us to stress out...

168
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,080
just to get a slightly better grade in math.

169
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,440
How should I put it?

170
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,179
I'd like you to do what you can in the most appropriate way.

171
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,720
You know what I mean, right?

172
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,360
Do what I can in the most appropriate way.

173
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,960
Ma'am.

174
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,129
Sure.

175
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,970
She should be here by now.

176
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,210
I'm not late, am I?

177
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,110
I cut it close, but I'm on time.

178
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,480
You weren't late.

179
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,850
But shouldn't you be here at least ten minutes early...

180
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,549
for a smoother shift change?

181
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,750
I'll think about it if I get paid for the extra ten minutes.

182
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,059
She's someone you know, right?

183
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,759
She came in earlier and has been waiting for you.

184
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,529
But this isn't a shelter for the homeless.

185
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,129
Can't she at least wash her hair?

186
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,200
That's crazy.

187
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,610
Thanks for the props.

188
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,210
Here's your rightful compensation.

189
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,679
Nice. I was starving to death, you know.

190
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,899
Did you even wash your face today?

191
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,210
And why aren't you washing your hair?

192
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,970
My place doesn't have hot water.

193
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,279
Shouldn't you take the tutoring job rather than me?

194
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,379
Why live this way when you study at Hanguk University?

195
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:10,220
It won't be different even if I attended Harvard.

196
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,820
When you're born poor, there's only so much you can do.

197
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,490
Right.

198
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,029
Didn't you hear about the doctor who lived and died alone?

199
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,669
That sure is an encouraging story for a high schooler...

200
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,769
who's trying to do well in life.

201
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:33,909
Gosh.

202
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,980
What am I going to do for a living?

203
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,419
For what?

204
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,690
- Right? - I guess that's true.

205
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,090
- Darn. - I want to go home.

206
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,200
Tell me about it.

207
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,340
Kim Hye In, HR teacher's asking for you.

(Teacher's Room)

209
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,649
What do you mean it won't be funded?

210
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,220
Wasn't the school...

211
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,990
covering all costs for the language camp?

212
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,330
I heard I had good enough grades to receive the benefit.

213
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,500
Of course you have good enough grades.

214
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,399
But it turns out...

215
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,940
that there's someone less fortunate than you financially,

216
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,169
and the spot went to her first.

217
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,039
What?

218
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,210
I'm well aware of your situation, but...

219
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,080
But that other student doesn't have any parents,

220
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,690
and she lives with just her grandmother.

221
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,220
So if you could be understanding...

222
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,960
What does that have to do with me?

223
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,629
There being someone who's less fortunate than I...

224
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,200
doesn't make my situation any better.

225
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,100
Right. It doesn't.

226
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm not saying there isn't an option for you.

227
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,950
You'll have to pay 3,500 dollars.

228
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,879
Couldn't your parents manage that?

229
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,250
Hye In.

230
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,990
Will you be going...

231
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,250
to the language camp in New Zealand during the break?

232
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,120
What?

233
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,190
We heard you made study plans to prepare for your time there.

234
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,570
Can we join you?

235
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,070
We won't be mooching off you, though.

236
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,870
In exchange, we'll share the English essay we're writing.

237
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,269
What do you say?

238
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm not sure.

239
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,080
I've actually been thinking about not going.

240
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,049
Why?

241
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:58,059
To be honest, a program designed by the school...

242
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,659
will be cookie-cutter at best.

243
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,490
I doubt it'll be of any use to me.

244
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,799
Right, I see.

245
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,299
Right.

246
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,039
- I'm home. - Hey.

247
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,349
Is your leg sore again?

248
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,150
The walk from the station has it working up again.

249
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,819
I'm sure it'll get better soon.

250
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,490
You should take a cab. It's not like it costs a lot.

251
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,160
But it's not like you can dig for the money you need.

252
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,500
One should live within their means.

253
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,569
That again.

254
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,509
If that's the case,

255
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,140
I'm looking toward a lifetime of poverty.

256
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,480
What was that?

257
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,750
What is it?

258
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,890
Why are you in my room? Get out!

259
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,420
Darn it.

260
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,859
Leave.

261
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,589
You and that temper of yours.

262
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,059
Why is she so hot-headed?

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,849
Hye In.

267
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,480
Will you be going...

268
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,750
to the language camp in New Zealand during the break?

269
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,910
I thought you were only going to unbox those,

270
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,210
but you put them on and are now taking photos.

271
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,180
Updating my social media account the day I went shopping...

272
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,650
is common courtesy.

273
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,259
Shouldn't you extend that to me as well?

274
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,690
Ms. Kim, does this purse...

275
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,630
go with this outfit?

276
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,259
It's pretty on the eyes,

277
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,970
but it stands out too much in the photos.

278
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,400
Isn't that a purse you already had?

279
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,809
I remember seeing one just like it.

280
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,150
Yes, it's over there.

281
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,089
What on earth are you saying?

282
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,859
One's a limited edition...

283
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,220
while one's of a basic design...

284
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,160
that is a bestseller.

285
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,230
Look. How are these the same?

286
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,000
This is a rare model that is nearly impossible to buy...

287
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
even if you have the money.

288
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,369
A famous celebrity collaborated on it.

289
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,569
And it's a new release.

290
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,140
It's even in pink.

291
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,150
I'm not sure.

292
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:12,549
How are these not identical?

293
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,220
Was it 3,000 dollars?

294
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,660
What about it?

295
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,029
This was actually pricier.

296
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,130
Was it 5K?

297
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,740
That's what it'll cost me to go to New Zealand.

298
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:33,569
It's insane.

299
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,109
Aren't you wasting too much money on luxuries?

300
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,849
And being immature isn't a decent excuse.

301
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,180
Must you say it that way?

302
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,819
I just really don't get it.

303
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,259
Why does a student need purses that cost 3,000 to 5,000 dollars?

304
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,089
The same goes for your clothes and shoes.

305
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,859
I would never spend my money on such things.

306
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,099
What a waste of money.

307
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
Is that so?

308
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,640
That's right.

309
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,220
You're right about them being of similar design.

310
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,990
I'll give you the one I had.

311
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,789
Take it.

312
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,130
What?

313
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,099
I'm giving it to you for free.

314
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,509
I won't be carrying the old one a lot anyway.

315
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,640
If I sell this...

316
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,079
I could probably receive around 3,000 or 4,000 dollars.

317
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,549
Do you not need it?

318
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,450
- Never mind, then. - Wait.

319
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,130
See?

320
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,730
Even you would take it if it's free.

321
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,470
How funny.

322
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,769
My mom told me...

323
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,539
that people act like they don't want the things...

324
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,980
that they can't possess...

325
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,950
and rather devalue those items.

326
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,180
Especially...

327
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,119
poor people.

328
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,359
Well, I wasn't talking about you.

329
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,259
I need to go to the bathroom.

330
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,970
Where are all the customers today?

331
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,609
Are you ordering chicken?

332
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,250
Don't you dare.

333
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,980
Just eat chicken or jokbal.

334
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,450
They'll both make me gain weight.

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,119
Let's eat it together.

336
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,900
Hey, what's with you?

337
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,569
Are you crazy?

338
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,339
Life is so unfair.

339
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
Gosh, did you just realize that?

340
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,849
I already knew, but I thought I would be rewarded...

341
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,119
if I worked hard.

342
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,990
But...

343
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,029
all of the deities must be dead.

344
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,500
Gosh, you can get scary when you're mad.

345
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,769
There was this student in my department in college.

346
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,339
She was gorgeous.

347
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:01,339
And she had a smoking hot body too.

348
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,880
For some reason, at that moment,

349
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,049
I vividly remembered...

350
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
the story that she told me then.

351
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,599
That day might have been the start of everything.

352
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,829
So?

353
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:23,430
What's the moral of the story?

354
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,500
The moral?

355
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,869
There's nothing like that.

356
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,410
I'm just saying...

357
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,910
that this world is too dirty...

358
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,309
and unfair...

359
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,150
for you to hope for a reward after working...

360
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,690
as hard as you are now.

361
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,160
That's all.

362
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,230
What the...

363
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,140
Hello.

364
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,009
Welcome in. Na Yeon said she'll be late.

365
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,349
I did this and this.

366
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,049
People act like they don't want the things...

367
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:17,450
that they can't possess...

368
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,720
and rather devalue those items.

369
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,920
Especially...

370
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,259
poor people.

371
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,829
"Devalue?"

372
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,970
It's not even pretty.

373
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,960
(Can you rate this bag? I don't understand why it's pretty.)

374
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,329
(For your information, this bag costs 5,000 dollars.)

375
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,190
(Post)

376
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,359
I'm back.

377
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,410
- You're here. - Yes.

378
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,319
Here. This is what we'll do today.

379
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,799
Hey.

380
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,329
What's wrong with her? Why is she waving at us?

381
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,190
Kim Hye In.

382
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,829
Is it true...

383
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,960
that you signed up for the New Zealand language camp...

384
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,859
as a near-poverty scholarship student?

385
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,269
Who says?

386
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,970
Class Three's president...

387
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,039
said they overheard you in the Teacher's Room.

388
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,839
Knowing you're a near-poverty student is already so ridiculous.

389
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,809
But why did you say that the program would be predictable...

390
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,220
and that it wouldn't help?

391
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,819
You're so shameless for a person who's going for free.

392
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:40,920
Hey, no way.

393
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,960
Hey, Kim Hye In.

394
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,700
Have you been acting all along when you were actually rich?

395
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,740
Gosh, look at this high schooler...

396
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,410
who was born with a gold spoon.

397
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,049
I'm so jealous.

398
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,150
That's a limited edition. There are only a few bags in Korea.

399
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,589
I want to live like her.

400
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,450
She's on another level.

401
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,589
I wonder what her parents do for a living.

402
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,490
Amazing. Can you give it to me if you don't find it pretty?

403
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,599
Hey, did you see this?

404
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,099
The house looks so nice too.

405
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,460
Aren't you Kim Hye In from Class One?

406
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,599
I'm jealous of her life.

407
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,599
What is all of this?

408
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,269
(Rich high schoolers these days)

409
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,339
(Followers)

410
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:41,119
Kim Hye In, level with us.

411
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,490
Are you really from a wealthy family?

412
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,319
- She's not answering. - I told you.

413
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,400
Hye In, you can be honest.

414
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,259
You're from a low-income family.

415
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,730
- What? - Really?

416
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,170
- What's going on? - Was she lying?

417
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,400
There are two things that I need to clarify.

418
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,970
- She must've wanted to see. - She's funny.

419
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,210
The fact that I'm from a low-income family...

420
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,579
and the lie that I was born with a gold spoon.

421
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,490
Why are you already here? Na Yeon won't be here for a while.

422
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:20,289
I had some business to take care of nearby, and I had extra time.

423
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,230
I can wait inside her room, right?

424
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,390
- Sure. - Thank you.

425
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:37,640
But if you're given a chance to choose,

426
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,740
wouldn't everyone choose...

427
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,839
to be rich than to be poor?

428
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,619
Expensive bags,

429
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,890
pretty heels,

430
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,059
nice clothes.

431
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,529
I can choose.

432
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,900
I really don't get her.

433
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,440
I can't believe her.

434
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,569
She's not saying a word.

435
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,579
Since they won't know...

436
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,079
You're right. I'm actually...

437
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,049
from a wealthy family.

438
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,289
See? I told you.
