00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,410
Done.

192
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,090
Go.

193
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,530
Run your best.

194
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,770
Come on.

195
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,830
I just hope you guys

196
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,530
won't hold me back.

197
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Come on.

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,650
Now let's see

199
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,600
the second throw of You Qian.

200
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,910
Come on, Fatty!

201
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,700
Come on!

202
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
Come on, Fatty.

203
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,190
Come on!

204
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,050
Come on.

205
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Throw it far.

206
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,240
Come on.

207
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,300
Awesome!

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,990
So cool!

209
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,000
Xue Yiran.

210
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,520
I thought you wouldn't participate in the competition.

211
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,490
I heard Xue Yiran is going to play.

212
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,400
Hasn't he been injured?

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,840
Yes!

214
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,700
Xue Yiran is going to play?

215
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,790
The news of Xue Yiran going to play

216
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,720
should be made public as late as possible.

217
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,530
Understand?

218
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,960
It can perturb the others

219
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
as it's most unexpected.

220
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,170
Any distraction

221
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,700
outside the track and field

222
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,230
will cause the opponents to lose their ZONE state.

223
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,660
If they make one mistake,

224
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,580
the impact will be fatal for them.

225
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,420
Do you see the scar on his foot?

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,980
Even if he comes, it won't matter.

227
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Him?

228
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,500
He's half a cripple. What's there to be afraid of?

229
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,520
He's not the old Xue Yiran.

230
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,570
Next,

231
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,820
what everyone is looking forward to

232
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,550
is the men's 4 x 100 m relay race.

233
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,690
Yesterday's preliminaries were just amazing.

234
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,100
It is predicted

235
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
this year's result

236
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,230
will improve by 1 whole second

237
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,200
than that of last year

238
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,840
and break

239
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
the record of this competition.

240
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,810
Is that Xue Yiran?

241
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,000
Didn't he just have a surgery?

242
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,570
Will he be injured again

243
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,760
if he plays so soon?

244
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,450
Come on.

245
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,770
Why is Xue Yiran the fourth-leg sprinter?

246
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,810
Wasn't he injured?

247
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,850
The one from the soccer team...

248
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,770
Who was that?

249
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,830
Chen Mingxiang.

250
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,510
Yes.

251
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,400
What about Chen Mingxiang?

252
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Why isn't he here?

253
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,830
Mr. Yuan, I forgot to tell you.

254
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,680
These days,

255
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,450
he's not feeling well.

256
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,430
He often has stomach trouble.

257
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,630
He went to the toilet.

258
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,010
How did you take care of your students?

259
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,460
I'm the only one taking care of

260
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,980
the track and field team.

261
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,910
And our school

262
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,040
doesn't have a nutritionist, either.

263
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,400
He may recover in this half a year,

264
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
but

265
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,400
how much can he recover

266
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,760
in half a year?

267
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,050
Pay attention.

268
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,210
Focus.

269
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Don't care about others.

270
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,710
One, two, three.

271
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,050
We've worked so hard

272
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,200
for the championship.

273
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,600
Victory!

274
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,860
Nothing else matters.

275
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,020
Come on.

276
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,780
One, two, three.

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,510
Go!

278
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,090
Let's go.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,700
I heard that you turned down

280
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,890
an invitational tournament abroad for this competition.

281
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,690
Yes.

282
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,360
Is it because there are too many masters abroad

283
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,290
and it's easier to win a place here?

284
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,170
Do you think I have no chance?

285
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,680
Do you think

286
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,020
the Asians don't have a chance

287
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,010
on the world stage?

288
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,880
It's because it's fun.

289
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,760
I think

290
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,640
the fastest potential speed for the Asians

291
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,200
is far from being unlocked.

292
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,090
This place

293
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,700
is full of possibilities.

294
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,150
It's because of Qi Tian, isn't it?

295
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,960
You want to compete with him again?

296
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,370
One, two, three.

297
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,080
Go!

298
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,060
♫My desire grows as time passes by♫

299
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,320
Three, two, one.

300
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,250
♫Just consider me a crazy guy even if I'll fall♫

301
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,890
Go! Go!

302
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,910
♫I won't stop♫

303
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,619
I can't believe he doesn't run the first leg!

304
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,230
♫I'm stubborn, proud, and arrogant♫

305
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,510
♫I won't hesitate even if I go against the light♫

306
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,800
You didn't see this coming, did you?

307
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm your opponent today.

308
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,750
♫I'll never surrender to fate♫

309
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,829
♫Running on the crowded street is crazy♫

310
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,630
♫Through the crowd, I'm not afraid of their questioning gazes♫

311
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,470
Did they plan to make Xue Yiran the fourth-leg sprinter

312
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,510
in the final from the beginning?

313
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,750
♫The sunset extends my shadow forward♫

314
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,200
♫It's my kingdom, and I'm the king♫

315
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,060
♫I refuse to be teased by fate and I'll make my soul shine♫

316
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,820
♫My friends show me the key directions♫

317
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
♫Only those who undergo the baptism of fire are worthy of being called phoenixes♫

318
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,560
♫Just shine bright♫

319
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,420
Are you really recovered?

320
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,100
It's just an injury.

321
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
At worst, the bone will break

322
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,020
and be set again.

323
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,160
Is it because it's fun?

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Mr. Yuan,

325
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,980
Look.

326
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,860
I didn't lie to you, right?

327
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,430
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

328
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,750
Dear audience,

329
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,000
men's 4 x 100 m relay race

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,170
is about to begin.

331
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,660
♫Before the unknown fear drowns me♫

332
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,980
♫Fearless of the darkness, I run to you before the doomsday♫

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,140
♫We'll meet no matter how far away♫

334
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,770
♫Conquer helplessness and confusion♫

335
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,320
♫Close your eyes and walk into my world♫

336
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,250
It's been three years.

337
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,220
♫Dream of flying along the wind♫

338
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,610
I'm going to try my best.

339
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,800
Will I leave no regrets this time?

340
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,000
♫Before the unknown fear drowns me♫

341
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,530
♫Fearless of the darkness, I run to you before the doomsday♫

342
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,240
♫We'll meet no matter how far away♫

343
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,730
Your coordination is too bad.

344
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,850
♫Conquer helplessness and confusion♫

345
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,860
What's the use of growing so tall?

346
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,170
You're the worst center I've ever seen.

347
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,340
♫Close your eyes and walk into my world♫

348
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
You jinx!

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
The victory is ours for sure,

350
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,280
♫The heart goes after what it desires and flies with the wind♫

351
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,800
because the track-and-field ground at 4 a.m.

352
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,930
won't let me down.

353
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,160
Xue Yiran!

354
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Could it be…

355
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
that I can't even

356
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,080
achieve the small goal

357
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,540
of participating in the game?

358
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,410
Xue Yiran,

359
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
don't give up.

360
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,240
Do you want to

361
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,240
to see the view

362
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,220
from the top award podium?

363
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,110
The finale show this morning,

364
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,660
men's 4 x 100 m relay race,

365
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,800
is about to begin soon.

366
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,930
Let's get to know

367
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,220
the team on every lane.

368
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,320
The first lane,

369
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,600
Agriculture and Forestry University.

370
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,330
The second lane,

371
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,170
Hunan University of Technology.

372
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,680
The third lane,

373
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,810
Xinghe University.

374
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,530
Come on!

375
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,490
The fourth lane,

376
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,080
Mingde Institute of Technology.

377
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,810
The fifth lane,

378
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,070
Shenglin University.

379
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,810
The sixth lane,

380
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,140
Zhongtian University.

381
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
The seventh lane,

382
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,040
Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

383
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,880
The eighth lane,

384
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,210
Nanjing University of Western Medicine.

385
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,110
On your marks.

386
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,360
Set.

387
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,450
The game begins.

388
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
National College Students Athletics Tournament…

389
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,230
The starting reaction time of Ai Ziji

390
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,740
is similar to that of Shixing.

391
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,140
They are both top-notch.

392
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Come on.

393
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,000
Ziji!

394
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,510
Come on!

395
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,250
Are you here?

396
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,260
Do you see me?

397
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Damn it!

398
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,070
Is that the level of a top-tier sprinter?

399
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,730
I can't believe I couldn't leave him behind.

400
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,010
How fast is he?

401
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,550
It's because it's fun.

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,600
This place

403
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,210
is full of possibilities.

404
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,360
Now, Zeng Shixing,

405
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,930
Xu Yancheng,

406
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,600
and Ai Ziji

407
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
are getting farther away from Tian Yuan.

408
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,360
Which of them will

409
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,880
hand over the baton first?

410
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,810
It seems…

411
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,320
Zeng Shixing is faster.

412
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,120
We will definitely retain the championship.

413
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,940
That is what young people are like.

414
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,320
They don't give way to anyone.

415
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,560
The stronger their opponents are, the stronger they become.

416
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,400
Shixing.

417
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,150
Come on!

418
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,400
Tianfu seems to be slower,

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,130
Coach.

420
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,680
It's not that Tianfu is slow.

421
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
They adjusted

422
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,350
the handover distance.

423
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,880
They know themselves better than yesterday.

424
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,570
Shenglin!

425
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,600
Shenglin is the first team to finish the handover.

426
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,840
The second one is Zhongtian.

427
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,240
Xu Yancheng and Xinghe's Ai Ziji

428
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,470
almost completed the handover at the same time.

429
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,410
It is said that the second-leg sprinter of Xinghe, Wu Tianfu,

430
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,360
only practiced sprinting for a year,

431
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,000
but he doesn't look like it at all.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,480
Go,

433
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,250
Track-and-Field Boy!

434
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,880
Tianfu.

435
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,800
You've been expelled from the basketball team.

436
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
From now on,

437
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,250
you're no longer a member of the basketball team.

438
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,360
Coach,

439
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,990
I want to play basketball!

440
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,030
In my opinion,

441
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,000
your Basketball Club is no good.

442
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,720
Let's make a bet.

443
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,930
As long as the Track and Field Club

444
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,660
trains Wu Tianfu for two weeks,

445
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,390
he can outrun the fastest player

446
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,790
in your basketball team.

447
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,770
As long as Wu Tianfu wins,

448
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
you have to allow him to go back to the Basketball Club.

449
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,840
Captain.

450
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,440
I…

451
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,800
I want to stay in the Track and Field Club.

452
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
You want to stay in the Track and Field Club?

453
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,120
Yes.

454
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,810
I want to run.

455
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,080
I want to stay here

456
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,440
and run with them.

457
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,600
Goodbye,

458
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,680
Kobe.

459
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,860
Goodbye,

460
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,660
the basketball court at 4 a.m.

461
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,520
I...

462
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,800
I want to be recognized.

463
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,460
Come on.

464
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,810
You're the best.

465
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:10,660
Go!

466
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,690
Track-and-Field Boy.

467
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,300
Tianfu.

468
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,130
Come on.

469
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,310
Mingde!

470
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,390
Mingde and Zhongtian

471
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,920
are catching up gradually.

472
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
Go! Tianfu!

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,810
The advantage gained by Zeng Shixing

474
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,360
seems to hardly exist now.

475
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:55,900
No.

476
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,850
At the last moment,

477
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,440
sprinter of Shenglin, in the fifth lane, lost his balance

478
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,100
and fell into the fourth lane.

479
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,760
In such an unexpected situation,

480
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,730
what will Mingde at the fourth lane

481
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,060
make their adaptation?

482
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,040
Big mistake!

483
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,850
Mingde's third-leg sprinter went past it,

484
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,800
but Liu Jian, the second-leg sprinter,

485
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,930
failed to jump over the barrier.

486
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,080
He fell into the third lane.
