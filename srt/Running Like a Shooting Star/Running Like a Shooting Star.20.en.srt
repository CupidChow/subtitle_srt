00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,880
The training has made my body so tough.

186
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,740
I feel so great.

187
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,710
Why haven’t Xue Yiran and others

188
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,800
been here yet?

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,980
Is he

190
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,080
in trouble right now?

191
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,730
I don’t think so.

192
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,630
Xue Yiran has been lively recently.

193
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,940
Qi Tian gets Xue Yiran hot water for bathing Xue Yiran's feet every day.

194
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,550
He's almost Qi Tian's valet.

195
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,750
Okay.

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,620
It's almost ready.

197
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,280
I'll go ask Xiang to come back.

198
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,150
I don't get it.

199
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,880
He has already joined the track and field team.

200
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,740
How come he stills wants to play football every day?

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,250
What are you doing?

202
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,180
Pass me the ball.

203
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,680
What are you doing?

204
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,180
I just felt like playing football today.

205
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,340
Mr. Wang has allowed me to play football occasionally.

206
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,420
It's time to determine

207
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,540
who will take part in the relay race.

208
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,060
You or me?

209
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,760
The doctor said you needed to increase the amount of training gradually.

210
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,960
You can't try your best to run a race now.

211
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,280
I've waited too long.

212
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,010
I can't just let him replace me.

213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,750
If I can't even beat him,

214
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,120
I don't deserve to compete in the event.

215
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,560
Respect.

216
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Let's have a race.

217
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,270
Coach.

218
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Xue Yiran and Chen Mingxiang

219
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,160
are going to have a race.

220
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,640
Let's go.

221
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,080
Xiang.

222
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,760
Make the football team proud of you.

223
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't worry.

224
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,040
He hasn't fully recovered.

225
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,830
He can't run fast.

226
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,690
It'll be a waste of my energy

227
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,620
if I try my best to race against you.

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,630
On your marks.

229
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Set.

230
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,430
Stop!

231
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,300
You don't have to have the race.

232
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,000
Both of you can participate in the competition.

233
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,260
Coach has signed you both for the competition.

234
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,070
Xue Yiran.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,060
What are you doing?

236
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Good.

237
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,740
How could you plan to have a race without telling me?

238
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,400
Do you know what you're doing?

239
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,060
I've got the doctor's report.

240
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,210
I can run.

241
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,660
Coach.

242
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,360
He wanted to compete with me. He started it.

243
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,840
I can only show respect

244
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,950
for his decision.

245
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,950
Qi Tian.

246
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,060
What did you mean when you said

247
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,120
the coach signed both him and me for the competition?

248
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,110
Coach.

249
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
Wait.

250
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,070
Coach.

251
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,350
I don't think your decision is right.

252
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,080
You can't just forbid Xue Yiran from competing in the event

253
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,730
in order to make our team the winners of the contest.

254
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,680
We will all choose to compete for him.

255
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,210
Even if we can't win a prize,

256
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,810
we would still want you to allow him to compete.

257
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,680
Do you think

258
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm a coach who cares much about the prize?

259
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,730
If I cared about the prize,

260
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,950
I wouldn't have chosen to be your coach.

261
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,960
So,

262
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,310
are you afraid that Mr. Yuan would be unhappy about it?

263
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,870
Qi Tian.

264
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,270
We're allowed

265
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
to have substitutes

266
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,990
for the relay race.

267
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,070
We can have five athletes in our relay team.

268
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,400
It's perfectly normal.

269
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,010
Besides,

270
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,930
Xue Yiran’s not in his best condition.

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,870
Do you think

272
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,120
he should try his best to run

273
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,550
once or twice

274
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,110
in a short time?

275
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Once?

276
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,400
Twice?

277
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
So,

278
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,040
you have known it for a long time.

279
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,550
Coach.

280
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,950
You are so cruel.

281
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,400
Weren't you afraid Xue Yiran would

282
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,920
have an emotional breakdown if you kept hiding it from him?

283
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,320
All of you may have an emotional breakdown.

284
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,800
But Xue Yiran won’t.

285
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,810
Why did you choose to hide it from us?

286
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,480
If you had told us

287
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,030
this decision of yours in the first place,

288
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,480
we would all be happy.

289
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
Why didn't you?

290
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,990
If you had done it, they wouldn't have hated me.

291
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,970
Do you know the catfish effect?

292
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,580
If I hadn't made him feel challenged,

293
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,640
Xue Yiran

294
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,640
wouldn't have worked so hard

295
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,080
on his rehabilitation.

296
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,120
If you

297
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,240
feel you may be challenged and replaced,

298
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,720
subconsciously,

299
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,320
you'll get your body

300
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,950
to become stronger

301
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,560
and recover from injuries.

302
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,720
Coach.

303
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,670
You are so bad.

304
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,880
Xiang can make Xue Yiran

305
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,720
and the rest of you

306
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,280
feel challenged.

307
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,080
You should thank Xiang

308
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,280
for his help during these days.

309
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,770
Thank you, Coach.

310
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,820
Thank you, Xiang.

311
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,860
My goodness.

312
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,410
Did I turn off the stove

313
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,570
when I left?

314
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,540
Darn it.

315
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,380
Here, your clothes.

316
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,500
Wait, I'll go too.

317
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
Xiang.

318
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,850
What were they talking about?

319
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,090
Let's go.

320
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,790
Let's go eat hotpot fish.

321
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,750
Here, Xiang.

322
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,700
Have some fish.

323
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you.

324
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,030
Xiang.

325
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,800
This is your first time

326
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,660
to have a meal with us here, right?

327
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,310
Yes.

328
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,750
Back then,

329
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,440
we had a small party here every three days

330
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,220
and a big one here every five days.

331
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,480
It's all Wang's fault.

332
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,650
He has been training us so hard lately.

333
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,560
Yiran.

334
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,620
Although the contest is only 20 days away,

335
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,900
don't be anxious.

336
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,120
You're not allowed to finish a 100-meter run in less than 14 seconds this week.

337
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
I'll see how you are recovering

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,050
and see if and when I can let you run faster.

339
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,130
Yes, Coach.

340
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,510
Qi Tian.

341
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,720
Eat more.

342
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,570
You've done so much for me these days.

343
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,410
Thank you and we'll talk later.

344
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,690
You're welcome.

345
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,190
Because of one guy,

346
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,000
what I did for him was almost in vain.

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
He even wanted to race against someone.

348
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,190
Yes, Xue Yiran.

349
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,840
Qi Tian did so much

350
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,940
to help you take care of your leg.

351
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
Indeed.

352
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,530
In the past, Mr. Rustic

353
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,780
didn't have a girlfriend.

354
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,580
Now,

355
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,520
he's the Golden Hound

356
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,230
that lots of people in our school

357
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,760
have heard about.

358
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,160
But he still doesn't have a girlfriend.

359
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,560
What is to blame for this?

360
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,270
Xue Yiran's injured leg!

361
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,550
What?

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,530
His nickname is Mr. Rustic?

363
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,430
You fatty!

364
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,800
Don't embarrass me.

365
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,079
It's my fault.

366
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,130
I'll be Qi Tian's servant

367
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,720
from now on to repay him, okay?

368
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,520
You'd better keep your promise.

369
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,160
It's so good to have watermelon after having a hot pot.

370
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,420
Have some watermelon.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,990
It's so sweet.

372
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,400
Nothing important.

373
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,290
Bye.

374
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,200
Don't take that one.

375
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,230
That one is bigger. You take this.

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,760
Actually,

377
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,530
I know some of your stories.

378
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,100
I didn't tell you my plan

379
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,400
because I believed

380
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,670
you could become mentally strong by yourself.

381
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,670
Making you feel you might be replaced

382
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,440
made you become more motivated

383
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,440
and refuse to give up.

384
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,230
Do you think

385
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,560
you've always been

386
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,260
losing precious things since childhood?

387
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm 58 years old.

388
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,880
When I was 27,

389
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,950
I lost my father.

390
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,600
The girl I loved the so much

391
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,760
also left me.

392
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,910
Later,

393
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,830
in an accident, my wife...

394
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,230
Don't look at me this way.

395
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,800
She didn't die.

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
She lost the hearing of her left ear.

397
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,300
What I want to tell you

398
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,360
is that people of my age

399
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,950
are losing something every day.

400
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,440
Maybe it's something as unimportant as a teacup.

401
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,100
Or something as big as a house.

402
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,360
Even my perception, my memory,

403
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,310
and my ability to take action

404
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,080
are deteriorating.

405
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,010
The list goes on.

406
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
I went back to my hometown the other day.

407
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,890
And I found the old houses were all torn down.

408
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,960
But my childhood memories were there.

409
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,830
Now,

410
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,380
there are only newly built modern houses

411
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,040
It is common for people of my age

412
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,880
to keep losing things.

413
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,430
Life

414
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,120
is all about

415
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,520
keeping losing things.

416
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,870
You'll also lose

417
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,440
my coaching one day.

418
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,360
What you need to do

419
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,620
is learn

420
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
how to handle the losses well.

421
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,290
Actually, you're doing a very good job.

422
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,130
But you need to do better.

423
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
I still need to do better?

424
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,400
The most painful thing is not to lose things.

425
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,700
As long as you really worked hard for those things and cherished them,

426
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,990
you won't feel regretful

427
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,630
when you lose them.

428
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,030
We'll lose everything eventually,

429
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,080
but we should be brave enough

430
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,190
to live a real life .

431
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,580
Tianfu.

432
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,670
Go check your wardrobe.

433
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,110
YJMF.

434
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,610
As long as you really worked hard for those things and cherished them,

435
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,290
you won't feel regretful

436
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,260
when you lose them.
