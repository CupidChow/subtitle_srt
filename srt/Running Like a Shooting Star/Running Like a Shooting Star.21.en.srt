Hello.

You're here too.

Fatty.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
You're under a lot of pressure this year.

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,210
They are all strong rivals.

12
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,380
The stronger they are,

13
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,729
the more excited I am.

14
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,180
No wonder you are Big Hulk.

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,780
Alright.

The figures of track-and-field athletes

19

vary a lot.

20
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,750
I'm already getting nervous.

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,890
Look who that is.

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,410
You guys.

I'm looking after the luggage.

27
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,079
No.

00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,390
It cannot be so quick.

29

Why are you here today?

30
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,660

33

You are cunning.

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,750
You are not ashamed at all whey lying.

35
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,830
The coach told us to keep our strength.

36

to help us finish the 4 x 100 m relay race.

A makeshift team.

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
Well...

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,000

Many reporters will be there.

64

Have you figured out what to do?

65
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,310
The worst-case scenario will be

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,510
that they come and take some photos of me

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,560
and make it

68
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,200
a clickbait, saying

69
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,170
that I cannot run as fast as before.

70

Instead of worrying about this,

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,050
I'd rather enjoy

72
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,570
your physiotherapy which makes me relaxed.

73

My head hurts a lot.

77
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,390
Why did I

78
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,150
persuade you to do the surgery?

79
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,340
Your leg was broken,

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
but what did it have to do with me?

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,250
You've been massaging my feet for so long.

82
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,260
They smell good, right?

83
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,500
Yes.

84
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,460
I've been massaging them for so long.

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,300
Be gentle.

86

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,450

Qi Tian, I'm not fully recovered.

93

I don't think it's convenient to enter the room.

How can you call this bullying?

95
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,450
It's okay.

96
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,920
This is their daily life.

97
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,659
I am giving you a massage.

Fatty, Wang and Xiang

115
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,300
are waiting for us in the lobby.

Ai Ziji

117
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,670

118
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,130
This set is for the morning

119
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,730
and this is for the night.

126
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,790
What a coincidence.

127
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,420
Have you decided

128
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,080
what we are going to eat later?

129

What a coincidence.

131
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,280
Are you going to eat too?

132
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,340
Yes.

133
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,240
Ms. Luo, long time no see.

134
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,590
You're still so pretty.

135
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,340
Ms. Luo.

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,810
The physiotherapeutic skills you taught Qi Tian

137
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,220
are really effective.

138
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,340
So it was you

139
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,110
who made loud noises just now.

140
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,680
Why don't we

141
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,100
find a place to eat together?

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,630
Let's go.

143
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,050
Am I too stressed?

144
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,970
It couldn't be.

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,050
Why should I be nervous?

146
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,450
I must be unaccustomed to the climate here.

147
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,980
I'm wearing a face mask.

148
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,260
I don't want to fight.

149
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,380
It's not bad to take the stairs.

150
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,960
You...

151
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,870
Why didn't you take the stairs?

152
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,040
Qi Tian.

153
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,170
I haven't seen you for three months.

154
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,090
Has your gluteus maximus grown?

155
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,860
You can say it directly that I have a nice booty.

156
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,080
That's different.

157
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,419
I complimented you in an academic way.

158
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,730
Honey.

159
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,470
Aren't you speaking

160
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,870
too much now?

161
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,600
I sensed something

162
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,910
between you two.

163
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,450
Don't you know that?

164
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,540
They've already been together.

165
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,410
Ms. Luo.

166
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,690
You only enjoyed a short period of time

167
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,010
as a carefree single.

168
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,890
Who knew

169
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,790
that he could not resist my charm?

170
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,130
Shixing.

171
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,260
I didn't expect you were like this.

172
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,530
So do you like me

173
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,190
when I act like this?

174
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,020
Let's make it between us.

175
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,390
Sir.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,300
What's wrong?

177
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,110
I envy you young people.

178
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,450
I wish I could express my feelings like you.

179
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,570
Why isn't Xu Yancheng here yet?

180
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,810
Right.

181
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,170
Could Ai Ziji fall asleep

182
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,850
during his skincare

183
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,720
in the hotel?

184
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,540
Are you the third-leg sprinter of Xinghe?

185
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,290
You can recognize me

186
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,150
even when I'm wearing a face mask?

187
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,220
Ai Ziji.

188
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,860
Your height is 180 cm.

189
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,500
Your PB

190
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,530
is 10.59 seconds.

193
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:05,950
Play...

194
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,130
Playboy?

195
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,050
Who told you that?

196
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,190
My friends from Shenglin.

197
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,210
No.

198
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,360
I need to ask them

199
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,440
to clear my name.

200
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,810
Why are you following me?

201
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,080
I'm going the same way.

202
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:29,970
He's here.

203
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,780
Ziji.

204
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,180
Hurry!

205
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,710
This way.

206
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,250
Come here.

207
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,880
Here.

208
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,090
Yancheng.

209
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,980
You bumped into each other?

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,420
Yes.

211
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,500
We met in the elevator just now.

212
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,660
Who told him

213
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,840
that I was a playboy?

214
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,900
It's true that you have

215
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,100
many female friends.

216
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,340
Yes.

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,700
The girls who came for you last time

218
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,540
cheered so loud

219
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,940
that we were almost deaf.

220
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,700
Xue Yiran attracts more girls than me.

221
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,340
Why didn't you gossip about him?

222
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,140
Because

223
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,950
I didn't have a thing with them.

224
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,050
I don't even have their contact numbers.

225
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,450
What do you mean by having a thing?

226
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,770
Xue Yiran, answer my question.

227
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,140
I...

228
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,130
Thank you.

229
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,170
This time,

230
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,750
Mingde Institute of Technology

231
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,260
is very likely to win.

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
Mingde Institute of Technology

233
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,040
is just so-so.

234
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,940
We didn't do our utmost last time.

235
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,260
Everything is possible

236
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,270
in the relay.

237
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,090
I agree.

238
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,280
Strengh is not the only decisive factor.

239
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,020
Luck

240
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,140
also plays a role.

241
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,920
A makeshift team

242
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,710
needs to depend on luck now.

243
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,810
You were next door to us?

244
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,750
It's because we are not strong enough

245
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,470
that we need to rely on luck.

246
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,940
You want

247
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,180
some?

248
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:57,780
No.

249
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,520
We'll have training

250
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,450
at 5 a.m.

251
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,970
Haoyu.

252
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,870
You have to work hard this time.

253
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,340
Shenglin has been the champion of this event

254
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,560
for the past three years.

255
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,860
It'll be the same this year.

256
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,020
Shixing.

257
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,180
You're so straightforward.

258
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,860
Let's go.

259
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,540
Since we meet here,

260
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,410
let's take a photo together.

261
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,990
You're all athletes, right?

262
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,740
You look so energetic.

263
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,620
Good luck to you the day after tomorrow!

264
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,060
Try our best

265
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,980
to win the game!

266
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,950
In this photo

267
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,180
are the best male sprinters

268
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,810
this year.

269
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:46,820
Look.

270
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,450
Did you bring the foot soaking tub?

271
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,790
Don't forget to soak your feet later.

272
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,090
Wang said

273
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,420
it would be cold in the hotel with the air conditioner.

274
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,770
He wanted us to take care at night

275
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,030
and not to catch a cold.

276
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,090
Qi Tian.

277
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,140
Thank you

278
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,070
for your care during this period of time.

279
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,740
Why are you so polite?

280
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,090
Don't think

281
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,760
that I feel guilty.

282
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,920
You underestimate me.

283
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,220
I fooled

284
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,990
you here

285
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,540
to win the gold medal for us.

286
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,660
Mom.

287
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,640
Don't come to me.

288
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,090
Besides,

289
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,550
the race won't be held tomorrow.

290
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,180
It's on the day after tomorrow.

291
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,890
I will be much more nervous

292
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,820
to see you than seeing the referee.

293
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,890
I know.

294
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,660
Okay, Mom.

295
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,720
They all look down on me.

296
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,790
Everyone

297
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,380
starts as a noboday.

298
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,830
It's only been less than a year.

299
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,850
We've changed a lot.

300
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,220
If it were not because of sprint,

301
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,990
I would still

302
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,250
be a bench warmer in the basketball team.

303
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,910
The night when Qi Tian and Yiran

304
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,040
invited me to the Track and Field Club,

305
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,340
I realized

306
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,070
the charm of 100-meter sprint.

307
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,290
I don't care

308
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,980
where I will be in the future.

309
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,200
But tomorrow,

310
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,570
I want to fight with my legs.

311
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,830
You are so simple-minded.

312
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,850
Listen.

313
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,700
If you talk like this while applying a face mask,

314
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,020
you'll get wrinkles.

315
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
I haven't slept well for days.

316
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,320
Don't disturb me tonight.

317
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,890
[National College Students Athletics Tournament]

318
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,500
Xu Yancheng. Xu Yancheng.

319
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,690
It is said the players are all competitive

320
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,780
in this year's 100-meter sprint.

321
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
What do you think?

322
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,740
Someone says your running style

323
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,980
is very similar to Michael Johnson.

324
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,540
What do you think?

325
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,600
I think neither of them is important.

326
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,770
Tsingpek has lost to Shenglin

327
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,540
and been second place in the 4 x 100 m relay race

328
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,550
for three years.

329
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,660
What do you think

330
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,530
of Zeng Shixing?

331
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,820
Zeng Shixing was indeed Shenglin's leader figure.

332
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,330
He's been our rival for a long time.

333
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,530
But he might be disappointed this year.

334
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,810
Because all of us are determined

335
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,540
to win the gold medal this year.

336
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,490
What do you think

337
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,890
of Tsingpek's comments?

338
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,180
They are so confident.

339
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,530
I wish them good luck.

340
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,410
I wanted to prove myself

341
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,580
before,

342
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,650
but now

343
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,110
I run for my girlfriend.

344
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,220
He cares about nothing but his girlfriend.

345
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,660
If he wants to win something for his girlfriend,

346
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,920
no one can take it away.

347
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,020
The College Students Athletics Tournament

348
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,770
is so exciting.

349
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,060
Carefree young people dare to say whatever they want.

350
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,540
Hello.

351
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,420
What do you think

352
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,690
about the race this year?

353
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,900
We don't know about other teams,

354
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,760
but Huainan is always number one.

355
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,090
OK.

356
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,060
Huainan, go!

357
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,740
Xue Yiran, everyone said

358
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,940
you were here to be a spectator.

359
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
What's your comment?

360
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,010
That's true.

361
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,339
I like boys who are as quiet and gentle

362
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,460
as him.

363
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,650
Excuse me.

364
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,980
Who is Qi Tian?

365
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,190
Who do you think is your biggest rival

366
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,920
in 100-meter sprint this year?

367
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,089
Qi Tian.

368
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,450
If there must be an answer,

369
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,780
it should be Qi Tian.

370
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,450
My girlfriend told me

371
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,020
that Qi Tian would be my most competitive rival

372
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,350
in the next three years.

373
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,240
I don't think so.

374
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,590
Qi Tian.

375
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,310
I will defeat you.

376
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,220
So many top players

377
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,170
think that you are

378
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,270
the most competitive.

379
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,620
Do you have any comment?

380
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,550
They worry too much.

381
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,390
I'm just an ordinary person

382
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,470
who loves running.

383
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,010
Okay.

384
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,740
Thank you.

385
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,340
Thank you.

386
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,050
Come on.

387
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,820
Is this another way of humblebraging?

388
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,700
So many young faces, so many personalities.

389
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,450
They are enjoying their youth now.

390
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,860
Stay tuned to see how well they will perform

391
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,850
tomorrow.

392
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,610
When will our team show up?

393
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,620
Why didn't I see

394
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,450
Ziji and Wu Tianfu?

395
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,030
I just read the schedule.

396
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,030
It should be soon.

397
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,460
[Xinghe, come on!]

398
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,710
Xue Yiran did not join the race.

399
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,730
Hasn't his foot

400
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,300
fully recovered?

401
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,220
I have no idea.

402
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,620
The games in the morning will be really exciting.

403
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,690
-Yes. -As we can see,

404
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,940
players of men's 4 x 100 m relay race

405
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,430
have started to warm up

406
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,490
on the track.

407
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,270
Where are Wu Tianfu and others?

408
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,250
Which group are they in?

409
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,850
This year,

410
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,330
we have 25 teams

411
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,300
signing up for

412
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,500
men's 4 x 100 m relay race.

413
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,490
They are divided into four groups to compete.

414
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,410
Heat One includes...

415
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,020
-They are in Heat Two and will be there soon. -The team from Tsingpek University.

416
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
The four of them

417
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,340
are all competitive

418
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,960
without obvious weaknesses.

419
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,490
They are indeed much stronger than last year.

420
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
The preliminary of men's 4 x 100 m relay

421
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,070
is about to begin

422
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,110
now.

423
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,650
Let's get to know

424
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,650
each team.

425
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,210
You are in Heat Two.

426
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,820
You will compete with teams from

427
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,380
Zhongtian University

428
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,440
and BSD University

429
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,050
Remember

430
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,350
that the preliminary today

431
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,610
is your final.

432
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,810
Only if you finish in the top eight

433
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,460
and are qualified to the semifinal

434
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,700
will Xue Yiran

435
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,480
reach the final.

436
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm so nervous.

437
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,300
If we didn't make it to the final,

438
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,060
Xue Yiran...

439
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,970
Stop it.

440
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,790
I don't even dare to think about that.

441
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,740
Ziji.

442
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,270
There's a pimple on your nose.

443
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,580
Shut up!

444
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,210
Damn it!

445
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,550
There's one more.

446
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,370
It's been a long time

447
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,900
since he retched last time.

448
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,850
It turns out that Qi Tian can be under pressure too.

449
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,580
He must be

450
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,700
under the most pressure.

451
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,610
Qi Tian.

452
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,120
Are you okay?

453
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,940
I'm fine.

454
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,250
It's normal.

455
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,850
It is

456
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,880
much better than before.

457
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,580
At least I won't be in a panic

458
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,300
because of vomiting.

459
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,380
Didn't the coach advise you

460
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,580
to relieve stress through meditation?

461
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,690
I finally understood

462
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,890
why the coach said we should have a lifelong cultivation.

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,940
Because there's always something that we care

464
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,200
lingering in our mind.

465
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,550
Whether it's being fickle

466
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,010
or having too much desires

467
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,940
and obsessions,

468
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,900
any of it can stop us

469
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,290
from being in the zone.

470
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,700
Come on.

471
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,800
Come on.

472
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,330
Come on.

473
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,120
Come on.

474
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,950
So fast!

475
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,720
No wonder it's a national tournament.

476
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
What do you think?

477
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,060
No problem.

478
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,270
Good performance.

479
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,220
Tsingpek University...

480
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,750
Tsingpek is charged with foul.

481
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,910
Their result is cancelled.

482
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,330
Being nervous causes mistakes.

483
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
These are all distracting thoughts

484
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,260
for us.

485
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:45,970
Yes.

486
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,080
The coach said

487
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,270
we should compete at our own pace.

488
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,220
It's our turn.

489
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,790
Let's compete with a peaceful mind,

490
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,590
the makeshift team!
