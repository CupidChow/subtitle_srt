[Running Like A Shooting Star]

3
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,810
Look, it's Xue Yiran.

4
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,090
Wait for us.

5
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,480
[Episode 11 Don't fall for me who can be hurt easily]

6
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,610
Xue Yiran, don't go.

7
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,460
Excuse me. Please make way.

8
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,250
Hello.

9
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm a reporter from the Hanfu Exhibition.

10
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,650
The Track and Field Club

11
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,770
used to be unknown,

12
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,220
but its rehearsal has attracted a lot of attention recently.

13
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,860
Do you have any comment?

14
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,550
What should we say?

15
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,670
We are either in the rehearsal hall

16
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,380
or on the track-and-field ground every day.

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,810
I don't even have time to remove my makeup.

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,259
My skin is getting worse.

19
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,450
You've changed several sets of clothes.

20
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,310
It's almost different every day.

21
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,410
You acted the Four Detectives yesterday.

22
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,710
And today

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
you are the Four Literary Masters.

24
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,770
Every set of your clothes looks good.

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,890
Why do you change your styles frequently?

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,970
Does your director have new ideas?

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,610
Our director is naive yet rich.

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,610
He doesn't know what he wants,

29
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,420
so he edited the script frequently.

30
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,890
To put it bluntly, he is squandering money.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,850
I see.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,280
Do you have any expectations

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,670
for your performance?

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,380
Xue Yiran, go ahead,

35
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,460
No expectations.

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,860
The biggest problem of a new director

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,570
is that the scene can be out of control

38
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,100
due to a lack of experience.

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,079
What about you?

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,370
No expectations.

41
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,380
I just want this to end as quickly as it can.

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,450
Then I can focus on my study.

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,980
I don't want to flunk again.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,450
What about you?

45
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,390
No expectations.

46
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,450
It seems everyone can be a director now.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,550
We work overtime every day.

48
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,700
It's hard for us to earn some money.

49
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,370
What about you?

50
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,690
I'm very busy.

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,260
Go and interview someone else.

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,010
Make way.

53
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,150
How could you be rude like this!

54
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,230
Xue Yiran.

55
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,340
Xue Yiran, wait for us! Xue Yiran!

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,290
Hurry up.

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,730
Run! Run!

58
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,850
Stop! Stop!

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,850
Ms. Luo.

60
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,170
You...

61
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,410
-You... -Ms. Luo.

62
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,620
Why are you here?

63
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,650
Let's talk inside. Let's go.

64
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,420
Let's go inside.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
What's going on?

66
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,120
I feel uncomfortable in this set of clothes.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
You are acting Tang Bohu.

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,329
You are Zhu Zhishan.

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,660
You two are Wen Zhengming and Xu Zhenqing.

70
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,210
You are right.

71
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,020
I knew it.

72
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,170
These outfits suit you.

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,850
Sorry.

74
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,740
I gotta go.

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,270
Don't disturb me.

76
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going to finish the script.

77
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,210
Ms. Luo, why are you here today?

78
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,450
I heard

79
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,010
you came back from the training camp.

80
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,690
So I came to see you.

81
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,650
You

82
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,450
came here for Qi Tian, right?

83
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,450
Qi Tian.

84
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,130
How are you?

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,460
Are you feeling better?

86
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,780
Did you find out

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,850
why you vomited?

88
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,770
I...

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,050
What are you doing here?

90
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,330
Shixing.

91
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,970
Why are you here?

92
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,899
I am asked to pay a visit here

93
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,250
and see how you are doing.

94
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,540
You knew each other?

95
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,330
He is my teammate from the provincial team.

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,100
Shixing, let's talk outside.

97
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,090
Who is he?

98
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,970
Do you know him?

99
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,770
Shixing.

100
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,210
I've been taking care of him since he was young.

101
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,810
He

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,210
runs the fastest

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,350
in Shenglin now.

104
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,530
Isn't Liu Haoyu

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,810
who runs the fastest?

106
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,620
Thank you.

107
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,500
He was.

108
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,409
But

109
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,530
Shixing

110
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,590
was so hardworking

111
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,920
that he surpassed Liu Haoyu in a short time.

112
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,050
He is outstanding

113
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,470
because he works hard.

114
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,650
Not like you.

115
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,690
You were born to be a sprinter.

116
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,130
Don't fall for me.

117
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,690
I can be hurt easily.

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,230
You are not here for me, are you?

119
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,170
How's your leg?

120
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,930
Same as usual.

121
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,010
What do you mean?

122
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,410
Liu Haoyu told me you join in the race.

123
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,810
You were given a day off

124
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,030
for rest.

125
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,020
Look at you.

126
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,770
It's okay

127
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,820
to get some exercise.

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,740
Is that guy Qi Tian,

129
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,050
the Golden Hound?

130
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,370
I knew it.

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,370
You're here for Qi Tian,

132
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,050
I just happened to be here.

133
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,420
He looks ordinary.

134
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,460
Nothing special.

135
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,700
In less than three years,

136
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,370
he will be your most competitive rival.

137
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:02,890
Let's go.

138
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,820
Let's go inside.

139
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,330
I'll introduce him to you.

140
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,370
Qi Tian.

141
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,450
Do you have a girlfriend?

142
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,840
Do you mind if you are younger than her?

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,570
It's very common now.

144
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,940
Although I am single now,

145
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,410
I know

146
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,530
you are just attracted by my ankles.

147
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,370
You don't love me at all.

148
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,460
Or what else?

149
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,550
If it weren't for your ankles,

150
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,070
who would like a rustic puppy like you?

151
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,650
You...

152
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,409
He's not a rustic puppy.

153
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,290
He's the Golden Hound.

154
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,810
Nonsense.

155
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,650
Both of you, get lost!

156
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,490
I'm going to get changed.

157
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,690
Shixing.

158
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,740
Please be the judge.

159
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,690
I don't even mind his age.

160
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,530
He's so mean.

161
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,710
You are Qi Tian, right?

162
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,090
I'll wait for you

163
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,470
in the qualifier next spring.

164
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,550
What are you talking about?

165
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,690
What's going on?

166
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,290
Are you going back to school with me?

167
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,290
What are you doing?

168
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,090
This...

169
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,690
This guy

170
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,930
seems to have a grudge against me.

171
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,690
Ms. Luo is a good doctor

172
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,290
with sharp eyes.

173
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,930
But

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,710
she might have never been in a relationship.

175
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,050
You mean

176
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,740
the two of them?

177
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,170
That's obvious.

178
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,780
Zeng Shixing

179
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,370
almost beat you just now.

180
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
So

181
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,030
what is the qualifier he just mentioned?

182
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,250
The National College Students Athletics Tournament

183
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,710
is held in July every year.

184
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,170
Before that,

185
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,670
players must participate in the qualifier,

186
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,440
which is

187
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,410
the Municipal Spring College Students Athletics Tournament.

188
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,250
When?

189
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,050
In March.

190
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,610
Shixing.

191
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,300
Shixing.

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,270
What's wrong?

193
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Why are you so obsessed with Qi Tian?

194
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,620
The way he runs,

195
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,090
his speed and explosive strength.

196
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,210
I like them all.

197
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,809
You like him because of these basic features?

198
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,409
I just like his body.

199
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,679
His body?

200
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,090
No.

201
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,080
That's not what I mean.

202
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,330
I think you can understand what I mean.

203
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,420
So Qi Tian is your type?

204
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,340
What's wrong with you today?

205
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,130
Do I have to report to you

206
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,610
what my type is?

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,710
I thought

208
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,770
you didn't like boys younger than you.

209
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,330
That's why I have no chance to be your boyfriend.

210
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,260
I didn't expect

211
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,250
Qi Tian...

212
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,820
Qi Tian is three years younger than me.

213
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,550
I can't believe he is your type.

214
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,820
You

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,450
don't have a chance?

216
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,650
You mean

217
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,970
you want a chance?

218
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,960
♫Can we go back to the past?♫

219
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,980
Yes.

220
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,610
I just want a chance.

221
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,090
♫Sometimes I want to hide the courage that I pretend to have♫

222
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,290
Whether it's going fishing

223
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,350
or growing a beard,

224
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,760
♫Not saying anything against my will♫

225
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,140
I just want to make myself maturer.

♫I want to continue♫

227
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,700
I've liked you

228
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,850
all these years.

229
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,840
♫Can I reverse the time?♫

230
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,290
But you've never noticed that.

231
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,250
I work hard every day,

232
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,690
♫Who gets hurt because of my temper?♫

233
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,390
hoping that you can notice me one day.

234
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,450
I wonder how long it will take for you to notice

235
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,780
♫Bystanders are indifferent♫

236
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,100

in order to be more excellent

238
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,270

239

♫I don't want to hear what they say♫

240

241

No, no.

242
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,290
I was twelve when we met

243
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,200
♫They talked about their destinations♫

244
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,620
while you were only seven.

245
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:50,970
In my eyes,

246
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,570
you were

247
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,530
♫They said they had unparalleled adventures♫

248
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,060
just a kid.

249
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,730
Isn't Qi Tian a kid in your eyes?

250
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,190
♫They said I should give up♫

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,820
When I was seven,

252
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,890
Qi Tian was only four.

253
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,170
He was even a todder.

254
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,480
♫I don't want to care♫

255
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,800
It's different.

256
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,050
You are younger than me.

257
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,400
♫They said where I should turn my face to♫

258
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,530

♫They said where I should look at♫

260
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,650

You are like my younger brother.

271

I've explained many times.

272
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,380
It...

273
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,560
No.

274
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,860
I am still confused. Please explain it again.

275
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,330
Please be serious.

276
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,860
I'm giving you two extra lessons for free.

277
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,530
Make it simple for us.

278
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,330
We are already very serious.

279
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,130
I'm speechless.

280
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,730
We are student-athletes.

281
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,770
We are not good at studying.

282
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,760
Please be patient with us.

283
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,020
Ask Xue Yiran if you don't believe us.

284
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,950
He won't be able to solve it either.

285
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,020
The answer is A.

286
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,420
Look.

287
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,730
See how disappointed I am with you?

288
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,110
Why does everyone like him,

289
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,900
not you?

290
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
This is a matter of IQ.

291
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,490
I don't believe it.

292
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,550
One more question.

293
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,050
-Yes. -Yes.

294
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,080
One more question.

295
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,140
One more question.

296
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,440
I advise you

297
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,910
not to waste your time.

298
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,880
I could have been admitted

299
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,630
to either Tsinghua or Peking University.

300
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,780
Why didn't you go there?

301
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,750
My grandma was in poor health.

302
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,770
And you know

303
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
what happened

304
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,530
to my dad and my family.

305
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,490
So I didn't want to go to another province.

306
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,410
Too far

307
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,420
for me to take care of my family.

308
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,690
But

309
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,470
when I was in the provincial team,

310
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,610
Zeng Shixing said he could be admitted to Tsinghua University with his grades.

311
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,540
But in the end, he went to Shenglin.

312
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,530
How good

313
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,900
is Zeng Shixing?

314
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,740
Bing, you're back.

315
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,770
Hello, Mrs. Zeng.

316
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,590
I heard from your mom that you found a job.

317
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,620
I'm now a team doctor at Shenglin University.

318
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,890
Working at a university is good.

319
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,890
It's stable.

320
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,610
Why are you still here?

321
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,010
Hurry up and go to school.

322
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,980
Zeng Shixing.

323
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,290
What's wrong?

324
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,940
You don't even greet me now?

325
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,230
Hello, Bing.

326
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,170
He

327
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,010
is getting surlier.

328
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,170
I gotta go, Mrs. Zeng.

329
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,300

People's voices trail off and only the sound of flute remains.

359

Where can those deeply-in-love couples meet?

368

I'm not unhappy.

374
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,170

375

Anyway, we have a deal.

376
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,540
I'll still treat you as a younger brother.

377
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,530
Don't think I want to have an affair with you

378
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,970

379
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,300
Got it.

380
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,930
It's said that girls in Xinghe are beautiful.

381
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,930
Can't I come to see those beauties?

382
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,850
Sure.

383
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,730
You're lucky today.

384
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,730
Qi Tian said they would be on stage soon.

385
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,450
Let's go.

386
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,250
You think about Qi Tian all day.

387
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,050
Qi Tian.

388
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,970
So cool, Captain!

389
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,970
So cool, Captain!

390
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,690
So cool.

391
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,310
Not bad.

392
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,430
Qi Tian, you are so handsome!

393
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,250
So handsome!

394
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,730
Nice suit.

395
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,010
I didn't expect

396
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,569
ancient costumes suited him well.

397
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,569
What do you think?

398
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,500
He is attractive.

399
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,170
He has the lingering charm.

400
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,650
No matter how he dresses up,

401
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,540
he is a bumpkin in nature.

402
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,170
You're jealous.

403
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,370
Ai Ziji.

404
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,420
Thank

405
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,050
all the clubs

406
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,250
for jointly presenting the Hanfu Show.

407
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,450
The theme of this year is...

408
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,650
Hanfu Exhibition.

409
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,570
Next,

410
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,130
let's welcome

411
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,050
Mr. Yuan, our respected principal,

412
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,450
who will give us a speech.

413
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,570
Cool.

414
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,380
Tianfu.

415
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,220
This beautiful place has witnessed countless glories.

416
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,370
Yangzhou in spring...

417
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,300
Yangzhou...

418
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,290
The trees...

419
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,390
The flowers...

420
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,010
You still can't memorize your lines?

421
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,450
You pissed me off.

422
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,300
Calm down.

423
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,820
If you fail to recite your lines on stage,

424
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,090
just make up some.

425
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,890
The audience has never read the script.

426
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,950
No one can know if it's right or wrong.

427
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,370
Tianfu.

428
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,100
The driver is going the wrong way.

429
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm a bit late.

430
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,130
But it's fine.

431
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,610
I saw you on the show.

432
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,450
It's great.

433
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,140
In the Peach Blossom Land, there is a peach blossom plot.

434
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,060
A peach blossom lover lives in Peach Blossom Cot.

435
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,860
The peach blossom lover plants peach trees in days fine.

436
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,970
He sells his peach blossoms for money to buy wine.

437
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,090
Great wine.

438
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,090
Great.

439
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,200
When he is not drunk, he would sit before the flowers.

440
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,330
He would lie beneath them to spend his drunken hours.

441
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,010
Bohu.

442
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,930
Do you really

443
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,130
want to lead a befuddled life like this?

444
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,410
From day to day half-drunk, half-sober he'd appear.

445
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,130
The peach flowers blossom and fall from year to year.

446
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Zhengming.

447
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,010
What

448
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,170
brings you here?

449
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,970
Do you know

450
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,730
your paintings

451
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,770
have been sold out?

452
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,530
Today,

453
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,540
I invited Xu Zhenqing and Zhu Zhishan

454
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,370
to celebrate with us.

455
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,570
Where are they?

456
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,990
I sent a servant to lead them here.

457
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,470
They will be here soon.

458
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,900
You two are totally chilled.

459
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,090
Since it's Bohu's

460
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,210
party,

461
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,930
how can there be no wine?

462
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,910
Party?

463
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,890
Here.

464
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,080
Please have a seat.

465
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,570
Bohu.

466
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,730
Keep the money.

467
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,340
This is

468
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,870
what you earned with your paintings.

469
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,570
Isn't the money

470
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,530
that you pooled for me?

471
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,170
I

472
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,570
live a miserable life

473
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,740
full of misfortunes.

474
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,890
My parents and wife

475
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,860
passed away one after another.

476
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,450
How could anyone

477
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,770
like my paintings?

478
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,570
How sad I am!

479
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,970
This is fate.

480
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,570
Don't worry about me.

481
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,900
Zhengming.

482
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,050
Let's down it.

483
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,770
But Bohu,

484
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,410
you have to earn a living.

485
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,810
I ranked the top in the municipal exam

486
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,290
when I was 16.

487
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,740
I got married at 19.

488
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,930
I felt I was in the limelight.

489
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,650
But when I was 25 years old,

490
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,490
my father,

491
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,250
mother,

492
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,050
my wife,

493
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,530
and my stepson

494
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,910
passed away one after another.

495
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,810
Even my yonger sister

496
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,740
who lived far from me passed away.

497
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,890
Earn a living?

498
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,970
I want to earn a living.

499
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,610
When I was 29,

500
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,530
I ranked the top in the provincial exam.

501
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,070
But unfortunately, I was charge with alleged cheating in the exam

502
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,250
and was imprisoned.

503
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,470
Now

504
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,550
half of my life has passed.

505
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,970
Isn't that miserable?

506
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,330
Good heavens!

507
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,330
The fate

508
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,690
seems to joke with me all the time.

509
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,210
I lost all the fame I gained.

510
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,570
I lost my family.

511
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,330
It makes me heartbroken.

512
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,170
I'm suffering the pain of loss.

513
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,970
This might be

514
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,380
the script of my life.

515
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,170
That's not what I wrote.

516
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,350
For the rest of my life,

517
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,670
I'll drink

518
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,230
with you.
