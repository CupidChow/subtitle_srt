00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,040
don't you think you've pushed yourself too hard?

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,070
Although you can accept it mentally,

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,530

-Sir.

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,770
I understand.

80
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,360
But I'm already in the fourth academic year.

81
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,190

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,740
The situation is not optimistic.

98
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,390
Maybe earlier.

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,940
You've been following me all day.

Don't athletes in the provincial team need to train?

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
The coach said I can relax.

103
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,080
He has endured his injury

105
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,740
but I didn't even notice it.

106
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,280

109
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,980
Especially Ai Ziji.

110
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,390
He loves to slack off.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,190
They were very diligent.

112
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,600
They want to train harder to surpass you

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,260
when you can't have training.

114
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,430
It's only been a few days.

115
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,960
They have become arrogant.

116
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll visit you at the hospital after class.

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,070
Okay.

118
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,710
I want braised pork ribs.

119
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,530
Are you hungry?

120
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,300
Let's go.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,150
Let's go eat.

122
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,510
Let's go.

123
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,680
What's wrong?

124
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
He Miao asked me

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,760
about Xue Yiran's injury.

126
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Looks like he is very guilty.

127
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
It's hard to say.

128
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,030
When he said he would return to the Track and Field Club,

129
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,090
I was very shocked.

130
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,420
He is utterly unpredictable.

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,940
Why must he continue to run

132
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,680
even

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
after he was injured?

134
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,890
Has the result of the MRI come out?

135
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,300
An Achilles tendon rupture.

136
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,880
Mr. Xu said

137
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
my situation is a little special.

138
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
He needs to discuss with other doctors.

139
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,510
For now, they're giving me conservative treatment.

140
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,970
Conservative treatment?

141
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,160
Wearing a plaster cast for three or four weeks.

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,710
By that time,

143
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
my right leg's muscles

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,610
will definitely atrophy significantly.

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,150
Consider it

146
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,980
a chance for you to surpass me.

147
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,559
Muscular atrophy?

148
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,500
Will it have any impact on you in the future?

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,990
Don't you think you are too nervous?

150
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,160
It won't.

151
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,510
Even Ai Ziji can have tight muscles through training.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,010
I don't understand.

153
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
Why were you smiling when you said this?

154
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
What else can I do?

155
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,830
Crying won't help.

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm an athlete.

157
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,220
It's normal to live with injuries.

158
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
I think Liu Haoyu

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,470
is more diligent than before.

160
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,020
Losing to Qi Tian twice

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,030
makes him very upset.

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,350
See?

163
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,270
It's only been two days.

164
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,200
Qi Tian has already attracted attention

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,840
from all of you.

166
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm sharp-eyed, right?

167
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,080
How can he be qualified to be my rival in love

168
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,490
if he's not capable?

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,710
Again.

170
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,990
By the way,

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,270
you and Xue Yiran were in the same team before.

172
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,530
What on earth happened to his right foot?

173
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,800
About a year ago,

174
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,160
his right foot had a slight Achilles tendon rupture

175
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,830
in a competition.

176
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
After that, his Achilles tendonitis would recur frequently.

177
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
The team thought

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,650
maybe training made him too stressful.

179
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,170
So they allowed him to take a long leave

180
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,280
to have a good rest.

181
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,960
Look at him now.

182
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,570
Isn't he worried that his right foot's problem will get worse?

183
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,230
Yiran,

184
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,000
we've been training hard every day.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,930
We're waiting for you to come back.

186
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,450
Say something useful.

187
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,140
Go away.

188
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,780
Xue,

189
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,830
I heard you'll wear a plaster cast for three or four weeks.

190
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,000
Your right leg's muscles

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
will definitely

192
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,830
get relaxed very quickly every day.

193
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,560
You can't laugh at me by that time.

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,280
What is this called?

195
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,260
This is karma.

196
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,790
Well,

197
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,920
why are you so mean?

198
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,430
Yiran,

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,720
don't listen to him.

200
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,580
I also wore a plaster cast before.

201
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,630
Anyway, it would take many days to heal.

202
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,140
You just rest till it heals.

203
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,030
After that,

204
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,920
we'll help you with the rehabilitation.

205
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,130
I'm going to edit it before sending it.

207
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,640
Ai Ziji.

208
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,430
Do you think I can't hit you

209
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,830
with a screen between us?

210
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,450
You...

211
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,520
You're wearing a plaster cast,

212
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,050
yet you still want to hit me.

213
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,880
Why did you leave the hospital?

214
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,440
It's... so boring to stay in the hospital.

215
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,240
Sir.

216
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,360
Look who's here.

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Xue Yiran.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,470
Yiran,

219
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,900
when you're in the hospital,

220
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,630
you should listen to the doctor.

221
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
Don't run around.

222
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,040
Qi Tian,

223
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,460
take him back later.

224
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,760
Okay.

225
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,150
Yiran,

226
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,540
recently,

227
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,110
I compared the results

228
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,360
of the National College Students Athletics Tournament in previous years.

229
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,480
This time, our result is 40.89 seconds.

230
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,710
It's the same as the result of the champion last year.

231
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,150
Besides, during recent training,

232
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,560
all of you

233
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,490
have improved.

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,590
When you recover and come back to us,

235
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,240
it's very likely

236
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,100
that we can win the championship.

237
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,370
Sir,

238
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,950
there are five months left

239
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,990
before the competition in August.

240
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,630
I will recuperate quickly

241
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,460
and come back as soon as possible.

242
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
Take your time.

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,830
Rest well.

244
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,940
[Mr. Xu]

245
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,520
Oh, no!

246
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,750
They already know that I snuck out.

247
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
Let's go then.

248
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,470
Don't make Mr. Xu worried.

249
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,130
Be careful.

250
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,750
T-Take your time.

251
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,720
Be careful.

252
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,120
[Orthopedics 02]

253
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,680
You're back.

254
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,040
Qi Tian.

255
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,910
I'm a little thirsty.

256
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,470
Can you bring me the thermal cup in the ward?

257
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,280
We discussed about it.

258
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,440
We have to perform an operation

259
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,120
to suture it.

260
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,590
If you only receive conservative treatment, it will definitely recur

261
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,650
and can't be cured.

262
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,550
Can I participate in the competition

263
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,900
in five months?

264
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,280
Competition?

265
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,590
Are you kidding me?

266
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Even the function may not be fully restored, okay?

267
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,280
Two weeks after the operation, your thigh,

268
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,160
calf, and foot will be immobilized with a plaster cast.

269
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,400
After removing the sutures,

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
we can just immobilize your functional positions

271
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,160
for three weeks.

272
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,490
Then you can do functional training.

273
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,250
This is a lengthy process.

274
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,560
It varies depending on the individual's conditions.

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,040
The blood supply of your Achilles tendons is relatively poor.

276
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,130
It can increase the risk of infection and delayed healing.

277
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,810
So... it's hard to say.

278
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
I can only tell you

279
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,160
it's possible to restore the basic function

280
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,150
in five months.

281
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,660
Doctor, thank you.

282
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,320
No big deal.

283
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,300
What did the doctor tell you just now?

284
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,790
He said I'm recovering well.

285
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,760
Don't worry.

286
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm a little tired today.

287
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
Go back first.

288
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,030
Didn't you say...

289
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,000
you're thirsty?

290
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,950
Yes.

291
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,160
Give it to me.

292
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,850
I ran around this afternoon.

293
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,030
I'm exhausted.

294
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,560
Go back first.

295
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm leaving then.

296
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,960
Mr. Xu.

297
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,160
Have you seen Xue Yiran?

298
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,170
Talk to him.

299
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,000
Look at his X-ray film.

300
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,880
The rupture is so serious.

301
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,430
But he still won't have an operation.

302
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,850
He still wants to take part in competitions.

303
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,850
He even forced me to give him conservative treatment.

304
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,040
Mr. Xu,

305
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I have a question.

306
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,350
If he has an operation,

307
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,490
can he recover to his best level?

308
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,120
It's hard to say.

309
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,320
It depends on your psychological expectation.

310
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,370
Maybe Olympic champions can

311
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,860
because they

312
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,310
have top-notch doctors

313
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,460
and nursing teams

314
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,230
and they are very self-disciplined.

315
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,290
But you should know

316
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,070
once a rubber band breaks,

317
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,030
it can't endure repeated stretching anymore.

318
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,590
Even if it can be completely restored,

319
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,520
it'll be more fragile than one that has never broken.

320
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,150
Do you know fault tolerance?

321
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,990
For someone who's at the same level as him but has higher fault tolerance,

322
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,560
no matter what that person does within reasonable limits,

323
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,839
it won't matter.

324
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,890
But for him,

325
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,400
if anything goes wrong,

326
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,130
all the efforts will be in vain.

You're here drinking wine alone?

How did you know I'm here?

341
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,080
You just won't let me drink secretly.

342
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,690
You haven't recovered yet.

343
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,590
I think the doctor has forbidden you to drink wine.

344
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,560
I want to drink.

345
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,830
Is the competition in August

346
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,140
really that important to you?

347
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,920
Why did you refuse to have an operation?

348
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,260
I don't want to have an operation.

349
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,910
Why?

350
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,880
It's already ruptured.

351
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,430
Do you want to have an operation

352
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,560
only when it's completely fractured?

353
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,520
Besides, even if you have an operation now,

354
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,920
it'll be very difficult to recover to your best level.

355
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,850
Do you know that?

356
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
Aren't you worried

357
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
about your sports career at all?

358
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,080
You

359
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,680
like running so much.

360
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,240
Why?

361
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,590
It's just

362
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,650
the National College Students Athletics Tournament.

363
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,230
If you recover,

364
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,120
you'll have many opportunities to take part in competitions.

365
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,780
Why do you have to take part in this competition?

366
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,160
Because...

367
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,250
I want to graduate with a smile.

368
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,500
Because...

369
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,670
I want to graduate without any guilt.

370
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,780
I want to graduate calmly

371
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,670
and with a smile on my face.

372
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,690
Because...

373
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,780
this is my promise to him.

374
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,370
It would be meaningless

375
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,790
if it's another competition.

376
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,230
Guys,

377
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
our new jerseys are here.

378
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,040
Here.

379
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,720
There's a name abbreviation on the back.

380
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,550
It's cool, right?

381
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,080
I specially asked someone to customize them.

382
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,920
Ziji.

383
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,960
This is yours.

384
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,080
Do you have a name abbreviation on it?

385
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,680
Let me see.

386
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,690
My uniform has a name abbreviation too?

387
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,370
Of course.

388
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,330
Is the material the same?

389
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
Of course.

390
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,060
Why would it be different?

391
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,460
What's the size of my uniform?

392
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,500
M or L?

393
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,740
Xue Yiran.

394
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,020
Open it and take a look.

395
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,760
This is your new uniform.

396
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,680
It's different from theirs.

397
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,110
Boring.

398
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,920
I think

399
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,810
it suits me well.

400
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,680
It's beautiful.

401
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,480
Of course.

402
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,120
He's more capable than us.

403
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,920
What's the big deal?

404
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,780
Don't say that.

405
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,770
We can't expect

406
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,550
everyone to have the same personality.

407
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,000
Besides, he really is awesome.

408
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,310
It's normal that

409
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,270
he looks down on us.

410
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,150
Not us, just you, okay?

411
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,000
Is Xue Yiran

412
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,290
better than you or not?

413
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
Yes.

414
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,520
You have to admit that he is amazing.

415
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,600
Go!

416
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,860
Xue Yiran, come on!

417
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,750
Come on, Xue Yiran!

418
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,970
Come on!

419
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,730
Xue Yiran.

420
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,720
Xue Yiran.

421
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,640
I bought braised pork ribs.

422
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,520
Do you want some?

423
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't like it.

424
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,510
What do you like?

425
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,600
I'll buy it for you.

426
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,490
Why are you always so nice to him?

427
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,670
I've been weak since I was a kid.

428
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,560
So my parents asked me to practice running.

429
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,240
Even though I trained really hard,

430
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,990
I only achieved a result of about 11.5 seconds.

431
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,070
So I envy

432
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,840
athletes like Xue Yiran very much.

433
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,750
He absolutely has the chance

434
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,210
to stand on a bigger stage.

435
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,360
I

436
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,200
am willing to do my best to help him,

437
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
support him,

438
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,540
and shine for him.

439
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,230
You just won't listen to me, right?

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,990
Why won't you participate

441
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,390
in the 4 x 100 m relay race?

442
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,300
Because it will waste my physical strength

443
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,270
and influence my performance in the 100 m race.

444
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,680
You're not the only one who'll participate in the 100 m race.

445
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,770
You think you are special?

446
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,650
You don't care about the Track and Field Club at all.

447
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,190
When you left for the provincial team's training and asked for a leave,

448
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,890
did I make things difficult for you?

449
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,590
Why is it so hard

450
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,240
to make you contribute to the team?

451
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,560
Actually, it doesn't matter

452
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,400
whether I'm in the school team or not.

453
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,000
The principal asked me here.

454
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,160
You're using the principal to put pressure on me, right?

455
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,910
If you look down on us,

456
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,840
don't come here.

457
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,020
How arrogant!

458
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,860
Fei Zhe,

459
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,320
what's wrong?

460
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,050
Are you okay?

461
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm fine.

462
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,360
Sir,

463
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,550
you were so fierce just now.

464
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,330
I nearly had a heart attack because of you.

465
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,080
Stay at home if you're sick.

466
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,560
You guys...

467
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,800
What's on your mind?

468
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,760
You've recovered?

469
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,360
Don't worry about me.

470
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,400
I pretended

471
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,780
to have a heart attack.

472
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,990
Considering the situation this afternoon,

473
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,970
if I didn't pretend to be sick to interrupt you,

474
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,630
you two would have fallen out.

475
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,060
I don't care.

476
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,960
Easy for you to say.

477
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,360
The coach said those words this afternoon

478
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,410
out of anger.

479
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,790
Everyone can see

480
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,230
how much importance he attaches to you.

481
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,160
Besides, do you really want

482
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,580
to withdraw from the Track and Field Club?

483
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,040
If so, how will you explain to the principal?

484
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,360
Our coach is straightforward.

485
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,800
He doesn't have any evil intentions.

486
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,990
He just wants you to contribute more to the team.

487
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,400
After all, you are very capable.

488
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,320
Arguing with him can't solve the problem.

489
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,050
It will only make things worse.

call me today?
