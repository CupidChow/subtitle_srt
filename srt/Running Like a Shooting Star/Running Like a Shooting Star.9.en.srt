What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,990
Old problem.

9
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,270
What old problem?

10
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,140
Ms. Luo,

11
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,310
take a look at him.

12
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,470
There are many types of doctors.

I specialize in Sports Medicine.

14
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,120
Given his current condition,

15
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,440
it's difficult for me to make a judgment.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,930
How long have you

17
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,060
been experiencing this?

Answer him.

19
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,960
How long has it been?

20
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,670
Actually,

21
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,229
it started in my second year of high school.

22
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,140
At first,

23
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,800
my coach thought

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,490
it was just vomiting due to excessive training.

25
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,990
But the situation worsened over time.

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,340
When my talent for running was discovered,

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,610
I began high-intensity training.

28
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,950
Honestly,

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,950
I enjoy training.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,770
I also understand that people around me

31
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,770
have very high expectations for me.

32
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,670
But the higher the expectations,

33
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,390
the greater the disappointment.

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,590
During a city-level Youth Track and Field Championship,

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,790
everyone thought I could win,

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,570
but unexpectedly,

37
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,150
Liu Haoyu emerged.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,550
You'll have to try harder

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,690
if you want to surpass me, a genius.

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,220
Qi Tian is nothing special.

41
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,420
What genius?

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,500
I think he's just not up to it.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,750
Later on,

44
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,000
my coach always used Liu Haoyu to motivate me.

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,090
What's funny is,

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,360
nowadays when I see Liu Haoyu,

47
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,550
he doesn't even remember me.

48
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,990
Maybe I'm just lame.

49
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,060
You can't even bear this little suffering.

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,070
You think having a bit of talent

51
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,710
makes you extraordinary, huh?

52
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,950
Look at Liu Haoyu.

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,170
I was training

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,160
while vomiting.

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,940
I swore that I'll beat Liu Haoyu

56
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,060
at the next High School Games.

57
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,030
During this time, the thing with Shen Ming happened.

58
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,910
In a fit of pique,

59
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,240
he left and kept training with his father.

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,230
So he didn't know about my training condition.

61
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,810
Why is it that I work so hard,

62
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,710
yet you can breeze through effortlessly?

63
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,100
You've always been the supporting character in my life,

64
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,329
the one who always lagged behind.

65
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,990
But now, you've become the school's superstar.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,579
My parents also boasted to everyone,

67
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,260
saying that a running genius had emerged in our family

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,680
and that they would organize a group to watch me in the Olympics in the future.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
They had no idea

70
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,290
that I was light-years away from the Olympics.

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,210
All of this added immense pressure on me.

72
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,420
Eventually,

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,130
my weight dropped to 55 kilogram.

74
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,550
How can you call yourself a man if you can't even bear this little suffering?

75
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,350
Why are you kneeling there?

76
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,150
What a loser.

77
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,270
Weak-kneed.

78
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,740
Meaningless.

79
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,850
So meaningless.

80
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,570
It's so boring.

81
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,850
My body seemed to have reached its limit.

82
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,740
For a while,

83
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,830
just the thought of running

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,430
made me nauseous,

85
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,110
and seeing training

86
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,870
made me physically uncomfortable.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,220
God gave me ankles suited for running,

88
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,700
but didn't give me

89
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,420
a matching body.

90
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm probably just a joke.

91
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,090
No,

92
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,000
you're not a joke.

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,540
I will help you get better.

94
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,470
Sir.

95
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,070
It's just that you have too much empathy,

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,130
competitiveness,

97
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,320
and sense of responsibility.

98
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,740
Trust me. You will get better.

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,110
Running and food don't make you vomit.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,430
The real reason for your vomiting

101
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,020
is the mental stress

102
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,230
that has disrupted

103
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,590
your digestive system.

104
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,820
Mental stress can cause sympathetic nervous system imbalance,

105
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,630
autonomic nervous system disorder,

106
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,630
gastric acid secretion imbalance,

107
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,750
and insufficient blood supply to the gastric mucosa.

108
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,480
This has long been confirmed in medicine.

109
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,120
Actually,

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,050
I've noticed for a while that you might have

111
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,180
mental stress issues.

112
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,590
You always think about

113
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,230
how to train harder.

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
But you never think about stopping yourself.

115
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,310
In the disdain of others,

116
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,360
in self-denial,

117
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,000
you keep pushing yourself.

118
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,630
Eventually,

119
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,070
both physically and mentally,

120
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,230
you fall into endless exhaustion.

121
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,520
But once the exhaustion accumulates,

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,930
Let's just believe it.

192
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,820
Anyway, things won't get any worse for you.

193
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,270
I want to believe in Wang.

194
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
If it weren't for you,

195
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,650
I don't think I could come back to running.

196
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,180
Maybe

197
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,500
I'd never be able to experience

198
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,070
the heat of the sun reflecting off the track,

199
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,520
smell the fragrance of the grass,

200
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,990
or hear the cheers around me again.

201
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,940
Every element of the track-and-field ground

202
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,280
fills my heart with something.

203
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,500
I want to come back.

204
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,200
I want to run again

205
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,540
with full vigor.

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
Thank you, Xue Yiran.

207
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,600
Actually,

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
I just want to comfort

209
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,250
the you from the past, full of wounds.

210
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,360
How great it would be

211
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,270
if I could return to the arena.

212
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,430
I'm exhausted.

213
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,030
In this Track and Field Club,

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,490
there's one with a hand injury,

215
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,290
one frequently feels nauseous,

216
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,990
and an old man about to retire.

217
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,260
It's simply a team of the elderly and infirm.

218
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,060
Ai Ziji,

219
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,750
what's with your sarcasm

220
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,900
every day?

221
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,030
The booked room isn't very professional.

222
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,610
It's just an ordinary guesthouse.

223
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,020
So, we need to bring more equipment with us

224
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,550
in case there isn't enough.

225
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,890
Where's Wu Tianfu at a time like this?

226
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,470
It's just me and Xue Yiran, two handsome guys,

227
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,530
doing all the work.

228
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,940
Is this reasonable?

229
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm not very pleased

230
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,520
with being on the same level as you in terms of looks.

231
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,780
As the saying goes,

232
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,110
"One should not be arrogant.

233
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Xue Yiran,

234
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,070
who exactly

235
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,330
do you think highly of?

236
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,640
Go ahead and keep being arrogant.

237
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,500
One day, you'll end up like Amumu.

238
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,110
You even have the face to say that to me?

239
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,030
Who,

240
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,560
back in freshman year, had no friends,

241
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,790
and was always moping in the corner with a sullen face,

242
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,200
and blaming others for bullying you?

243
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,930
Xue Yiran, are you asking for a beating?

244
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,760
Alright. Stop it, you two.

245
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,590
Wu Tianfu said he went to Huainan University

246
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,730
to have a meal with a friend.

247
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,790
He'll be back soon.

248
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,750
Look at Wu Tianfu.

249
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,190
He made friends all the way to Huainan.

250
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
Which friend of Wu Tianfu is in Huainan?

251
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,750
Here.

252
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,310
Here.

253
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,580
Actually, I saw you that day.

254
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,800
It's just that Qi Tian wasn't feeling well,

255
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,060
so I didn't come to you.

256
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,660
I didn't expect you to still remember it.

257
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,310
It's fine.

258
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,470
I'm used to it.

259
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,960
As a jinx,

260
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,560
I can't do anything well

261
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,580
except

262
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,350
handle pressure.

263
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,620
So what happened later?

264
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,220
Did they give you a hard time?

265
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,800
What else could they do to give me a hard time?

266
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,000
They just won't let me run in the future.

267
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,350
Handing over the baton

268
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,510
is something that requires two people.

269
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,500
Why did they only target you?

270
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,110
Tianfu,

271
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,550
there isn't always a reason for everything in the world.

272
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,350
We can only accept our fate.

273
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,510
Who can I blame for the fact

274
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,440
that I always seem to have bad luck?

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,110
No.

276
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,980
No, I don't agree with it.

277
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,340
In my values,

278
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,640
as long as you are willing to work hard,

279
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,240
there will definitely be results and rewards.

280
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,050
That's because you're lucky.

281
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,540
All the people in the world who work hard and get rewarded

282
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,440
are lucky.

283
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,910
Sometimes I wonder

284
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,430
if I should become an online writer.

285
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,090
Then I can stay at home every day

286
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,000
without having to deal with people

287
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,110
or

288
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,310
hurt anyone.

289
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,520
Don't always be so pessimistic.

290
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,080
Look,

291
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,150
the shoelaces you gave me

292
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,810
are tied nicely, aren't they?

293
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,280
♫A fleeting beam of light♫

294
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:41,780
♫The youth wants to catch up to the sun♫

295
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,300
♫My dream makes me♫

296
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,300
♫Willing to be crazy♫

297
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,340
♫Breaking through fear, racing against destiny♫

298
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,070
♫Not being nervous anymore, not being content with the status quo♫

299
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,150
Don't rush.

300
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,520
The first thing you need to do is rehabilitation.

301
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,370
♫Never again♫

302
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,150
♫Feel lost♫

303
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,220
What are you looking at?

304
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,820
Is it better looking than me?

305
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,570
♫Once promises are made, I never thought of leaving♫

306
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't flatter yourself.

307
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,750
Haven't you already been looking at Tadao Ando's works?

308
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,770
♫Even facing the hardships of reality♫

309
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,630
Why haven't you made any progress in aesthetics?

310
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,390
What do Tadao Ando's works

311
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,810
have to do with your face?

312
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,290
♫The wish made in summer will eventually come true♫

313
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,420
Voilà!

314
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,450
Look!

315
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,760
Let's go.

316
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,270
Let's go.

317
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,520
This place is nice.

318
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,830
Not bad.

319
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,370
Not bad.

320
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,480
I remember the house I rented is self-service

321
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,069
with no staff.

322
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,910
We were arranged by You Qian's mother.

323
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,349
I'm a nutritionist

324
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,300
and also a chef at a five-star hotel.

325
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,280
In these days,

326
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,060
if you want to eat anything, just tell me.

327
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,140
That's great.

328
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,560
I am specifically responsible for your daily life.

329
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,910
I am in charge of rehabilitation.

330
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:32,980
I used to be

331
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,060
a team doctor for a sports team.

332
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,380
If you need relaxation, massage,

333
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,800
I can help.

334
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,390
Just call me Dr. Liu.

335
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,360
Keep it low-key.

336
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,250
Mom, hello.

337
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,110
Hi, Mrs. You.

338
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,160
Hello.

339
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,180
Thank you for taking care of our Qian before.

340
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,550
These are my gifts to you.

341
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,920
Feel free to enjoy them.

342
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,490
Make yourself at home.

343
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,590
Thank you, Mrs. You.

344
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,710
Stupid.

345
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,770
Don't call her Mrs. You.

346
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,110
Call her sister.

347
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,190
Thank you, sister.

348
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,040
Alright.

349
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,880
Call me whatever you want.

350
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,000
Qian,

351
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,980
You must focus on your rehabilitation

352
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,380
and listen to the doctor,

353
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,350
got it?

354
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,470
I got it, mom.

355
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,590
-I'm going to hang up now. Bye.
-Bye, Mrs. You.

356
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,790
-Bye, Mrs. You.
-Bye.

357
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,970
Let’s go.

358
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,920
There are three rooms in total.

359
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,500
You can assign them yourselves.

360
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,070
Okay.

361
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,190
Sir, I want to share a room with you.

362
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,140
Well, Qi Tian,

363
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,400
would you like to share a room with me?

364
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,090
No.

365
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,070
I don't want to share a room with Xue Yiran.

366
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm neat.

367
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,670
I feel sick just seeing him.

368
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,580
I don't want to live with you either.

369
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,740
You are so stupid.

370
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,040
You...

371
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,320
Enough.

372
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,870
You can live with me.

373
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,310
I'll live with the best.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Let's go. Let's share a room.

375
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,450
The air in the mountains is really good.

376
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,730
I feel like my skin looks better.

377
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,700
Tianfu.

378
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,880
There are a lot of trees in the mountains.

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,810
You can use this.

380
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,710
What's this?

381
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,820
What is it for?

382
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,320
What are you planning to do later?

383
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,010
I heard there's a hot spring nearby.

384
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
I want to go for a soak.

385
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,350
A hot spring?

386
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,650
Don't you have any other options?

387
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,320
Why do I feel like

388
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,290
you've never taken a bath with me before?

389
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,600
Is that so?

390
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,900
We're both men.

391
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,300
What's there to hide?

392
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,880
I have everything you have.

393
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,460
Maybe we just never had the chance.

394
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,680
Why don't you take a bath with us?

395
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,010
What secrets do you have on your body?

396
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,420
What?

397
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,950
Do you really want to take a bath with me?

398
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,650
Plus, you always wear these

399
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
long-sleeved undershirts.

400
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,350
The weather was hot before.

401
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,270
You got a WeChat message.

402
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,090
Tomorrow morning at 5:30,

403
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,640
Qi Tian will go to the meditation room.

404
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,970
I'll wait for you there.

405
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,570
The others will start morning exercises promptly at 6:00.

406
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,490
Everyone, have some dinner today

407
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,480
and rest early.

408
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,380
Copy that.

409
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,040
Copy that.

410
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,780
Copy that.

411
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,740
Copy that.

412
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,010
I'm going to take a shower now.

413
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,810
Do you want to join me?

414
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,800
Well, I don't really mind.

415
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,350
That's gross.

416
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,700
Qi Tian.

417
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,940
Let's get started.

418
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,510
Sit.

419
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,950
Today, what I want to tell you

420
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,390
might be a bit complex,

421
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,530
difficult to understand,

422
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,190
or even a bit mystical.

423
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,950
But these are some of the results of my research

424
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,470
on athlete psychology over the years.

425
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,400
You can try

426
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,750
to follow my thoughts.

427
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,820
If you don't understand,

428
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,620
we can always stop.

429
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,560
Do you remember Lolo Jones,

430
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,150
the American athlete who competed

431
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,990
in the women's 100-meter hurdles

432
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,430
at the 2008 Beijing Olympics?

433
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,050
She was leading the race

434
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,110
after the start

435
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,970
but stumbled over the second-to-last hurdle,

436
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,570
losing the gold medal.

437
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,370
Do you know what she was thinking at that moment?

438
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,750
She said

439
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,880
that at the moment she stepped out, she was thinking,

440
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
"I need to extend my legs as far as I can."

441
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,870
You see,

442
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,480
in the world's highest level of competition,

443
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,860
just such a small thought

444
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,590
caused the disappearance of her ZONE state.

445
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,910
ZONE state?

446
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,890
Yeah.

447
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,510
ZONE state.

448
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,590
The ZONE state is a concept

449
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,860
proposed by psychologist

450
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,440
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,

451
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,980
which means

452
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,170
being completely immersed

453
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,550
in one's goals,

454
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,180
relaxing,

455
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,860
and allowing the body

456
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,030
to achieve a state

457
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,530
of extreme focus.

458
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,230
That's the ZONE state.

459
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,420
It's also called the peak state.

460
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,290
The peak state?

461
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,240
Every athlete,

462
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,620
when they step onto the field,

463
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,970
is actually pursuing

464
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,200
this peak state.

465
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,700
In other words,

466
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,250
it's about disregarding oneself

467
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,370
and disregarding others.

468
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,910
I'm so tired.

469
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,240
I miss the braised pork ribs at school.

470
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,630
Do you know

471
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,460
what's the hardest thing for an athlete the moment

472
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,530
they step onto the field?

473
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,610
It's not the technical moves,

474
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,210
nor the determination to win,

475
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,900
nor the money, status, or fame.

476
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,830
The hardest thing

477
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,200
is to think of nothing.

478
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,630
Especially in short-distance sports,

479
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,690
most of it relies on our muscle memory.

480
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,300
This requires us to enter this ZONE state

481
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,310
so that our bodies

482
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,700
can exert 100% of their energy.

483
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,150
Wanting to win

484
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,010
makes you anxious.

485
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,730
Fear of losing makes you a coward.

486
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,770
The more distractions you have,

487
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,170
the worse your physical condition will be.

488
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,210
Now,

489
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,600
let's go back to you problem.

490
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,450
Why do you fear running,

491
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,070
and avoid it?

492
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,750
Because...

493
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,070
I feel like I can't lose friends,

494
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,750
health,

495
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,010
or even the whole world

496
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,910
just for running.

497
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,110
Because...

498
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,270
as long as I stop running,

499
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,000
I won't vomit anymore.

500
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,910
In fact,

501
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,340
there are many athletes who have the same problem as you.

502
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,560
Most of the time,

503
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,720
it has nothing to do with the intensity of the exercise.

504
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,380
Because some esports players

505
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,510
also vomit

506
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,660
during competitions.

507
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,550
Some can even vomit

508
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,180
for a minute and a half.

509
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,310
Although Coach looks like this,

510
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,820
he is actually

511
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,040
very professional.

512
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,720
I can tell.

513
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,750
When Wang was training me,

514
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,490
he told me a lot about his past.

515
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,100
He actually had

516
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,380
a promising student

517
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,880
named Zhuang Xizhe.

518
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,750
They achieved a result

519
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,080
almost approaching the national record.

520
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,810
But that year,

521
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,800
only one person could participate in the competition.

522
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,950
For him, Wang fought

523
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,030
with his leader.

524
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,190
Finally,

525
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,140
the leader agreed to let Zhuang Xizhe participate in the competition.

526
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,300
Get up!

527
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,360
Perhaps due to immense pressure,

528
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,460
Wang's training of Zhuang Xizhe

529
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,810
became stricter.

530
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,180
However, Zhuang Xizhe was too hot-tempered.

531
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,910
Who did you fight with?

532
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,440
In the end,

533
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,910
Zhuang Xizhe didn't get to participate

534
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,760
in that important competition

535
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,390
and ended his sports career early.

536
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,220
Years later,

537
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,910
the news about him

538
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
was about another fight.

539
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,070
He injured someone

540
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,330
and ended up in prison.

541
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,360
After he came out,

542
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,110
his work and life were very miserable.

543
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,810
You can't go on like this anymore.

544
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,120
Let's go.

545
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,600
Let's go.

546
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,910
Go home.

547
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,910
Let's go home.

548
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,630
Let's go!

549
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,070
Let's go.

550
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,200
Wang was very sad.

551
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,110
Perhaps he had put

552
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,430
too much pressure on the child,

553
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,350
leading to his psychological issues.

554
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,910
Later, he started reading various books

555
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,190
about psychology,

556
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,430
trying to make up for his guilt.

557
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,100
In training,

558
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,350
he no longer rushed for results.

559
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,440
It's no wonder

560
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,830
he's like this now.

561
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,290
Actually, he could be considered

562
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,190
a frustrated person.

563
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,790
In his youth,

564
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,160
he once had lofty aspirations.

565
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,750
But I've never seen him

566
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,560
unhappy.

567
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,390
He's always cheerful.

568
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,870
Some people

569
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,510
are like shells.

570
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,190
Time gives them sand,

571
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,820
but what they give back

572
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:22,940
is pearls.

573
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,030
The causes of these diseases

574
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,790
lie in stress and depression,

575
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,600
not in the exercise itself.

576
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,630
Qi Tian,

577
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,180
you've targeted the wrong object of dislike.

578
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,710
Studies show

579
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,320
that stress and depression

580
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,200
can lead to various illnesses,

581
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,890
such as ulcers, high blood pressure,

582
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,150
irregular heartbeat, headaches,

583
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,960
and more.

584
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,990
The majority of human stress and depression

585
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,470
stem from emotions

586
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,670
such as resentment, regret,

587
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,260
anxiety, disappointment,

588
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,480
expectations, fear, sadness,

589
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,750
and various other feelings.

590
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,480
Removing them

591
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,450
is indeed challenging.

592
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,790
Therefore,

593
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,640
you must learn

594
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,680
how to calmly deal with them.

595
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,810
Of course,

596
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,320
for a nineteen-year-old like you,

597
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,020
this is indeed difficult.

598
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,460
Even for someone like me in their fifties,

599
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,440
it's impossible to remain undisturbed in every situation.

600
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,250
But this is a mandatory lesson for every athlete

601
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,310
until retirement.

602
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,570
So,

603
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,190
Qi Tian,

604
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,830
in the upcoming period,

605
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,440
your goal

606
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,230
is to learn

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,050
how to peacefully coexist with the distractions

608
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,630
in your mind,

609
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,670
and truly enter

610
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,470
your own peak state.

611
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,840
Qi Tian,

612
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,710
keep up the good work.

613
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,230
Why am I saying these words to you?

614
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,230
Because in you, I see potential,

615
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,710
the potential to reach greater heights.

616
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Don't ever

617
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,990
give up.
