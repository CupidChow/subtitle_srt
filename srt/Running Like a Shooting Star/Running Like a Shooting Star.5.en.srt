[Running Like A Shooting Star]

3
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,870
You're back.

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,940
[Episode 5: I only care when you'll leave]

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,720
Why are you here?

6
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,480
Where is Lin Pei?

7
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,770
I exchanged my bed with him

8
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,490
with a wooden chessboard.

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,760
This ungrateful guy.

10
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,190
Isn't it good that Yiran lives with us?

11
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,620
Qi Tian,

12
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,030
I won't leave if you don't have a competition with me.

13
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,430
You want to live here too?

14
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,700
Shen Ming,

15
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,509
tomorrow,

16
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,070
let's go to the morning training together.

17
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,940
Is it okay?

18
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,710
I'm just thinking where I should go to train.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,780
How do you

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,090
usually train?

21
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,680
How many times a day?

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Usually three times a day.

23
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,590
Three diligent men are together.

24
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,390
That's horrible.

25
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,590
Qi Tian,

26
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,070
do you despise me?

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,190
I thought about it.

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,470
This is the only reason

29
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,729
why you won't have a competition with me.

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,400
How many times do I have to tell you?

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,470
It's not because of you.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,560
It's because of the running event itself

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,630
and everyone.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,740
If you guys want to run, go ahead.

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,140
It's none of my business.

36
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,470
I'm a loser now.

37
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,470
Just let me be a loser,

38
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,270
okay?

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,870
Go away.

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,320
Don't hinder me from doing my homework.

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,510
Alright.

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,680
You don't want to run.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,590
You've said it so many times.

44
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,980
Tianfu,

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,270
my former coach

46
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,910
taught me professional physiotherapy.

47
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,829
Let me show you.

48
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,590
Really?

49
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,670
Do I need to take off my clothes?

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,200
No. Just bend over the desk.

51
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,390
Physiotherapy can remove excess lactic acid

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,480
to help you perform better during the next day's training.

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,010
Almost all professional teams

54
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,870
have such physiotherapists.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,310
Yi... Yiran.

56
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,460
It feels so good.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Qi Tian,

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,590
do you want to experience it?

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
It hurts a lot,

60
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,820
but you'll feel really good after that.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
What do you think?

62
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,270
I can

63
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,170
extend the duration of the massage

64
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,680
specially for you.

65
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,300
Don't touch me.

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Forget it.

67
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,780
My skills are top-notch.

68
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,579
It'll be your loss if you miss it.

69
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,570
You're reading this?

70
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,200
You also have Haruki Murakami's book.

71
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,230
I didn't know you like this kind of thing.

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,230
It's not like you.

73
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,470
Don't touch my stuff.

74
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,630
Qi Tian said

75
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,800
girls like artistic people.

76
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,470
His natural enemy is one of them.

77
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,230
So,

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,890
he wants to improve his strength in this aspect.

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,300
You have a natural enemy?

80
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,110
Who?

81
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,660
Wu Tianfu,

82
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,370
you like massage, right?

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,390
Let me massage your mouth.

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,870
Tianfu,

85
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,910
don't be a coward.

86
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,870
Hit him.

87
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,910
You have more strength than him.

88
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,899
Wu Tianfu, I'm gonna fight with you!

89
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,329
Tianfu, fight with him.

90
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
Wu Tianfu.

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,740
Hit him.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,130
Shen Ming.

93
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,590
Are you asleep?

94
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,290
Not yet.

95
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,760
Tell me

96
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,050
about the past Qi Tian.

97
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,300
Sorry.

98
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm still awake.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,909
Don't expect to speak ill of me behind my back.

100
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,760
It doesn't matter if you're awake or not.

101
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,870
When he was little,

102
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,800
he was naughty

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
and stole things.

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,780
What nonsense are you nerd talking about?

105
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,030
But he only

106
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,760
stole things in his family's convenience store.

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,980
We all liked Mimi prawn chips when we were little.

108
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,850
He always went to steal it in his family's convenience store.

109
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,310
His father would beat him up if he got caught.

110
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,720
Your dad would also beat you

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
when he saw it, right?

112
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,180
We were really happy at that time.

113
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,140
I'm going to use more strength.

114
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,630
Can you still hold on?

115
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,030
Yes.

116
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,980
How did it become like this?

117
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,510
It's all because of running.

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,820
Enough.

119
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,960
I have to go to class tomorrow morning.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,790
I hope you won't be here

121
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,390
when I open my eyes tomorrow.

122
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,830
If you don't have a competition with me, I won't...

123
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,990
Fine.

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Just stay here forever.

125
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,190
I don't believe

126
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,050
your team won't ask you to go back.

127
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,070
Here, eat more.

128
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,910
I've lived here for a few days.

129
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,990
When will you ask Qi Tian to have a competition with me?

130
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,030
No hurry.

131
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,630
It's not the time yet.

132
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm not here to have fun with you.

133
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,300
I still need to prepare for a competition.

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,340
Tell me when.

135
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,740
Could it be you've been fooling me?

136
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's have a barbecue tonight.

137
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,140
By that time,

138
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,210
you'll know

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,700
when Qi Tian can have a competition with you.

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,770
Yiran.

141
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Qi Tian, you came.

142
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,200
I ordered some skewers.

143
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,270
I don't know if you'll like them.

144
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,230
He

145
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,330
likes seafood products like oysters and octopus.

146
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,990
He once

147
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,650
ate ten oysters.

148
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,900
He even wanted more after that.

149
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,300
It cost all of my living expenses for a week.

150
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,780
Stop talking.

151
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,430
I could only eat instant noodles after that.

152
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,350
Okay. Today,

153
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,030
you can eat as many oysters as you like.

154
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,190
Sir, we want more skewers.

155
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,990
Okay.

156
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,810
Yiran,

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
can you drink?

158
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,340
Just a little.

159
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,320
Come on.

160
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,800
Pour some for yourselves.

161
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,650
Shen Ming,

162
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,950
let's have a drink together.

163
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,750
Come on.

164
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,310
You can't hold too much liquor.

165
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,510
Don't expect me to carry you back later.

166
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,350
Fine.

167
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's see

168
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,180
who can hold more liquor.

169
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,990
Come on, Shen Ming.

170
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,550
Let's have a drink.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,700
Since you're Qi Tian's friend,

172
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,960
you're also my friend.

173
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,690
Ming,

174
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,520
stop pretending.

175
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,680
Come on.

176
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,800
We stole your dad's wine to drink when we were little.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,930
Have you forgotten?

178
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,290
Xue Yiran,

179
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,690
you are still fooling me.

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
Today,

181
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,010
we are just here to drink

182
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,930
and chat.

183
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
Isn't it good?

184
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,350
Xue Yiran, what on earth are you up to?

185
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,890
Shen Ming,

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,730
why are you still so impatient?

187
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,160
Don't think I don't know

188
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,770
what you guys are up to.

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,580
Qi Tian, you're drunk.

190
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,900
I'm not drunk.

191
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,330
Everyone

192
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
likes my ankles.

193
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,290
You, and you.

194
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,160
You are the same.

195
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,880
My life

196
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,600
has been controlled by my talent.

197
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
Everyone

198
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,730
thinks I shouldn't waste my talent.

199
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,890
But

200
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,080
has anyone really cared

201
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,920
what I think?

202
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,090
I'm not a slave of talent.

203
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,050
You...

204
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
You are not my slave.

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
I'm not talking about you.

206
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,180
Where were we?

207
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,870
Right.

208
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,740
It should be that I run whenever I want to,

209
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,920
and I don't run when I don't want to.

210
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,040
I don't want to run now.

211
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,480
I want to be in a relationship.

212
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,730
But girls

213
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,600
like you instead.

214
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,040
You are also a student athlete.

215
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,250
Do you think

216
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,470
I can become the next Su Bingtian

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
or Usain Bolt?

218
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,770
How do you know

219
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
you can't?

220
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,870
Do you know why

221
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,830
you were asked to live with Qi Tian?

222
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,260
You know what Qi Tian liked to eat when he was little.

223
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,140
But do you know what he likes to eat now?

224
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,180
Sweet or savory?

225
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,070
Do you know what kind of girl Qi Tian likes?

226
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,810
Tall or short?

227
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,930
Fat or thin?

228
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,430
I don't care what he likes.

229
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,810
Do you know what got you this far?

230
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,360
Do you know

231
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,240
what makes you run so fast today?

232
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,630
It's jealousy.

233
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,640
In your eyes,

234
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,630
Qi Tian

235
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,850
is just a robot with golden ankles,

236
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,010
not your friend.

237
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,450
When we were little,

238
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,660
we all had many friends.

239
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,770
We came from the same place

240
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,710
and spoke the same dialect.

241
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,930
But as time passes by,

242
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,110
we'll have different experiences

243
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,450
and development.

244
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,400
Comparing to them

245
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,180
will make us have fewer and fewer friends.

246
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,840
It's you.

247
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,280
It's you who lost the friend

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,050
who grew up with you.

249
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,650
♫A fleeting beam of light♫

250
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,690
♫The youth wants to catch up to the sun♫

251
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,470
♫My dream makes me♫

252
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,470
♫Willing to be crazy♫

253
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,320
♫Once promises are made, I never thought of leaving♫

254

♫Even facing the hardships of reality♫

255
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,190
He still thinks about Su Bingtian and Usain Bolt

256
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,200
when he is drunk.

257
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,120
So he must love running.

258
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,350
♫The wish made in summer will eventually come true♫

259
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,210
But yet, he is also so resistant to running.

260
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,920
He must have endured much pain

261
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,800
that others don't know.

262
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,530
♫My dream has never disappeared♫

263
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,490
I want to become like Su Bingtian.

♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

266
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,050
One day,

267
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,580
Qi Tian will have a competition with you.

268
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,520
One day.

269
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,470
♫That innocent child is still there♫

270
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,580
♫It's reflected in my head♫

271
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,430
Nerd.

272
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,900
Why didn't you buy more?

273
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,030
[Sorry, Qi Tian. When you want to run one day, we'll meet again.]

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,030
[No. We can meet again even if you don't want to run.]

275
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,910
♫I want to travel to the future to see if I'm okay♫

276
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,590
In childhood, there was a genius among us.

277
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,810
♫Will I still cry at 3 a.m.?♫

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,140
But you wouldn't know that he is a genius.

♫Don't just drink beer when you're depressed and sad♫

280
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,720
You always thought you were all the same.

281
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,800
But when the genius becomes stronger

282
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,510
♫It can't solve your problems in life♫

283
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,370

♫This will make you fall apart, so please stop♫

285

away from you,

286
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,920
something would change in your heart.

287
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,600
♫But I don't know when my dream can come true♫

288
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,520

♫I've had enough, but I still remember what you said♫

290
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,470
♫You said don't be afraid♫

00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,960

302

303

Are you also attracted

304
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,810
by my beauty?

305
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,970
Shen Ming has left.

306
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,410
You should also leave as soon as possible.

307
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,680
I have an idea.

308
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,210
I plan

309
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,750
to live here permanently.

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,250
What?

311
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,370
You have an empty bed in your room anyway.

312
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,410
We can vote.

313
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,480
Training in the morning to sweat it out after a hangover

314
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
feels so good.

315
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,480
I brought you breakfast.

316
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,010
Yiran, come and eat.

317
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,160
Wait, Tianfu.

318
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,620
Let's discuss something.

319
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I plan to live in your room permanently.

320
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,800
What do you think?

321
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,130
Of course you can.

322
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,570
Yiran,

323
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,760
you said you want to live here permanently on WeChat.

324
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,210
So I brought you some things.

325
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,970
You're indeed my good wingman.

326
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,810
Put them there.

327
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,610
Okay.

328
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,680
Now,

329
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
it's two to one.

330
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,400
Fine. I'll go.

331
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,330
Okay?

332
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,650
Where are you going?

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,060
I'm going to class. Want to go with me?

334
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,930
Come back early.

335
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,730
It's so quiet.

336
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,130
In your eyes,

337
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,080
Qi Tian

338
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,810
is just a robot with golden ankles,

339
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,600
not your friend.

340
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,610
Wang is really something.

341
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,810
Ms. Luo Bing,

342
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,810
you want to see me?

343
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,340
Is something wrong

344
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,240
with your feet?

345
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,010
Well...

346
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Listen.

347
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
The Autumn College Students' Athletics Championships

348
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,330
in our city

349
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,610
will begin soon.

350
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,850
I'll sign up for you.

351
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,520
Okay.

352
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,480
I'll do two more sets of strength training later.

353
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,130
Okay.

354
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,210
Remember,

355
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,840
strength is the basis.

356
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,560
The key is the speed.

357
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,570
Step, Rotate, Deliver, and Lift.

358
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,600
Thrust, Prop, Push, and Pull.

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,130
You've done well

360
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,770
except in Push and Pull.

361
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
You still need

362
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,720
to improve your skills in these two aspects.

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,210
Okay.

364
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't worry, Sir.

365
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,050
Okay. I'm going.

366
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,840
Go.

367
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,490
I'm old.

368
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,090
even a slight movement

369
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,360
makes me sweat.

370
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,210
I didn't know

371
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,340
the Fighting the Landlord game is not the only thing you're good at.

372
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,810
I have to make a living.

373
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,800
The school

374
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,480
can't just recruit someone

375
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,680
who only knows how to play the Fighting the Landlord game.

376
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,490
Skills will never be burdens.

377
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,030
It's so tiring.

378
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
Isn't it good to lie down?

379
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,240
Since Fatty wants to learn, I should teach him.

380
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,130
Consider it as doing exercise.

381
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,810
Right, and you.

382
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,720
I can teach you if you want to learn.

383
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,730
By the way,

384
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,450
I heard you're a good runner.

385
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,720
Skills will never be burdens.

386
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,810
Both of us are men.

387
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,160
What's there to hide?

388
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,900
I have everything you have.

389
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,640
You said

390
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,290
you have everything I have.

391
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,440
Then why do girls like me

392
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,570
instead of you?

393
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,920
You...

394
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
It must be because

395
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
I'm better than you in some aspects.

396
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,720
Why are you so argumentative?

397
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,400
You want to argue with me as soon as I came back, right?

398
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,450
No.

399
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,640
My roommate came back.

400
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm so happy.

401
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,850
Who is your roommate?

402
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,410
Where is Tianfu?

403
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,650
I didn't see him during training this afternoon.

404
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,690
He answered a phone call this afternoon

405
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,010
and left in a hurry.

406
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,140
I think he said he would fail the exams.

407
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,640
This guy

408
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,400
has been playing basketball or busy with running

409
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,480
since the enrollment.

410
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,680
It's normal that he will fail the exams.

411
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,970
Where is Lin Pei?

412
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,010
When can you care about me?

413
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,040
Care about you?

414
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,920
Care about you.

415
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,810
I only care

416
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,570
when you'll leave here.

417
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,250
[Registration System of Changzhou's Autumn College Students Athletics Championships]

418
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,420
Let's go out for a walk.

419
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,650
The wind is so comfortable at night.

420
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,440
Really?

421
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,470
Let me feel it too.

422
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,130
Thank you.

423
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,440
For what?

424
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,730
Thank you for what you said to Shen Ming.

425
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,480
You heard it?

426
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,620
You were not drunk.

427
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,290
My alcohol tolerance is not that low.

428
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,810
I was just a little dizzy.

429
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,730
So you pretended to be drunk.

430
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,410
You behave ill after you drink wine.

431
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,370
Actually,

432
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,600
I value

433
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,060
Shen Ming as a friend a lot.

434
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,880
Now that I've got him back,

435
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,000
I feel that I have been cured

436
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,700
somewhere in my heart.

437
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,940
You've read too many Haruki Murakami's books.

438
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,390
The way you speak has changed.

439
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,430
Do you think

440
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
we are friends?

441
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,890
Yes.

442
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,820
Since you treat me as your friend,

443
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,880
can you tell me

444
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
why you don't want to run?

445
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,010
In this world,

446
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,480
there are numerous gifted athletes

447
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,630
like me.

448
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,920
You know

449
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,710
what it takes

450
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,000
to shorten the time from 10.7 seconds to 10 seconds.

451
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,830
You won't have time to date

452
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
or enjoy life,

453
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,930
let alone eating whatever you want.

454
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,370
You can't

455
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,300
play video games all night either.

456
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,840
Even

457
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,800
your friend who grew up with you

458
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,490
will leave you.

459
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,650
Even if you can do all these,

460
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,700
you may not achieve your goal.

461
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,090
Is this why

462
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,500
you waste your gift in running?

463
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,440
The life of an athlete

464
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,450
is too boring.

465
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,810
There are 7.5 billion people in the world.

466
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,500
Only a dozen can gain the result

467
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,850
of less than ten seconds every year.

468
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,010
The probability is too low.

469
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,250
Since I can't make it,

470
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,320
why don't I enjoy life?

471
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,270
I don't believe it.

472
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,190
You are not telling the truth.

473
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,560
What about Wu Tianfu?

474
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,850
He is a late starter.

475
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,190
What level do you think

476
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,010
he can reach?

477
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,440
He... He is different.

478
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,490
He likes running.

479
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,320
What about you?

480
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,460
Do you like running?
