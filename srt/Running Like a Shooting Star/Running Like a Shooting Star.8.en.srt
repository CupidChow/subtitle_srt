You're weak, but your voice is still so loud.

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,430
Does your confidence come from the reputation of Huainan's fastest runner?

In my opinion, even ten runners like Xue Yiran

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,210
couldn't shorten the distance caused by him.

60
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,829

61

Considering Yiran's ability,

129

you think you're something

157
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,669
just because you have a little talent, huh?

158
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,710
Look at Liu Haoyu.

159
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,590
He has very good physical quality,

160
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,520
but he still trains so hard.

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,380
What about you?

162
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,120
You can't even endure these hardships.

163
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,990
You want to win the national championship?

164
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,370
I think it's hard for you to win the city's championship.

165
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,650
You have to try harder

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,670

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,600

168
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
Okay. Go for it.

169
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,170
Bye.

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,550
Why are you here?

171
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,050
We'll participate in the 4 x 100 m relay race later.

Yes. He

188
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,760
will be your strongest rival.

189
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,630
Better be.

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,230
By the way, Qi Tian,

191
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,360
judging from your outfit,

192
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,360
you're finally ready to take part in the competition.

193
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,710
Yes.

194
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,370
Then... did you see what I left for you?

195
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes.

196
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,640
It's far from enough.

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,680
Men's 100 meters preliminaries are about to begin.

198
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,870
Which heat is Wu Tianfu in?

199
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,290
Looks like Wu Tianfu

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,350
has to run in the rain.

201
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,840
His hands are sweating a lot.

202
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,010
Qi Tian,

203
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,550
why are you nervous?

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't expect us to be in the same heat.

205
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,380
I'm worried I'll make a mistake.

206
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,750
Just follow my lead later.

207
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,680
Don't be afraid.

208
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,390
On your marks!

209
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,690
Set!

210
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,310
Go for it!

211
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,330
Go!

212
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,990
Go!

213
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,950
Go!

214
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,390
Let me participate in the 4 x 100 m relay race later.

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,190
What?

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,110
Aren't you here to watch the games?

217
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,110
Why do you want to participate in it?

218
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,140
Xue Yiran, since you'll take the track later,

219
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,090
I'd like to have a competition with you today.

220
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,190
-Come on!
-Run faster!

221
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,040
-Go!
-Go!

222
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,200
What a childish kid.

223
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,130
Really?

224
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,110
Since we'll have a competition sooner or later,

225
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,440
why don't we do it today?

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,950
[Men's 4 x 100 m relay race of the Autumn College Students Athletics Championships]

227
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,680
I didn't expect that you are fast enough

228
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
to achieve a result of less than 11 seconds.

229
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,620
Actually, I am.

230
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
It's just that I messed it up before.

231
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,800
Then why should you follow my lead?

232
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,010
I'm weak.

233
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,670
Let's go.

234
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,910
Listen,

235
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,270
do your best in the next round.

236
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,110
I'm looking forward to competing with you.

237
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,580
Shen Ming,

238
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,560
warm up with me.

239
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,720
Men's 4 x 100 m relay race.

240
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,350
Men's 4 x 100 m relay race is about to begin.

241
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,840
Can you do it?

242
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,600
Do your best.

243
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,430
He Miao.

244
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,190
Which team are you in?

245
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,630
-Xue Yiran.
-Xue Yiran.

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,560
Is it really him?

247
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,230
He really is handsome.

248
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,350
Xinghe University's Track and Field Team

249
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,080
was disbanded long ago, right?

250
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,200
Do your best.

251
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,380
Who would have thought Haoyu

252
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,980
suddenly wants to take part in the competition this time?

253
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,840
I'll let you take part in the competition next time.

254
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,910
If you

255
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,440
keep being absent-minded,

256
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,640
I'll be angry.

257
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm fine now.

258
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,800
Xue Yiran is not the fourth runner.

259
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,190
Fine.

260
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,450
If you're a Golden Hound,

261
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,420
I'm incomparable.

262
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,630
Qi Tian,

263
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,830
are you done vomiting?

264
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,360
There are still ten sets of Fartlek training.

265
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,820
Coming.

266
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,120
Liu Haoyu,

267
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,070
I will definitely defeat you next time.

268
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,560
I didn't lie to you, right?

269
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,570
One day,

270
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,770
Qi Tian will run with you.

271
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,960
You are indeed a wonderful person.

272
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,540
You taught me life principles,

273
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,070
but in terms of running,

274
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm not afraid of anyone.

275
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,630
No need for that.

276
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,110
I won't drag them down.

277
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,620
♫My desire grows as time passes by♫

278
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,810
♫Just consider me a crazy guy even if I'll fall♫

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,520

♫I won't stop♫

281
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,690
I should have applied some sunscreen cream.

♫I'm stubborn, proud, and arrogant♫

283
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,070

♫The sunset extends my shadow forward♫

289
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,330

♫It's my kingdom, and I'm the king♫

291

-Go!

300
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,520

00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,110
Why did he sign up

309
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,940
for a competition of this level?

310
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,870
Hurry.

311
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,470
Yiran.

312
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,080
Xue Yiran

313
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,450
is impressive.

314
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,360
His state now is different

315
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,280
from that in the individual race.

316
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,530
Is Wu Tianfu

317
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,730
the type of athlete

318
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,740

♫Before the unknown fear drowns me♫

320
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,100

♫Fearless of the darkness, I run to you before the doomsday♫

322
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,720

♫We'll meet no matter how far away♫

324
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,090
Xinghe's second runner is so weak.

325
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,630
Look at their third runner.

326
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,030
He is fixing his hair.

♫Conquer helplessness and confusion♫

328
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720

Their third runner is good.

333
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,840
I wouldn't call this a preliminary round.

334
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,640
They've displayed the level of performance expected in the finals.

who achieved impressive results this year?

353
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,520

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,020
Who won?

372
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,840
I think Liu Haoyu is faster.

373
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,810
But I'm not sure.

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,120
Who would have thought today's competition is so fierce?

375
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah.

376
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,020
Did we win

377
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,740
or lose?

378
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,540
[Men's 4 x 100 m relay race of the Autumn College Students Athletics Championships]

379
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,260
Great!

380
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,670
Great!

381
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,440
Great!

382
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,670
We didn't win, right?

383
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,350
Qi Tian,

384
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,830
let me help you up first.

385
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,380
You can't even endure these hardships.

386
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,620
You are a loser.

387
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,280
Qi Tian.

388
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,050
Isn't he good at running?

389
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,310
What's going on over there?

390
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,240
What happened?

391
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,710
Who fell down?

392
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
Ziji, Tianfu,

393
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,360
stand closer.

394
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,720
Don't let anyone take pictures of Qi Tian.

395
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,750
He can't even stand up?

396
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,430
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,430
I still let you down.
