"Did you really not use it?"

You Qian's wound on his hand

154
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,270

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,870

167
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,300
That's why he accidentally stepped...

168
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,830
stepped on You Qian's hand.

169
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,150

I have many teammates who recognize me here.

174
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,750
Do you know what I've learned from it?

175
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,920
In this world, the most ridiculous words that we start by saying

Don't listen to them.

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,450
Wait.

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,700
These are my spare shoelaces.

191
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,930
Thank you.

192
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,600
Go for it!

193
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Go for it.

194
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,830
[One week later]

195
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,000
Well...

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,830
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,100
I'm sorry for what happened last time.

198
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,940
These are the gifts I prepared.

199
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,250
As for Fatty,

200
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,080
I...

201
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,080
gave him money as compensation.

202
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Tianfu,

203
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,610
congratulations.

204
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,780
Although you didn't make it to the top three in this competition,

205
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,520
the fourth place is good enough.

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,980
Also, you've met the standards for a Level 2 athlete.

207
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,780
This is your first valid result.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,280
It's worth remembering.

209
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,080
In the future,

210
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,940
I will train you more strictly.

211
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,980
Well,

212
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,880
the uniform is so ugly.

213
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,080
It's so white.

214
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
What do you think?

215
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,410
Is the size right?

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,160
Not bad.

217
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
It's just a little loose.

218
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,640
I think it's because you have relaxed muscles.

219
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
You have relaxed muscles.

220
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,170
I have tight muscles.

221
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,530
What's the use of having tight muscles only on your face?

222
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,990
You have relaxed muscles all over your body.

223
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,250
Cut the crap.

224
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,320
Give me half a month.

225
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,690
I'll show you my tight muscles.

226
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,610
I didn't expect Ai Ziji

227
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,490
to stand on the track-and-field ground one day.

228
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,620
He was so afraid of getting sunburned.

229
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,120
That's right.

230
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,450
Who would have thought of this?

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,260
It's time for me to tighten my muscles.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,170
Wu Tianfu,

233
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,840
the slowest runner among us,

234
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,100
you're so lame.

235
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,370
Train me strictly!

236
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,440
Looks like you're still very arrogant.

237
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,690
Is Ziji not afraid of getting sunburned anymore?

238
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,420
He is afraid.

239
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,940
Then why is he training so hard?

240
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,610
Maybe

241
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,810
having relaxed muscles is worse than getting sunburned.

242
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,480
Let's...

243
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,490
form a team

244
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,450
for the 4 x 100 m relay race.

245
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,710
The 4 x 100 m relay race?

246
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,410
So this is why you came back.

247
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,850
Just to fulfill your promise to Fei Zhe?

248
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,160
I made a promise.

249
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,930
I must keep it.

250
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
Besides, we're already in the fourth academic year.

251
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,770
If we don't do it now,

252
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,800
it'll be too late.

253
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,880
Come on.

254
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,710
Stop acting cool.

255
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,370
You're in the Track and Field Club because of him too, right?

256
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,030
You can go to the lab to study skincare products.

257
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
There's no need to stay here.

258
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,510
Cut the crap.

259
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,970
If I still don't practice,

260
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,100
I'll become a loser.

261
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,310
The 4 x 100 m relay race?

262
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
Is the fourth runner Qi Tian?

263
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,090
I'm not sure.

264
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,210
Should we find another person?

265
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,470
Although I can't explain,

266
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,480
I think

267
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,050
he will

268
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,040
be the fourth runner.

269
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,320
It should be him.

270
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,440
He

271
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,080
is our hope.

272
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,390
We

273
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,770
are also his hope.

274
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,320
In the 4 x 100 m relay race,

275
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,260
each runner faces different challenges.

276
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,560
Because of the curves,

277
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,160
the distances covered by each runner

278
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,690
are not exactly 100 meters.

279
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,090
They are different.

280
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,370
The challenge of the first runner is starting running.

281
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,930
The distance covered by the second runner is the longest.

282
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,390
He needs more physical strength than usual.

283
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,520
In terms of this, Wu Tianfu is qualified.

284
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,090
The challenge of the third runner is the curves.

285
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,420
Ai Ziji will handle it.

286
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,850
The challenge of the fourth runner lies in the sprint finish.

287
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,130
Are you hungry due to the training?

288
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,490
I have roasted chicken wings, grilled sausages, and grilled meat.

289
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,150
Each skewer costs only 2 yuan.

290
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,300
This is our hope.

291
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,620
Each costs 2 yuan.

292
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,750
Do you want roasted chicken wings, grilled sausages, and grilled bull penises?

293
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,630
What are you doing?

294
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,290
It's delicious.

295
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,180
Ai Ziji doesn't have time to cook for us these days.

296
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,000
You can provide us with logistic support from now on.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
You wish.

298
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,569
Each skewer costs 2 yuan.

299
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:28,410
Remember to give me the money later.

300
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,810
You're indeed the son of a grocery's owner.

301
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,910
You only have three runners.

302
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,610
You still want to participate in the 4 x 100 m relay race?

303
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,410
I will

304
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,770
find the fourth runner.

305
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,560
You don't need to feel guilty.

306
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,960
You've made your choice.

307
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,010
I told you before. No matter what choice you make,

308
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,410
I will support you.

309

Qi Tian,

346
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,060
now you don't need to train anyway.

347
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,350
Give me a massage.

348
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,810
No.

349
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm going to go on a date in the study room.

350
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I recently met a really cute girl.

351
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,970
Is she cuter than Ms. Luo?

352
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,800
Well...

353
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,610
Ms. Luo...

354
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,520
is a bit cuter.

355
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,630
I'm not going then.

356
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,140
I wanted to go with you to see pretty girls.

357
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,590
I'm leaving then.

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,640

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:03,440
♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

372
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,830
♫That innocent child is still there♫

373
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,050
♫It's reflected in my head♫

374
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,030
♫I want to travel to the future to see if I'm okay♫

375
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,040
♫Will I still cry at 3 a.m.?♫

376
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,270
♫Don't just drink beer when you're depressed and sad♫

377
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,940
♫It can't solve your problems in life♫

378
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,780
♫This will make you fall apart, so please stop♫

379
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,720
♫But I don't know when my dream can come true♫

380
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,450
♫I've had enough, but I still remember what you said♫

381
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,880
♫You said don't be afraid♫

382
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:42,360
♫Once promises are made, I never thought of leaving♫

383
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:48,130
♫Despite numerous challenges♫

384
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,800
♫The wish made in summer will eventually come true♫

385
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,230
♫My dream has never disappeared♫

386
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Is your date over?

387
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,040
I saw you've trained for three hours.

388
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,710
♫Failure is better than boredom♫

389
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,170
Where are you going?

390
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,110
♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

391
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,490
Why are you training here

392
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,280
behind everyone's back?

393
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,700
♫That innocent child is still there♫

394
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,000
♫It's reflected in my head♫

395
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,240
Say something.

396
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,770
Because...

397
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,390
Because I don't want you to have any expectation.

398
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,870
The greater the expectation is,

399
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,940
the greater the disappointment will be.

400
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,130
What on earth

401
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,830
are you worried about?

402
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,670
I'm worried about myself.

403
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm worried

404
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,660
I can't persist in it again one day.

405
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,750
If you're so worried,

406
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,910
why do you want to run?

407
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,970
What else could it be?

408
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,970
It's because I like running.

409
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,260
♫Once promises are made, I never thought of leaving♫

410
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,070

♫It's reflected in my head♫

417

Don't tell anyone

418
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,060
about what happened today.

419
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,570
Just let me train quietly.

420
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,970
If

421
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,120
everything

422
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,600
goes well,

423
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,540
I'll take part in the competition.

424
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,950
Thank you.

425
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,540
Remove your hand.
