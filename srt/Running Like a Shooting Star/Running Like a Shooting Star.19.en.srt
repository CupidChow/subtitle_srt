3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,850
Mr. Yuan,

4
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,720
I wouldn't have succeeded in my career these years

5
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,890
without the education of my alma mater.

6
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,460
You are an excellent alumnus of our school.

7
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,780
I haven't exercised properly for years.

8
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,710
This is youth.

9
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,570
There seems to be a competition over there.

10
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,700
Let's go have a look.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Miss Zhang,

12
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,260
what's the activity today?

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,390
Let's go and have a look.

14
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,070
Okay.

15
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,120
The third-leg sprinter is so handsome.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,229
Look at his figure.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,080
Ai Ziji is handsome, too.

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,590
I want to slide on his bubble butt.

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,560
Give it to me.

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,250
Miss Zhang,

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,289
why isn't our school's

22
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,610
Xue Yiran there?

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,630
On your marks.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
Set.

[Episode 19: Is that the so-called "big heart"?]

26
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,310
This feeling is so familiar.

27
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,540
No matter how many times I run with Xing,

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,680
his absolute advantage still

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,140
makes me feel suffocated.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,570
Don't you think he's taking it too seriously?

31
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,670
He's almost

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,329
giving his best performance.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,410
Take off!

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,410
Bai Junyan.

35
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,620
This is the first time I see him run.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,450
He runs more smoothly than in the legends.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,440
The last half is so smooth.

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,610
In the halfway stage, he maintains a nearly constant speed.

39
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,270
The distribution of energy is the most reasonable this way.

40
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,910
Yes.

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
Coach said

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
Wu Tianfu has improved a lot recently.

43
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,970
But compared to him,

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,730
Wu is still slightly inferior.

45
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,500
Xinghe.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
That's all you can do?

47
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,670
Come on.

48
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,270
Xu Yancheng is obviously underperforming on purpose

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,530
because they're having too big of a lead.

50
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,300
Looks like

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,180
he's going to pay a price for that.

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,700
Ziji, go!

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,790
That bubble-but guy

54
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,990
is not as good

55
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,950
as he looks.

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,870
What?

57
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,950
There's no way I'd lose to this third-leg sprinter!

58
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,079
I was just careless.

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,380
It seems that Ai Ziji

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,760
has recovered well

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,270
while I was injured.

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,640
He's back to his old state.

63
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,560
So close.

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,670
Yes, so close.

65
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,790
What a pity.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,170
It was so close.

67
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,800
It's okay.

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,690
I won!

69
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,220
Qi Tian, come here.

70
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,550
In the first half, from 30 to 35 meters,

71
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,460
you pushed off the ground, stretched, and accelerated.

72
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,260
Respiration for the first time.

73
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,710
From 45 to 70 meters,

74
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,070
a strong pushing hard against the ground.

75
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,930
Respiration for the second time.

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,170
From 70 to 95 meters,

77
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,500
the elastic pushdown running.

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,830
Respiration for the third time.

79
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,030
From 95 to 100 meters,

80
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,370
the final sprint.

81
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,230
Perfect!

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,470
Good job.

83
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,630
Third-leg sprinter.

84
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,400
What's your name?

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,810
What a pity.

86
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,030
They were so close.

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,410
I didn't expect

88
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,370
to see

89
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,960
such a wonderful game today.

90
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,550
They are not

91
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,400
the best sprinters in our school.

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,490
We also have an athlete named Xue Yiran.

93
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,690
He didn't come today.

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,870
Really?

95
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,260
Mr. Yuan,

96
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,110
I'm making this promise

97
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,530
on behalf of our company.

98
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,040
If our school can win the national championship again

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,120
in the 4 x 100 m relay race,

100
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,450
I will sponsor

101
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,200
a new indoor multipurpose sports complex.

102
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,250
How about that?

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,570
Great!

104
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,690
Looks like my training has been very effective lately.

105
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,820
Didn't you see that?

106
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,550
I left Qi Tian behind by at least two meters.

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
Qi Tian

108
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,030
is just so-so.

109
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,150
Can't you see?

110
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,160
He's changing his techniques now.

111
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,180
Not only Qi Tian

112
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,320
but the other members of Xinghe

113
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,310
have all also changed their techniques.

114
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,910
Yes.

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,060
The techniques related to Qi Tian's upper body,

116
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,680
breathing,

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,290
arm-swinging,

118
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,020
and downward propulsion have all been adjusted.

119
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,430
That's not strange.

120
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,090
When I changed my techniques,

121
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,170
I felt like I didn't even know how to run.

122
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,370
And I was even slower.

123
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,659
Haoyu,

124
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,470
don't get too swellheaded.

125
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,590
You only beat a sprinter in his period of transition.

126
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,450
Go back and keep on your hard work.

127
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,510
Let's go.

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,510
If the four of them of this afternoon

129
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,710
made up a team,

130
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,550
I think it'd be hard for us to win.

131
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,010
But they are not a team.

132
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,320
We are.

133
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,670
Qi Tian,

134
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,550
do you think

135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,000
you promised to win together with me,

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,210
so getting the first place

137
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,740
is a task you must complete?

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,960
You don't have to think that way.

139
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,420
Even the old me

140
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,030
couldn't guarantee

141
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,550
to win the first place.

142
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Winning the championship is our goal,

143
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,470
not a mission.

144
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,110
If you go on carrying so much burden,

145
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,470
you'll vomit again.

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
Do you think

147
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,350
I'm too responsible now?

148
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,790
Fine.

149
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,440
In the future, pour the hot water yourself.

150
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,370
Go do the physiotherapy yourself.

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,030
I'm still on crutches.

152
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,130
How can I go and do the physiotherapy myself?

153
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,370
I'm just trying to persuade you.

154
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,300
Don't take the loss too seriously.

155
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,360
I take the loss too seriously?

156
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
Who cried

157
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,030
and begged me

158
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,330
to keep my promise?

159
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
It's my fault.

160
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,730
It's my fault.

161
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,770
I just look at

162
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,010
my atrophied leg muscles every day.

163
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,650
With this pair of legs,

164
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,910
I can forget about the champion.

165
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,440
It'll be good enough if I can

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,490
participate in the race in August.

167
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,370
Don't hit your leg.

168
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,360
That's the leg I've been taking care of for six weeks.

169
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,940
Yiran,

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,730
why didn't you tell the school

171
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,410
about the operation?

172
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,790
Come on.

173
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,670
Have a seat.

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

175
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,430
With everyone's help,

176
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,630
I've recovered a lot.

177
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,160
You should have a good rest.

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,320
Take care of yourself.

179
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,760
The school won't forget

180
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,590
your contribution these years.

181
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,620
Wang,

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,130
I watched

183
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,720
their game yesterday.

184
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,400
The athletes who came this time

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,670
were all college star sprinters.

186
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,320
Looks like we're promising next time.

187
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,630
So,

188
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,740
I discussed with the football team

189
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
and asked them to choose a person

190
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,190
to help you win the championship of the 4 x 100 m relay race.

191
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,990
Chen Mingxiang is the forward of the Football Club.

192
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,030
He used to be a national Level 2 athlete.

193
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,500
His best result is about 11.60 seconds.

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,130
If Coach Wang can train him,

195
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,550
maybe his result will be within 11 seconds.

196
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,600
Okay.

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,150
Good. Good.

198
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,220
Mr. Yuan,

199
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,200
without Xue Yiran,

200
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,470
there wouldn't be this relay team in the first place.

201
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,910
Look at this kid.

202
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,120
Mr. Yuan, please don't mind his words.

203
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,790
We

204
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,620
really appreciate your concern.

205
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,180
Trust me. We will do our best.

206
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:10,910
Okay.

207
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,590
Coach,

208
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,850
you can't stop Xue Yiran

209
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,330
from participating in this competition.

210
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,790
He came back and did so much

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,950
just for this day.

212
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,500
Yeah.

213
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,700
If Xue Yiran doesn't play,

214
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,760
I won't, either.

215
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,950
We worked so hard

216
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,730
to…

217
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,640
to make up…

218
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,320
To make up for Xue Yiran’s shortcomings, right?

219
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,850
Since he's not good enough,

220
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,580
then he should be replaced.

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,490
What are you talking about?

222
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,400
Who is not good enough?

223
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
What are you doing?

224
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,620
Stop talking.

225
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,580
Do you think I want to join the Track and Field Club?

226
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,350
If it weren't for the principal's order,

227
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,350
I'd still be practicing free kicks.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,060
Where is Xue Yiran?

229
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,680
Isn't that Xue Yiran?

230
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,340
How did he become like that?

231
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,880
I heard he's completely crippled.

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,410
His ankle tendon is broken.

233
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,030
Xue Yiran.

234
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,580
Xue Yiran.

235
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,470
Could it be that

236
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,670
I can't even

237
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,410
achieve the small goal of

238
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,650
participating in the game?

239
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,690
Xue Yiran,

240
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,400
don't give up.

241
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,740
Mr. Yuan is right.

242
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,610
If Coach insists on letting me play

243
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,210
when someone runs faster than me,

244
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,390
that means Coach must be crazy.

245
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,500
I'll talk to Coach.

246
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,740
If he doesn't let you play,

247
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
I won't play, either.

248
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,310
It's just too childish.

249
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,820
Stop dwelling on it.

250
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,890
Maybe some people's lives

251
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,710
are full of regrets.

252
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,560
Xue Yiran is so poor.

253
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,080
He formed the relay team from scratch.

254
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,990
It's almost the last step.

255
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,280
In the end,

256
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,400
someone came to reap the benefits.

257
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,920
What do you mean?

258
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
I mean

259
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
our team has the ability to win a medal now.

260
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,950
But now,

261
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,860
anyone can get involved

262
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,850
while Xue Yiran himself couldn't.

263
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,000
Isn't it toiling for someone else's benefit?

264
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,950
Yes.

265
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,210
Why didn't Coach stop them?

266
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,500
I don't know what he was thinking.

267
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,250
Wang

268
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,840
just planned to

269
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,070
retire after staying here for a couple of years.

270
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,630
How would he offend the leader

271
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,790
for us?

272
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,960
Theoretically,

273
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,310
we should let whoever is faster participate in the game.

274
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,280
But isn't it too cruel

275
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,430
to Yiran?

276
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes.

277
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,020
He was basically sentenced to death.

278
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm not even sure he can participate.

279
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,990
It's impossible for him to make it into 11.60 seconds.

280
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,120
In my opinion,

281
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,240
we should

282
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,460
rely on ourselves to solve it.

283
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,650
What do you want?

284
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,580
You can hit me,

285
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,520
but don't hit my face

286
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,930
because

287
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,170
my mom will be sad.

288
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,310
Forget it.

289
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,710
Although you look like a sissy,

290
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,640
your hands have a lot of strength.

291
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,680
Let's go have dinner together.

292
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Let's go.

293
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Have dinner?

294
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,300
Have some vegetables.

295
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,010
Xiang, let's drink.

296
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,580
I'll fill it up for you.

297
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,040
Fill it up.

298
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,940
Fill it up.

299
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,590
Fill it up.

300
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,040
Come on!

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,580
Cheers, Xiang.

302
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,190
Which year are you in?

303
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,460
Which major?

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm a sophomore majoring in international trade.

305
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,630
I'm also a sophomore.

306
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
-What a coincidence.
-What a coincidence.

307
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,400
Today...

308
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,370
we're really sorry.

309
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,520
We are just too close

310
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,200
to Xue Yiran,

311
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,420
so we acted on impulse today.

312
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,400
Please forgive us.

313
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,160
It's all a misunderstanding.

314
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,240
-All my apologies are in the beer.
-Cheers. Cheers.

315
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,900
Bottoms up!

316
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,940
Bottoms up.

317
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
Here. Fill it up.

318
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,530
Here.

319
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,520
Let's put the beers aside.

320
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,490
I have something to say.

321
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,590
As athletes,

322
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,680
we should drink less.

323
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,840
Ziji.

324
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,630
You said…

325
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,520
You just asked me to hit you.

326
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,650
Look at

327
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,790
your two bros behind you.

328
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
How dare I hit you?

329
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm not stupid.

330
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,910
Xiang.

331
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,200
You can't say that.

332
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,330
Am I the kind of person who bullies others

333
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,190
just because I have strong bros?

334
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,400
I asked you to hit me,

335
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
and I meant it.

336
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,840
Come on.

337
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,680
Don't hesitate.

338
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,930
Hit him!

339
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
How could I really hit my bro?

340
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,530
Have you ever thought about

341
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,720
going back and playing free kicks?

342
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,630
Yes.

343
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,870
Yes.

344
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,520
Then why don't you go back

345
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,710
to do what you want?

346
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,880
Dreams

347
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,370
are very important,

348
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,160
but I have to take reality into consideration.

349
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,720
-Yes.
-Listen.

350
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,830
If we

351
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,970
win this time,

352
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,190
the probability of me succeeding in applying for the scholarship next year

353
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,000
will be big.

354
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,550
Right?

355
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes, it'll be big.

356
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,880
Have you considered

357
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,119
private sponsorship?

358
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,000
Stop.

359
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,339
A man doesn't accept food that comes from contempt.

360
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,599
I'll get the scholarship

361
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,819
on my own merit.

362
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,079
Private sponsorship?

363
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,680
What is that?

364
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,170
Come one. Cheers!

365
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,140
-You're right. What is that?
-Cheers.

366
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,339
Why don't you drink?

367
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,640
I haven't seen you drink all night.

368
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,100
How much can you two drink?

369
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,150
It's not easy to make him

370
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,920
quit the Track and Field Club.

371
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,230
I didn't expect him

372
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,840
to have good integrity.

373
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,620
What about our bro Yiran?

374
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,830
♫Can we go back to the past?♫

375
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,100

♫I don't want to care♫

389
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,970
Let's think of another way.

390
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,710
Get out.

391
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,180

423
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,000
Qi Tian.

424
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,610
I brought someone here.

425
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,690
Hello, Qi Tian.

426
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,140
I'm here to visit Xue Yiran.

427
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,740
I wonder if his leg is better.

428
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,280
He

429
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
is probably still sleeping.

430
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,800
Morning, He.

431
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,180
Let's go.

432
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,610
Yiran,

433
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,000
I went to the temple to get this amulet for you.

434
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,320
There's also a gold lock pendant.

435
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,250
I hope you can be safe in the future.

436
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,510
You're so superstitious.

437
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,080
Is this made of gold?

438
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,890
Well,

439
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,080
I'll take the amulet.

440
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,840
Take this back.

441
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,010
It's too expensive.

442
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,030
No, Yiran.

443
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,270
You have to take this.

444
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,430
Actually...

445
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,620
since the day you were hospitalized,

446
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,990
I've wanted to visit you every day.

447
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,560
But I'm afraid I'll bring you misfortune.

448
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,140
So, for the past month,

449
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,600
I've been blaming myself.

450
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,920
Yiran,

451
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,080
just accept it.

452
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,590
He Miao asked me several times

453
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,790
about your recovery.

454
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,480
He's really worried about you.

455
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,870
I'm really fine.

456
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,040
Don't think

457
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,680
I got hurt because of you.

458
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,840
But if I didn't

459
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
invite you to go to our bathhouse,

460
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,620
there wouldn't have been

461
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,270
the subsequent accidents.

462
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,920
Let's not talk about this anymore.

463
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,440
What are you busy with recently?

464
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,630
Are your teammates still bullying you?

465
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm not doing bad.

466
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,190
They don't want to have anything to do with me,

467
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,680
and I don't want to be friends with them.

468
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,740
We are kind of like…

469
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,170
minding our own business.

470
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,160
That's good.

471
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,500
I heard

472
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,280
you're also writing novels.

473
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,210
I'm just writing it for fun.

474
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,650
We're leaving.

475
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,820
-Bye.
-Bye.

476
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,080
Bye.

477
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,970
-Bye.
-Bye.

478
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,020
Qi Tian.

479
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,280
I want to eat

480
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,900
roast chicken, roast duck, Spicy Sliced Beef and Ox Tongue,

481
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,030
and many, many more.

482
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,530
Is that the so-called "big heart"?

483
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
You're back to normal

484
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,000
after only one night?

485
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,660
Have you digested it?

486
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,990
You're not sad anymore?

487
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm still sad.

488
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,420
The injury

489
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,200
has always been a boil on me.

490
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,080
We pierced it.

491
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,680
Now, I'm going to

492
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,520
keep going on

493
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,530
with this unhealed wound.

494
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,210
And I have always been living like this

495
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,910
for the past 23 years

496
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,050
♫They said where I should turn my face to♫

500

It's not that those mentally strong people

501
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,730
don't feel pain.

502
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,960
♫They said where I should put my hands♫

503

♫They said no secret should be in my heart♫

504
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,910
It's that

505
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,310
no matter how many times they've been hurt,

506
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,310
with the mask on,

507
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,420
the sun will rise as usual.

508
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,020
♫The so-called vision is just♫
