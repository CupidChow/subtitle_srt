00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,500
Why did he

4
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,900
want to return to the Track and Field Club?

5
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,850
He didn't explicitly say.

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
You don't seem to like him.

7
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,310
I don't have any particular feelings towards him,

8
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,910
either liking or disliking.

9
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,550
According to this conversation,

10
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,210
you haven't forgiven him yet.

11
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,289
Let alone forgiveness.

12
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,910
Because...

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,009
he should be more heartbroken than me.

[Episode 2: I Want To Be Recognized]

15
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,600
Because that person

16
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,450
was also Xue Yiran's best friend.

17
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,759

18
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,020

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,480
Qi Tian.

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,750
Don't be so cold.

21
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,070
After all, we're in the same club now.

22
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,620
We can consider ourselves teammates, right?

23
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,580
Since you have so many bad memories in the Track and Field Club,

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,790
why did you come back?

25
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,329
Of course, it was because of you.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,190
I fell in love with your Golden Ankles

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,190
at first sight.

28
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,410
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,540
Following me all the time.

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,340
Doesn't the provincial team need training?

31
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,400
The coach notified me that I could relax and have a rest.

32
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,860
Then go relax and have a rest.

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,640
Don't follow me.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,570
Making friends is also a way to relax and have rest.

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,240
Qi Tian,

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,079
don't go.

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,390
Didn't you say you want to flirt with girls?

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,250
I have the contact information of the top ten campus goddesses

39
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,490
saved in my phone.

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,170
You...

41
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,650
can share it?

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,290
Good things...

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,910
are meant to be shared with brothers.

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,110
But women are not objects.

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,920
We mustn't objectify them.

46
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,090
It's unethical to disclose

47
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,750
someone's privacy, you know.

48
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,640

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,780
don't be angry.

50
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,090
Although we can't disclose others' privacy,

51
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,280
I can help you set up a gathering.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,510
I'll ask all of them out.

53
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,220
Qi Tian.

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,040
Wait for me.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,440
Qi Tian. Qi Tian? Qi Tian!

56
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,610
Xinghe has never missed

57
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,250
CUBA over the years.

58
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,329
What are you doing?

59
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,329
Wu Tianfu,

60
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,400
I hope you explode right here and right now.

You jinx!

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,990
You've been kicked off the basketball team.

63
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,829
From now on,

64
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,480
you're no longer a member of the basketball team.

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,510
Sir! Sir,

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,690
I didn't mean it.

67
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,530
Could you please forgive me?

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,329
Sir!

69
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,220
I want to play basketball!

70
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,100
Get lost!

71
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,850
Stop crying.

72
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,240
Get up.

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,170
Turns out Kobe's words were all lies.

74
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,410
I only started playing basketball in my senior year of high school,

75
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,010
so my fundamentals are weak.

76
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,420
Coach always says my sense for the game is bad.

77
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,240
I had a heavy academic load at that time,

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
but I still got up at four in the morning every day

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,930
to practice.

80
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,410
That's true.

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,870
Just the other day,

82
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,090
he tried to drag me to see

83
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,890
the court at four in the morning.

84
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,090
Do you know how comforting the sound

85
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,550
of a basketball swishing through the net is?

86
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,090
I kept shooting.

87
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,650
Two hundred times,

88
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,260
five hundred times,

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,810
a thousand times.

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,360
I always want to push myself a little further.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
But why did I get,

92
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,350
"Your basketball IQ is too low."

93
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,250
"You're the worst center I've ever seen."

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,250
Is it because I really have no talent?

95
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,640
So,

96
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,540
So, what exactly did you do

97
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,020
to anger the basketball team like this?

98
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,440
I came off the bench in the last two minutes.

99
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,900
In the final 20 seconds of the game,

100
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,350
I grabbed a rebound.

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,060
But I passed the ball to a player from Hangning University.

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,110
And then Hangning University reversed the score

103
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,170
and turned defeat into victory.

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,550
Our school allocates

105
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,159
quite a bit of funding to the basketball team every year.

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,720
This year's performance

107
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,600
was quite unsatisfactory.

108
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,040
I don't know why

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
it's always me making mistakes.

110
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,190
I just feel so much pressure on the court,

111
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,130
and it's hard to breathe.

112
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,760
I know that feeling.

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,090
That...

114
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,180
suffocating feeling on the field.

115
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,740
You have competed before?

116
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
People with dreams

117
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,090
often turn themselves into cars

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,790
with only accelerators

119
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,200
and no brakes.

120
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,470
You always think about

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,250
♫A fleeting beam of light♫

122

125
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,850

in self-denial,

129
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,120
you keep pushing yourself.

130

♫Willing to be crazy♫

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,040
Eventually,

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,410
both physically and mentally,

133
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:07,120
♫Breaking through fear, racing against destiny♫

134
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,530
you fall into endless exhaustion.

135
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,680
But once the exhaustion accumulates,

136
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,840
♫Not being nervous anymore. Not being content with the status quo♫

137
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,650

138
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,480

147
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,250
I remember

148
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,530
Hangning is a very bad team.

149
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,210
They always used to lose to Xinghe by more than 20 points.

150
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,730
I haven't heard of any skilled newcomers

151
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,810
joining this year.

152
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,120
You...

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,000
How did you become the scapegoat?

154
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,540
This way.

155
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,090
Qi Tian,

156
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,450
take a picture of here.

157
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,780
Tianfu.

158
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
Take a picture,

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,360
then put it back in place.

160
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,690
Who's there?

161
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,730
Hello, sir.

162
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,990
Is there a restroom in this building?

163
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,370
Are you...

164
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,500
Xue Yiran?

165
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,770
Why are you here to use the restroom?

166
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,470
I ate something bad at dinner.

167
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,290
Running back to the dormitory probably won't make it in time.

168
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,770
Even you can't make it.

169
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,370
It must be quite serious.

170
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,610
Hurry up and go.

171
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,670
It's right ahead.

172
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,360
-Over there.
-Thank you, sir.

173
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,780
What are you doing here?

174
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
Do you have a conscience?

175
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,080
If it weren't for me just now,

176
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,720
you would have been caught.

177
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,450
Qi Tian,

178
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,210
Yiran was right.

179
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,340
We should be more careful later.

180
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,200
You're not in good health.

181
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,470
If we accidentally alert the security later,

182
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,280
Xue Yiran and I can escape.

183
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,140
but it will be difficult for you.

184
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,920
Not in good health?

185
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,450
It seems that

186
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
Tianfu

187
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
has no idea

188
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,970
how perfect your physical fitness is.

189
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,440
Shut up.

190
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,650
All right.

191
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,450
Let's go.

192
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,860
Who is it?

193
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,520
Run!

194
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,390
Who's there?

195
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,310
Who?

196
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,980
Stop!

197
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,940
Stop!

198
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,010
Your brother

199
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,040
has fully understood

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
your perfect physical fitness.

201
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,640
Despite the ugly running posture,

202
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,460
your leg explosiveness is not bad.

203
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,390
Surprisingly, you weren't left too far behind by us.

204
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,130
Qi Tian.

205
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,050
You...

206
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,890
You...

207
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,690
I...

208
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,720
No wonder you insisted on joining the Track and Field Club

209
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
even though it's so idle.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,620
So, your true passion is in running, huh?

211
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,730
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,330
I underestimated you.

213
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,120
It turns out your seemingly cynicism

214
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,690
is just a facade.

215
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,130
I heard you didn't get to eat it last time.

216
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,620
Have some more this time.

217
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,950
And your friends too.

218
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,610
Sister, you're so nice.

219
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,490
Are these people blind?

220
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,420
They can't see your true nature.

221
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,530
I have a good nature.

222
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,310
If it weren't for my altruism,

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,090
how would I be sitting here

224
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,620
having a meal with you guys?

225
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,810
Captain, look.

226
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,000
Go, Tianfu.

227
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,630
Just follow what we taught you to say.

228
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,690
Didn't I tell you to disappear?

229
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,890
Why are you still hanging around us?

230
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,950
Captain.

231
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,500
I want to go back to the basketball team.

232
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,530
You're a black sheep.

233
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,870
Get lost.

234
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,560
Don't block my way to the meal.

235
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,990
How could you call someone a black sheep?

236
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,500
Who do you think you are?

237
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm Tianfu's classmate.

238
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,260
He often takes care of me.

239
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,740
Now seeing him being bullied,

240
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,320
I can't just stand by.

241
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,030
Isn't that Qi Tian?

242
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,190
Mind your own business.

243
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,810
Hold your horse,

244
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,810
Captain Gan Xian.

245
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,610
Teachers

246
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,410
and classmates present,

247
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,740
I've just had a little idea.

248
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,210
Today, on behalf of the Track and Field Club,

249
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,290
I challenge the basketball team.

250
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,100
We're being represented.

251
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,330
What does this guy want to do?

252
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,330
What do you think your lame club

253
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,610
can compare with us?

254
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,570
Who can lose more miserably?

255
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,030
Who said our Track and Field Club is lame?

256
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,410
Xue Yiran

257
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,620
is now a member of our Track and Field Club.

258
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
The problem here

259
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,490
is that you insulted Wu Tianfu

260
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,640
and called him a black sheep.

261
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,570
In my opinion,

262
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,470
it's your Basketball Club that is lame

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,510
and incapable of nurturing talent.

264
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,440
What did you say?

265
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,160
I bet with you

266
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,280
that if the Track and Field Club trains Wu Tianfu for two weeks,

267
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,930
he will be able to outrun

268
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,390
the fastest person in your basketball team.

269
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,100
If Wu Tianfu wins,

270
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
you'll have to let him go back to the Basketball Club.

271
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,850
I...

272
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,690
Me racing against someone?

273
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,960
Okay.

274
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,010
He can race against Lin Yufan.

275
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,280
He's a Level 2 athlete.

276
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,970
Beating small fries like you

277
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,740
would be a piece of cake for him.

278
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,730
He's the small forward in our team,

279
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,790
and runs very fast.

280
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,880
You know,

281
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,360
running is a sport

282
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,350
for people with poor coordination,

283
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,460
strong

284
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,030
but unintelligent.

285
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,070
It's nothing like basketball,

286
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,770
which combines competition, psychological tactics,

287
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,180
and intelligence.

288
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,730
You can insult me,

289
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,570
but you can't insult my friends.

290
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,030
Your friends?

291
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,490
Xue Yiran is not that skilled.

292
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,950
With my physical fitness,

293
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,910
I can easily run faster than him

294
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,440
if I get some fine practice.

295
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,840
Indeed.

296
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,610
Xue Yiran

297
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,990
is glad that you chose basketball.

298
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,250
Otherwise,

299
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,540
he wouldn't be able to make it now.

300
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,190
Anyway, it's settled.

301
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,610
See you

302
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,780
at the track-and-field ground in two weeks.

303
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,500
You brat,

304
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,570
when did you qualify to represent our Track and Field Club?

305
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,250
Ziji, how could you hit me?

306
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,940
Our Track and Field Club is so lame anyway.

307
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,880
Being represented

308
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
won't hurt anything, right?

309
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,100
You've made a big deal out of this.

310
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,140
If we end up losing,

311
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,850
we'll all lose face together.

312
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,490
Not necessarily.

313
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,570
It might be them

314
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,020
who end up losing.

315
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,930
Were we being

316
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,080
too reckless today?

317
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,400
Do you remember how fast he was

318
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,330
when he ran away with us that night?

319
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,610
Run away?

320
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,210
What did you guys do?

321
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,450
We had some professional exchanges

322
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,910
with the Basketball Club.

323
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,530
Anyway,

324
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,030
trust my judgment.

325
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,530
After all,

326
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,830
my judgment is excellent.

327
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,770
Right, Qi Tian?

328
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,370
Xue Yiran was right.

329
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,860
This dummy,

330
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,610
although he looks a bit clumsy,

331
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,590
he has amazing explosiveness,

332
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,190
runs at a fast pace,

333
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,570
and has well-developed leg muscles.

334
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,670
Originally,

335
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,200
we just wanted to figure out

336
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,350
why the Basketball Club's performance was declining

337
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,080
and help this scapegoat vent his frustrations.

338
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
Unexpectedly,

339
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,310
we found out

340
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,350
that this guy runs pretty fast.

341
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,150
With a little training,

342
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,500
he'll definitely be a good sprinter.

343
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,840
See?

344
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,990
The strength,

345
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,510
the explosiveness.

346
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,510
Stop it.

347
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,590
I understand.

348
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,550
I have to say,

349
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,420
you freshmen

350
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,000
really like to make trouble for yourself.

351
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,200
You're a senior.

352
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,310
You used to be difficult to find.

353
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,670
Why have you been joining in the fun lately?

354
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,730
I can't help it.

355
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,270
People change.

356
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,670
Recently,

357
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,670
I found joining in the fun is not bad.

358
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,670
Fatty.

359
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's go.

360
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,950
Tianfu.

361
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,700
Your posture is so ugly.

362
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,250
Look at your running posture, isn't it ugly?

363
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,930
How is my posture ugly?

364
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,930
♫Leaving worries behind♫

365
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,700
♫Doing whatever you want can make you happy♫

366
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,120
♫I made a wish upon a shooting star♫

367
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,440
♫And dreams have grown wings♫

368
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,100
♫Courage has increased the speed♫

♫I keep running as fast as I can all the time♫

370
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,680
♫Who am I running for and who will I stop for?♫

371
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,370
♫And for whom will you become mature?♫

372
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,270
♫Both efforts and luck matter, so don't be afraid of being mocked♫

373

♫Eliminate your fear with courage, because you are young♫

374

375

Tianfu.

376
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,080
♫Show the meaning of running to the world♫

377
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,690
Here, have some water.

378
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,360
Qi Tian.

379
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,590
Can I really do it?

380
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,880
What if

381
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,710
I end up embarrassing everyone?

382
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,930
Have confidence in yourself.

383
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,360
Why are you sitting there idling?

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,890
Come down and demonstrate.

385
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,050
Since you're here,

386
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,150
demonstrate

387
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,370
a crouching start.

388
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,150
You

389
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,270
really don't consider yourself an outsider, huh?

390
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,800
Why don't you demonstrate?

391
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,590
I haven't practiced for a long time.

392
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,390
I'm rusty,

393
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,670
not as good as you.

394
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,110
Besides,

395
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,190
aren't you the most helpful one?

396
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,990
I think

397
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,870
you just don't want to reveal

398
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,800
your true abilities in front of me.

399
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,350
Cut the crap.

400
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,150
Hurry up.

401
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,800
What a pity for the Golden Ankles.

402
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,590
If you're not going to train, just stand aside.

403
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,790
In this school,

404
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,850
you're probably the only one who can boss around Yiran.

405
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,930
I told you to learn his posture.

406
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,590
Hurry up. You talk too much.

407
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,710
On your marks.

408
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,510
Set.

409
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,400
Go!

410
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,920
Come back and take a look.

411
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,040
Are you okay?

412
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,390
Take a look.

413
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,220
It's fine.

414
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,990
Many people are like this the first time

415
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,190
they use starting blocks.

416
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,510
I'll teach you this later.

417
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,830
Just practice more and you'll get better.

418
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,070
Pay close attention to Xue Yiran's posture.

419
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,510
The time from the starting gun firing to the start

420
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,950
is called starting reaction time.

421
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,000
This ability to react

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,390
is crucial

423
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,550
for sprinters.

424
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,150
It's also an area you can improve on.

425
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,120
Is this the starting ability of top athletes?

426
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,020
I've already lost before reaching five meters.

427
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,910
Why are you comparing yourself to him?

428
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,390
How many years has he been training?

429
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,390
It's normal for him to run like this.

430
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,030
This is a basic ability.

431
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,200
You're useless now.

432
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,870
Go away.

433
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,880
How could you bite the hand that feeds you?

434
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,340
Am I just a tool for you?

435
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,630
Go.

436
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,800
Let's continue.

437
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,830
Prop up.

438
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,440
Okay.

439
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,070
Right.

440
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,790
On your marks.

441
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,520
Set. Go.

442
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,350
I heard Xue Yiran is coming today.

443
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,880
Will he participate in the race?

444
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,610
I don't know.

445
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,910
So our school really has a Track and Field Club?

446
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,870
His skin is so fair.

447
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,550
He's dandified in appearance, pretentious,

448
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,670
lacking any masculinity.

449
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,710
What a sissy.

450
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,070
Is the muscular guy

451
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,270
the black sheep of the basketball team?

452
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,790
Who's this Mr. Rustic in the middle?

453
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,920
Is the fatty also on the track and field team?

454
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,320
Seems like exercising really isn't effective for losing weight.

455
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,270
How come Xue Yiran

456
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,710
is hanging out with this strange bunch?

457
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,520
Why is there even an old man?

458
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,140
Tianfu.

459
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,560
Tell them to shut up.

460
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,890
It's too noisy.

461
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,110
How could you let your team members

462
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,510
do such a thing?

463
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,010
Who are you?

464
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,170
This is our basketball team's chief coach.

465
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,390
Nice to meet you.

466
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,620
Our Track and Field Club

467
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,460
advocates for non-interference.

468
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,260
If you don't allow it,

469
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,400
you can stop them right now.

470
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,900
Calling a stop now?

471
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,030
Won't that prove

472
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,640
that our Basketball Club doesn't coach according to the abilities of the students?

473
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,100
It's been rumored outside

474
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,770
that the talent our Basketball Club doesn't appreciate

475
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,300
has become a treasure

476
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,190
in your Track and Field Club.

477
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,450
Wu Tianfu,

478
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,830
as his name suggests,

479
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,690
is just a talentless waste.

480
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Nowadays,

481
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,870
there are plenty of talented individuals,

482
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,000
but only a few can truly recognize them.

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,860
-You…
-Don’t worry.

484
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,990
That Lin Yufan is quite talented.

485
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you think we can make it?

486
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Do you know what professionalism is?

487
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,280
Running

488
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,230
is different from basketball.

489
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,490
You can't play tricks.

490
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,370
Starting reaction time

491
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,550
can be improved through training.

492
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,340
Concentration is the key.

493
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,040
On your marks.

494
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,980
Set.
