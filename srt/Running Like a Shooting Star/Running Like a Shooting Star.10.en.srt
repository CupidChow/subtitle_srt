00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,750
People

4
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,030
tend to believe

5
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,110
that their thoughts have made them who they are.

6
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,480
If so,

7
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,130
a person is nothing but a collection of thoughts.

8
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,890
You should try thinking about

[Episode 10 Seize Every Day]

10
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,480
the thoughts that bother you from a bystander's perspective.

11
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,970
Once your head is full of thoughts that bother you,

12
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,979
much of your energy will be consumed,

13
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,530
and you'll become less and less concentrated.

14
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,580
You'll have poor judgment and become less creative.

15
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,580
As a result, you'll be stopped from entering the ZONE.

Coach makes Qi Tian

stay with him in the meditation room every day.

18
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,140
Will it get Qi Tian to improve his speed?

19
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,300
What the coach is doing is so weird.

20
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,490
Qi Tian

21
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,060
kept silent

22
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,210
after he came back to his room every night.

23
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,140
I have no idea what he was thinking.

24
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,410
The coach looked happy every night.

25
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,860
After he came back every night, he would sing in the shower.

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,180
Wang sang every night?

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,980
When you calm down,

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,250
label every thought that bothers you.

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,740
Then you will find

30
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,640
those thoughts in your head

31
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,370
are quite similar.

32
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,020
How come I worked so hard,

33
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,420
but it was you who got the first place easily?

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,090
I used to be way better than you,

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,140
but you are one of the most popular people at the school now.

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,980
Come on.

37
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,260
You have to work harder.

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,570
Otherwise, you won't beat a genius like me.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,570
When you know what those thoughts that bother you are,

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,380
try labeling them.

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,900
I tend to number them.

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Bad Thought No.1.

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,820
You can easily get the first place.

Bad Thought No.2.

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,460
You have to work harder

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,180
to beat a genius like me.

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,610
Bad Thought No.3.

48
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Most people

49
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,050
will have no more than ten thoughts

50
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,100
that keep bothering them in their life.

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,700
But they would feel the number of those thoughts is far greater than ten.

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,380
And they're tired of dealing with them.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,700
The next time Bad Thought No.1 comes to you,

54
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,770
you'll say,

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,180
"Oh, it's you again."

56
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,210
Try to talk to them

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,579
as a bystander.

58
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,860
Try to keep calm and think critically

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,250
when you're dealing with the thoughts that bother you.

60
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,660
Gradually, you will find

61
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,610
those thoughts will come to you

62
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,070
less and less frequently.

63
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,290
You don't have to think hard about them.

64
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,370
Just let those thoughts be there.

65
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,450
Try to get familiar with those thoughts.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,660
Many of them

67
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,660
will be like the friends that will be with you forever.

68
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,340
Your goal is

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,100
to focus on breathing.

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,780
Think about nothing.

71
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:00,860
Clear your mind.

72
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,930
Should we get one for Qi Tian?

73
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,970
He should be here soon.

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,329
Get him one.

75
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,620
Qi Tian.

76
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,060
How are you feeling?

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,500
I'm so hungry.

78
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,790
Here you are.

79
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,140
Thank you.

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
I'm starving.

81
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,010
Qi Tian.

82
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,260
I remember you haven't eaten much at every meal

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,850
since you began to run again.

84
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,460
You couldn't even finish the food I bought for you.

85
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Why is your appetite so great today?

86
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,610
Coach.

87
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,020
Though I can't

88
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,480
be in the state you talked to me about for now,

89
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,970
I'm much calmer now.

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,820
And I don't feel sick anymore.

91
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,900
That's because your sympathetic nerves

92
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,420
are not in disorder anymore.

93
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,480
The secretion of your gastric fluid is also normal now.

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,530
Sympathetic nerves in disorder?

95
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,340
Qi Tian.

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,920
You had a mental disorder?

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,570
Don't talk nonsense.

98
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,170
Qi Tian just got better.

99
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,740
Don't make fun of him.

100
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,140
Coach.

101
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,150
The theory you used is really good.

102
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,340
Although I don't quite understand

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,900
the cutting-edge brain science theories

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,780
or psychology.

105
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,820
But at least,

106
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,300
your methods worked well for me.

107
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Thank you, Coach.

108
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,060
Don't mention it.

109
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,460
Actually,

110
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,250
I should thank you

111
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,530
for giving me the opportunity

112
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,570
to teach you what I have learnt

113
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,450
and to watch you grow day by day

114
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,420
and become stronger and stronger.

115
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm really happy for you.

116
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,020
Coach.

117
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,430
Will your methods work for me?

118
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,200
I want to become stronger too.

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,940
You...

120
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
In terms of mental strength,

121
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,340
you're way better than Qi Tian.

122
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,070
You don't need those methods.

123
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,510
I'm better than Qi Tian in that aspect?

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,530
Okay.

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,850
I agree with you.

126
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,500
No wonder you've been so happy these days.

127
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,330
Thank you.

128
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,290
Actually,

129
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,010
to evaluate

130
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,540
how good a coach is

131
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,200
is to see how well they can train their athletes.

132
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,480
Athletes like you are like firewood.

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,210
A good coach is like one who will

134
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
ignite the firewood.

135
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,140
Let's drink a toast to Coach.

136
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,170
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

137
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,500
Cheers.

138
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,630
-Thank you, Coach.
-Thank you, Coach.

139
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm so full.

140
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,940
I haven't eaten so much in a meal for a long time.

141
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,810
Dr. Liu just came to help us get relaxed.

142
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,420
He said there was a thermal spring here

143
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,020
and advised all of us to take a bath in the thermal spring.

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,550
He said it would help get our muscles relaxed.

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,570
I've just taken a shower.

146
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,770
But your hair is dry.

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,000
And you're not wearing slippers.

148
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,170
He lied to you.

149
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,100
He hasn't taken a shower yet.

150
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,970
He has mysophobia.

151
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,550
He wants to keep it a secret.

152
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,340
When he used to live with us,

153
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,730
he complained we were too untidy.

154
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,460
And he has never bathed with us.

155
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,310
Right, Tianfu?

156
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,110
It seems that

157
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,060
Yiran has never bathed with us.

158
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,710
Ai Ziji has mysophobia. So do I.

159
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,580
The idea of sharing a bathtub with you guys

160
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,240
makes me feel uncomfortable.

161
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,540
How could you say that?

162
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,940
Fine, you just stay here.

163
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Qi Tian, would you like to go with us?

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,650
I ate too much.

165
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,260
I'm afraid I'll feel uncomfortable later if I take a thermal spring bath.

166
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
I'll go next time.

167
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

168
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,570
Bye.

169
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,809
Thank you.

170
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,070
You're such a terrible liar.

171
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,650
That's because

172
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm an honest person.

173
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,940
An honest person

174
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,620
doesn't hide things from their best friends.

175
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,540
What on earth...

176
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,190
There is a new girl group.

177
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,780
The lead dancer is so pretty.

178
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,460
Really.

179
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,360
I bet you'll like her a lot.

180
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,690
Xing, I missed you so much.

181
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,660
Why didn't you come back to the team for training after the match?

182
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,460
Xing, you're amazing.

183
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,250
You finished the race within 10.19 seconds.

184
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,290
No college students

185
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,420
in the past two years have been faster.

186
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,450
My fish!

187
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,330
You scared my fish away.

188
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,610
We're here.

189
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,690
How come you're still fishing?

190
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,730
Didn't you miss

191
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,770
your cute juniors?

192
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,570
Yeah.

193
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,900
Fine.

194
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,930
Let's go.

195
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,770
What do you want to eat?

196
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,030
Anything will be good.

197
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,720
I heard you had competed in the city-level contest for autumn.

198
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,840
Why did you do that?

199
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,780
If I didn't participate,

200
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,370
the winners of the 4 x 100 m relay race

201
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,430
would become another school's team.

202
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,610
Xue Yiran also competed in the contest this year.

203
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,470
How come he would compete in a contest of that level?

204
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,500
I don't know.

205
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,970
There is something very strange about Xinghe this year.

206
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,770
That's not important.

207
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,370
The important thing is that they have recruited a new member. His name is...

208
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,850
He used to be Shen Ming's schoolmate.

209
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,690
He's only a freshman.

210
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,660
But he almost beat me.

211
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Almost beat you?

212
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,340
A freshman?

213
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,140
He has been seen as a gifted runner

214
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,290
since high school.

215
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,920
And I'm sure

216
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,860
he wasn't at his best in that race against me.

217
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,970
He fell on the ground after the race.

218
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,250
Xue Yiran carried him away.

219
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,090
Really?

220
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,160
Was Ms. Luo there that day?

221
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,170
Ms. Luo?

222
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,380
You won't believe this.

223
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,980
She's a huge fan of his now.

224
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,930
She said he was art

225
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,010
all the time.

226
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,100
What's his name?

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,840
He's called Golden Hound.

228
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,900
His name is Qi Tian.

229
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,190
Are you ready to go running with us?

230
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,260
Yes.

231
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,710
Let's go.

232
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,650
The coach said

233
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,620
I only needed to meditate for an hour every day.

234
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,230
For the rest of the day,

235
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,580
I would be in training with you.

236
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,650
Good for you.

237
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,410
Looks like

238
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,400
it's going to rain, right?

239
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,430
Let's do the training indoors.

240
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,500
No.

241
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,190
I just came out from seclusion.

242
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,780
Let me run freely.

243
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,980
So you're fully recovered now.

244
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,020
Don't be a jerk.

245
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,600
Cut the crap.

246
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,860
Are you running or not?

247
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,680
I don't feel like running.

248
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,180
The caged hound has been set free.

249
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:46,720
♫Talking like a child♫

250
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,020
Wait for us.

251
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,520
I believe in those long nights

252
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,100
there will be someone

253
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:57,280
♫I will love you more♫

254
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,930
who can bring the passion out of you.

255
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,010
The person is like a shooting star flying through the night sky.

256
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,810
He will help you know yourself

257
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,650
and get you to love your life.

258
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:11,810
♫Talking like a child♫

259
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,780
And he's also like a torch,

260
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,490
making you feel

261
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,210
your own warmth.

262
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,580
♫Take a little time to think things over♫

263
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,240
♫We're just one song away from heaven♫

264
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:33,010
♫Take a little time to think things over♫

265
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,100
It's so cold.

266
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,020
Are you alright? Xue Yiran was running so slow.

267
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,730
Hey.

268
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,500
It's so cold outside.

269
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,610
Why were you running in the rain?

270
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,980
Go get changed now.

271
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,450
I feel so good.

272
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,890
I didn't run for ten days.

273
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,550
Today,

274
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,850
I feel incredibly good after running.

275
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,370
What are you hiding us from?

276
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,120
You got a big green dragon tattooed on your back?

277
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,750
I don't mind letting you see it.

278
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,550
I don't want to scare you.

279
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,670
How did you get those scars?

280
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,740
I got burnt by cigarette butts.

281
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,480
Who did this to you?

282
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,260
Someone from my family. It's a story about child abuse.

283
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,720
My stepmother did it to me.

284
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,780
What was your dad doing?

285
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,900
My dad fooled around all day.

286
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,190
He paid little attention to me.

287
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,830
What about your birth mother?

288
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,700
She

289
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,970
remarried.

290
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,940
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

291
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,270
It's all over.

292
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,860
At that time,

293
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,270
you were still a child, right?

294
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,210
Of course.

295
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,950
I grew stronger and stronger.

296
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,830
My stepmother had to avoid me.

297
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,530
I want to tell you a joke

298
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,780
to make you feel better.

299
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,970
But I'm unable to do that.

300
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
You must have felt hopeless.

301
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,010
It's all over.

302
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,500
Really?

303
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,060
I now have you by my side.

304
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,339
In

305
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
less than a year,

306
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,780
we'll have to

307
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,010
go our separate ways.

308
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,390
I feel a little sad when I think about it.

309
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,500
In the meditation room,

310
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,810
Wang said some words to me.

311
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,850
Let me say them to you now.

312
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,450
Don't regret what happened in the past.

313
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,110
Don't worry about the future.

314
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,050
Seize every day.

315
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,410
What happened in the past

316
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,930
won't bother you anymore

317
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,120
if you don't care about it.

318
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,780
Now,

319
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,910
we are completely honest with each other.

320
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,850
You now know

321
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,210
all my secrets.

322
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,340
You must feel sorry for me because of my unhappy childhood.

323
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,410
Then tell me a joke.

324
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,810
No, I won't.

325
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,890
Hurry up.

326
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,370
I'm hungry.

327
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,460
I used to tell you jokes.

328
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,860
You're so cold-hearted.

329
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
What are you going to eat?

330
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,900
Gu said he would make us Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish today.

331
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,850
Wait for me.

332
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,050
Yiran.

333
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,320
I think

334
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,560
you look different today.

335
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,740
But I can't tell

336
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,670
what's different about you today.

337
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
Yes.

338
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,060
He's not wearing

339
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,930
that...

340
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,100
He's not wearing his long johns today.

341
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,460
Don't talk nonsense.

342
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,220
That is compression clothing.

343
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,320
It can accelerate the process of blood going to the heart

344
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,020
and improve the efficiency of exercising.

345
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,540
Come on.

346
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,070
Your compression clothing is nothing good.

347
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,820
It can only be worn in winter.

348
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,620
In summer, you must feel very hot in that clothing.

349
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,840
How did you get these scars?

350
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,340
You really care little about your appearance.

351
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,730
Now the medical beauty technology is highly developed.

352
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,700
I'll recommend you a clinic where you can have the scars removed through a laser surgery.

353
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
How could you say

354
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,170
you have mysophobia?

355
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,250
I do have mysophobia.

356
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,510
What's wrong about it?

357
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,030
We can see so many stars in the sky in the mountains.

358
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,320
Yes.

359
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,380
There're too many lights in cities so we can't see many stars there.

360
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,330
We're going back tomorrow.

361
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,350
I feel a little sad about it.

362
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,780
The tea here is good.

363
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,050
The air is also fresh here.

364
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,360
If you like it here so much,

365
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,790
let's come here often.

366
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,360
Did you notice that

367
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,010
after these days' training,

368
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,010
Ziji and Tianfu made much progress.

369
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,900
Tianfu has improved a lot.

370
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,370
Yes.

371
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,580
But

372
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,250
we didn't improve.

373
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,770
That's not true.

374
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,010
We all made a great stride.

375
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,770
You must have had

376
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,940
a happy childhood.

377
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,380
Very much so.

378
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,460
My parents

379
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,610
own a small business.

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,230
It's easy to tell

381
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,130
that you grew up in a happy family.

382
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,700
That's why you were always naive.

383
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,650
That's not fair. I wasn't naive.

384
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,510
I was just innocent and carefree.

385
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,660
I never

386
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,780
experienced pain or failure.

387
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,380
What I'm going through

388
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,870
is something I should go through in my childhood.

389
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,410
In my experience,

390
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,700
if you had many unhappy experiences in your childhood,

391
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,380
it doesn't mean you'll have fewer happy experiences when you grow up.

392
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,180
So,

393
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
try to be happy

394
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,900
every day.

395
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,160
Not to be bothered by the past.

396
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,330
Just to embrace the future and always wear a smile.

397
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,440
This is your style.

398
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
We're finally back.

399
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,170
I want to eat braised pork ribs.

400
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,140
Wasn't the food Gu cooked good?

401
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,260
Yes, it was.

402
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,410
Of course, it was.

403
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,630
But

404
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,700
people can feel nostalgic.

405
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,970
I felt nostalgic for braised pork ribs,

406
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,580
the lively campus,

407
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,890
and the youth of our schoolmates and the days spent with them.

408
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,490
You're making me want to have a braised pork rib

409
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,090
and get back my youth now.

410
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,100
I stayed in the meditation room for so many days.

411
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,980
I did nothing but sit in meditation and drink tea.

412
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,240
I feel like I were almost ten years older.

413
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,180
Do you want me to take you to the canteen

414
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,740
and ask the lady working there to give us more braised pork ribs?

415
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
I need three more braised pork ribs.

416
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,290
Listen.

417
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,970
I've just

418
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,320
received a notice.

419
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,980
On November 25,

420
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,980
the school will hold

421
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,500
the Hanfu Exhibition.

422
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,460
Every club

423
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,230
needs to

424
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,920
present a show

425
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,180
about Hanfu, the traditional Chinese clothing.

426
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,040
The training makes me exhausted.

427
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,330
And I have to learn the lessons I skipped during the training in the mountain.

428
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,330
I don't have time.

429
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,580
Right.

430
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,300
I haven't sent

431
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,820
the face masks the girls ordered to them.

432
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,470
I don't want to spend time rehearsing for the Hanfu show.

433
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,120
Let those who want to do it do it.

434
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,170
If I don't begin to study hard from now on,

435
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,570
I'll fail my tests again.

436
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,170
If Qi Tian doesn't participate in the show,

437
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,030
I won't either.

438
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,550
Wait.

439
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,770
Let me tell you.

440
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,050
In my childhood, apart from watching my grandpa do shot put,

441
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,180
I also enjoyed watching TV shows and movies.

442
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,640
So my second biggest dream

443
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,480
is to be a director.

444
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,380
So,

445
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,060
you can take this opportunity

446
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,090
to help me fulfill my dream of being a director.

447
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,370
No.

448
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,720
I'll pay you.

449
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,730
Hello, Director.

450
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
Hello, Director. Hello, Director.

451
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,450
Look, it’s Xue Yiran.
