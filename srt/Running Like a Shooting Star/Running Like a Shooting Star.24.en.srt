♫My dream is always there♫

185
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,590
Great!

186
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,120
What did I say?

187
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,980
Xue Yiran definitely can make it!

188
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,720
Bravo!

189
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,520
♫Failure is better than boredom♫

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
We won!

191
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,510
We won! We won!

192
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,350
Coach!

193
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,930
♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

194

We won!

195

Coach!

196
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
We won!

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
We won!

♫That innocent child is still here♫

♫It's reflected in my head♫

Dad.

201
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,060
You worthless piece of junk!

202
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,690
After training for so long,

203
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,820
you still haven't achieved anything!

204
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,880
Sir,

205
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,990
Shen Ming is your son.

206
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,380
He's injured now.

207
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,620
Why didn't anyone else get injured?

208
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,880
Why were you the only one who got injured?

209
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,780
Look at the camera.

210
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,110
Okay, look here.

211
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,330
One, two, three.

212
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
Okay.

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,630
Congratulations.

214
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,160
Good job.

215
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,020
Senior.

216
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,100
Congratulations on your graduation!

217
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,560
Thank you.

218
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,330
Congratulations!

219
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,530
Why are there so many people here today?

220
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,850
They didn't make it

221
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,840
to the graduation ceremony because they were

222
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
participating in the competition.

223
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,830
So it's a supplementary one for them.

224
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,240
Thank you.

225
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,900
Senior, will we see you again?

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,660
Yes.

227
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,160
I'll come back often to see you.

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,620
Bye.

229
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,370
Senior, bye.

230
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,030
-Thank you.
-Senior, see you.

231
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,480
Usually, you don't care about

232
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
these girls at all.

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,790
Hypocritical.

234
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,360
How am I hypocritical?

235
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,790
Your alma mater has nurtured you for so many years.

236
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,850
After graduation,

237
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,500
shouldn't you come back to see your teachers,

238
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,020
coach,

239
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,950
and classmates?

240
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,070
You're heartless.

241
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,470
If there weren't a camera here,

242
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,470
I really would want to

243
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,830
pin you down and beat you up.

244
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,910
You can try.

245
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,780
Members of the track and field team, take a picture together.

246
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,590
-Ziji, Yiran.
-You're here too.

247
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,650
Congratulations.

248
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,260
-You graduated.
-You graduated.

249
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,430
-Coach.
-Coach. Coach.

250
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,420
Coach, please come here.

251
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,220
Congratulations.

252
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,620
Coach.

253
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,990
Thank you, Coach.

254
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,320
Yiran.

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,700
Come on.

256
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,390
Three, two, one.

257
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,240
Look.

258
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,940
Our Qian

259
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,230
finally got a shot put medal.

260
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,150
This medal is really valuable.

261
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,680
If it were last year,

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,510
his result

263
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,470
could've gotten a gold medal.

264
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,030
Mom.

265
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,550
A silver medal is just a silver medal.

266
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,120
Don't exaggerate.

267
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,080
Fine.

268
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,730
It means your hard work didn't go to waste.

269
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,870
So, in the future,

270
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,190
can you put down your shot put

271
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,990
and learn to do business with me?

272
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,240
No.

273
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,100
No. I want gold medals.

274
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
I want lots and lots of gold medals.

275
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,230
What?

276
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,830
Are you going to keep doing shot put?

277
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Didn't we have a deal?

278
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,280
Didn't you say you wouldn't do

279
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
-shot put after graduation?
-Mom.

280
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,270
You brat!

281
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,310
This brat.

282
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,530
The dorm without you

283
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,840
is too quiet.

284
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,430
Well,

285
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,660
aren't you going to my place to hang out?

286
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,660
Why should I go to your place?

287
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,870
Isn't your foot

288
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,960
already healed?

289
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,840
I feel like,

290
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,550
since the last intense match,

291
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,160
it's not as good as before.

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,510
Keep pretending.

293
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,640
But it was you who said

294
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,650
you'd take care of me until I fully recovered.

295
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,030
I bet you just want

296
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,030
a free physiotherapist, don't you?

297
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,420
Don't think of me like that.

298
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,590
Am I really that shallow?

299
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,310
I have dates to attend to.

300
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,040
Dates?

301
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,110
Take me along

302
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,400
to your dates.

303
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,630
Take you?

304
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,440
Then how can I go on dates?

305
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,300
The girls would run away with you.

306
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,240
We might become friends,

307
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,500
or maybe

308
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,470
enemies.

309
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,510
As for our relationship,

310
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,670
I'll take it

311
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,590
step by step.

312
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,420
By this time next year,

313
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,390
we should be opponents on the field, right?

314
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,070
You are

315
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,750
too impatient.

316
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,550
But, indeed.

317
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,990
If it performs well.

318
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,610
Wang once told me in the meditation room,

319
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,300
the moment of starting

320
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,910
is like the instant a match is lit.

321
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
It's not hearing a sound first

322
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,760
and then starting to run,

323
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,030
but in that instant,

324
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,680
a spark of thought ignites,

325
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,150
and it's the whole body's

326
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,320
reaction.

327
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,680
I think I understand.

328
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,110
They say

329
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,940
if you run after you hear the starting gun,

330
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,830
it's too late.

331
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,870
Then he told me,

332
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,020
the moment a spark of thought ignites

333
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,070
is called an instant.

334
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,240
All things,

335
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,320
flesh and blood,

336
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,470
our entire lives

337
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,950
in the river of the universe,

338
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,040
are just an instant.

339
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,270
When we fall,

340
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,640
will it be dark

341
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,240
or bright?

342
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,920
Wang's conversation with you

343
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,030
is too profound.

344
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,150
Indeed.

345
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,440
In the blink of an eye,

346
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,920
life is but an instant.

347
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,390
But I believe

348
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,270
you're the brightest star.

349
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,600
They say an instant is eternity.

350
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,110
Then,

351
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,700
what is eternity?

352
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,350
Exactly.

353
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,470
What is eternity?

354
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,200
It may be a heartfelt smile,

355
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,680
a moment when one faces fear

356
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,670
yet

357
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,089
still trembles forward,

358
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,750
the scattered white dust

359
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,550
when one makes a powerful throw,

360
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,359
the courage to do

361
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,020
what one knows is impossible,

362
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,990
the moment when each of us gives our all.

363
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,460
They...

364
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,850
quietly glide through the night sky,

365
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,920
emitting

366
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,880
faint light.

367
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,070
[Wishing everyone's efforts can be rewarded, and that they have the courage to compete with destiny]

368
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,070
[Firmly believing that love and justice in our hearts can grasp the fleeting shooting stars of life]

369
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,760
[Five years later]

370
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,150
Let's order more when they arrive.

371
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,950
Okay.

372
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,080
They are here.

373
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,350
Hello, long time no see.

374
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,990
Long time no see.

375
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,990
Come, have a seat.

376
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,560
Have a seat.

377
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,870
They are so sweet.

378
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,120
Long time no see.

379
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,390
Long time no see.

380
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,320
Long time no see.

381
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,800
You two are so happy and sweet.

382
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
Where is Qi Tian?

383
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Why isn't he here?

384
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,470
I'm still here,

385
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,500
yet you are talking about Qi Tian.

386
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,680
Let me tell you.

387
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,480
I've been babysitting all day.

388
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,830
I'm exhausted.

389
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,330
Okay, sister.

390
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,880
Shen Ming,

391
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,920
how old is your son?

392
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
He's one year old.

393
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,450
What do you plan for him in the future?

394
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,660
He can do whatever he wants.

395
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,830
Isn't that good?

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,080
Qi Tian must be quite busy now, right?

397
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,360
Yes.

398
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,200
He's competing everywhere.

399
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,760
His performance this year is particularly good.

400
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,470
Yes.

401
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,550
His performance at these events this year

402
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,880
has been skyrocketing.

403
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,600
You guys have no idea how thick

404
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
his thighs are

405
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,800
and how well-shaped

406
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
his buttocks are.

407
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,820
He's indeed different after he got into the national team.

408
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,530
What about Xue Yiran?

409
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,640
Why hasn't he come yet?

410
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,570
This guy should be even busier now.

411
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,750
At that time,

412
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,910
he must have had a tough time.

413
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,550
Yeah.

414
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,880
He had already broken through the barrier of 10.50 seconds.

415
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,590
What a pity.

416
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,240
What about He, the famous writer?

417
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,960
What has he been busy with lately?

418
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,820
He just told me he'll be here soon.

419
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,390
Let's watch TV for a while.

420
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,050
We'll start when they arrive.

421
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,150
Honestly,

422
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,550
I think he's fine the way he is now.

423
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,070
Yeah, it suits him.

424
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,630
He used to be like this,

425
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,710
hypocritical

426
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,750
and greasy.

427
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,900
He often made some

428
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,760
pretentious mysterious smiles.

429
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,250
Don't even mention it.

430
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,000
I have several friends

431
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,590
who really like it when he's doing it.

432
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,040
They are completely infatuated with him.

433
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,640
I dare not even say I know him.

434
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
Xue Yiran

435
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,950
seems to have really lost

436
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,170
his passion for running.

437
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,670
Yeah.

438
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,620
If everything

439
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,180
he cares about will eventually be lost,

440
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,290
wouldn't he become

441
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,120
a perennial figure in the show business?

442
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,960
Why?

443
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,950
Because

444
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,390
he probably doesn't even care about

445
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,650
those things in the show business at all.

446
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,400
Over there, right?

447
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,840
Let's go.

448
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,470
Let's go.

449
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,750
Why did you two come here together?

450
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,950
He was

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,130
discussing business with me just now.

452
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,240
Come on.

453
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,110
Have a seat.

454
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

455
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,180
Long time no see,

456
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,030
Writer He.

457
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,290
Don't call me that.

458
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,790
I'm just an online writer.

459
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,190
It's not that dignified.

460
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,190
What business

461
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,090
were you two discussing just now?

462
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,740
He wants me to play a psychotic killer

463
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,610
from his novel.

464
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,910
He said it suits me.

465
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,270
Can you believe that?

466
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,140
Yes.

467
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,590
It makes sense.

468
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,680
It suits you.

469
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,330
You are a wolf

470
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,560
in sheep's clothing.

471
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,310
Ai Ziji,

472
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,790
have your muscles gone lax again

473
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,030
since you became the boss of a cosmetic clinic?

474
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,450
Should I give you a beating to tighten up your muscles?

475
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,580
He! He!

476
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,480
He, look at him.

477
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,270
Does he look like a pervert?

478
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,560
Yes, he does.

479
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,790
Such a pervert.

480
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,880
Pervert!

481
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:13,330

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,360

490
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,060
I was delayed by some matters in the team.

491
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,150
I bought the best 4 kilograms of beef here,

492
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,410
along with king crabs,

493
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,320
oysters,

494
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,220
and lobsters,

495
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,920
all of which are high-quality proteins.

496
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,490
Can we really finish them?

497
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,430
Why don't you come over

498
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,290
to eat and stay with me these days?

499
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,550
No, I can't.

500
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,850
I promised the team

501
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,910
that I would have one meal at your place.

502
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,110
I flew here specifically to take care of you during the competition.

503
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,750
The team's chef's food

504
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,950
can't compare to what I cook, right?

505
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,530
It's not good for me to always be treated specially like this.

506
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,330
This competition

507
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,260
is so important.

508
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
You must be under a lot of pressure.

509
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,550
Do they know what you like to eat

510
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,320
when you're feeling stressed and your stomach isn't comfortable?

511
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,560
They don't know.

512
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,110
But I have a mouth to tell them.

513
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,310
Even if you tell them,

514
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,430
will they be able to make it?

515
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,190
Besides,

516
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,230
can what they make

517
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,690
compare to what I can make?

518
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,630
Just let me contribute

519
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,820
to Chinese track-and-field.

520
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,190
My professional career

521
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,820
is over.

522
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,950
Do you know

523
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,470
how envious I am

524
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,640
of your current situation?

525
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,870
If you really have no choice,

526
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,950
you can call your coach and teammates over

527
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,870
to join us.

528
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,270
No.

529
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,690
You're a celebrity.

530
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,240
It would affect their mood before the race.

531
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,870
Why

532
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,110
are you being so heartless now?

533
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,300
You're just being unreasonable.

534
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,630
Well...

535
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,640
Two meals?

536
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,040
Okay.
