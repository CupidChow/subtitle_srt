Do you like running?

Qi Tian, Yiran,

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,710
I brought you midnight snacks.

Let's go.

11
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,800
Is something wrong with your feet?

12
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,310
Actually, I thought it looks strange when you walk

13
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,710
a few days ago.

14
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,140
But I couldn't verify it.

15
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,030
I watched your recent competition videos.

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,560
They confirmed my thought.

Ms. Luo, thank you for telling me.

I know

20
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,650
what you said.

21
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,990
The team doctor said I'll be fine after getting some rest.

22
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,770
Where are Fatty and Wang?

23
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,700
Still training?

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't think so.

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,820
I didn't see them on the track-and-field ground just now.

26
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,880
I heard they went to a friendly match in the district.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,950
A friendly match?

28
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,590
Why didn't they call me?

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,250
You started training not long ago,

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,380
Fatty is rich.

32
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,890
He even has a black card.

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,420
He can do whatever he wants.

34
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,829
Why does he want to be a shot-putter here?

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,380

Nowadays,

there aren't many people who love the shot put event.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,540
It's hard and tiring.

40
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,860
It doesn't attract

41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,370
much public attention either.

Of course.

Why doesn't he go home since he's hurt?

I don't need too much.

90

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,620
I'll keep practicing it

192
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,540
until I die.

193
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,020
So it's because of my dad.

194
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,220
He always wanted

195
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,880
to train me to be a shot-putter when I was little.

196
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,830
But I love pretty things.

197
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,430
I thought the shot was ugly.

198
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,580
But now,

199
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,810
you're into it.

200
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,330
Forget it.

201
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,740
I won't interfere again.

202
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,970
But remember,

203
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,060
I'll only allow you to do it before you graduate from college.

204
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,690
Besides,

205
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,590
you can't delay your studies.

206
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,300
Thank you, Mom.

207
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,150
Give me your hand.

208
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,420
Let me see.

209
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,740
It's fine. It'll heal.

210
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,820
Does it still hurt?

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,810
No.

Thank you for taking care of You Qian.

214
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,820
He looks good.

215
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,020
Madam, don't worry.

216
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,650
I made some soup for Fatty.

217
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,340
Fatty has fair skin. He inherited it from you, right?

218
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
You've taken good care of your skin.

219
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I've spent a lot of money on this.

220
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,920
I don't know how to thank you.

221
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,120

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,860
You are so thoughtful.

225
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,540
Madam,

226
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,780
please take the money back.

227
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,940
We're Fatty's friends.

228
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,700
We should take care of him.

229
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,640
I heard you bribed Fatty's roommates.

230
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,990
We're not like them.

Between money and You Qian,

236
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,810
you've chosen him.

It's great

238
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,700
he has sincere friends like you guys.

239
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,460
In the future,

240
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,380
just tell me if you need anything.

241
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,860
I have something to do.

242
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,720
I should leave.

243
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,380
Okay.

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:42,980
Bye.

Bye.

246
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,820
Bye, Madam.

247
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,000
What are you thinking?

248
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,240
Nothing.

249
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,020
You must be thinking

250
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,780
about the money in her wallet.

251
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,730
You are

252
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,020
really nice.

253
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,240
It would be better

254
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,210
if you don't have a mouth.

255
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,740
My mouth

256
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,820
is the essence of my facial features.

257
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,980
It's prominent.

258
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,140
I can't lose it.

259
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,460
Don't flatter yourself.

260
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,890
Isn't it typical of him?

261
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,780
Tell me,

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,330
do you envy a persistent person like Fatty?

263
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,810
He can give up money

264
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,780
for something he likes.

265
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,730
He can even

266
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,100
quarrel with his family.

267
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,590
It depends on how you define persistence.

268
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,540
If the final result is good,

269
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,290
that's persistence.

270
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,340
If nothing

271
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,750
is gained in the end,

272
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,390
that's just obsession.

273
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
But if we don't persist till the end,

274
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,160
how do we know if the result will be good or bad?

275
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,950
That's why it depends on the probability.

276
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,180
The probability of winning a medal

277
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,060
in a city-level shot put competition is relatively high.

278
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,850
But wouldn't this be too snobbish?

279
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,060
You work hard

280
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,620
because you know it'll be a good result?

281
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,410
I'm the son of a grocery shop owner.

282
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,530
It's natural for me

283
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
to be money-oriented and snobbish.

284
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,180
I understand.

285
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,740
Ordinary people

286
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,640
should prepare a way out for themselves.

287
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,710
Do the impossible.

288
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,460
This kind of life

289
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,660
is more challenging, right?

290
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,280
You won't see

291
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,690
the bravery you mentioned in me.

292
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Sometimes,

293
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,770
I really don't know

294
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,300
what kind of person you are.

295
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,690
What should we do?

296
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Sir.

297
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,180
How is Fatty?

298
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,100
Here.

299
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,770
This is the pig's feet cooked by my wife.

300
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,970
You are what you eat.

301
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,310
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,660
I fed Fatty something.

303
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,930
He's asleep now.

304
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,360
How did Fatty

305
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,890
hurt his hand?

306
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,060
Yesterday,

307
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,460
he took the first place in the first three rounds.

308
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,400
He was in a very good state.

309
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,780
I thought

310
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,490
Fatty would get the first medal

311
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,700
in his life.

312
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,109
But before the last three rounds,

313
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,220
Fatty wanted to go to the toilet.

314
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,380
He didn't come back after he left.

315
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,970
When I found him,

316
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,420
his hand was already injured.

317
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,310
His hand was stepped on by spikes.

318
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,640
They are so despicable.

319
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,980
This could

320
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,220
ruin the athlete's sports career.

321
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
I think someone from Huainan did it.

322
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,210
But

323
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,960
I didn't see his face clearly.

324
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,540
I only remember

325
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,030
there were many people in the registration office yesterday.

326
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,690
Later,

327
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,570
I found that my shoelaces were loose.

328
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,380
Can you recognize the person who stepped on you if you see him again?

329
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,420
I think so.

330
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,060
He has curly hair.

331
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,840
The spikes... are blue.

332
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,120
He hurt someone severely,

333
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,980
but he didn't even apologize.

334
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,530
Do you think

335
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,770
someone did it on purpose?

336
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,250
I don't think it's very likely.

337
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,410
It was just a small competition.

338
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,400
Everyone treated it as training.

339
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,020
It's not necessary to do this

340
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,010
to win the first place, right?

341
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,830
What if...

342
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,090
he did it to prevent Fatty

343
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,890
from participating in the autumn championships?

344
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,540

-Go!
-Go!

350
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,570
So this is what a track and field competition is like?

351
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,980
It's so exciting.

352
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,180
-Hurry!
-Go!

Run!

354

It's Xue Yiran.

355
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,860
Why is Xue Yiran here?

356
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,940
To make them embarrassed by defeating them?

357
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,210
Looks like so.

358
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,420
Professional athletes can't participate in such competitions, right?

359
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,370
That's right.

360
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,290
How does it feel to return to the track?

361
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,350
I feel nothing.

362
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,870
You have to work harder

363
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,080
to outshine me, a genius.

364
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,300
Qi Tian. Qi Tian?

365
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,240
Is it that hot?

366
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,850
Are you okay?

367
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,970
Cut the crap.

368
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,460
I have excessive internal heat. Is there a problem?

369
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Just look for him.

370
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,700
Okay.

371
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,450
Is that area for the people from Huainan?

372
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,450
He surpassed him!

373
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,380
Come on!

374
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,090
You're about to cross the finish line. Come on!

375
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,920
I think I have found him.

376
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,760
Are you sure it was him?

377
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,450
I'm sure.

378
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,660
Then why are we still standing here?

379
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,570
Let's go.

380
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,040
You are so happy after hurting someone.

381
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,140
Come on!

382
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,180
-Go!
-Go!

383
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,080
Come on!

384
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,070
Who are you guys?

385
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,410
It's none of your business.

386
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,270
We're here for the guy next to you.

387
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,580
Me?

388
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,430
Did you hurt my teammate yesterday?

389
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,850
Your teammate?

390
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,480
Well, who are you guys?

391
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,410
Why should I answer your question?

392
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,110
I'm the chief coach of the Xinghe Track and Field Team.

393
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,640
My team member You Qian said

394
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,530
you hurt him by stepping on him

395
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,090
at about 3:20 p.m. yesterday.

396
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,830
Oh no, Captain.

397
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,330
I think I did step on something yesterday.

398
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,410
But I was in a hurry,

399
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,030
so I went to He's place first.

400
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,740
It's all your fault,

401
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,580
you jinx.

402
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,360
I think...

403
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,550
I think it was me.

404
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,100
What's the big deal?

405
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,970
It's just a finger.

406
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,150
We can pay the medical expenses.

407
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,040
What kind of attitude is this?

408
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,320
Fatty can afford the medical expenses himself.

409
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,090
He can't participate in any competition over the next three months.

410
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,130
Do you know that?

411
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,060
He got very good grades this time,

412
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,770
so you don't want him

413
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,050
to participate in the autumn championships, right?

414
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,100
That's not true.

415
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,840
Huainan's athletes who participated in this time's competition

416
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,300
are second-tier members.

417
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,310
Do you ignorant people

418
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,260
think you're great

419
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,320
just because you won the first place in a friendly match?

420
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,120
Really?

421
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,260
I remember

422
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,750
you are the fastest runner in Huainan.

423
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,260
Why has Huainan changed its standards

424
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,320
for first-tier and second-tier athletes these years?

425
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,790
You...

426
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,600
You are Xue Yiran?

427
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,880
Xue Yiran?

428
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,350
Why is he here?

429
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,990
Is he here for the first place?

430
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,890
I'm here to lead the team. Is there a problem?

431
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,970
Except you,

432
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,540
everyone in Xinghe is trash.

433
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,080
You trash.

434
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,770
Why are you here

435
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,380
instead of being in the garbage station?

436
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,840
You deserve it if you really were stepped on.

437
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,130
Really?

438
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,260
I think

439
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,030
you are the ignorant one.

440
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,760
I don't need to compete with you myself.

441
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
The three of them from Xinghe

442
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,020
are strong enough to compete with you for the first place.

443
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,780
Xue Yiran,

444
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,620
you can't participate in the competition.

445
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,750
Stop pretending.

446
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,470
You...

447
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,290
Listen,

448
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,170
after the competition is over,

449
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,620
you should not only pay

450
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,280
You Qian's medical expenses,

451
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,970
but also apologize to us

452
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,680
for what you just said.

453
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,420
Sir,

454
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,820
let us go.

455
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:04,840
[Registration Office]

456
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,500
I... I...

457
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,700
Come on.

458
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,420
You came to sign up

459
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,620
when the competition is about to start.

460
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,620
Sorry.

461
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,680
I'm old.

462
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,430
-Fine.
-I have a bad memory.

463
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,900
Why do you have this kind of thing?

464
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,860
I wanted to give it to you

465
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,230
when the autumn championships start.

466
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,840
Yiran,

467
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,530
this is my size.

468
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,630
I didn't even have an official uniform

469
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,390
in the basketball team.

470
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,940
You planned to make me

471
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,140
participate in the competition today long ago, right?

472
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,620
I really should be very cautious.

473
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm not that cunning.

474
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,420
This

475
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,740
is for Fatty

476
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,690
and friendship.

477
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,700
Men's 100 meters preliminaries are about to begin.

478
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,100
Where is Qi Tian?

479
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,210
It's not funny.

480
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,880
It's not funny at all.

481
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,870
It's so boring.

482
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,340
Hey.

483
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,230
Where are you going?

484
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,350
On your marks!

485
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Set!
