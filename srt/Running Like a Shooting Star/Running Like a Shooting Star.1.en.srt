00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,830
It's really going to kill people to carry things upstairs.

195
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,860
Hey,

196
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,580
let me help you.

197
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,060
Thank you.

198
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
These are all yours?

199
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,210
Yes.

200
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,860
Dude.

201
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,840
Are you okay?

202
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,600
Let me do it.

203
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm okay.

204
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,860
I think I'm anemic again.

205
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,690
When I was young,

206
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,180
my family was poor.

207
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,740
It's okay.

208
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,020
Let me help you.

209
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,460
Let me help you.

210
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,050
I didn't expect that you and I

211
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,860
are in the same dorm.

212
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,220
Fate.

213
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,220
Fate.

214
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,580
Don't worry.

215
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,210
I'll take care of you.

216
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,830
My name is Wu Tianfu.

217
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,450
Tianfu.

218
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,020
Actually, during the time you took care of me,

219
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,720
I've become stronger.

220
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,060
In the future,

221
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,740
I can take care of myself.

222
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,130
Really?

223
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,690
Then join the Basketball Club with me.

224
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,610
Let's be the next James together.

225
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,900
Like Kobe,

226
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,660
let's see the campus at 4 a.m.

227
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,100
We won't give up

228
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,340
until we're worn out.

229
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,060
There's no

230
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,960
"we."

231
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,490
Tianfu,

232
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,780
I have no dream.

233
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,300
And I hate sweating so much.

234
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,980
Plus, I know nothing

235
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,580
about sports.

236
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,500
By the way, Qi Tian,

237
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,750
in this school, you must at least join a club to get the credits.

238
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,550
Which club are you going to join?

239
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,940
Is there a Flirting Club?

240
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,540
Even you, a person who has "hermit" on his forehead,

241
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,670
signed up for a club?

242
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,970
I'm a senior member of the Go Club.

243
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,050
Qi Tian.

244
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,220
You don't have any hobbies anyway.

245
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,500
Why don't you join the Basketball Club?

246
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,060
Become the national champion with me.

247
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,010
-Let me tell you…
-Stop.

248
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,340
Do you know what is the least busy club

249
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,740
in our school?

250
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,430
If I'm correct, it's the Track and Field Club.

251
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,420
Because

252
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,770
it doesn’t recruit students publicly.

253
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,480
And

254
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,120
there should only be two students there.

255
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,300
It can't be.

256
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,450
Your natural enemy is not in the Track and Field Club,

257
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,460
because that club is too small

258
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,930
for a genius like him.

259
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,950
How can he be counted as a genius?

260
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,780
Let me say it again.

261
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,150
He is not my natural enemy.

262
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,160
He doesn't deserve it.

263
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,620
Pass!

264
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,090
This way.

265
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,230
This school is good in every aspect

266
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,420
except that you must join a club and get the credits.

267
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,540
So annoying.

268
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,650
There are people like Wu Tianfu everywhere.

269
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,090
They're all so pumped.

270
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,980
Hurry up.

271
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
Go to the left.

272
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,550
That fat guy is really something.

273
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,700
Is the Track and Field Club

274
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,030
really the least busy club in this school?

275
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,860
Excuse me.

276
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,800
Do you know where the Track and Field Club is?

277
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,330
He didn't move at all.

278
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,060
His arm strength is astonishing.

279
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,200
Come with me.

280
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:47,890
Fatty!

281
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,440
Come and be our goalkeeper.

282
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,540
No.

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,530
I like a shot put.

284
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,550
This kind of captivating smell comes from

285
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,870
stewing top-class beef tallow

286
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,330
with Sichuan peppers and fermented soya beans.

287
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,340
Where is it from?

288
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,020
Fatty.

289
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,060
You're back.

290
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,310
I just sliced the Wagyu beef.

291
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,290
And you brought someone back?

292
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,700
Hello.

293
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,020
Hey,

294
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,420
your teeth are so uneven.

295
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,410
Why don't you wear a brace?

296
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,410
Maybe

297
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,490
the wind disheveled my teeth.

298
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,120
Why are there so many wrinkles on your face when you smile?

299
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,820
You must have neglected to apply the sunscreen and moisturizing cream.

300
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,400
Apply it before going out.

301
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,490
I've missed a Seven.

302
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh no.

303
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,410
I've lost all the beans.

304
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,350
I quit.

305
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,080
Ai Ziji.

306
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,330
How is the hot pot?

307
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,720
Who are you?

308
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,540
It doesn't matter who I am.

309
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,620
I heard that the Track and Field Club

310
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,140
matches my values.

311
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,100
Young people nowadays

312
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,380
can't talk properly now.

313
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,820
Fine.

314
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,500
Let's have the hot pot first.

315
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Then, we'll talk.

316
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:53,980
Thank you.

317
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,540
My name is You Qian.

318
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,040
I'm a sophomore this year.

319
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,960
Hello.

320
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,930
He

321
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,210
is the only one who's training seriously

322
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,740
in our Track and Field Club.

323
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,569
Come on.

324
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,619
Come on.

325
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,270
What about you?

326
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,670
I'm Ai Ziji.

327
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,420
I'm a senior.

328
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,579
Hello.

329
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,890
He is

330
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,369
just like his name.

331
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,540
He loves himself.

332
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,329
I've never seen a man

333
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,910
who loves skincare so much.

334
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,940
My major is biotechnology.

335
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,980
My dream

336
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,420
is to make our family's beauty salon

337
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,680
the largest cosmetic medical institution in the country.

338
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,690
Excuse me,

339
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,350
what project do you do

340
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,900
in the Track and Field Club?

341
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,960
Is that important?

342
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,030
I'm going to graduate soon.

343
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,410
I just need two more credits

344
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,740
and leave quickly.

345
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,770
Ai Ziji is right.

346
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll retire in two years.

347
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,300
Training is tiring.

348
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,420
It's better to cook something delicious

349
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,680
to nourish our health.

350
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,410
Wait a minute.

351
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,610
Are you the coach?

352
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,030
You don't train?

353
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,830
Just call me Wang.

354
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,760
You can come to me if you want to play Fighting the Landlord.

355
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,440
We have the same views on the world and life.

356
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,120
Coach,

357
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,540
I want to join the Track and Field club.

358
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,010
We can become friends.

359
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,140
What project do you plan to sign up for?

360
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,570
Of course…

361
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,030
for Fighting the Landlord and skincare.

362
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Welcome to the Track and Field Club.

363
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,700
Cheers!

364
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,020
Come on.

365
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,970
Come on.

366
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,170
Thank you, Coach.

367
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,320
Here.

368
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,400
Congratulations

369
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,260
on becoming a new member of our Track and Field Club.

370
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Thank you, Coach.

371
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,110
Are you having a hot pot?

372
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,490
Do you mind

373
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,780
giving me a bowl and a pair of chopsticks?

374
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,820
You...

375
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,150
What are you doing here?

376
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,210
Coach.

377
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,900
I want to come back to the Track and Field Club.

378
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,510
You can run 100 meters in less than 10.3 seconds easily.

379
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,060
Why do you want to come to our petty Track and Field Club?

380
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,860
Guru,

381
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,730
no one can train you.

382
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,570
I know.

383
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,960
We are all idle people.

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,930
An outstanding athlete like you is not welcome here.

385
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,190
I know.

386
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,450
Since you are so idle,

387
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,380
everyone can join.

388
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,290
It won't matter

389
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,570
if I join.

390
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,140
You're really a pervert.

391
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,420
You're not even welcome,

392
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,330
but you still insist on joining.

393
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,430
I'm just as stubborn as this.

394
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
Coach,

395
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,020
this is my application form.

396
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,690
Xue Yiran,

397
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,300
come out.

398
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,650
What exactly do you want,

399
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,340
coming back like this?

400
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,920
I didn't expect

401
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,060
the person who sticks to the last minute

402
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,980
to be you.

403
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,020
Did they know each other?

404
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,970
I don't know.

405
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,620
I've never seen

406
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,220
Ziji had such an expression.

407
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,150
He's always laughing and joking.

408
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,520
He's only focused on health care.

409
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,980
Why is he so serious today?

410
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,100
I guess they were teammates.

411
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,700
Teammates?

412
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,980
Although Ai Ziji is like this,

413
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,940
I've seen his result.

414
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,290
It's second only to Xue Yiran's.

415
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,450
If they used to be teammates,

416
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,420
shouldn't they greet each other

417
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,740
when they meet again?

418
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,750
I don't know what happened between them,

419
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,660
but

420
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,820
it must be related to the reason why I came here.

421
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,670
I stay

422
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,890
because this club is idle.

423
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,510
I get to do what I want.

424
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,270
What about running?

425
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,620
You don't think

426
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,750
I still have a dream about running, do you?

427
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,290
I'll have to let you down.

429
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,600
Like all the other seniors,

430
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,180
I am busy finding a job after graduation

431
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
and finding a way out for the future.

432
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,430
Unlike you,

433
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,370
Superstar Xue.

434
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,090
You have a bright future.

435
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,700
What a pity.

436
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,430
In this world,

437
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,810
not many people can make a living by running.

438
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,190
But you…

439
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,680
It's been three years.

440
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,320
What on earth do you want

441
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,590
by coming back now?

442
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,980
Three years ago,

443
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,390
there was a member of the team

444
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,410
called Fei Zhe.

445
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,760
He fell on the track

446
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,060
due to a heart attack.

447
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,220
Although

448
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,380
he had an inborn heart problem,

449
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,990
and thus his death

450
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,360
had nothing to do with the school,

451
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,740
it still stirred up a big problem.

452
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,760
From then on, the track and field club

453
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,820
disbanded.

454
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,450
The chief coach resigned.

455
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,780
I was the new coach who replaced him.

456
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
For a long time,

457
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,010
I really hated you.

458
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,380
Almost all the boys

459
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,980
thought that I was different

460
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,780
and that I was a sissy who loved skincare.

461
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,840
They all bullied me

462
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,560
and played pranks on me.

463
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
He was the only one

464
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,910
who was willing to make friends with me,

465
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,920
but you took him away.

466
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,740
I know his death

467
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,560
was not related to you directly,

468
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,180
but if it weren't for you,

469
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,990
would he have trained so feverishly that he even died?

470
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,260
You hate me.

471
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,100
It's okay.

472
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,830
People like you are really annoying.

473
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,820
You always make people yearn

474
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,240
and want to pursue something.

475
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,400
You make people forget that they are just ordinary people.

476
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,580
And that person

477
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,500
paid too huge a price

478
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,300
for being ordinary.
