when he steps onto the field?

or the determination to win.

121
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,060

as long as there is a competition,

126

I'd bring them with me.

127
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,140
I always think

128
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,120
I can show him around

129

and let him see more in this way.

130

I think

131
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,510
I can run faster later.

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,000
Wu Tianfu will be the first runner.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,900
I'll be the second runner.

146
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,830
Ai Ziji will be the third runner.

147
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,690

154
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,460
Maybe the coach wants to save our strength.

155

Everyone knows

156
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,890

157
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,090
What's there to hide?

158
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,660
Let's obey the coach's order.

159

160
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,410
I'm counting on you to make it to the finals.

Let's go.

162
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,040
Why doesn't Xue Yiran participate at this critical moment?

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,300
I also want to know why.

164
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,210
What happened?

165
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,220

166
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,480
come to the wrong race?

167
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,520
Could it be that he's an all-rounder?

168
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,420
Could it be that Xinghe's coach has noticed it too?

169
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,340
Shengling's Zeng Shixing is not on the track either.

170
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,210
Could it be...

171
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,750
both coaches are saving their strength?

172
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,630
You're leaving?

173
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,370
You don't want to participate in the 4 x 100 m relay race?

174
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,300
If I can't even win in the 100 m race,

175
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,830
what's the point of participating in the 4 x 100 m relay race?

176
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,070
I thought Xing would participate

177
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,400
to compete with Xinghe.

178
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,810
You performed well in the past

179
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,740
even without me and Xing.

180
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,580
So don't panic

181
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,240
just because Xing won't participate this time.

182
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,590
Our opponent this time

183
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,850
is not Shenglin,

184
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,270
but ourselves.

185
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,880
So

186
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,500
don't make any mistake.

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,380
Leave the final part to me.

188
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,150
Shenglin is the best!

189
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,660
-Go!
-Go!

190
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,620
Today's final event is about to begin.

191
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,230
Track One: North China University.

192
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,810
Track Two: Huainan University.

193
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,310
Track Three: Xinghe University.

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,260
Track Four: Agriculture and Forestry University.

195
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,970
Track Five: Shenglin University.

196
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,660
On your marks!

197
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,790
Set!

198
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,020
-Go!
-Go!

199
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,100
Come on, boys!

200
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,640
-Go!
-Go!

201
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,180
Go, Wu Tianfu!

202
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,150
Go!

203
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,810
Hurry!

204
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,660
This is the first time I see such a fat guy

205
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,780
in a track event.

206
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,340
Fatty is still fast

207
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,600
on the football field.

208
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,860
Fatty, run faster!

209
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,260
-Huainan, go!
-Huainan!

210
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,230
Forget what I said.

211
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,110
Sorry, Fatty.

212
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,540
I've rested for long.

213
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,650
It's finally my turn to run.

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,860
Ziji!

215
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,650
-Ziji, come on!
-Ziji, come on!

216
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,030
Cool, Ziji!

217
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,810
Is he Ziji?

218
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,660
His hair is too ethereal.

219
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,700
He's definitely the neatest among stinky men

220
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,250
and the manliest among all the neat men.

221
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,890
When the race is over,

222
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,100
I'll ask him what shampoo he uses.

223
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll go with you later.

224
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,330
Come on, Ai Ziji!

225
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,380
Be worthy of the title I gave you.

226
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,020
What a wonderful game!

227
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,500
Frizzle.

228
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,460
Hold tight!

229
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,470
Come on!

230
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,810
[Men's 100 meters preliminaries of the Spring Track and Field Tournament]

231
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,670
We made it to the finals.

232
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,800
Do our best in the finals, guys!

233
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,520
-Go!
-Go!

234
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,770
I knew we could definitely make it to the finals.

235
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,100
But I didn't expect you to perform so well.

236
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,490
Today is a perfect day.

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,310
Qi Tian won the first place in the preliminary round.

238
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,470
Besides, I set my personal record.

239
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,480
We also made it to the finals

240
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,880
of the 4 x 100 m relay race.

241
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,090
I can't wait

242
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,700
to watch the game tomorrow.

243
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,680
Who would have thought I could participate?

244
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,470
Sir, you are amazing.

245
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,020
I made the best of a loser.

246
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,960
Sorry. It was a slip of the tongue.

247
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,900
I made the most of everyone.

248
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,780
I made the most of everyone.

249
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,260
Everyone,

250
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,560
our coach said

251
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,000
in future competitions,

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,110
as long as I'm qualified,

253
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,570
he'll let me participate.

254
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,570
So, thank you.

255
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,350
If it weren't for you,

256
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,220
I might have

257
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,710
given up fighting for a chance today.

258
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,940
You are the best sprinter

259
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,090
in your team.

260
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,970
No need to belittle yourself.

261
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,330
After I go back later, I'll continue to practice

262
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,660
to prepare for the relay finals tomorrow.

263
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,020
Enough.

264
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,010
Stop practicing.

265
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,690
The competition is tomorrow.

266
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,820
Today,

267
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
go relax yourselves.

268
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,180
Yes.

269
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,150
I suggest

270
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,860
we should have a bath tonight

271
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,320
in my family's bathhouse.

272
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,950
I'll treat you to a massage.

273
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,480
I think it's a good idea.

274
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
Last time,

275
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,760
Tianfu didn't give us many bath coupons.

276
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
He only gave one to each of us.

277
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,180
I...

278
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,800
I didn't have many.

279
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,720
It's my fault.

280
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,210
I'll tell my family

281
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,940
to ask the best massage therapists to wait for us.

282
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,940
Sometimes,

283
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,880
don't shoulder everything by yourself.

284
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,630
Thank you, Sir.

285
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,560
Xue Yiran,

286
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,770
is the institution offering laser treatment for scar removal

287
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,730
I recommended to you useless?

288
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,670
Why are there still so many scars on your back?

289
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,579
They

290
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,099
don't matter

291
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,170
to me anymore.

292
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,970
You have a pretty face,

293
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,150
but you

294
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,840
don't care about details.

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,130
Speaking of a pretty face,

296
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,180
no one is more handsome

297
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
than Ai Ziji, who has tight muscles.

298
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,690
That's right.

299
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,220
I didn't expect

300
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,000
that I could be so passionate.

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,380
After graduation,

302
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,820
don't ask me to run again.

303
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,300
The training is really tiring, and I have to be exposed to the sun.

304
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
But you will

305
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,210
remember this forever, right?

306
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,860
Yes.

307
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,940
Maybe I'll never

308
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
be more focused or hard-working than now in this life.

309
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,380
Tianfu,

310
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,910
what do you plan to do after graduation?

311
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm just a freshman.

312
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,240
Don't you think it's too early

313
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,480
to talk about graduation now?

314
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,390
Look at you.

315
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,070
We're just having a bath,

316
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
relaxing ourselves,

317
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,220
and chatting.

318
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,910
Right? Don't be so nervous.

319
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,440
Just say whatever you want.

320
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,840
It depends.

321
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,090
If I can make some achievements

322
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,690
in college,

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,970
I'll find a job

324
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,760
related to running in the future.

325
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,000
If I can't,

326
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,690
I'll just find an ordinary job.

327
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll cheer for Qi Tian and Yiran

328
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,000
in front of the TV.

329
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,560
How do you know

330
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Yiran and I

331
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,210
can persist in running?

332
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I don't know.

333
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,810
He

334
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,560
just thinks

335
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,610
it will be a pity

336
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,980
if either of you

337
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,360
gives up.

338
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,920
Why are you worried?

339
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,400
Xue Yiran even refused

340
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,320
Canyu's agent.

341
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
Why would he give up running?

342
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,080
It's just that

343
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,980
I don't have a free cosmetics endorser anymore.

344
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,840
It makes me angry.

345
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,920
Why do you think

346
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll endorse your products free of charge?

347
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,550
I'll give you a 20% discount at most.

348
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,490
You are so mean.

349
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,880
Who begged me

350
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,090
to establish this relay team back then?

351
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,380
What are you doing?

352
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,410
Miao.

353
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,760
We're off work. We're leaving first.

354
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,490
Can you send your friends back?

355
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Okay, I have a key.

356
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,030
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

357
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,100
-Thank you.
-Okay.

358
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
You can stay here for as long as you want.

359
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,440
There...

360
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,070
are sauna and steam rooms over there.

361
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's go back to school

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
after taking another bath, okay?

363
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,160
Tomorrow's competition

364
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
is a hard nut to crack.

365
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,960
I don't understand you.

366
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,440
You can live in your dorm.

367
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
Why do you want to rent a house outside?

368
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Do you have much more money than you need?

369
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,560
It's inconvenient for a mature man

370
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
to live in a dorm.

371
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,920
You?

372
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,160
You?

373
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,050
A mature man?

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,800
What?

375
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,540
You're not convinced?

376
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,200
Your abdominal external oblique muscle

377
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,360
and serratus anterior are quite ordinary.

378
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,890
You're showing off your muscles in front of me.

379
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,290
Aren't you embarrassed?

380
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,210
Why did you come?

381
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,680
Xinghe made it to the finals of the 4 x 100 m relay race.

382
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,480
So?

383
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,700
What does it have to do with me?

384
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
Well,

385
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,080
I don't know

386
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,530
why you are angry.

387
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,170
You lost to Qi Tian in the preliminary round. So what?

388
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,240
What?

389
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,210
Do you think I would like you

390
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,400
if you won?

391
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,840
You think if Qi Tian lost,

392
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,900
I would be with you right away, right?

393
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,160
You don't know women at all.

394
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,840
Even if I'm with you,

395
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,680
can you guarantee you won't lose forever?

396
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,280
You think if you lose, I'll run away with someone else right away?

397
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,960
Shixing,

398
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,630
we can't judge a person

399
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,360
according to the result of a competition.

400
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,080
Besides, I won't change my feelings for you

401
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,010
just because of your performance.

402
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,160
You'll always

403
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,390
be my most important friend and family.

404
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,230
Xue Yiran will participate

405
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,560
in the finals tomorrow.

406
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,280
The juniors in the team really hope

407
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,650
you can lead them to compete with Xinghe.

408
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,050
Xinghe's team is really strong this year.

409
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,920
Defeat them with your strength.

410
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,210
Who wants to be your friend?

411
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,560
♫Can we go back to the past?♫

412
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
Don't go too far.

413
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,680
♫Sometimes I want to hide the courage that I pretend to have♫

414
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,160
You should be happy that I came to see you.

415
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,210
You don't want to be friends with me, right?

416
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,370
♫Not saying anything against my will♫

417
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,120
Fine, I'm leaving.

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,840
Don't.

419
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,490
♫I want to continue♫

420
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,720
Have you had dinner?

421
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,360
Recently, I learned

422
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
to cook fried rice with chicken. It's very delicious.

423
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,430
♫Can I reverse the time?♫

424
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'll cook for you.

425
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,770
You know how to cook fried rice?

426
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,280
♫Who gets hurt because of my temper?♫

427
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,000
Is it edible?

428
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,460
I'll take a rain check.

429
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,390
♫Bystanders are indifferent♫

430
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,530
♫I don't want to hear what they say♫

431
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,970
Why is it not edible?

432
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,790
♫They talked about their destinations♫

433
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,130
♫They said they had unparalleled adventures♫

434
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,790
♫They said I should give up♫

435
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,080
♫I don't want to care♫

436
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,000
♫They said where my face should turn to♫

437
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,120
That little brat has really grown up.

438
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,520
♫They said where I should look at♫

439
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,930
♫They have many principles♫

440
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,210
Calm down.

441
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,540
♫Ignoring how far the dreams are♫

442
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,680
It won't be a problem

443
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,650
to handle Zeng Shixing.

444
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,900
♫They said where I should put my hand♫

445
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,690
♫They said no secret should be in my heart♫

446
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,000
You have a key, right?

447
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,920
I have a gate key.

448
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,680
It's in my bag.

449
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,210
What should we do now?

450
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,360
We need a cellphone to ask someone to open the gate.

451
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,220
The cellphones are in the locker.

452
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm sorry.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,040
It's my fault.

454
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
It's all my fault.

455
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,740
Getting close to me

456
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,460
would always bring bad luck.

457
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,300
Don't think like that.

458
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,520
It's okay.

459
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
Back then, when I went

460
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,130
to study medical cosmetology,

461
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,320
in order to save money,

462
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
I specially spent one night in the bathhouse.

463
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,980
I slept very well.

464
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,340
Just sleep.

465
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,760
I think

466
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,540
you're becoming more like a monk.
