00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,520
I think

4
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,080
you're becoming more like a monk.

5
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
So be it.

6
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,820
There's nothing bad about it.

9
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,400
The coach is impressive.

10
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,550
Does this sound like something a person in his 20s would say?

11
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,560
The coach

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
just asked me

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,210
to make the chaos in my head

14
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,560
in order.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,759
You

Chaos

is the unrealistic thoughts in the head.

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,500
Humans spend more than half of their time

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
on this every day.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
Just like I did before.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,160
But...

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,620
you've recovered, right?

25
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,300
Why would you still meditate?

26
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,390
Things keep changing.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,760
Besides,

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
many new things happen every day.

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,510
How could I eliminate all the distracting thoughts in this life

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,910
just by meditating for half a month?

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,820
That's true.

38
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,110
it could help humans

39

calm down.

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Then tell me.

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,950
Should I

42
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,040
practice with you?

43
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,079
You don't need to.

♫Close your eyes and walk into my world♫

376
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,150
Come on, Yiran!

377
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:28,250
♫Dream of flying along the wind♫

378
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,360
Oh my God.

379
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,260
Xinghe is going to step out of the exchange zone.

380
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,060
No way.

381
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,730
Will Xinghe's result be nullified in the end?

382
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,780
Did they break the rule?

383
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,570
It depends on the referee.

384
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,580
Come on!

385
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,920
Wu Tianfu, come on!

386
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,900
-Go! Go!
-Go! Go!

387
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,030
Tianfu, come on!

388
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,840
Are you okay?

389
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,530
Yes.

390
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,440
He pushed himself too hard.

391
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,500
Shen Ming didn't show mercy at all.

392
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,490
Wu Tianfu's physical strength

393
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,490
really is strong.

394
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,250
Maybe he's more suitable for the 200 m race.

395
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,800
Come on, Ai Ziji!

396
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,970
Go!

397
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,620
-Come on!
-Come on!

398
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,680
-Come on!
-Come on!

399
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,280
Or we won't stand a chance!

400
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,610
He surpassed him!

401
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,410
Gosh.

402
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,460
The distance between Xinghe and Shenglin has been shortened.

403
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,520
Does Xinghe have a chance of winning?

404
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,760
My physical strength is so weak.

405
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm still a loser after all.

406
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,960
Ziji!

407
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,750
Go!

408
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,600
Will Xinghe's result be nullified?
