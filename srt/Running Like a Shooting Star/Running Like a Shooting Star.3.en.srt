Set.

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,680
A person's starting reaction time

6
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,840
can be shortened through training.

[Episode 3 How Fast Can You Run?]

8
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,670
The key is to be concentrated.

9
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,820
If you haven't heard the starting pistol for a long time,

10
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,550
your starting reaction time will become longer.

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,430
Big Hulk, go!

Tianfu.

13
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,170
Your opponent once met the qualification requirements for being a Level 2 athlete.

14
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,539
But he hasn't received any systematic training since then.

15
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,070
His speed can be estimated.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
And your muscular endurance is good.

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,670
Your problem is that your body will lose balance when you're running.

18
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,560
Your body keeps swaying when you're running.

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
If you want to run faster,

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,990
you need to keep your balance when running.

21
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,120
Don't lean forward.

22
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
Run straight.

Are you really here

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,690
to play Fighting the Landlord and learn how to do skincare?

27
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,070
Don't get me wrong.

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
I did nothing bad.

Aren't you a Level 2 athlete?

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,790
What happened?

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,720
What's going on?

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,270
I knew he could be really fast.

34
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,120
Amazing.

Let's go.

37
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,430
Wait, Coach.

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,780
I have the attendance records

39
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,180
of the Basketball Club members for the first half of the year.

40
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,950
I have to say

41
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,880
you have poor attendance records.

42
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,740
Many of your key players were late for

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,710
or absent from training.

44
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,829
Your key players didn't even compete

45
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,360
in the CUBA preliminaries.

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,030
Your team frequently made stupid mistakes on court.

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,110
In the end,

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
you let a newcomer be the scapegoat.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,510
Shame on you.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,850
What are you going to do?

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,610
There are many people here.

52
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,140
Let's talk somewhere else.

53
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,150
No need.

54
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,480
Why did the Basketball Club

55
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,910
lose to the Track and Field Club that is the most unpopular sport club at the school?

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,920
The reason is the same as the reason why your player lost today's match.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,910
You lost because all of you were being arrogant and you underestimated your opponents

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,340
and because your players weren't serious about doing the training.

59
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,740
You've lost your respect for basketball.

60
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,500
Wu Tianfu

61
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,470
just made you realize how wrong you were.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,130
I could have

63
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,780
shown the document to everyone.

64
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,350
But now I'm giving it back to you.

65
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,830
I just hope you can keep your promise

66
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,720
and let Wu Tianfu return to Basketball Club.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,110
And you need to make sure that no one will bully him ever again.

68
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,910
Okay?

69
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,070
Thank you all.

70
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,600
Did you see how people were looking at me

71
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
when the race was over?

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,650
It was nice to be praised and recognized, right?

73
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,550
Have you done the thing I asked you to do?

74
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,230
No need to worry about it.

75
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:56,710
Tianfu.

76
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,750
Your coach said

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,430
you could go back to the basketball club tomorrow.

78
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,230
Really?

79
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,350
They won't give you a hard time anymore.

80
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,510
I've enhanced the training of my leg strength.

81
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,280
I thought

82
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,310
by doing that the lower part of my body could be steadier.

83
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,150
To my surprise,

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,680
it enabled me to run faster.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,110
I tried my best to improve my skills in playing basketball.

86
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,570
To my surprise, I showed everyone that I could be a fast runner.

87
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,790
Qi Tian.

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,270
Let's have a race.

89
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,650
You can have a race against Xue Yiran.

90
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,360
No.

91
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,210
I want to have a race against you because I've never had a race against you before.

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,470
Come on, run as fast as you can and beat me.

93
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,320
Let me know how wide the gap is

94
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,690
between me and a real sprinter.

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,870
Fine.

96
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,510
I'll be your referee.

97
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,240
Don't you need to wear a pair of spikes?

98
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,270
On your marks.

99
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,470
Set.

100
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,030
Let's go.

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,290
How fast you ran!

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,350
You're such a good sprinter.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,330
Those with good physical fitness

104
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,440
can finish a 100-meter sprint within 11 seconds

105
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,300
if they receive enough training.

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,990
But it's not easy

107
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,200
to finish a 100-meter sprint within 10.9 seconds.

108
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,670
Every time you shorten the time by 0.1 seconds,

109
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,800
you become faster than lots of people.

110
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,350
It's like a pyramid.

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,730
This is the world of 100-meter sprinters.

112
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,120
It's simple but cruel.

113
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,909
How much time do you need to finish a 100-meter sprint?

114
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,270
I...

115
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,310
It depends on my mood.

116
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,090
What...

117
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,670
What is this?

118
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,390
It's the new kind of face masks developed my me.

119
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,700
Are you testing the face mask on me?

120
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,670
Come on, Mr. Rustic.

121
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,290
The Top Ten Goddesses at our school

122
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,620
all want this kind of face masks very much.

123
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,390
The Top Ten Goddesses?

124
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,800
You called me Mr. Rustic just now?

125
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,310
You...

126
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,420
How could you call me Mr. Rustic just now?

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,350
Stop it. Stop...

128
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,590
-The face mask!
-How could you call me Mr. Rustic just now?

129
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,750
My face mask! It's about to drop!

130
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,610
-How could you call me Mr. Rustic just now?
-Stop it.

131
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,900
We're in trouble now.

132
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,230
It's said that members of the basketball team

133
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,220
are criticized wherever they go.

134
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,679
It's said that they felt so humiliated

135
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,770
that they were going to

136
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,570
let the track and field team pay the price tonight.

137
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,480
I just ran into the captain of the basketball team, Gan Xian.

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,940
He said he would come to the Track and Field Club to see us later.

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,490
What did you say to the basketball coach yesterday?

140
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,020
Were you being aggressive?

141
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
Being aggressive?

142
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240
They should have thanked me

143
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,890
for not showing the document to the principal.

144
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,740
How could I be so stupid to let you talk to him?

145
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,540
It can't be.

146
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,640
Those from the Basketball Club shouldn't be so stupid.

147
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,520
We have something on them.

148
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,540
How come they dare to provoke us?

149
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,350
It's hard to say. You know, they're from the Basketball Club.

150
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,070
They bullied Wu Tianfu.

151
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,990
They're indeed a bunch of stupid jocks.

152
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,590
But

153
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,390
I don’t think Gan Xian was being unfriendly to me

154
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,990
when he talked to me just now.

155
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,930
You think he would tell you

156
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,700
he was going to hit you in front of you?

157
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,790
My friend told me that those from the basketball team

158
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,590
said,

159
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,630
"It can't be like this anymore.

160
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,950
The basketball team will show the track and field team

161
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,660
that we're not losers."

162
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,750
So it's my fault?

163
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,950
How about

164
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,080
I call Wu Tianfu and ask for his advice?

165
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,670
Okay.

166
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,880
[Qi Tian]

167
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,590
He's not answering the call.

168
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,510
Well...

169
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,150
Is he being watched by the basketball team?

170
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,430
Have they forbidden him from telling us any information?

171
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,550
You did so much for him.

172
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,840
But he

173
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,990
is being so ungrateful.

174
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,670
Well,

175
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,670
what should we do now?

176
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,630
Tianfu.

177
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,840
Would you like to go with us?

178
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,210
Okay.

179
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,500
Wait a moment.

180
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,150
-To throw a fellowship ball?
-To throw a fellowship ball?

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,670
Yes.

182
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,520
We can throw a fellowship ball

183
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,180
and invite some girls to come.

184
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,220
When there're many girls at our ball,

185
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,370
I don't believe

186
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,790
those from the Basketball Club

187
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,190
will have a fight with us.

188
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,990
That's true.

189
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,810
Are you

190
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,550
using me?

191
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,840
You promised to throw a party for me,

192
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
didn't you?

193
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,700
I was just kidding.

194
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,990
Besides,

195
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,960
I don't have the contact information of those girls.

196
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,300
What?

197
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,250
I don't believe it.

198
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,670
So many girls like me.

199
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,070
I've been focused on my training these years.

200
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,150
I don't like

201
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,320
being around those girls.

202
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,780
Looks like Fei Zhe's thing

203
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,850
has a deep influence on him.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,400
I guess he hasn't communicated with many people for the past three years.

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,150
So you were just bluffing.

206
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,030
-I was not bluffing.
-He must have also dated few girls.

207
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,900
My contact information

208
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,380
is something those girls want very much.

209
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,990
Let me invite girls to come to our ball.

210
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,030
-You?
-You?

211
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,890
In my Skincare Chat Group,

212
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,650
there're quite a few girls.

213
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,880
They

214
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,210
also want to know tall boys.

215
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,590
Take a look.

216
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,540
I didn't know I could get to know girls by joining this kind of groups.

217
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,250
I was too narrow-minded.

218
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,970
We'll have to share the cost of the ball. Let's see how much money

219
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,250
we need to spend on the lights, drinks, and music.

220
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,850
Let's throw a good ball.

221
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,130
What do you think?

222
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,310
No need to use your money. I'll pay the bill.

223
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,170
Use my card.

224
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,210
No password.

225
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,750
How come I didn't know

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
you were so rich!

227
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,820
♫Leaving worries behind♫

228
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,590
♫Doing whatever you want can make you happy♫

229
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,010
♫I made a wish upon a shooting star♫

230
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,330
♫And dreams have grown wings♫

231
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,980
♫Courage has increased the speed♫

232
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,830
♫I keep running as fast as I can all the time♫

233
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,570
♫Who am I running for and who will I stop for?♫

234
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,270
♫And for whom will you become mature?♫

235
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,150
♫Both efforts and luck matter, so don't be afraid of being mocked♫

236
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,690
♫Eliminate your fear with courage, because you are young♫

237
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,120
♫Look at the starry sky and tell yourself to seize the chance♫

238
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,980
♫Show the meaning of running to the world♫

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,030
♫Just chase after the sunset♫

240
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,560
♫Move forward and don't be nervous♫

241
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,280
♫Life is always full of setbacks♫

242

♫Don't be afraid, because courage will lead the way♫

243
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,700
Will those girls come?

244
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,850
A few girls in the chat group said they would.

245
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,940
♫Just move forward and enjoy life♫

246
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,590
♫Just move forward and be happy and tough♫

247
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,540
Wait.

248
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,890
We're throwing a ball.

249
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,470
♫You won't get lost♫

250
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,070
But

251
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,930
♫Live in the moment and do your best♫

252
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,940
are you good at dancing?

253
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,090
♫You won't get lost♫

254
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,010
So you're really a Mr. Rustic.

255
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,320
Are you good at dancing?

256
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,650
At least I can get girls to come to our ball.

257
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,290
Since none of us are good at dancing,

258
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,550
we'd better learn how to dance right now.

259
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,190
♫Courage has increased the speed♫

260
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,960
♫I keep running as fast as I can all the time♫

♫Your hard work will pay off♫

♫Get ready to face what will happen unexpectedly♫

265

♫I'm not afraid of difficulties and I believe I can overcome them♫

266
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,890
♫I believe the wish that I made at dusk and at dawn will come true♫

267

Are the girls coming?

272
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,040
-Hello.
-Nice to see you.

273
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,330
-Hello.
-Hello.

274
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Hi, Ziji.

275
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,390
Hi, Ziji.

276
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,010
Hello. Hello. Hello.

277
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,570
Hello, Ziji.

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,260
Hi. Hello. Hi.

279
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,840
Hi, Ziji.

280
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,840
Hi, hello.

281
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
-So many girls.
-Hello.

282
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,810
I was so narrow-minded.

283
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,300
I told them

284
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,940
that if they came to our fellowship ball,

285
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,080
I would give them

286
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,980
the face masks newly developed by myself next week.

287
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm going to be broke next week.

288
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,050
Really, you're going to be broke?

289
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,490
It's none of our business.

290
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,220
Let's go.

291
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,550
Hi.

292
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,100
Thank you.

293
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,690
-Welcome.
-Sorry.

294
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,480
They said...

295
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,190
Sorry?

296
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,810
I'd like to apologize for what we did before.

297
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,720
Please come in.

298
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,610
Please come in.

299
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,290
-Hi.
-Hi.

300
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,270
Thank you.

301
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,520
Actually,

302
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,720
something bad happened to my family recently.

303
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,750
My girlfriend also broke up with me.

304
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,349
For a long time,

305
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,030
I just kept fooling around.

306
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,650
I was also very grumpy those days.

307
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,520
And I didn't focus on training at all those days.

308
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,740
Coach didn't punish me

309
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,960
because he knew I was having a hard time.

310
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,630
Please forgive me for speaking rudely to you

312
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,190
and asking the coach to kick you out of the basketball team.

313
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,220
Xue Yiran,

314
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,030
what you said to the coach that day

315
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,200
touched me.

316
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,840
You were right.

317
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,990
We have lost our respect

318
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,510
for basketball.

319
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,750
After so many things happened,

320
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,050
only playing basketball can cheer me up.

321
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,300
Bro.

322
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,880
Welcome to

323
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,030
the fellowship ball organized by the Track and Field Club.

324
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,310
To be happy is the most important thing.

325
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,040
Come on, let's drink together.

326
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,630
Cheers.

327
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,790
Hi.

328
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,830
Hi.

329
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,950
It's said

330
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,230
that you broke up with your girlfriend recently.

331
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,910
I...

332
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm not good at dancing.

333
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:47,990
It's okay.

334
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,040
So he is also a Mr. Rustic.

335
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
My name is Shasha.

336
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,430
I have a question.

337
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,800
Some members from the Basketball Club

338
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,550
said they wouldn't be losers.

339
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,720
What does it mean?

340
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,370
How did you get to know that?

341
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,200
We don't want others

342
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,270
to to look down on the Basketball Club

343
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,000
because of our recent failure.

344
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,020
We will show everyone that we're not losers.

345
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,950
So I misunderstood those words.

346
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,670
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

347
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,870
Bye. Bye. Bye.

348
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,790
Bye.

349
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,390
We had a good time tonight.

350
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,480
From now on, members of the basketball team

351
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,110
and members of the Track and Field Club are good friends.

352
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,710
Of course.

353
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,630
Let's go.

354
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,220
Tianfu.

355
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,890
Let's go.

356
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,550
Bye.

357
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,680
Captain.

358
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,510
Wait.

359
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,110
I...

360
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,110
I want to join the Track and Field Club.

361
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,370
You want to join the Track and Field Club?

362
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,330
Yes.

363
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,170
I want to be a runner.

364
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,760
I want to stay in the Track and Field Club and run with them.

365
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,190
Good luck.

366
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,530
Young runner.

367
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,270
♫A fleeting beam of light♫

368
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:44,300
♫The youth wants to catch up to the sun♫

369
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,090
♫My dream makes me♫

370
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,970
Is being a runner

371
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,100
interesting?

372
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,100
♫Willing to be crazy♫

373
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:02,140
♫Breaking through fear, racing against destiny♫

374
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,860
♫Not being nervous anymore. Not being content with the status quo♫

375
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Tianfu.

376
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,850
Would you like to go with us?

377
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,320
Okay.

378
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,150
♫Never again♫

379
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,540
Wait a moment.

380
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,940
♫Feel lost♫

381
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,340
♫Once promises are made, I never thought of leaving♫

382
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,560
♫Even facing the hardships of reality♫

383
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,930
♫The wish made in summer will come true♫

384
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,400
♫My dream is always there♫

385
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,560
Goodbye.

386
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,780
Kobe.

387
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,800
Goodbye.

388
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,360
The basketball court at 4 a.m.

389
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,100
Qi Tian.

390
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Yiran.

391
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,630
Let me join the Track and Field Club.

392
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,780
I won.

393
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,910
Let's make a bet.

394
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,600
I bet

395
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,220
Wu Tianfu will join our Track and Field Club.

396
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,870
Listen.

397
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,110
Don't do anything stupid.

398
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,390
Don't show the document to others.

399
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,420
If we make an enemy of them,

400
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,390
Wu Tianfu will have a hard time

401
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,870
even if he returns to the Basketball Club.

402
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,200
Isn't it a good thing

403
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,750
that Wu Tianfu can't go back to the Basketball Club?

404
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,760
How about we

405
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,030
form a relay team?
