But Qi Tian's performance is really impressive.

161

To my surprise, his ability to accelerate is extraordinary.

162
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,200
He didn't train as a sprinter until he became a university student.

Not bad.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280

174
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,610

Without Xue Yiran,

176
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,670
Qi Tian won't get the whole team to win in the end.

177
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,330
Looks like Xinghe will lose.

178
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,950
It's too early

179
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,920

The man who is the second fastest sprinter

182
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,480
in Xinghe only after Xue Yiran is at his best.

183
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,190

185
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,590
I didn't expect the boy who looks girlish

186
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,720

Maybe it's because I was slow.

♫My dream is always there♫

371
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,200
But we have made it to the final.

372
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,830
You did well too.

373
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,310
Right?

374
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,800
♫Failure is better than boredom♫

375
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,950
Yeah.

376
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,210
♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

377
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,070
Fei Zhe.

378
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,800
♫That innocent child is still here♫

379
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,170
Come and watch us compete tomorrow.

380
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,100
♫It's reflected in my head♫

381
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,640
Tianfu.

382
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Try your best to catch up with us.

383
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,730
Hey, you're all so fast! How could you commit a false start?

384
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,750
He.

385
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,830
Where are you going?

386
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,530
Are you not allowed to stay here anymore?

387
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,030
No.

388
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,520
I have to go to Shanghai

389
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,850
to deal with something.

390
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,620
What's the result of your race?

391
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,920
I was slow this time.

392
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
I failed to catch the shooting star.

393
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,190
But

394
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,430
it's okay.

395
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,540
My novel is serialized on the internet and is very popular.

396
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,470
Someone is willing to pay me 500,000 yuan

397
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,200
for the copyright of the novel.

398
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,430
500,000 yuan?

399
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,590
That's a lot.

400
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,460
I'm in a hurry to go to Shanghai

401
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,220
because I'll talk to the buyer about the deal.

402
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,150
That's great.

403
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,410
Good luck.

404
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,460
The car is here.

405
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,370
I'm going to the airport.

406
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,890
Bye.

407
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:49,220
♫Breaking through fear, racing against destiny♫

408
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,940
♫Not being nervous anymore, not being content with the status quo♫

409
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,200
Mingde is a really strong team.

410
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,400
Good luck.

411
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,240
♫Never again♫

412
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,020
♫Feel lost♫

♫My dream is always there♫

418
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,190
Shenglin lost.

419
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,910
Shixing...

420
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,880
♫Failure is better than boredom♫

421
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,680

♫I'm well-prepared because I don't want to lose♫

423
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,160

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,840
♫That innocent child is still here♫

425
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,550
♫It's reflected in my head♫

426
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,520
I think you all know

427
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,850
the results of today's matches.

428
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
Mingde won.

429
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,150
Yeah.

430
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,070
Mingde won.

431
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,720
Mingde and Shenglin

432
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,940
have both reached tomorrow's final.

433
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,050
But Mingde won the first place in the heats

434
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,430
by a wide margin.

435
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,630
Mingde

436
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,990
is really a strong team.

437
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,260
Since I made the decision

438
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,060
to let Xiang compete in the heat,

439
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,400
I have never doubted

440
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,080
your ability to win the title.

441
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,320
Some coaches,

442
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,240
in order make the athletes feel less nervous,

443
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,640
will say to his athletes,

444
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,650
"Relax.

445
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,990
Even if you don't win,

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,130
it doesn't matter."

447
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,710
But today I want to tell you

448
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,900
that you have the ability to win a medal

449
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,360
and the medal will be the gold one

450
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,640
that you want the most.

451
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,630
Look.

452
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,280
Can you recognize me

453
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,270
when I'm wearing this?

454
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,110
Why are you dressed

455
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,610
like this?

456
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm just worried

457
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,990
that our son will be nervous when he sees me.

458
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,270
He won't.

459
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Hello, Qian.

460
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,030
Hello, Dad.

461
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,460
Dad.

462
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,460
I'm not feeling well

463
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,400
so I won't be able to come to see you.

464
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,960
Remember to take your mom

465
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,080
to a nice restaurant and have a nice meal

466
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
when she arrives.

467
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,970
Okay, Dad.

468
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,910
I will.

469
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,840
If one wants to win,

470
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,290
they will be anxious,

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,870
be afraid of losing,

472
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,930
and worry too much.

473
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,520
The more you're distracted,

474
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,430
the worse

475
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
your body will be.

476
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,670
Indeed.

477
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,290
They are a very strong team.

478
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,660
But

479
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,840
as long as all of you

480
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,200
can reach the ZONE state

481
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,450
and be in the ZONE state when running,

482
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,760
you will have a great chance to win.

483
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,350
Coach.

484
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,600
We got it.

485
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,510
Alright.

486
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,390
I'm done.

487
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,240
Go back.

488
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,150
I've never had

489
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,070
such an obstacle

490
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,000
in playing Fighting the Landlord.

491
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,880
Stop laughing.

492
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,200
It's all because of you guys.

493
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,080
Because I need

494
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,220
to focus on coaching you,

495
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,790
I have rarely

496
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,550
played cards

497
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,660
for a year.

498
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,890
I hope you can finish your races quickly

499
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,620
so that I can participate in

500
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,480
the Fighting the Landlord Championship.

501
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,760
Come on, Coach.

502
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,090
Even if you hadn't chosen to be our coach,

503
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,920
you wouldn't be able to win

504
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,810
the Fighting the Landlord Championships.

505
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,210
Nonsense.

506
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,570
Coach.

507
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,280
Thank you.

508
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,710
Alright.

509
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,740
Guys.

510
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,900
Good night, Coach.

511
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,710
Good night.

512
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,770
Good night, Coach.

513
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,840
What jerks they are.

514
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,350
I should thank you.
