[Running Like A Shooting Star]

3
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,550
What...

4
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,810
did she mean?

5
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,630
Haoyu.

6
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,150
What?

7
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,250
I have a question.

8
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,660
I need you to help me analyze.

9
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,070
What's more important

10
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,810
than defeating Qi Tian now?

11
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,120
That's...

12
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,550
That's unrelated.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,720
I have a friend.

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,400
You have a friend?

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,530
What other friends do you have that I don't know about?

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,590
He's from Jamaica.

17
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,080
A friend from Jamaica.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
A friend from abroad,

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,420
runs pretty fast?

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,229
He runs okay.

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,060
Well,

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,150
he...

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,240
has been liking a girl older than him.

24
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,800
A Jamaican May-December romance?

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,490
Not exactly.

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,670
Because this girl

27
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,000
is hot and cold with him.

28
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,120
Usually, she's pretty nice to him.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,190
But when he confessed his feelings,

30
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,320
she didn't respond.

31
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,550
Well...

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,840
that means that girl just isn't into him.

33
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,370
But just a few days ago,

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,180
she kissed him.

35
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,230
What?

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,640
Luo Bing kissed you?

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
Keep your voice down.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,730
I told you

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,280
he's a friend from Jamaica.

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,079
A friend from Jamaica.

41
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,410
Who would believe that?

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,060
You mean...

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
Ms. Luo kissed you

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,950
and doesn't want to take responsibility for you?

45
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,860
She...

46
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,020
kissed here.

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,130
I don't think she needs to take responsibility.

48
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,460
This is a bit tricky.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,310
She...

50
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,490
Did she kiss you

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
and then act like nothing happened?

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,880
Is she still

53
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,190
interacting with other guys

54
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,590
very enthusiastically?

55
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,150
I never expected

56
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,960
Ms. Luo, who looks so adorable,

57
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,390

Ouch!

60
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,910
Good, pain is part of the process.

61
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,000
Xue Yiran will feel

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,960
a hundred times more pain than you.

63
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,900
Okay.

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
I see, Ms. Luo.

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,620
I will study hard.

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,190
You are here learning the physical therapy techniques.

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,390
Don't you need to take care of Xue Yiran?

68
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,079
No, I don't.

69
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,870
Wu Tianfu is there.

70
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,100
In the first week after the surgery,

71
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,540
he needs to fully mobilize his toes.

72
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,150
This is important for promoting blood circulation,

73
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,150
reducing swelling,

74
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,280
and preventing deep vein thrombosis.

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,140
I'm well aware of that.

76
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,430
Wait a minute.

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,230
I need to take a call.

78
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,870
Qi Tian,

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,140
Yiran is having a breakdown because of learning

80
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,100
the toe dancing.

81
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,360
This is way too difficult.

82
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,660
Is the video you gave him

83
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,030
too hard to learn?

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,380
What kind of toe dancing is this?

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,910
Is it something humans can learn?

86
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,530
You might as well give me a terrible movie.

87
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,140
That way, I'll be so embarrassed

88
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,200
that I'll build a castle with my toes.

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,740
Let me tell you,

90
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,950
I've watched

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,110
countless videos of toe dancing

92
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,700
and picked out the simplest version.

93
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,890
If you can't learn it,

94
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,020
I won't come to the hospital to see you.

95
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,870
Tianfu,

96
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,870
keep an eye on him.

97
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,620
Don't let him slack off.

98
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,220
Are you really ditching me like this?

99
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,950
Qi Tian.

100
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,950
Qi Tian!

101
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,180
Okay.

102
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,010
Yes, sir!

103
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,230
Not bad.

104
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,690
Now you seem to be more professional than me.

105
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,470
I'm now very confident

106
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,730
in Xue Yiran's postoperative recovery.

107
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,850
There's someone at the door, I think.

108
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,060
That's Zeng Shixing, right?

109
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,830
You...

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,930
know he likes you, don't you?

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,790
Yes.

112
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,880
He confessed to me.

113
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,180
So, how do you feel about him?

114
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,980
If you don't like him, you should turn him down quickly.

115
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,830
I like him.

116
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,520
Well...

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,580
Why did you close the window just now?

118
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,830
Aren't you afraid he might misunderstand?

119
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,580
But I haven't agreed to be his girlfriend yet.

120
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,710
You like him,

121
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,500
but you don't want to be his girlfriend,

122
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,060
yet you're stringing him along.

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
Are you a player?

124
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,170

one piece at a time to taste sweet.

126
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,310
What do you young and ignorant boys know?

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,550
I am currently enjoying

128
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,370
the most amazing time in love.

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,470
What do you mean?

130
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,150
Flirting.

131
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,150
A woman's mind

132
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,570
is truly hard to guess.

133
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,090
Even if you guess it right, you might still get hurt.

134
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,880
Good.

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,350
Excellent,

136
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,040
Yiran!

137
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,820
This time seems fine.

138
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,100
Let me take a look.

139
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,980
Would you like to record

140
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,190
the previous move again?

141
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,340
I'll edit it.

142
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,020
No, I can't.

143
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,750
It's too hard.

144
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,950
Fine.

145
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,310
I'll do some editing and send it to Qi Tian.

146
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,790
Yiran.

147
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,830
Qi Tian said it's not a one-shot

148
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,800
It didn't pass.

149
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,160
Yiran,

150
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,560
don't get discouraged.

151
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,870
We can make it.

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,659
Come on!

153
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,400
Come on.

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,200
Get up.

155
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,560
Let's take another try.

156
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,750
Hurry up.

157
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,840
Come on.

158
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,720
Do it.

159
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,590
Get moving!

160
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,590
Come on.

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,350
Look.

162
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,990
On the website of the National University Championship,

163
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,680
the list and registration results

164
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
of the relay race this time were announced.

165
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,480
Here are some of the strong teams:

166
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,690
Qingbei University is as dominant as ever.

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
And there's Zhongtian University,

168
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,660
which seems to have a new talent emerging.

169
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,390
His running style is particularly like

170
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,030
that of the former genius athlete Michael Johnson,

171
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,840
especially powerful after forty meters.

172
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,830
Also, there's Mingde Institute of Technology.

173
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,980
They recorded a time

174
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,380
of 40.76 seconds.

175
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,059
What's our ranking?

176
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,650
We recorded a time of 40.89 seconds, ranking third.

177
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,320
Next,

178
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,820
we need to prepare for the possibility that Xue Yiran

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,280
may not be able to run in less than 13 seconds.

180
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,260
Even if Xue Yiran's Achilles tendon is fine,

181
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,380
we may not necessarily win the championship.

182
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,950
Not to mention the situation now...

183
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,100
You two, come here.

184
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,840
Coming.

185
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,270
Okay, stop.

186
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,990
Be careful.

187
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,320
These are all borrowed.

188
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,130
What are these, Coach?

189
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,360
High-speed camera,

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
muscle oxygen meter, and blood lactate analyzer.

191
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,860
There are a bunch more in the car.

192
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm thinking,

193
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,110
before I retire,

194
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,350
we should make a big splash.

195
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,360
Let me do it.

196
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,450
Let us do it, Coach.

197
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,450
It has been five days,

198
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,290
Yiran.

199
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,440
How come you still haven't learned it?

200
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,760
Are you doubting my intelligence?

201
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm doubting whether your cerebellum

202
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,590
has developed properly.

203
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Is it really that difficult?

204
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,900
Come on!

205
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,160
Come on, Yiran!

206
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,430
Spread your toes!

207
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,020
Spread!

208
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,150
Yes.

209
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,300
Come on!

210
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,780
Come on, Yiran!

211
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,660
Spread your toes!

212
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,510
I haven't seen you in a few days,

213
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,890
and it seems that you've recovered quite well.

214
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,730
Come here.

215
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,630
I promise I won't kill you.

216
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,510
I did this for your own good.

217
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,670
You were too cruel.

218
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,300
You sent Wu Tianfu to watch over me.

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,850
He almost wanted to time me peeing.

220
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,630
Really?

221
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,440
Then I'll have to punish him

222
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,130
with extra drumsticks later.

223
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,830
I'm thirsty.

224
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,660
Your leg is injured,

225
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,680
but your hands aren't.

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,050
Isn't the water glass right beside you?

227
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,840
I don't care.

228
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,260
You haven't shown up for so long.

229
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,220
I have to boss you around now.

230
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,230
Fine.

231
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,320
Here.

232
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,030
Sir.

233
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,600
It's too hot.

234
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,190
By the way, what have you been up to

235
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,050
during your long absence?

236
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,350
I've been dating,

237
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,180
learning about love from someone experienced.

238
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,500
You?

239
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,840
It's no use for you learning it.

240
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,700
You've been cursed by me.

241
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,610
You'll never get a girlfriend.

242
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,200
What do you mean?

243
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,310
"YYDS".

244
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,010
What do you think it means?

245
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,900
It means "forever single".

246
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,110
You brat!

247
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,540
You tricked me into having a surgery here,

248
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,380
and now I have to

249
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,260
lie here bored every day

250
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,190
while you're enjoying yourself.

251
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,900
Let me tell you,

252
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,830
you wish.

253
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,910
You're so vicious.

254
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,900
You want me to suffer, don't you?

255
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,350
Just you wait.

256
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,950
Yes! What can you do about it?

257
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you doing?

258
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,190
Don't do it.

259
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,390
I'm quite familiar with the doctors

260
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,430
and nurses here.

261
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,900
I see them every day.

262
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,270
Drop your pen and be merciful.

263
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,440
When I recover...

264
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,520
When I recover,

265
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,300
I'll change the abbreviation on your clothes to

266
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,230
"MFTH",

267
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,230
which means "having a lot of wrong romances".

268
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,840
Got it!

269
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,750
I'll change it to "ZYYB",

270
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,810
which means "surrounded by lovers"!

271
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Hey, giant macho over there,

272
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,630
let's go for hot pot.

273
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,730
I like this nickname.

274
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,750
But,

275
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,190
the macho has got a date.

276
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,230
Lately, you always leave right after training.

277
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,940
What's up?

278
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,070
Did you get a girlfriend?

279
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,350
What girlfriend?

280
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,300
It was my mom.

281
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,070
She's got me playing the supporting character for her.

282
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,000
What do you mean?

283
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,610
The son of one of my mom's big clients

284
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,710
is about my age.

285
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,110
She wanted me to cozy up to him.

286
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,590
But the thing is,

287
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,430
I did too good of a job.

288
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,070
Now this guy

289
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,530
is hitting me up every day.

290
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,950
So life forced you into it.

291
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,470
I'd be happy to have a supporting character

292
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,910
like you by my side.

293
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,580
You're like a free bodyguard.

294
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,590
Plus, you won't steal my thunder

295
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,140
with the girls around.

296
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,640
I also have to set off his charm.

297
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,470
It's really for my mom.

298
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,500
How about me?

299
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,850
I'm also macho.

300
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,590
Can you take me to hang out with you?

301
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,380
You?

302
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,280
With your perceptiveness?

303
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,660
You'd better go and have hot pot with me.

304
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,070
Wait for me.

305
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,980
Let me tell you guys.

306
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,850
Lately, I've been feeling

307
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,420
that dating is so boring.

308
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,660
I prefer girls

309
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,940
that are hard to get.

310
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,910
Do you have a boyfriend?

311
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,790
See?

312
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,870
That's exactly what I don't like about you.

313
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,440
If so,

314
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,060
our story would be like this:

315
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,130
I pursue you,

316
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,150
buy you clothes,

317
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,010
shoes,

318
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,760
bags,

319
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,210
and then we're together.

320
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,550
And that's it.

321
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
So dull!

322
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,680
The story ends before it even starts.

323
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,390
That's...

324
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,990
Mr. Zhu,

325
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,990
your preference is a bit unique.

326
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,800
Because,

327
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,380
after so many relationships,

328
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,780
I found that the routines are all the same.

329
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,590
So boring.

330
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,030
Oh, I see.

331
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,780
A toast!

332
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,020
Here.

333
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,310
Here.

334
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,990
Here.

335
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,780
Fatty.

336
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,680
What are you looking at?

337
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,940
I...

338
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,860
What?

339
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,670
You've been recovering well.

340
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Tomorrow, the stitches will be removed,

341
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,970
and you'll have your cast replaced.

342
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,830
Then, you can be discharged.

343
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,420
Okay.

344
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

345
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,700
Your families have visited you?

346
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,700
[Wishing you a long and healthy life, and free from disasters and misfortunes]

347
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm watching

348
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,550
this year's Diamond League

349
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,750
to see who the champion is

350
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,010
and what the result is.

351
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,300
How is it possible that anyone wants to

352
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,950
practice shot put nowadays?

353
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,470
Well.

354
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,390
Look at this.

355
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,310
Skateboarding

356
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,760
and e-sports have become Olympic events now.

357
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,110
How entertaining

358
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,710
are these!

359
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,030
In my opinion,

360
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,470
shot put, as an outdated event,

361
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,310
should have been eliminated long ago.

362
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,180
Does anyone still watch it?

363
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,940
Can it drive

364
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,520
economic development?

365
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,110
Look.

366
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,420
These female shot put athletes are too muscular.

367
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:43,880
Well...

368
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,230
These...

369
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,890
These women are too big for me.

370
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,830
Dude,

371
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,370
I don't know if shot put is outdated.

372
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,520
What I do know

373
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,109
is that some ancient histories

374
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,619
shouldn't be forgotten.

375
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,079
And also,

376
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,829
the most primitive strength engraved in the human spirit

377
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,160
shouldn't be erased.

378
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,180
Furthermore,

379
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,150
when we stand on the international stage

380
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,960
and others ask what Chinese strength is,

381
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,329
can it be proven by you,

382
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,760
a weak man who steals others' girlfriends?

383
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,180
Fatty.

384
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,260
Fatty.

385
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,410
Fatty.

386
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,270
What are you doing?

387
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,600
Why aren't you talking？

388
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm tired from training these days.

389
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,940
I almost fell asleep just now.

390
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,950
Look.

391
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,950
Fat people like him

392
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,040
really can fall asleep anywhere.

393
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:47,940
Here.

394
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,670
Here.

395
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,100
Here.

396
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,910
Here.

397
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,350
I'm so pissed.

398
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,730
Why didn't you hit back directly?

399
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,330
What's wrong with being fat?

400
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,130
It's not like you ate their rice.

401
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,630
Hit back?

402
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,360
Forget it.

403
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,920
If I had hit back,

404
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,810
it would have only caused trouble for my parents.

405
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,070
My mom has been really stressed lately

406
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,470
because of the business.

407
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,390
And my dad is not in good health.

408
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,350
I'd better be a more sensible child.

409
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,470
That's right.

410
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,550
It was meaningless back then when I argued

411
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,070
with those who called me a sissy.

412
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,920
Even if I rebutted,

413
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,250
it wouldn't change their opinions.

414
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,510
On the contrary,

415
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,910
it would invite even greater mockery.

416
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm going for training.

417
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,350
I didn't expect you

418
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,030
to have another house outside

419
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,140
behind our back.

420
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,630
What do you mean by behind your back?

421
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,490
I haven't been living at home since the ninth grade.

422
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,570
I forced my dad

423
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,480
to buy this house for me.

424
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,480
Be careful.

425
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,910
He also knew

426
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,310
that I couldn't get along with that woman.

427
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,870
So, he gritted his teeth

428
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,860
and bought me this house.

429
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,950
I just can't stand you.

430
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,850
You have such a big house

431
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,910
but you insisted on squeezing with us in a dorm.

432
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,890
It was

433
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,960
to get you into the relay team.

434
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,970
Besides, I found that sleeping with you guys

435
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,090
improved my sleep.

436
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,220
During the days when I was in the hospital,

437
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,750
without Tianfu's snoring,

438
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,400
I couldn't sleep well.

439
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,550
Here.

440
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,150
Okay.

441
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,710
I'll go tidy up the room first.

442
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,860
Ziji and the others will be here soon.

443
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,500
Okay.

444
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,390
Welcome.

445
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,830
I didn't expect you,

446
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,590
Xue Yiran,

447
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,300
to have a house outside

448
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,780
behind our back.

449
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,650
It's so close to the school

450
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,270
and in such a good location.

451
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,550
What do you mean by behind your back?

452
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,630
Are we that close?

453
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,070
Not close, huh?

454
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,340
Then don't eat the food I bought later.

455
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,590
Yiran,

456
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,030
this house should be worth

457
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,390
around 30-40 thousand per square meter now, right?

458
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,090
When we bought it,

459
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,820
it was about 4000 per square meter,

460
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,150
and the total price was less than 500,000.

461
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,220
You really have great foresight.

462
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,830
Hello.

463
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Mr. Zhu.

464
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,300
I have something to do today,

465
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
so I can't make it.

466
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,110
Well,

467
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,790
I really have something to do.

468
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,990
I'll definitely go there next time.

469
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,790
I premise.

470
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,150
Did that Mr. Zhu call you again?

471
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,450
Who is Mr. Zhu?

472
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,470
He's a spoiled wealthy heir.

473
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:35,990
Forget about him.

474
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,790
Let's eat.

475
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,680
Give him a plate of food.

476
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,350
You can eat here.

477
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,440
This one is good.

478
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
Give me a pair of chopsticks.

479
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,300
What kind of gathering is this?

480
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,980
I can't even see you guys.

481
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,260
I seriously suspect

482
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,150
that you're just using my discharge as an excuse

483
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,430
to have a meal here.

484
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,900
Your leg is broken.

485
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,340
Can't you just talk less?

486
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,840
You're so dramatic.

487
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,060
It's because my leg is broken

488
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,540
that I can only talk.

489
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,910
That's easy.

490
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,770
Yiran!

491
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,490
The beef is very tender.

492
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,850
Let me see who's the handsome guy doing the eating broadcast?

493
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,370
This roast chicken is good,

494
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,820
crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

495
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,180
Babies, if you place your orders now,

496
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,640
I can apply for a discount.

497
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,120
It won't work, not professional.

498
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,790
Watch me.

499
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,350
Babies, you can buy four

500
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,290
of our roast chickens

501
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,790
for 99 yuan!

502
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,330
Come on.

503
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,050
One, two, three.

504
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,590
Put up the link!

505
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,530
Cheers!

506
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,670
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

507
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,830
Let's warmly celebrate the strongest rookie of our Track and Field Club,

508
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,690

I'll take these two.

513
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,070
Don't take too much.

514
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,600
Let's go.

515
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,360
