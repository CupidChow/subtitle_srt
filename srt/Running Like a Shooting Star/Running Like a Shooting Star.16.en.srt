00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,460
I couldn't fulfill my promise to him.

127

But your appearance

129
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,000

139
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,050
Actually, since I was a kid,

140
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,730
I've been used to it.

141
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,720

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,650
she couldn't find me.

151
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,680
But

152
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,240
I only asked my uncle

153
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,970
and found out her phone number.

Qi Tian.

155
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,200
It's not that she couldn't find me.

156
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,060
She just didn't want to find me.

157
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,020
Fei Zhe organized a birthday celebration for me.

158
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,960
It was

159
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,300

160
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,420
that someone volunteered to celebrate my birthday.

161
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,000
Then...

162
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,520
he passed away.

163
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,290
Last year,

164
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,190
something was wrong with my foot.

165
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,990
I thought I could hold on till I graduate.

166
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,570
But

167
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,360
it seems

168
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,510
I will lose everything I cherish

169
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,800
one by one.

170
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,360
This seems to be the script of my life.

171
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,800
I don't even know

172
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,740
what else I deserve to have

173
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,450
in my life.

174
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,330
I understand him.

175
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,760
After all, if he undergoes an operation,

176
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,410
it will take a lot of time

177
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,480
to recover to his current level.

178
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,250
If he still insists,

179
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,630
I'll leave the relay team.

180
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,930

181
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,000
What darn promise?

182
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,300
If he loses his foot,

183
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,690
he'll lose everything.

184
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,570
Now that I think about it,

185
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
I also said a lot out of anger.

186
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,250
Xue Yiran

187
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,850

Fei Zhe had many friends.

189

His death

190
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,040
made everyone very sad.

Xue Yiran

192
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,330
naturally became

193
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,330
the outlet for everyone's sadness.

194
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,840
But actually,

195
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,720
we forgot

196
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,730
the one who was the closest to Fei Zhe

197
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,600
was Xue Yiran.

198
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,850
In fact, he was the saddest person.

199
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,710
I don't know how he lived these years.

200
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,300
It seems he is Prince Charming,

201
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,280
but he has never had the mood

202
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
to find a girlfriend.

203
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,200
I think what he wants most

204
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
is to get rid of the guilt

205
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,340
that bothers him every day.

206
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,980
But he loves running most.

207
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,080
If he can't continue to run

208
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
because of this...

209
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,480
Do you think Xue Yiran

210
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,810
is someone who would

211
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,240
care about his ranking?

212
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,530
Senior Shixing,

213
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,480
the training must be tiring.

214
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,410
Have some water.

215
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,380
Thank you.

216
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,490
He is so handsome.

217
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,650
How long have you been training today?

218
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,220
I've been training for a long time.

219
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,890
You must be very tired.

220
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,070
Are you hungry?

221
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,330
A little.

222
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,850
We'll bring you some food later.

223
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Shen Ming.

224
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,460
Ms. Luo.

225
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,880
Who are those two girls?

226
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,720
Those two...

227
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,110
are Xing's fans.

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,890
Fans?

229
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,810
He has fans?

230
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,920
Let me tell you.

231
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,370
Xing looks more handsome

232
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,570
after shaving his beard.

233
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,520
Also, he is a top student

234
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,530
and excels in sports.

235
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,730
It's normal for him to have fans, right?

236
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:02,290
Alright.

237
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm getting back to running.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,610
Okay.

239
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,890
The training is so tiring.

240
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,680
You should look after your health.

241
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
-Zeng Shixing.
-That's right. Otherwise, we'll be worried.

242
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Zeng Shixing.

243
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,330
Come here.

244
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,490
What's wrong?

245
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,330
-We're leaving then.
-Come here.

246
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,810
I'm a doctor.

247
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,850
Of course I asked you here for a health checkup.

248
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,030
-Senior, bye.
-Bye.

249
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
Get down.

250
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,600
Why?

251
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,210
Didn't you say

252
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,370
you strained your glutes a few days ago?

253
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,470
I made it up

254
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,040
to seduce you.

255
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,600
I knew it.

256
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,560
Why didn't you send me messages

257
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,930
these days?

258
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,970
I didn't want to.

259
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm tired.

260
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,780
Then why did you shave your beard?

261
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,670
I was trying to look older,

262
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,790
but it didn't work.

263
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,870
I've decided to be myself.

264
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,190
You don't like me anymore, right?

265
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,110
I'm tired of it.

266
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,030
Tired?

267
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,480
What do you mean?

268
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,140
Now you are tired of me, right?

269
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,810
Why do you have so many questions?

270
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,090
Should I answer all your questions

271
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,020
just because you're older than me?

272
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,720
Zeng Shixing,

273
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,670
now you've learned to talk back, right?

274
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,870
I said I'm tired of it.

275
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,680
I have a headache whenever I see you.

276
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm going to beat you.

277
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,990
Don't make another move.

278
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,880
I can't guarantee

279
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,520
what I'm going to do next.

280
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,450
Who I'm tired of is myself who's always worried about gains and losses,

281
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,410
not you.

282
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,210
Ms. Luo,

283
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,000
are you here?

284
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,280
♫They said where I should turn my face to♫

285
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,800
♫They said where I should look at♫

286
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,820
It's a clean shave.

287
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,220
♫They have many principles♫

288
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,460
Coming. Wait a minute.

289
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,820
♫Ignoring how far the dreams are♫

290
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,190
♫They said where I should put my hands♫

291
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,980
♫They said no secret should be in my heart♫

292
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,080
Is Zeng Shixing...

293
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,010
okay?

294
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,840
He doesn't look well.

295
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,280
Did he get hurt too?

296
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,160
Really?

297
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,420
Why didn't I notice it?

298
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,400
Even you can't tell.

299
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,890
Then his problem is quite serious.

300
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,440
I compiled some successful cases

301
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,290
of recovering to the normal level

302
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,280
from an operation on the ruptured or fractured Achilles tendons.

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,570
I hope they can be helpful.

304
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,720
The operation is very important.

305
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,400
But the recovery and rehabilitation after the operation

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,530
are more important.

307
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,920
Thank you

308
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,290
for telling me this

309
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,640
patiently.

310
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,330
Is Xue Yiran

311
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,460
still unwilling to have an operation?

312
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,490
I think you know

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,650
better about his problem than him now.

314
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,220
But it's his foot after all.

315
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,450
As his friends,

316
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,370
we can only respect his choice.

317
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,130
We can't force him to lie on the operating table, right?

318
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,120
What disgusting thing are you looking at?

319
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,890
This is what your Achilles tendon is like.

320
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,600
This is the Achilles tendon.

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,610
These are bones.

322
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,690
This part of Xue Yiran's Achilles tendon

323
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,170
is ruptured.

324
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,610
I'm dizzy.

325
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,090
The car is waiting at the gate of the hospital.

326
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,950
The discharge procedure is done.

327
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,970
Let's go.

328
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,600
Okay.

329
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,250
[Orthopedics 02]

330
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,720
Finally, I left this boring place.

331
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,250
What should we eat tonight?

332
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,680
Tonight,

333
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,750
why don't we ask Tianfu,

334
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,190
Ziji, and Fatty

335
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,630
to have hot pot together?

336
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,560
You can't get angry

337
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,760
just because I won't have an operation.

338
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
It's your foot.

339
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,580
Why would I be angry?

340
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,910
But you look like

341
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,180
you're angry.

342
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,330
Sir,

343
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,410
you're driving towards the wrong direction.

344
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,850
This is not the direction

345
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,290
to Xinghe University.

346
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,600
Sir, don't listen to him.

347
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,490
Just drive according to the address I gave you.

348
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,490
You kidnapped me.

349
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,020
Where are you taking me?

350
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,830
Are you taking me

351
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,050
to the hospital for an operation?

352
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,610
Sir,

353
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,490
drop me off.

354
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
You can barely move.

355
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,920
If we drop you off now,

356
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,850
where can you go?

357
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,690
You'll know when we get there.

358
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,890
I'm not taking you to have an operation.

359
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,190
Isn't this place...

360
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,410
Why did you bring me here?

361
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,890
To recuperate?

362
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's go.

363
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,580
Wang has arranged everything for us.

364
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,730
Wang knows you brought me here?

365
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,090
The car was prepared by Fatty.

366
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,370
You Qian?

367
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
Do you still remember

368
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,430
we spent a night

369
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,780
in He Miao's bathhouse?

370
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,730
You asked me

371
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,010
if you needed to meditate with me.

372
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,410
Yes.

373
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,750
You said I didn't need to do that,

374
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,210
but you didn't tell me why.

375
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,840
Yes.

376
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,690
I was jealous.

377
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,600
I didn't want you to be too happy.

378
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,500
Now I can tell you why.

379
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,650
Well...

380
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,850
what about Xue Yiran?

381
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,680
Does he need to meditate here

382
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,760
like me?

383
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,320
In this world,

384
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,100
there are many types of people

385
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,480
and brains.

386
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,220
Some people are naturally reliant

387
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,320
on emotions to motivate themselves.

388
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,250
Let's take Wu Tianfu as an example.

389
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,250
His results in individual races were not as good as those in relay races.

390
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,620
Because teammates

391
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,040
can stimulate his potential.

392
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,850
But Xue Yiran

393
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
is the type of people in the minority

394
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,320
who can directly enter the ZONE state

395
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,530
as soon as he stands on the track.

396
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,530
Because he was born with a strong heart.

397
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,500
Stage fright has nothing to do with him.

398
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,850
He is perfect

399
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,740
for heavyweight competitions.

400
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,290
I don't know

401
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,880
what he has been through.

402
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
Maybe

403
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,220
he has already suffered a lot.

404
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,330
Usually, people like him

405
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,680
were already under a lot of pressure

406
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,240
when they were little.

407
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,320
Their brains have become very resilient to pressure

408
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,040
before they know it.

409
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,580
So,

410
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,830
usually, you don't know

411
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,470
what is on Xue Yiran's mind.

412
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,000
He doesn't show his emotions easily.

413
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,330
He always wears a smile.

414
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,990
No matter how big the occasion is,

415
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,310
it doesn't matter to him.

416
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,840
Do you know how much I envy you?

417
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,630
You were born with a strong heart.

418
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,650
But I

419
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,510
have to go through a lot to have it.

420
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,610
But...

421
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,400
so what?

422
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,130
I will lose

423
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,510
what I like

424
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,810
and cherish.

425
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,770
Even if I have an operation,

426
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,880
I'll have to leave

427
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,430
the tracks.

428
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,400
All I have left

429
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,500
is my promise.

430
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,880
All I can catch

431
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,040
is also my promise.

432
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
No.

433
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,710
The script of your life

434
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,610
is not losing.

435
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,030
Just because of the people

436
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,900
and things

437
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,320
that made you suffer

438
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,050
and left you in the past,

439
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,960
you

440
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,500
have gained

441
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,940
a brain very resilient to pressure

442
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,150
and a strong heart

443
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,780
that make

444
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,120
every athlete

445
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,320
envious.

446
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,570
Misfortune

447
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,090
might be

448
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,130
a blessing

449
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,560
in disguise.

450
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,130
So,

451
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
don't always think about losing

452
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,730
and live pessimistically.

453
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,480
Go have an operation.

454
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,730
We'll help you win the competition

455
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,920
in August.

456
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,250
Let's win together.

457
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,020
How?

458
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,530
I've read a lot of surgical documents.

459
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,000
As long as you recover well,

460
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
you can participate in the competition

461
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,370
in August.

462
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
If I can only get a result of 12 or 13 seconds,

463
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,480
what's the use?

464
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,370
I think I can lead you to victory,

465
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,300
just like you thought

466
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,400
you could lead Fei Zhe to victory back then.

467
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Do you think Xue Yiran

468
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,840
is someone

469
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,700
who would care about his ranking?

470
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,130
No.

471
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,640
But Ziji,

472
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,440
I still can't let him avoid having the operation.

473
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,040
You told me so much today.

474
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,560
I can only say

475
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,450
I understand why he made this decision.

476
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,160
But it doesn't mean I'll let him

477
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,220
do something that will hurt himself.

478
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,320
Because

479
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,320
I can't forget

480
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,640
how he got me out

481
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,240
of the darkness back then.

482
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,370
If I had followed

483
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,410
my choice,

484
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,370
I can't imagine

485
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,650
how regretful

486
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,170
I would be today.

487
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,400
He is

488
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,910
in the same situation now.

489
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,010
What are friends?

490
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,110
Friends know you

491
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,020
and understand you.

492
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,810
Friends help you

493
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,810
when you're walking into the abyss.

494
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,040
Friends have the courage to say no to you

495
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,800
when you act rashly.
