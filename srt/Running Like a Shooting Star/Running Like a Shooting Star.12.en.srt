Why do you like people calling you Sister so much?

to get him out of the track-and-field ground

163
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,580

170

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,680
♫Willing to be crazy♫

193
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,560
What's the level of Zeng Shixing?

194
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,980
Zeng Shixing

195
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,730
is at the top level among college students.

196
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,260
He used to be as good as me.

197
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,690
But now,

198
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
it's hard to tell.

199
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,060
After all, I took a long break

200
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,200
while he has been training systematically.

201
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,260
So...

202
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,770
it's hard to tell.

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,660
Even you are unsure that you can defeat him?

204
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,530
Of course.

205
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,660
You're still up?

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,140
You've been chatting with that agent

207
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,000
for a long time?

208
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,050
No.

209
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,540
I went to visit Grandma.

210
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,380
So...

211
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,790
What?

212
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,460
Were you afraid that I was abducted by the agent?

213
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,140
You...

214
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,970
It's more like you'd abduct that agent.

215
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,770
Can you

216
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,790
stop always thinking of me

217
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,390
in a bad way?

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,960
Why did you add those lines

219
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,740
when you were performing today?

220
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,100
Maybe,

221
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,220
at that moment,

222
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,780
I was possessed by Tang Bohu's soul.

223
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,180
Really?

224
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Yes.

225
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,030
I read Tang Bohu's biography.

226
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,170
He had

227
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,330
such a tragic life.

228
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,350
However,

229
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,180
maybe only such a sad life

230
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,560
could create

231
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,240
such an unrestrained artist.

232
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,250
What I said

233
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,050
was just a summary of his life.

234
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,050
I didn't expect

235
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,840
that you even went to read the biography.

236
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,450
You're really worth Fatty's pay.

237
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,220
Do you know

238
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,060
how Wen Zhengming's life ended?

239
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,480
At the end of his life,

240
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,450
he was writing an epitaph for someone,

241
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,110
but before he could finish it,

242
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,460
he put down the brush and died, seated.

243
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,190
He was 89 years old when he died.

244
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,820
His life

245
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,860
is quite different from Tang Bohu's.

246
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,290
They were born in the same year.

247
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,660
Their personalities and

248
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,020
their lives were very different,

249
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,870
but they were bosom friends for years.

250
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,660
I think Tang Bohu

251
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,170
should be grateful

252
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,970
for the last line you said today.

253
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,940
I said that to you.

254
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,260
To me?

255
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,530
With your weak alcohol tolerance,

256
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,250
how can you drink with me for the rest of your life?

257
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,250
You don't want it?

258
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,180
I won't accompany you then.

259
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,420
Yes.

260
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,300
Of course I want it.

261
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,090
Did Zeng Shixing

262
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,770
try to kill you today?

263
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,050
No.

264
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,260
Instead, I...

265
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
accepted his challenge.

266
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,300
Is the tiger coming down the mountain?

267
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,260
Because I can't wait to see

268
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,060
how fast I can run

269
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,450
when I am in the zone.

270
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,650
Yeah.

271
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,100
Since the hostel training,

272
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,270
every training of yours

273
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,260
has been very effective.

274
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,490
Now,

275
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,300
no one knows

276
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,660
how capable you are.

277
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,320
Even I started to get a little scared.

278
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,220
You?

279
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,650
Stop pretending.

280
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,620
Welcome to

281
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,850
[March 9, Spring Track and Field Tournament]

282
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,420
the Changzhou Spring Track and Field Tournament.

283
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,370
All the athletes, please go to the registration office to register.

284
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,390
♫Leaving worries behind♫

285
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,310
♫Doing whatever you want can make you happy♫

♫I made a wish upon a shooting star♫

287
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,860
March in Changzhou is so pleasant.

288
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,050
♫And dreams have grown wings♫

289
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,690
♫Courage has increased the speed♫

♫I keep running as fast as I can all the time♫

291
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,280
♫Who am I running for and who will I stop for?♫

292
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,950
That's Frizzle, right?

293
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,780
It's them.

294
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,980
♫And for whom will you become mature?♫

295
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,390
Where is He Miao?

296
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,090
It's none of my business.

297
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,460
He said he was coming to the competition today.

298
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,760
♫Just chase after the sunset♫

299
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,290
♫Move forward and don't be nervous♫

♫You won't get lost♫

307
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,100
Tianfu.

308
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,180
Let's warm up.

309
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,450
He Miao will contact you

310
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,050
when he sees the missed call.

311
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,690
Zeng Shixing is here.

312
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,570
Zeng Shixing?

313
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,090
Isn't that Zeng Shixing?

314
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,070
Why is he here?

315
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,450
Hello, He Miao.

316
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,460
Where are you?

317
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,350
Tianfu. Tianfu.

318
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,020
I'm here.

319
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,200
I thought you weren't coming.

320
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,490
Of course I am.

321
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,390
I want to beat you in 100 meters.

322
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,770
Isn't that He Miao?

323
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,260
Why did you take the subway by yourself?

324
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,980
The subway station is far from here.

325
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,920
I'll just take it as a warm-up.

326
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,860
Did they bully you

327
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,870
and didn't let you take the bus?

328
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,210
They

329
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,100
feel uneasy to see me,

330
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,260
so I won't bother them.

331
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,500
If anyone sees me

332
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,860
and has their mood affected,

333
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
it'll be bad.

334
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,370
He Miao.

335
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,510
Which team do you belong to?

336
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,320
Come back to your own team.

337
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,220
Wait.

338
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,990
Why didn't you let He Miao take the bus?

339
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,410
Stop it.

340
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,319
Why are you so excited?

341
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,210
He wanted to take the subway himself.

342
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,609
How could we control him?

343
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
How is it possible that he takes the subway

344
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,329
when the school offers a coach?

345
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,369
Stop it.

346
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,740
It means you've been bullying him

347
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,089
for a long time.

348
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,339
You only bully the weak.

349
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,380
What kind of ability is that?

350
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,849
Don't get it wrong.

351
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,700
He Miao is from Huainan.

352
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,870
Don't meddle in something that doesn't concern you.

353
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,090
I'm fine.

354
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,790
As long as they let me compete in the game

355
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,870
and run,

356
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,850
I don't care about those things.

357
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,700
Don't make unnecessary conflicts

358
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,940
because of me.

359
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,450
You know?

360
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,340
My dad told me

361
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,510
that weakness when facing a sin

362
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,030
is more terrible than the sin itself.

363
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,490
What does it have to do with you

364
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,100
that we marginalize the jinx?

365
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,940
Do you know?

366
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,610
People

367
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,820
will hate the person

368
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,660
who brings bad luck to them.

369
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,030
Whenever we see him,

370
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,830
all of us feel unlucky.

371
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,140
He's my friend.

372
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,970
You just can't bully him.

373
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,260
Only newbies

374
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,190
pick on others all the time.

375
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,980
Any unusual situation

376
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,720
can affect the performance of a newbie.

377
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,460
They just don't know

378
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,300
that in competitive sports,

379
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,970
strength

380
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,970
determines everything.

381
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,450
Stop pretending.

382
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,670
You were exhausted after running last time.

383
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,290
You didn't even compete in the finals.

384
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,220
You were so lame.

385
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,710
Do you think we've lost our memories?

386
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,310
It's not for you to judge

387
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,460
whether he is lame or not.

388
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,580
In your team,

389
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,670
even if there were no He Miao,

390
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,330
there would be Zhang Miao

391
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,140
or Li Miao.

392
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,260
You just need an vent

393
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,450
to make excuses

394
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,770
for your own lameness.

395
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,460
Don't you think I'm lame?

396
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,450
If I beat all of you,

397
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,710
then in the future, you can't hinder

398
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,390
He Miao from participating in any competition.

399
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,970
Don't panic.

400
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,740
He can't even compete in the finals.

401
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,870
Besides, last time,

402
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
if it weren't for He Miao's mistake,

403
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,260
we wouldn't have ended up with no points.

404
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,490
With your physical strength,

405
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,950
how dare you challenge me?

406
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,490
Fine. Let's compete.

407
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,540
Do they know

408
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,300
Qi Tian is as fast as me?

409
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,260
Do you think they will take you seriously?

410
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,860
You're right.

411
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,620
Coach,

412
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,500
my hand is almost recovered.

413
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,160
When will you allow me to play?

414
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,540
Soon,

415
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,540
but not today.

416
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,070
You can take a good look at No. 330.

417
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,490
His release speed is extremely fast.

418
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,020
Awesome! Amazing!

419
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,790
Just run as best as you can.

420
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,450
I'll wait for you at the finish line.

421
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,100
Are you not joining the competition

422
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,290
because of me?

423
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
I'm fine.

424
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,050
I won't throw up anymore.

425
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,450
The only reason I'm here

426
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,490
is the 4 x 100 m relay race.

427
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,980
The rest

428
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,060
doesn't matter.

429
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,940
The registration for men's 100 meters preliminaries

430
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,300
has started now.

431
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,530
Athletes, please go to the registration office to register.

432
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,660
Qi Tian,

433
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,530
remember your state when you were meditating every day.

434
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,860
That state

435
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,590
is your best state.

436
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,740
Come on.

437
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,840
Do your best.

438
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,330
The next event is

439
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,040
Heat One of men's 100 meters preliminaries.

440
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,250
Liu Haoyu's best result is 10.36 seconds.

441
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,740
Zeng Shixing's best result is 10.19 seconds.

442
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,350
What kind of Heat is this?

443
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,300
Come on! Come on!

444
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,580
Qi Tian, come on!

445
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,830
Go! Go! Go!

446
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,070
Where is Xue Yiran?

447
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,450
Don't you need to pay attention to me?

448
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,460
I heard you were angry

449
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,090
last time when I didn't go to the finals?

450
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,260
How do you know that?

451
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,220
After the race,

452
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,620
I can tell you the secret.

453
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:25,060
Come on. Come on.

454
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,430
On your marks.

455
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,100
Set.

456
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,300
Go! Go!

457
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,470
Zeng Shixing, come on!

458
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,470
Shixing is not in a good state today.

459
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,660
Gosh.

460
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,810
Who is that guy in lane two?

461
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,740
Why is he so fast?

462
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,450
Even Liu Haoyu and Zeng Shixing

463
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,680
can't outrace him!

464
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,250
Zeng Shixing is catching up.

465
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,910
Can Zeng Shixing surpass him?

466
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,300
He's in a unusually terrible state today.

467
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,360
He's very nervous.

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,900
Liu Haoyu and Qi Tian are neck and neck.
