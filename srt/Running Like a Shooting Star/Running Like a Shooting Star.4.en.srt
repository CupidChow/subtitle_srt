What?

5
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's practise.

6
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,370
Get up and practise.

7
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,490
Get up.

8
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,310
It's too early to get up.

9
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,070
Bro.

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,610
No one wants to practise with you now.

11
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,680

am I here

15
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,880
at four o'clock in the morning?

16

Let's go.

Let's enjoy the sunrise in the track-and-field ground everyday.

18

Why did I help you?

19
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,490
Isn't it good to have a peaceful life?

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,090
Let's go.

21
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,630
Where are you going?

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,210
To see how the track-and-field ground is like at 4 a.m.

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:05,800
Let's go.

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,800
What are you hiding?

25
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,140
I've been wondering

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,950
why you are so interested in where I go.

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,500
You didn't blame us for making noises

28
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,230
but asked where we were going at four a.m.

29
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,040
No wonder

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,460
I can always

31
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,750
come across Xue Yiran.

32
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,970
It turns out that he has a wingman.

33
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,790
Well...

34
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,850

Yiran?

37
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,260
You sold me out so easily.

38
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,400
He also sent me a set of go

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,750
made of agate.

40
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,590
I'll try to get up at 2 a.m. next time

41
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,660
and see if Lin Pei will wake you up to the toilet.

42
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,190
Lin Pei

43
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,140
is exposed.

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,460
You asked Lin Pei to recommend the Track and Field Club to me.

45
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,550
After that,

46
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,250
you joined the club too.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,730
You've spared no effort

48
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,950
to establish this relay team.

49
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,590
To be honest,

50
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,590
Wu Tianfu was out of the plan.

51
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,910
I didn't do anything.

52
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,180
Without him,

53
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,790
there would be others.

54
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,110
Anyway,

55
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,070
you're just unscrupulous.

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,120
Don't be rude.

57
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,149
You deliberately approached me

58
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,510
because of my ankles.

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,260
You want me to join the club

60
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,510
so that you can form a relay team, right?

61
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,710
Yes

62
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,670
and no.

63
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,130
After getting along with you,

64
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,720
I think you are

65
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,310
naive and upright.

66
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,070
You never give up easily.

67
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,030
Nowadays,

68
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,230
only few people remain to be pure as you.

69
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,150
You should be protected as a friend.

70
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,600
You're so eloquent.

71
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,510

78
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,150
I'm telling you clearly

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,920
that I won't participate in any running race.

80
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,130
I applied for this university

81
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,600
because I wanted to start a new life besides running.

82
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,310
No race.

83
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,200
No competition.

84
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,390
No pep talk.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,150
You ran so well.

86
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,160
Don't you think it's a pity?

87
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,810
I'm just a son of a grocery store's owner.

88
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,590
In the future,

89
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,240
chances are that I have to go back home and run the grocery store.

90
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,470
My life is too miserable

91
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,390

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,690
Why did you leave early this morning?

94
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,790
Even if he asked Lin Pei about your whereabouts,

95
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,190
there's no need for you to be mad.

96
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,020
I often ask him where you are.

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,760
Don't be angry.

98
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,550
I'm not angry.

Excuse me.

Didn't you stop running?

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,030
Why do you join the Track and Field Club now?

117
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,630
Shen Ming?

118
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,840
Long time no see.

119
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,380
What brings you here?

120
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,110
Stop!

121
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,159

This is women's locker.

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,480
Show some respect.

126
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,580
Someone kept you running crazily

127
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,310
even if you have given up on running.

128
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,510
Who on earth is he?

129
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,440
Are you following me again?

130
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,900
It's your right

131
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
to reject me.

132
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,520
But it's my right

133
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,260
to follow you.

134
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,550
Whatever.

135
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,510
I don't care.

136
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,370
I advise you

137
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,020
to beg me not to make a sound now.

138
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,610
Are you sure here's the right place?

139
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,210
Did we go the wrong way?

No one is here.

I am sure.

Let's wait here.

143
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,850
You've been thinking about catching up with Qi Tian for a long time,

144
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,810
but you still failed.

145

He is awesome in the first 30 meters.

146
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,800
Why is he talking nonsense?

147
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,040
What does he mean by "the first 30 meters?"

148
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,770
Qi Tian is awesome beyond that.

149
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,190
Shut up.

150
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,110
Don't be clingy.

151
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,110
Stay away from me.

152
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,500
Why are you acting stealthily?

153
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,280
Who is that guy?

154
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,740
What's your relationship with him?

155
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,710
A mix of you and Wu Tianfu.

156
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,470
What do you think about him?

157
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
What do you mean?

158
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,200
A clingy man who looks excited all day.

159
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,390
I'm not feeling well.

160
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,070
It's him.

161
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,510
So you are from the Track and Field Team of Shenglin University.

162
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,630
Shenglin Track and Field Team is famous for its capability.

163
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,230
I wanted to apply for Shenglin before.

164
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,020
But

165
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,360
my family asked me to study economic management.

166
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,200
Qi Tian is not here.

167
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,230
We don't know when he'll come.

168
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,070
So he really joined the Track and Field Club?

169
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,950
What a liar!

170
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,680
He's running again.

171
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,510
You also know Qi Tian is good at running?

172
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,870
Good is not a proper word

173
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,070
to describe Qi Tian's

174
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,210
running speed.

175
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,870
How should it be described?

176
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,350
It is not worth wasting my time on

177
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,150
a layman like you.

178
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,590
Bro.

179
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,090
I'm not happy with what you said.

180
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,000
Why are you so arrogant?

181
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,530
Don't forget you are sitting in our club.

182
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,340
That's right.

183
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,030
Go outside to wait for Qi Tian.

184
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,750
Goodbye.

185
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,350

with an amazing reaction time

188
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,190
and a super high stride frequency.

189
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,630
He ran 100 meters within 10.7 seconds in high school.

190
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,230
He was chosen three times by the national team.

191
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,490
He is said to be

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
a man born for sprint.

193
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,510
I know he's good at running.

194
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,150
But judging from his messy teeth and hair

195
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,330
and the fact that he plays Fighting the Landlord all the time,

196
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,990
he doesn't look like a legend.

197
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,150
Ai Ziji

198
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,150
is not a shrewd judge of character at all.

199
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,080
Don't take what he said seriously.

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,810
If what you said is true,

201
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,310
why didn't this one-in-a-million

202
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,360
go to Shenglin

203
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,620
but chose our university instead?

204
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,470
This is also something

205
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,580
I want to ask him this time.

206
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,310
By the way,

207
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,580
who are you?

208
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,760
Why do you have to find Qi Tian?

209
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,820
What's your relationship with Qi Tian?

210
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,540
What kind of fetters of fate do you have?

211
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,140
Please.

212
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,510
Qi Tian and I have been neighbors since middle school.

213
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm from a sports family.

214
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,450
I was trained by my dad since I was young.

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,920
Later, Qi Tian's mother thought running

216
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,350
could make him stronger,

217
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,920
so she allowed Qi Tian to practise with me.

218
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,110
During that time,

219
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,340
he was the consolation for my failure.

220
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,510
Ming. Ming.

221
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,530
Did your dad hit you again?

222
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,270
I lied to my dad that I didn't run well this time

223
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,610
and didn't make it within 12 seconds.

224
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,070
My dad said I was a loser.

225
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,990
But

226
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,430
what he didn't know

227
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,230
is that my PB was even

228
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,270
above 12.2 seconds.

229
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,210
Is your dad a devil?

230
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,670
Don't cry.

231
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,090
After all, I will be the last one, not you.

232
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,660
Do you think

233
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,510
I am really a loser?

234
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,790
Why bother thinking about that?

235
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,870
Who says you will be a loser if you can't get a good result?

236
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,410
I think running is interesting.

237
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,470
I feel happy when running. That's it.

238
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,460
Look.

239
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,910
These are snacks

240
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,230
I took from my grocery store.

241
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,230
Let's share them.

242
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,670
Thank you.

243
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,580
It was Qi Tian who accompanied me through that bottleneck period.

244
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,270
But changes always came silently.

245
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,160
[Years Later]

246
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,550
[First Year Class 3]

247
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,230
Hello, everyone.

248
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,630
From now on, I'll be your substitute coach.

249
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,290
Warm up now.

250
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,160
Start.

251
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,670
Ready.

252
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:29,910
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

253
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,030
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

254
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,270
Qi Tian.

255
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,310
Come here.

256
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
The rest of you continue warming up.

257
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,830
Qi Tian.

258
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,400
Let's practise how to start faster today.

259
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,350
I want you to sprint 20 meters

260
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,620
for five times.

261
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,820
You must be wondering

262
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,970
why I called you out to practise alone.

263
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,750
As you all know,

264
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,150
the starting speed

265
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,030
is very important for sprinters.

266
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,030
And that

267
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,650
is determined by your step-on power

268
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,470
and reaction time.

269
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,340
If you didn't pass just now,

270
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,090
I wouldn't have told you this.

271
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,750
Madam.

272
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,110
What do you mean?

273
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,970
I'm getting more confused.

274
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,650
Because after my observation,

275
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,390
I've found

276
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,870
that you have stronger ankles than others.

277
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,590
And your reaction time is shorter.

278
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,860
Although I didn't calculate it precisely,

279
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,190
with my experience,

280
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,380
your reaction time is 0.02 to 0.03 seconds shorter

281
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,900
than ordinary people.

282
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,950
There's nothing special

283
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,190
with my ankles.

284
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,980
Seventy percent of the explosive power

285
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,280
of our ankle joints

286
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,510
can be trained,

287
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,640
while thirty percent relies on genes.

288
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,650
Qi Tian.

289
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,030
You are a born sprinter.

290
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,000
Am I that brilliant?

291
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,320
You haven't been trained systematically.

292
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,580
You're still growing.

293
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,990
You don't have enough muscle strength.

294
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,520
I wish

295
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,470
I could make you

296
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,430
a top sprinter in China

297
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,540
in two and a half years.

298
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,280
I wonder if you're willing.

299
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,170
You really deserve my adoration.

300
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,110
I didn't expect that such a careless guy

301
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,630
could have Golden Ankles.

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,110
What happened next?

303
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,750
Why does Qi Tian

304
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,370
not even want to meet you now?

305
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,820
Ordinary people make progress step by step,

306
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,730
while geniuses advance by leaps.

307
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,190
Ming.

308
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,350
Are you Qi Tian?

309
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,850
You ran within 10.7 seconds as a sophomore.

310
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,750
Join us.

311
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,900
Our provincial team

312
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,680
is equipped with the best coaches,

313
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,150
therapists, doctors,

314
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,480
and nutritionists.

315
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,920
-Look. -I've seen you run.

316
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,230
You crossed the finishing line like a bolt of lightning.

317
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,710
As long as you fill in the application for our university,

318
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,750
I'm sure you will be admitted without taking the exam.

319
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,750
Come to our university.

320
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,430
Take a look.

321
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,670
This is our university.

322
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,480
Take a look.

323
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,859
This is our university.

324
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,430
Come to our university.

325
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,790
And our coaches are all top-notch.

326
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,950
Look at our faculty members.

327
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,990
They are famous for their capabilities.

328
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,510
Come to know more about our university.

329
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,230
Take a look at mine.

330
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,010
Take a look.

331
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,099
Take a look at mine.

332
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,740
What's wrong?

333
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,350
Nothing.

334
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,710
Let's play games next week.

335
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,790
I've been preparing for the race.

336
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,050
It's been a long time since I took a break.

337
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,150
Let's

338
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,350
stay up all night

339
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,030
and have fun.

340
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,030
What do you think?

341
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,590
Don't pretend to be nice.

342
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,920
What do you mean?

343
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,550
Why should I work hard to get what I want

344
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,360
while you can live a carefree life without the slightest effort?

345
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,790
You used to be my supporting role,

346
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,070
the one who always performed worse than me.

347
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,330
Now you become a superstar in the school.

348
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,150
No, bro.

349
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,510
This talent is not what I want.

350
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,870
I'm annoyed at being surrounded by a group of people every day.

351
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,090
Let's go.

352
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,800
Forget about those people outside.

353
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,790
Let's play games.

354
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,670
Let's go.

355
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,030
Stop being hypocritical!

356
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,950
Listen.

357
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,030
I won't be

358
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,300
the second forever.

359
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,590
I will work harder

360
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,750
to make up for the congenital gap.

361
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Let's not meet each other

362
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,590
before the results come out.

363
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,920
But when I challenged Qi Tian to a race,

364
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
he said he wouldn't run anymore.

365
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,220
-Why? -Why?

366
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,150
Why?

367
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,950
What's wrong with your colleage application?

368
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,700
It's literally

369
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,750
what it means.

370
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,760
Xinghe University?

371
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,020
I've asked around.

372
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,550
It's a place where you will waste your talent.

373
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,740
Yes.

374
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,790
Didn't I tell you

375
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,990
that I wouldn't run anymore?

376
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,620
It's time to plan for the future.

377
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,960
Why?

378
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,270
I can't accept it.

379
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,810
Neither can I.

380
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,780
How could Qi Tian

381
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,280
give up so easily?

382
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,730
I understand now.

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,730
He has been following you

384
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,160
because he wants you to return to the ground

385
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,690
and compete with him again.

386
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,030
He knows nothing.

387
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,150
Since

388
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,110
he wants you to run again,

389
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,500
he's my friend.

390
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,920
What?

391
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
Hello, everyone.

392
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,070
Qi Tian is here.

393
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,330
Are you Xue Yiran?

394
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,430
Yes, I am.

395
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,900
There are many geniuses hidden in the Track and Field Club.

396
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,030
I didn't expect that you were a legend.

397
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,510
The real genius is by my side,

398
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,720
but I've turned a blind eye to that.

399
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,820
Here, Tian.

400
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,980
Step on these cushions.

401
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,750
The ground is too hard.

402
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,810
Don't let it hurt your Golden Ankles.

403
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Didn't you hear that?

404
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,650
He said he wouldn't run anymore.

405
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,270
Are you hiding something?

406
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,990
Were you injured?

407
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,020
Did something happen to your family?

408
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,610
Did you have a car accident?

409
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,010
Did you owe a loan shark

410
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,670
and being chased by the gangsters?

411
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,310
I have money.

412
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,200
Qi Tian.

413
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,350
Didn't you say you were injured

414
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,300
so that you couldn't run anymore?

415
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,700
Why do you join the Track and Field Club now?

416
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
Yeah.

417
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,410
I was injured.

418
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,460
This Track and Field Club

419
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,870
is rubbish.

420
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,810
As you said,

421
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,110
Xinghe is by no means a good place for training.

422
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,550
I don't believe it.

423
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,740
How can Xue Yiran be here if that's true?

424
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,270
My team doctor

425
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,930
is here to give you a check-up.

426
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,680
Why should I be examined by your team doctor?

427
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,470
I refuse.

428
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,340
This is my team doctor.

429
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,720
What?

430
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,810
You're the team doctor?

431
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,240
Then hurry up and have a check on me.

432
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,520
No need.

433
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,790
Judging from how you ran,

434
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,520
I know

435
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,650
he has been lying to you all the time.

436
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,270
Miss.

437
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,990
Why did you sell me out?

438
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,470
I'm sorry.

439
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,570
I'm 29 years old.

440
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,040
Call me madam.

441
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,420
Your ankles are perfect.

442
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,130
They are the best among those I've dissected.

443
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,550
Dissection?

444
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,140
You are so tough.

445
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,570
Qi Tian.

446
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,020
Shen Ming.

447
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,730
Calm down.

448
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,870
If I told you

449
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,950
that I just didn't want to run anymore,

450
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,680
you wouldn't have believed me.

451
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,060
That's why I lied to you.

452
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,900
And I've been idling for a long time.

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,040
I am rusty now.

454
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,590
Don't be modest.

455
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,630
Didn't you

456
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,760
run with Tianfu several days ago?

457
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,880
You ran very well.

458
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,690
How can you still lie to me?

459
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,990
Compete with me.

460
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,350
Results won't lie.

461
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,450
Please spare me.

462
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,440
Pleasant to the eye.

463
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,670
You want to run with Qi Tian, don't you?

464
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,650
So do I.

465
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,590
Looks like we're on the same side.

466
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,660
As long as you listen to me,

467
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,560
I can let Qi Tian

468
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,410
run with you.

469
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,900
You're back.
