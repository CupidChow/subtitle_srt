00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,620
Set.

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,500
Qi Tian.

6
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,420
Look.

7
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,060
The angle between your knee and your power leg

8
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
is 84.6 degrees.

9
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,380
The angle between your knee and your lead leg

10
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,470
is 112 degrees.

11
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,530
The length of your first step

12
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,290
is 1.07 meters.

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
The second is

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,820
1.12 meters.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,540
The accumulative length

16
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,870
of the first seven steps

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,970
is 9.24 meters.

18
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,520
Your average step length

19
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,720
is

20
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,350
2.08 meters.

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,210
Compared with

the data

23
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,800
of the world's best athletes,

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
you have some problems.

25
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,120
Your starting posture is not correct.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,060
The length of the first seven steps is not long enough.

27
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,560
You fail to generate enough momentum when you push off the ground.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
Neither your breathing nor speed rhythm in the whole process

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,250
is ideal.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Sir.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,650
Even Qi Tian has so many problems.

32
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,650
We must be worse.

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,650
It'll be your turn soon.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
You have more serious problems.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Sir.

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,570
Please point out my shortcomings.

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,020
From now on,

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,890
I will be more strict with you.

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Qi Tian.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
You tend to hold your breath

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,730
when you run.

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,590
Due to the lack of fresh air

43
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,560
and strength,

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,090
you often feel dizzy

45
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,640
in the last dozens of meters.

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,960
This can affect your speed and endurance indirectly,

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
leading to a poor performance

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
in the last dozens of meters.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Within the first 35 meters,

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,170
you need to stretch your legs and accelerate

51
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,170
while breathing for the first time.

52
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,840
You need to be in the transfer phase

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,300
within the next 10 meters.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,920
From 45th to 70th meters,

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,240
make sure your hip joints are powerful enough to generate more forward momentum,

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,300
while breathing for the second time.

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,400
From 70th to 95th meters, make sure your hip joints are more flexible,

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
while breathing for the third time,

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,760
and finally sprint the last five meters.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,810
When you should take a breath

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,990
must be in your muscle memory.

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,930
Have you noticed

63
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,050
that Qi Tian has changed recently?

64
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,120
He's totally different from

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,399
what he was

66
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,940
when I first met him.

67
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,290
Now

68
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,890
he practises twice a day.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,690
After his training, he goes to class and takes care of Xue Yiran.

70
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,020
There are so many classes in freshman year.

71
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,080
He also has to study physiotherapy at Luo Bing's place.

72
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,820
Do you remember

73
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,960
what he looked like

74
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,290
when he joined the club?

75
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,720
Sir.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,240
I want to join the Track and Field Club.

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,320
I think we can become friends in spite of our age difference.

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,380
Which event do you plan to sign up for?

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,760
They must be

80
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,110
Fighting the Landlord and skincare.

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,409
Cringy.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,330
I think I can understand

83
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,220
how he feels now.

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,490
Qi Tian.

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Why don't you go back now?

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
I can stay here

87
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,840
to take care of Yiran.

88
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm fine.

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,660
You may go back now.

90
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,830
But you look tired.

91
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,160
I persuaded him to do the surgery.

92
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,680
I made a choice for him.

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,840
I have to be responsible for him.

94
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,330
I must help him

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,690
return to the peak of his athletic career.

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,870
He sets a good example for us.

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,080
Let's practise now.

98
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,940
-Go! -Let's go.

99
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,050
Would you consider

100
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,050
the project?

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,970
What's your opinion?

102
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,850
We can

103
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,680
negotiate.

104
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,470
Okay?

105
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,240
Dad, I'm here.

106
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,700
Mr. Zhu, you are here today.

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,620
He's nearby,

108
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,240
so I asked him to come.

109
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,770
Let's have a meal together.

110
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,820
Hello, Mrs. You.

111
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,920
Mr. Zhu.

112
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,210
You are getting more and more handsome.

113
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,620
Where have you been

114
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,850
with Qian these days?

115
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,600
Mrs. You.

116
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,760
I really like Qian.

117
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,700
He is honest

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
and reliable.

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,450
Honest

120
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,690
and reliable.

121
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,970
Brat.

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't lead Qian astray.

123
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,250
Dad.

124
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,010
It's possible for anyone except Qian

125
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,930
to go astray because of me.

126
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
He has no interest

127
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,090
in pretty girls.

128
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,290
And he doesn't drink.

129
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,500
No, not totally uninterested.

130
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,730
It seems

131
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,960
that he has a strange taste.

132
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,590
There was a time

133
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,600
when I found him

134
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,060
peeping at the photo of a female shot putter.

135
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,560
That female athlete

136
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,330
looks chunky

137
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,480
and a little clumsy.

138
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,210
Not my type.

139
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,000
Not at all.

140
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,890
Mr. Zhu.

141
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,980
It seems that you still don't know

142
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,140
Qian well.

143
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,770
Yes.

144
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,990
He is a shot putter.

145
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,470
That's why

146
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,210
he often watches sports news.

147
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,230
There are still people practising shot put?

148
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,280
That day, I told him

149
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,640
that shot put should be cancelled.

150
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,040
Oh no.

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
By the way,

152
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,430
when I was young,

153
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,790
I was also a shot putter.

154
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,510
Back then,

155
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,020
I was no thinner than You Qian.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,400
That will be your problem

157
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
if you can't

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
appreciate the figure of shot putters.

159
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,300
He

160
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,530
doesn't mean that.

161
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,680
Look at your figure.

162
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,690
You are as astonishingly beautiful

163
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,280
as a princess.

164
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,060
Besides,

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
shot put is a sport

166
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,890
that requires the extreme accuracy of fingers.

167
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,540
Not a single shot putter

168
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,430
qualified for large-scale sport events is clumsy.

169
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,760
You Qian.

170
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,950
I asked you to make friends,

171
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,490
not to be a waiter.

172
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,440
Mom.

173
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,420
This shot

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
is still so dirty.

175
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,920
You will make friends with all kinds of people.

176
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,630
They will be complicated and from all walks of life.

177
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,590
How will you make them follow you?

178
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,960
By being a simp?

179
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,140
Do you think

180
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,720
they still want to treat you

181
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,650
if they cannot do business with me?

182
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,050
Qian.

183
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
I know you are kind.

184
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,290
But today I want to tell you

185
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,570
that how influential you can be

186
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,430
is the most essential for adults.

187
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,000
Come on. Drink.

188
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,950
Go on.

189
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,980
You must be mad at me.

190
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,480
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

191
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,040
Alright.

192
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,320
Mrs. You and my dad have criticized me.

193
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,450
Here's the thing.

194
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,390
I

195
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,730
only know how to enjoy life.

196
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,530
I know nothing about sports.

197
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,760
It's okay.

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,280
It's normal that you don't know much about shot put.

199
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,960
It's a little-known event.

200
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,170
I didn't take it seriously.

201
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,290
We're still friends.

202
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm going to sing a song.

203
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
Sure.

204
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,730
Good.

205
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,520
Great.

206
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
You sing well.

207
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,510
Mr. Zhu is awesome.

208
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
What's wrong?

209
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,090
It was him

210
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,090
who seduced Qian.

211
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,500
It hurts.

212
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,450
Be gentle.

213
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
They left.

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,290
But I warn you

215
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,240
not try to flirt with girls

216
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,640
who are either married

217
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,760
or in a relationship

218
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,330
in the future.

219
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,960
Got it.

220
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,190
I am finally convinced

221
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,070
of the strength of a shot putter.

222
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,520
My chest hurts.

223
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
I really can't do bench press.

224
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,520
Qian pressed 190 kg upwards

225
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,800
easily today.

226
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,920
Unbelievable.

227
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,240
Let's not

228
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,470
compete with a giant tough man like him.

229
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,820
Qian.

230
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,820
Do you want to eat something later?

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,070
You may go first.

232
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,870
I need more practice.

233
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,290
I've thought a lot

234
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,020
these days.

235
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,770
Why are there so many people

236
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
knowing nothing about shot put?

237
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,310
Actually, we can't

238
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,780
always pick on others.

239
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
I want to be stronger.

240
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,940
Let my strength speak.

241
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,560
[May]

242
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,570
Mom.

243
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,270
I'm not going on a trip.

244
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,580
It's crowded everywhere.

245
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,670
And I am given

246
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,210
only one day off.

247
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,570
No.

248
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,090
It's not that I don't want to accompany you.

249
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,220
Because the race is around the corner.

250
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,010
Alright.

251
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,920
I'll remember to apply sunscreen.

252
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,560
Bye. Bye.

253
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,860
Why are you riding so fast?

254
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,060
Is Hades calling you?

255
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,280
Are you Qi Tian?

256
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,560
It's rude to mistake me for someone else.

257
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,660
Then it's fine.

258
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,290
What do you mean?

259
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,630
There are only two types of people for me.

260
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,630
Those who run within 10.5 seconds and those who don't.

261
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,680
Who are you?

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,680
You're just a cyclist.

263
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm good at corner overtaking.

264
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,130
Even Xue Yiran needs to repsect me.

265
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,610
Are you the third-leg sprinter?

266
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,250
You...

267
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,250
Ziji.

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,080
This is...

269
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,780
Let's go inside.

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He only makes friends

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,400
with those who can run within 10.5 seconds.

272
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,210
I think he looks familiar.

273
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,210
Ziji.

274
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,880
Where's the information you've searched?

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,920
It's him.

276
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,690
A rising star of Zhongtian.

277
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,440
He's the one whose running posture

278
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,280
looks like Michael Johnson.

279
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,280
Look.

280
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,300
He's from Zhongtian University?

281
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,330
Why is he here?

282
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,640
You're recovering well.

283
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,410
The plaster cast worked well.

284
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,450
Keep wearing the walking boot.

285
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,770
Follow my advice.

286
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
Keep your knees warm.

287
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,850
Remember to soak your feet in warm water often.

288
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,050
It can prevent adhesions in ligaments.

289
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,920
Remember

290
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,890
not rush to act with explosive power.

291
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,080
Let the muscles grow.

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,570
Okay.

293
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,570
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

294
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,570
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

295
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,810
I'll keep an eye on him.

296
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,470
I won't let him do anything against your advise.

297
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
Luo Bing and others are on their way.

298
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,520
Let's go.

299
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,640
Congratulations.

300
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,570
You finally have the cast removed.

301
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,890
Thank you.

302
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,680
How are his physiotherapy skills?

303
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,360
Is he as good as me?

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,920
Not as good as

305
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,390
you, Ms. Luo.

306
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,220
Thank you for visiting me.

307
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,170
And

308
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,520
these are...

309
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,440
Let me introduce.

310
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,079
This is Bai Junyan

311
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,880
from Mingde Institute of Technology.

312
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,730
Mingde Institute of Technology?

313
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,050
So familiar.

314
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,200
I remembered!

315
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,530
You ran 40.76 seconds in the relay race.

316
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,650
Is he Bai Junyan

317
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,880
whose PB is 10.2 seconds?

318
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,119
This is Xu Yancheng.

319
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,720
He's the rising star of Zhongtian University.

320
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,210
Let me tell you.

321
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,050
Yancheng is really out of the ordinary.

322
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,920
We planned to come back in a sedan

323
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,450
after finishing the murder mystery game.

324
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,170
But he insisted

325
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,580
on coming to you by bike.

326
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,920
He rode all the way from east

327
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,050
to west.

328
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,250
I

329
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,860
just wanted to

330
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,950
enhance the driving force of my legs.

331
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Stop pretending.

332
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,270
Which one of you is Qi Tian?

333
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,890
After the rehabilitation,

334
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,820
you can get back to your best state.

335
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,120
In that case,

336
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,330
can he make it to the race

337
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,330
in August?

338
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,670
It's hard to say.

339
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,680
It depends on how well he will recover.

340
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,760
Normally speaking,

341
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,540
he can walk without crutches

342
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,530
in three months.

343
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,130
But it's still risky

344
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,740
to join in the race in August.

345
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,040
No matter how well I can recover,

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,610
I will go back to the running track

347
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,920
in August.

348
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
Even if he cannot

349
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,980
run within 12 seconds,

350
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,620
the rest three of us will win for him.

351
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,770
You still think you can win

352
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,440
in such a situation?

353
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
How do we know

354
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,490
if we don't try?

355
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,690
Everything is possible

356
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,400
for the relay.

357
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,070
Interesting.

358
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm not interested

359
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,460
in Xue Yiran's recovery.

360
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,250
I knew your result

361
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,730
in the Spring Games.

362
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,330
It's 40.89 seconds.

363
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,550
Now that we're here,

364
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,380
let's compete.

365
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Yancheng.

366
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,400
You've excited me.

367
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,540
Go! Pass it to me!

368
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,940
Hang in there.

369
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,870
Since Xue Yiran is injured,

370
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,440
let Shen Ming

371
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,770
be the first-leg sprinter.

372
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,870
Even if he could run in August,

373
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,210
he might not be as fast as Shen Ming.

374
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,730
Then the four of us form a team.

375
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,520
Let's see

376
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,380
how good the Xinghe relay team is.

377
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,000
You'd better do your best.

378
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,740
Let me know

379
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
why you are so arrogant.

380
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,910
Why are there so many people in the playground?

381
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
Isn't that Qi Tian?

382
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,740
The others around him look familiar too.

383
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,160
Ms. Luo.

384
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,920
Liu Haoyu.

385
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:38,850
Sir.

386
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,650
Hello.

387
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,530
This is the real Dream Team.

388
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,290
These four represent

389
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,080
the fastest speed in men's 100 meters

390
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,740
among all student-athletes.

391
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,600
Indeed.

392
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,790
It will be incredible

393
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
if they can form a team in the end.

394
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,810
I

395
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,850
just wanted

396
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,040
to pay a visit to Xue Yiran with my friends.

397
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,700
Your friends

398
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,540
made a big scene.

399
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,710
Hurry up.

400
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,120
4 x 100 m relay race.

401
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,880
It is said

402
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,610
that our university has been performing well this year.

403
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,440
How can it be poor with Xue Yiran?

404
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,850
It's said that the rivals are also strong.

405
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
The guy in cycling clothes

406
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,050
has radish-shaped legs which are ideal for sprinting.

407
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,600
Sir.

408
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,730
You have a sharp eye.

409
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,550
He has a rare figure

410
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,240
as an Asian.

411
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,340
His muscles on thighs and hips are well built,

412
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,580
while his calves are slim.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,160
I believe he must have

414
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,020
a good training team from European countries.

415
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
You are right.

416
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,110
His name is Xu Yancheng.

417
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,370
He was trained abroad when he was a child.

418
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,050
Sir.

419
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,290
Why do radish-shaped legs have advantages?

420
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,760
It's complicated to explain.

421
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,160
It's not hard to generate enough forward momentum within the first 40 meters.

422
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
But in the rest 60 meters,

423
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,730
you should change your running postures.

424
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
You have to

425
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,310
accelerate the downward movement

426
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,900
of your lead leg

427
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,350
in order to gain more driving force

428
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,730
to push you forward.

429
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,140
That is when

430
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,170
this muscle plays a part.

431
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,170
It is also known as

432
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,380
bending and streching your hip joints.

433
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,450
Technically speaking,

434
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,400
what you rely on to generate momentum at this moment is not your calves

435
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,360
but

436
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,090
your ankles.

437
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,560
So it's more important

438
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,200
to have resilient ankles.

439
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,700
This is

440
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,550
why I am

441
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,510
so obsessed with Qi Tian's ankles.

442
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,420
Xue Yiran? Xue Yiran?

443
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,370
What happened to Xue Yiran's feet?

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Who would have thought

445
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,800
that I could be in the same team with Qi Tian one day?

446
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,490
Qi Tian.

447
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,490
Don't let me down.

448
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,220
I'll be the last-leg sprinter.

449
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,890
I want to compete with Qi Tian.

450
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,440
No.

451
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,640
I came from afar.

452
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,170
Let me compete with him.

453
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,080
Rock, paper, scissors.

454
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,850
The result of a relay race

455
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,130
indicates nothing.

456
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,140
Why don't you challenge him one-on-one later?

457
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,080
The five-day vacation

458
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,580
is becoming more and more interesting.

459
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,560
On your marks.

460
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,500
Set.
