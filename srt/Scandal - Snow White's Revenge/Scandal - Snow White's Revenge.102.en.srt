00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,459
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,959
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,430
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,430
(Final Episode)

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,600
Sir.

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,500
The last person Ms. Moon talked to
on the day of her death was...

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,070
Jung Woo Jin, the actor.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,909
Her presumed time of death was 8 p.m.
And 5 minutes before that,

9
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,279
she talked to him
on the phone for two minutes.

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,110
What about Park Jin Kyung?
Did you find out anything?

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,520
She seemed composed.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,749
I did get a feeling
that she wasn't the culprit,

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,520
but her father really was murdered
by Moon Jeong In in the past.

14
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,590
She couldn't give me evidence,

15
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,429
but she claimed to be the witness.

16
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,899
So, she was the witness
of a murder case?

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,660
Yes.

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,440
She said the story
of her drama, "Poker Face,"

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,670
was the evidence.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,509
Do you think it's true?

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,740
Did you put an APB out
for Min Tae Chang?

22
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,639
Of course.

23
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,950
Actually, the Regional Investigation Unit
had put one out first.

24
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:06,149
He's a key suspect, too.

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,749
I heard he beat Moon Jeong In
at the party that night.

26
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,550
He was highly suspicious
of her affair with Jung Woo Jin.

27
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,619
My gosh.

28
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,360
We'd know by now if only the CCTV
on the rooftop wasn't down.

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,830
Why did it break then?

30
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,970
Tell them to restore it quickly.
That'll be our key.

31
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,830
Yes, sir.

32
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,839
Take a look at this.

33
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,410
This time is accurate, so...

34
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,319
Noodles?

35
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,250
Yes, I'm not sure if you'll like it.

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,419
- Have a seat.
- It looks delicious.

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,929
- How is it?
- It's good.

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,300
It's not too salty or too bland.

39
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,669
I'm glad.

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,369
And right, the police put an APB out
for Chairman Min.

41
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,209
Some even said
he could've stowed away overseas.

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,309
That means I'm left here alone,

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,289
although you probably became used
to living alone as you grew up.

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,289
Anyway, Woo Jin.
What will you do from now on?

45
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,789
Will you keep living here?

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,630
I don't think that's possible.

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,829
This house would get
auctioned off very soon.

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,569
I'll have to look for a place.

49
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:34,840
What about you?

50
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:37,310
I have no idea.

51
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,780
I was starting to wonder
if I should seek...

52
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,509
my biological mother.

53
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,130
Honey.

54
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,530
Get up and have some porridge.

55
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,000
Goodness. Why do you care
if Moon Jeong In is dead?

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,340
You have nothing to do with it.
Why did you become so ill?

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,350
Don't even speak of that woman.
It's horrifying.

58
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,180
What about Moon Jeong In's death?

59
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,590
Honey.

60
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,789
- My gosh.
- What's wrong?

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,789
Mom, this isn't good.

62
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,590
Take him to see a doctor.

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,600
He's worrying me to death!

64
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,169
Yes, you need to see a doctor now.

65
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,430
Come on. Stand up.

66
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,699
- Get up.
- No, stop!

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,239
I know what this is.

68
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,810
Actually, on the day of her death...

69
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,780
What about the day of her death?

70
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,819
Well, the thing is...

71
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,319
Tell us.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,789

You will be cursed.)

73

75
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,919
What are you doing, honey?

76
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,890
- We're running late.
- Okay.

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,460
- Give me a moment.
- Come quickly.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,289
That was why everything happened.

79
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,960
Wait. My goodness.

80
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,400
That weird memo
reported in the newspaper...

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,330
- was made by you?
- Yes, I'm telling you!

82
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,400
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

83
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,799
- Gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

84
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,140
I dreaded seeing that woman,

85
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,510
so I just wanted to scare her.

86
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,539
Why did she...

87
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,309
have to die on that day?

88
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:03,419
I feel like her spirit will
appear before me.

89
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,789
I also feel like the police will...

90
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,020
take me away any minute now.

91
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,030
Honey, this is terrifying.

92
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,460

93
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,169

to do something like that?

Aunt, what am I going to do now?

97
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,879
What do you think? Turn yourself in.

98
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:32,820
Turn myself in?

99
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,549
Goodness.

100
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,419

Woo Jin.

181
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,580
My beloved son.

182
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:15,779
My love.

183
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,060
Ms. Moon...

184
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,070
You should've told me much earlier.

185
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,570
Why are you telling me this now
like a fool?

186
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,550
What good would it be
if you told me after you died?

187
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,600
Mom...

188
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,970
Mom...

189
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:53,550
- Ju Ryun.
- Dad.

190
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,050
- Ju Ryun.
- Dad.

191
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,389
What happened to you?

192
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,989
Where have you been all along?

193
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,989
My daughter, are you all right?

194
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,159
Of course, you're all right.

195
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,499
You're a brave girl.

196
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:10,200
Dad...

197
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
First things first,
take this, Ju Ryun.

198
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,940
It's heavy.

199
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,040
What's in here?

200
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,739
Money.

201
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:23,850
Take this
and go to America or something.

202
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,519
Run away quietly and stay there.

203
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,320
"Money?"

204
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,930
Then, what about you?

205
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,100
How am I going to leave alone?

206
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:42,970
Wait, Dad.

207
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:45,529
Did you...

208
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,700
do that to Mom...

209
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:51,139
What are you talking about?

210
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,009
Why would I do that?

211
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
I loved your mother so much.

212
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,680
Then, why are you on the run?

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,879
You should help them
catch the culprit.

214
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,050
That's because
of the illegal drug...

215
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,720
I smuggled in...

216
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,290
Anyway, that's another story.

217
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,460
Do you have any idea...

218
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,499
who did this to Mom?

219
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,139
Jung Woo Jin. Baek Seol Ah.

220
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,070
Those two.

221
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,570
I must destroy them.

222
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,509
Why would Woo Jin do that?

223
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,379
No, he wouldn't do that.

224
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,720
He killed your mother.

225
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,149
It had to be him!

226
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,119
Dad!

227
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,249
Just wait.

228
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:42,889
I'll spot a chance
to get her revenge.

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,229
Ju Ryun, I have to go.

230
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,129
Remember what I said, okay?

231
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,239
- Dad!
- Ju Ryun, please let me go.

232
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,470
Dad...

233
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,840

because of thin ice...

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
In a nutshell,

241
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,540
it was an accidental fall.

pass away just like that.

252
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,050
She had done
all kinds of evil stuff...

253
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,820
and passed away in vain.

254
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,889

to admit to everything she did...

255
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,590
and apologize to my dad...

and to Mr. Kwon with all her heart.

Right, the director
from our children's home...

259
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,310
stopped by yesterday.

260
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,109
The director?

261
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,480
Yes, she asked me to visit
the children's home sometime.

262
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,810
Back when we were there,

263
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,080

would return and bring good food.

264
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:59,050
Yes, you're right.

265
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,590
Then, should we
make a visit sometime?

266
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,659
Should we?

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,919
Thank you.

270
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,219
Let's walk from here...

271
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,459
and reminisce on our old days.

272
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,030
Okay.

still looks the same.

It does.
Only we seemed to have changed.

276
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,780
Right? How sad.

277
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,149
We used to run and play
on this road, too.

Seol Ah.

279
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
The director must've asked
Jin Ho to come, too.

280
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,780
I'll do it now. Ready? Look.

281
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,580
Gosh, you're really good.

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,219
- Aren't I?
- You're so good.

283
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,889
Watch this. It goes like this.

284
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,189
We used to play here a lot, too.

285

- Like this.
- Whoa.

that would last forever,

You probably
wouldn't want to hear me say this,

292
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,959
but could we go back
to how things were?

293
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,560
I still...

294
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,590
Let's stop talking about that.

295
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,000
Is it because of Director Na?

296
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,669

00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,379
Dad, what happened
to your face again?

322
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,010
Did you get into another fight?

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:23,050
I try to live a good life...

325
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,919
to keep my promise to you.

326

But there are
too many evil jerks in here.

327
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,159
You promised not to fight anyone
and live a good life.

328

You said
you wouldn't do anything bad.

I'm a new man now.

330
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,879
But these jerks in here are
really evil.

331
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,639
It's like the abyss.

332
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,649

Yes.

336
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,129
You've sent me food from outside.

337

And so does Seol Ah.

338
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,869
I've been eating much better in here
than when I was out there.

for forgiveness?

Yes.

342
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,619

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,719
for 100 days straight...

344
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,959

Great job, Dad.

347
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,969
You should also do that
for everyone else,

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,030
- You're making my heart flutter.
- Eat up.

00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,250
- I'm here.
- Hey.

365
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,919
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

366
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,020
Goodness, come on in, Seung Woo.

367
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:17,030
It's been a while since we met,
and you've become even prettier.

368
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,189
So? Do you feel all right?

369
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:20,260
Yes, Mom.

370
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:22,500
I do feel a bit heavier recently.

371
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:26,699
But I already feel more energy
from smelling all the food.

372
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,439
So? Do you have a boy or a girl?

373
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,240
That's still a secret, Grandaunt.

374
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,709
Anyway, I've missed
your cooking, Mother.

375
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,409
So, we came to eat with you.

376
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:42,119
Just tell me whatever you want.
I can make it all.

377
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,790
Stuff yourself today.

378
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,189
Your legs must hurt. Sit down.

379
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,290
- Yes, sit down.
- Yes, be careful.

380
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:50,830
- Careful.
- Goodness.

381
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,990
Thanks, honey.

382
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,459
I can still walk, though.

383
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:58,969
Gosh, I'll be a grandfather
very soon.

384
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:01,000
You're in for a tough ride.

385
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,040
I've been bracing myself, Father.

386
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,570
Goodness, of course.

387
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,879
Eat a lot, both of you.

388
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,780
You need more energy, my girl.

389
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,550
I feel so happy.

390
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,649
So, where's Seol Ah?

391
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,919
Does she still pretty much live
at the children's home?

392
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,590
She does.
She feels at peace when she's there.

393
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:25,790
All right. Let's eat. Eat up.

394
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,030
- Yes, eat up.
- Give that to Ji Yeon.

395
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,359
Eat up, everyone.

396
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,629
- Ji Yeon needs to eat for two.
- Here.

397
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:33,570
- Seung Woo, you love hairtail.
- Here.

398
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,770
The assistant director
with good complexion.

399
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:38,810
Try this, too.

402
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,060
- Over here!
- Hey, that's my ball!

403
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:57,689
Hey, over here.

404
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,389
- Come on.
- Why?

405
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,260
- Let's clean up.
- I said it was mine.

406
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,199
- Hey, stop it.
- Hey!

407
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,169
- No, it's my ball.
- Move.

408
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,139
Hey.

409
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,510
- Ms. Park!
- Mr. Na!

(Heemang Children's Home)

411
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,889
It's been a while, Ms. Park.

412
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,060
Mr. Na, I'm not Park anymore.
I'm Baek Seol Ah.

413
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,399
You should make your comeback
as Scriptwriter Park Jin Kyung.

414
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,330
Are you not going to write
"Poker Face Two" as you promised me?

415
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,629
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,240
I don't think
I can keep that promise.

417
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:20,709
Why not?

418
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:27,419
I don't want to go back
to my "Poker Face" days.

419
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,619
To be frank, I was full of spite,

420
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,619
and all I wanted was revenge.

421
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:35,820
It was so futile and vain.

422
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,389
Would that mean...

423
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,260
you've healed from everything?

424
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:45,429
Yes.

425
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:48,669
I realized forgiveness was
the best revenge.

426
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,639
Also, I love
to look after the children here...

427
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,639
because it makes me so happy.

428
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,040
It's perfect for me.

429
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:00,550
Is that so?

430
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,020
- Mr. Na.
- Mr. Jung.

431
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,159
- Come in, Jin Ho.
- Okay.

432
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,330
Have you been well?

433
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,969
And I'm not Jung Woo Jin anymore.
I'm Seo Jin Ho.

434
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:23,240
All right, Mr. Seo.

435
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:26,040
You look great.

436
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,080
Seol Ah keeps making so much food,
so I'm only getting fat.

437
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,219
The kids even tease him and say,

438
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,550
"You'll be a piggy soon!"

439
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,889
Is that so?

440
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:41,990
So, who's this girl?

441
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:46,090
Say hello to the director.

442
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,260
Say hello.

443
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,100
All right. Say hi to him.

444
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,199
Hello.

445
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,909
How adorable.

446
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,310
What's your name?

447
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,330
Is there anything inconvenient
as you live here?

448
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
No, this place is like our hometown,

449
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:26,270
so we're very comfortable here.

450
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:27,770
Of course.

451
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,040
And I received
a wedding invitation from Ju Ryun.

452
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:33,310
Do you hear from her often,
Ms. Park?

453
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:34,780
From time to time.

454
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,810
She had been busy looking after
her biological mother...

455
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:39,580
until she passed away.

456
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,119
It seemed so.

457
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,020
I couldn't go to the funeral
because I had a shoot.

458
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:46,619
I only sent some flowers
and consolation money.

459
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:51,290
Mr. Kim helped her out very much
by her side, Mr. Na.

460
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,730
Is that so?

461
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,929
Then, excuse me.

462
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,230
Hey, please send my regards
to Ms. Lee, too.

463
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:02,070
And please tell her
I'm always grateful...

464
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:04,169
for the presents she sends here.

465
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,669
I will.

466
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:08,840
And...

467
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,879
please take care, Ms. Park. No.

468
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:14,550
Ms. Baek Seol Ah.

469
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:17,820
And you, Mr. Seo.

470
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,090
Have a safe drive, Mr. Na.

471
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:30,770
Goodbye.

472
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,869
It's cold. Should we go inside?

473
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,540
- Should we?
- Yes.

474
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:48,709
Hey.

475
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,350
It's snowing.

476
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:54,879
It must be the first snow.

477
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,649
You're right.

478
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,169
Come here.

479
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,000
Be careful.

480
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,009
Hey. Gosh.

481
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
All right!

482
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,779
It's snowing.

483
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:46,299
(Thank you for supporting
and watching Snow White's Revenge.)
