1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,259
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,790
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,330
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,730
(Episode 100)

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,300
Dad!

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,599
Dad, this is bad.

7
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,269
Ju Ryun.

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:23,940
Mom's business is
under search and seizure!

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,339
They're going through everything!

10
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,750
I know, Ju Ryun.
But first, calm down.

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,980
And your mom must have erased...

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,789
all important data.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,189
No, Mom said...

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,890
no one would mess with her...

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,429
because the NDAs included
all kinds of famous people.

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,030
She just said
we had nothing to worry about.

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,369
And? She didn't hide anything?

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,500
She must be out of her mind.

19
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,039
I have no idea.
What do we do now, Dad?

20
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,189
(Mind Trading Company)

21
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,659
Hey, Seok Ki.

22
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,530
Where are you, Ju Ryun?

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,900
I need to see you.

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,120
Don't worry too much, Ju Ryun.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm scared, Seok Ki.

26
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,319
What if they found out
I dropped the light on purpose...

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,459
at the TV shopping studio?

28
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,730
I thought that was attempted murder.

29
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,730
They'd have to raise
a separate investigation to do that,

30
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,000
so you wouldn't have to worry.

31
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,069
They'll focus on one thing instead.

32
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,040
The NDAs she forced
the entertainers to sign.

33
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,939
What are your thoughts, Seok Ki?

34
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,909
Do you think
Jeongin Entertainment will go down?

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,449
I don't know.

36
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,520
What am I going to do?
What do I do now?

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,590
Brace yourself, Ju Ryun.

38
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,889
It'll somehow reach a conclusion,

39
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,460
and we may be able to figure out
a way to resolve this.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,469
I have a feeling
things will stay quiet...

41
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,240
until the drama's wrap party.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,810
So what if they hold this off
until the wrap party?

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,439
Seok Ki.

44
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm so scared.

45
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm so scared.

46
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,020
Here.

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,729
Ms. Lee, what will happen
to Jeongin Entertainment now?

48
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,060
Everything would get exposed
in 15 days.

49
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,030
Every single evil deed
they committed.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,500
And their businesses will...

51
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,509
naturally disappear.

52
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,439
Then, would my dad's murder...

53
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,949
also come to light?

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,650
It probably will
if Min Tae Chang also gets arrested.

55
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,860
Such a gruesome and evil deed
will definitely come out...

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,060
if the investigators
continue to dig up his past.

57
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,699
- Ms. Lee.
- Don't worry.

58
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,500
I'll make sure
Dr. Baek rests in peace.

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,469
Thank you.

60
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,379
Good grief.

61
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,709
It served you right
after acting like you were all that.

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,209
What are you going to do now?

63
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,980
Are you going to shut
Jeongin Entertainment down?

64
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,019
You don't have to worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

65
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,759
You were going around begging
for a couple thousand dollars.

66
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,529
Good grief. You're still all talk.

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,329
Whose fault do you think this is?

68
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,670
It's your fault, Tae Chang!

69
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:44,670
Did I tell you to break the law?

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,399
Did I tell you to write up
those NDAs?

71
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,970
You'd always say you were meeting...

72
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,579
with assemblymen
and CEOs of broadcasting companies,

73
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,980
claiming you had influence over
key politicians and businessmen...

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,449
and ran wild.

75
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:57,850
And you're blaming me now?

76
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,850
I knew this would happen.

77
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,290
You never got educated,
and you weren't smart enough.

78
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,889
All you ever do is
act like a gold digger.

79
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
Dad, please stop!

80
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,529
My goodness. Who are you?

81
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,829
We're with the court.

82
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,540
Mr. Chairman,
people are here from the court.

83
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,279
"The court?" Not the prosecution?

84
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,399
I heard you came from the court.

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,600
That's right.

86
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,240
So, are you Mr. Min Tae Chang?

87
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,870
- Yes.
- So, you are Mr. Min, right?

88
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,839
I'm here for compulsory execution.

89
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,540
- "Compulsory execution?"
- Yes.

90
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,649
Then, let us begin.

91
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,149
Let's get started.

92
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:07,250
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,379
Let's go.

94
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,089
Wait, I...

95
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:19,300
Wait, what's going on?

96
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:22,529
What are you people doing?

97
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,100
His creditor, Ms. Lee Sun Ae,
lodged an appeal.

98
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:30,569
You will not touch anything
before he repays her.

99
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,680
What did you say?

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,410
- Dad.
- Ms. Park.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,149
Honey.

102
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,279
That woman.

103
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,089
Let's hurry.

104
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,149
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,600
(CEO Lee Sun Ae)

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,199
Hello, Mr. Min.

107
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
People from the court
are there, right?

108
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,500
What is this?
Why are you doing this?

109
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,009
Have you forgotten
how I kept urging you...

110
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,209
to pay me back?

111
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,480
I should've done this
for Jeongin Entertainment, too.

112
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,180
But I heard her business was
under search and seizure,

113
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,279
so I let her off out of pity.

114
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:16,920
What?

115
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,860
Please tell CEO Moon Jeong In...

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,990
I'll also come for her very soon.

117
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,000
Lee Sun Ae, are you
really trying to end my life?

118
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,399
If you hate those red stickers,

119
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,339
why don't you sell
your house to me now?

120
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,910
It'll get auctioned anyway.
I'll give you half the price.

121
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,839
You're crazy!

122
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,089
(CEO Lee Sun Ae)

123
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,490
What?

124
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,589
She put debt collection stickers
around Moon Jeong In's place?

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,029
Yes, it might be done already.

126
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,769
So, both Jeongin Entertainment
and Mind Trading Company will...

127
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,269
go down at once?

128
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,540
Probably.

129
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,079
Ms. Lee said she'd do that.

130
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,850
My goodness.

131
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,519
Ms. CEO is a really scary woman,

132
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,720
isn't she?

133
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,029
Dad, what are we going to do now?

134
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,269
I won't let that woman live.

135
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,100
Honey, I don't think
we can sit around.

136
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,210
Let's meet Lee Sun Ae.

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,879
Otherwise, we'll end up
on the streets!

138
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,009
You heard me talk to her
on the phone.

139
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,850
Meeting her won't change anything.

140
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:56,090
No, the two of us can
go there and beg her...

141
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,120
to let us live. Okay?

142
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,860
Have you lost your mind?
Why should I?

143
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,190
If you want to go, go alone.

144
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,899
How can you say that
in this situation?

145
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,230
We're in this situation...

146
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,269
not because of my debt
but because of yours.

147
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,399
If she also confiscates
the amount I owe,

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,210
we won't even have ten cents left...

149
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,740
after losing our home
and our businesses!

150
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,409
Dad.

151
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,710
Good grief.

152
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,750
We fell into that woman's trap.

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,090
Both you and I will
never get out of this!

154
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,960
Let's just...

155
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,330
She's right, Dad.
You should just beg her.

156
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,500
If that was the only way,
then you should do it.

157
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,659
We need to save ourselves first.
Don't you think?

158
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,929
Darn it!

159
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,840
Honey!

160
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,710
Ju Ryun, can you run out
and convince him?

161
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:54,940
Okay.

162
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,710
Dad!

163
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,809
Dad!

164
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,330
Ms. Lee, it's me.

165
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,500
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

166
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,210
You're here.

167
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,879
So, what are you here to say?

168
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:32,779
Did you have to do this?

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,360
Ms. Lee, please show us some mercy
just this once. Please?

170
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,090
You already asked me that
10, 20 times over the phone.

171
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,600
If that's what you're here to say,
then please leave.

172
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,529
Gosh, Ms. Lee.

173
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,539
Kneel.

174
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,440
What?

175
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,710
Kneel. Now.

176
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,019
Are you unable to move your knees?

177
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,590
Fine.
If you don't want to do it, don't.

178
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,830
But you'll regret it tomorrow.

179
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,500
I plan to claim...

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,970
your company's
promissory note tomorrow.

181
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,220
Excellent. Now, start begging.

182
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,080
And you better mean it.

183
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,250
Ms. Lee.

184
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,820
Please help us out. Please?

185
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:52,330
Sun Ae, I knew I wronged you,

186
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,500
but this was just atrocious.

187
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,860
Just six months.

188
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:58,269
Everything will be back on track
after six months.

189
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,669
I'd be able to pay you back
at that time.

190
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,139
Isn't that right? Yes.

191
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,240
Yes, please give us
a little more time. Please?

192
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,480
Please, Sun Ae. Please.

193
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,919
Ms. Lee.

194
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,190
Lower your head and bow down.

195
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,460
What you two are doing is
far from enough.

196
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,299
Darn it.

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,620
What did you two do
when I knelt and begged you...

198
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,519
to save my son?

199
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,690
You didn't even blink
as you chowed down...

200
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,730
those greasy dishes.

201
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,429
And you were his father.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Your son was dying...

203
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,070
because he had no money
to get surgery!

204
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,940
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,610
I was wrong.

206
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,740
Back then,

207
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,440
I must've been blinded.

208
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,110
Ms. Lee.

209
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm so sorry.

210
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,559
So, please help us out
just this once. Please?

211
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,360
You two are the filth of this world.

212
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,909
Darn it.

213
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,090
Hey, Kyung Sook.

214
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,190
Don't ever ask me to go
and do that again.

215
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,690
You need to lose that temper.

216
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,830
You knew it wouldn't do any good
to incite her anger now!

217
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,570
Darn it. This is preposterous!

218
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,809
Anyway, prepare something to wear
to my wrap party.

219
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:18,610
It's tomorrow evening.

220
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:20,909
"Wrap party?"

221
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:24,149
We'll end up running into Seol Ah.

222
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,850
Wouldn't it feel uncomfortable?

223
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,179
Don't worry.

224
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,590
I made sure
she'd never set foot inside.

225
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,590
And writers rarely show up...

226
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,259
to such luxurious wrap parties.

227
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,460
Is that so?
But I thought you had no money.

228
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,830
How are you going to hold the party
at such an expensive hotel?

229
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,799
I don't know.

230
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,309
I invited all those punks
on my secret list.

231
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,139
I'll meet and beg them
to help me out.

232
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,620
Or I may even threaten them
to go down with me.

233
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,789
Kyung Sook, the gold digger.
You can't lose that nature, can you?

234
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,629
Stop it. Let's hope the wrap party
is a success tomorrow.

235
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:12,230
Who knows?

236
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,360
We might spot our chance to survive.

237
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,139
Darn it.

238
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,909
I, Min Tae Chang,

239
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
won't go down this easily.

240
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,789
No, I won't.

241
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:46,129
Hello? It's me, Min Tae Chang.

242
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,259
It's me, Won Jae Ho.

243
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,129
Have you been well, Chairman Won?

244
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,340
Why did you do something this huge?

245
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,139
I heard
you'd get summoned tomorrow...

246
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,779
for smuggling in
some weird illegal drug.

247
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,750
Goodness, illegal drug?

248
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,820
It's a misunderstanding. Yes.

249
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,789
And it's not just that.

250
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,450
I heard you were charged
with embezzlement, too.

251
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,360
Anyway, I told them...

252
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,629
to just keep an eye on you
for our old times' sake.

253
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:19,159
You need to handle this.

254
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,059
Then, goodbye.

255
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,230
Darn it.

256
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:41,950
Honey.

257
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:45,389
Why are you ironing clothes
this late instead of sleeping?

258
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:49,690
Mi Sun.

259
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,960
Wait, I was going to iron
Il Joong's clothes.

260
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,899
It looks like you're already on it.

261
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,299
Why are you ironing clothes
in the middle of the night?

262
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,639
Wait, because of the wrap party?

263
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,639
Goodness, you're so slow.

264
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,980
I'm not slow.

265
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,950
I said we should get
fancy new clothes.

266
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,819
Why would you do that?
It's only for this occasion.

267
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,519
Just look sharp enough
not to embarrass Seol Ah.

268
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,000
Gosh, what's going on?

269
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,569
Why are you all sitting around
in the living room?

270
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,869
She's ironing clothes
to go to Seol Ah's wrap party.

271
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,210
What? Why would we go there?

272
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,440
That party is
only for those who are involved.

273
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,410
That's nonsense.

274
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,019
The entire family was in on this
throughout the drama.

275
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,319
Whatever.
Even if she tells me not to come,

276
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,049
I will go.

277
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,319
Yes, I have to go and do something.

278
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,789
There's nothing for you to do.

279
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:01,599
Anyway, no one can stop
how extreme my family is.

280
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,130
Anyway, Mi Sun.
You forgot something, right?

281
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,339
I did?

282
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,140
These.

283
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,180
You have to use them every day
to show a good result.

284
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,750
- Gosh, you're right, Aunt.
- Yes.

285
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,349
I need to use these daily...

286
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,150
- until the warp party.
- Good.

287
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,289
Under the eyes...

288
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,289
and both cheeks. Right here.

289
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,589
- Me, too. Mom, give it to me.
- What? Here.

290
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,230
- Hey.
- Hey, let go of me!

291
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,740
Let go of me!

292
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,769
Let go!

293
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,009
What's going on, Ju Ryun?

294
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,809
This guy grabbed me from the back.

295
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,309
Hey, sorry.

296
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,779
I mistook you for my partner.

297
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:07,519
Anyway, why would you scream
over something like this?

298
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,160
You've humiliated me, brat.

299
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,890
What? "Brat?"

300
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,900
Hey, getting drunk isn't an excuse
to act like this.

301
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,430
Don't use belittling words to her.

302
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,799
You need to give her
a proper apology.

303
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,000
What do you want?

304
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,710
You need to apologize first.

305
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,809
What if I say no?

306
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,009
- Hey, what's going on, Mr. Park?
- Hey.

307
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,579
Come on, man.

308
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,650
It's not a big deal.

309
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,019
What the heck?

310
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,190
- Let's go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

311
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,259
I need his apology.

312
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,319
You heard him.

313
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,160
Give me a proper apology.

314
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,700
"Apology?"

315
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,400
Yes, an apology.

316
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,869
Are you deaf?

317
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,869
I've had enough
of a brat like you...

318
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,940
My gosh!

319
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,710
Have you lost your mind?

320
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,180
Hey...

321
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,450
Hey, are you okay? Hey.

322
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,660
Where are you going, Ju Ryun?

323
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,589
Please handle everything.

324
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,180
Hey, that was so cool, Jin Ho.

325
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,819
Have you had enough?

326
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,359
Why were you so worked up?

327
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,460
This was just an audition.

328
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,329
"An audition?"

329
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,130
"An audition?"

330
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:12,710
What are you doing? Get in.

331
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,890
Do this for me, will you?
I'm under the influence right now.

332
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,609
You passed the audition.

333
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,880
Let's go.

334
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,529
Ju Ryun!

335
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:07,470
This is hilarious.

336
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,519
Will you keep making me drink alone?

337
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:28,220
I need to go now.

338
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,829
I hope you aren't a loser
who leaves a woman and runs away.

339
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,339
Anyway, what do you think about me?

340
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,609
Are you not attracted at all?

341
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,789
You're too smug.

342
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,200
What's that?

343
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,039
It's not your business.

344
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,410
Can I consider myself your girl
if you break up with her?

345
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:31,890
Cheers.

346
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,819
Come on, cheers.

347
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,250
I shouldn't have gotten into this
like it was a joke.

348
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,519
I shouldn't have.

349
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,730
I thought it'd only end as a joke.

350
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,480
Ms. Park, what are you wearing
to the wrap party?

351
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,750
I need to know to wear something
that'll match your outfit.

- It felt like I made it big.

360
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,819
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,319
- Where are we sitting?
- Over here, I think.

362
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,619
This is us?

363
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,289
- Please take a seat here.
- Honey, you first.

364
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,730
- We're missing two here.
- I understand.

("Poker Face" Wrap Party)

366
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,039
Welcome. And you, too.

367
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,210
So?

368
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,119
Is your Jeongin Entertainment
now the best production company...

369
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,079
here in Korea?

370
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,519
I heard you'd get to produce
all these new dramas...

371
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,220
for streaming platforms, too.

372
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:57,890
Stop it, Director.

373
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,529
Isn't that the case?

374
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:02,460
I don't know.

375
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,740
- Ms. Jung.
- Yes, Ms. Moon.

376
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,940
Please show them to their seats.

377
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,039
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,839
This way, please.

379
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,250
I'll see you later.

380
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,589
They're here.

381
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,859
- They came.
- They're here.

382
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,490
I can't see them.

383
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:39,230
Please look over here!

384
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:48,140
Please look over here, too.

385
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,549
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

Woo Jin,

388
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,069
please share a word
as the male lead of "Poker Face."

389
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:20,170
Tell us
how you came to play this role.

390
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,079
How can I put this?

391
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,579
Su Yeon, why don't you start us?

392
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,920
Me?

393
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,119
Ms. Moon, why are you still here?

394
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,759
You should join them.

395
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,420
- I'll do that later, Mr. Pyo.
- Why?

396
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,289
I don't know.

397
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,900
I thought it was proper etiquette
to stay out of this...

398
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:43,900
as the production company's CEO.

399
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,200
That was cool, Ms. Moon.

401
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,329
- These guests should be arriving...
- Sure.

402
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,809
Thank you.

403
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,170
Congratulations.

404
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,339
Thank you for coming, CEOs.

405
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:07,619
I knew Jeongin Entertainment
could do it. Excellent job.

406
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,619
Thank you.

CEO Moon Jeong In.

409

Yes?

410
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,309
This is for you.

411
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,910
What is it?

412
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,420
(Moon Kyung Sook!
You will be cursed.)

413
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,130
(You must die. I'll kill you today!)

414
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,230
Hey, wait a moment.

415
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,240
Who gave this to you?

416
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,339
A woman told me to give that to you.

417
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,579
- "A woman?"
- Yes.

By any chance...

421
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,720
are you Myung Ji?

422
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,720
This is just repulsive.

423
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,819
Move aside.

424
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,859
Ju Ryun, we're going to begin soon.

425
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:33,960
