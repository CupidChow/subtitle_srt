("Poker Face" Wrap Party)

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,350
- Goodness!
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,749
Ms. Moon.

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,889
What's going on?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,060
Why are you here?

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,830
Yes, well, it's...

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,199
I heard it was the wrap party.

12
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:39,940
Follow me for a second.

13
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,779
Ms. Moon. Please let go of me.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,059
Did you forget that you were fired?

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,400
You aren't one of our staff
or my employee.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,140
How shameless.

17
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,409
You embezzled my money
and spent it as you liked.

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,879
Did you come to the wrap party
to beg me like a beggar?

19
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,539
Ms. Moon, I was...

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,909
I was really framed.

21
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:22,519
I never embezzled any money.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,950
I gave you the corporate card
to use for necessary expenses.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,119
But you used it as you liked,
for taxi rides, drinks, and food.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,890
Isn't that considered embezzlement?

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,989
Well...

26
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,730
Right, I found it hard to believe,

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,769
but you must've used it
on dates, too.

28
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,869
No. It's a misunderstanding.

29
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:47,810
I used it to treat
the production crew after a shoot.

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,209
It was for teamwork.

31
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,340
I don't even want to give you
a cup of water.

32
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,009
Get lost right away.

33
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,920
Ms. Moon, please.

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,819
Get lost!

35
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,989
Do I have to get someone
to drag you out?

36
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,330
What a ridiculous girl.

37
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,469
Wait.

38
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:18,640
By any chance,

39
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,709
did you send the note?

40
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,410
Never mind. Forget it and go.

41
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:31,380
This is ridiculous.

42
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,390
So ridiculous.

43
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,309
Hey, Seol Ah... Wait, no.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,850
I mean, Ms. Park.
Why haven't I seen her yet?

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,679
She must've arrived by now.

46
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,890
I talked to her on the phone,
and she said she left a while ago.

47
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,219
Yes, she told me the same, Mom.

48
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,290
Is that so?

49
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,189
Then, she should be somewhere here.

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,969
She must have many people to meet
on an occasion like this.

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,630
Is that so?

52
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,309
Gosh, I told you to wear
a different necktie.

53
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,610
Look at other people.

54
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:32,380
My gosh. You look the tackiest.

55
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,450
Where did you find it?
I hid that thing.

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,649
It was right there.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,649
Gosh, you're so embarrassing.

58
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,320
That's true.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,459

60
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,529
Great work.

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,469
Woo Jin,
are you looking for someone?

63
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,239
The writer?

64
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,610
No, not really.

65
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,580
Anyway, is Ms. Park somewhere else?

66
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,779
I haven't seen her.

67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,950
I don't know.

68
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,489
Well, she'll come soon.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,589
We still have some time, right?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,889
Let me go out and get some air.

71
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,329
Should I come with you?

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,230
No, I'll go alone.

("Poker Face" Wrap Party)

74
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,590
Move aside.

75
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,790
Ju Ryun, we're going to begin soon.

76
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,199
How much did you have to drink?

77
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't mind me. I'm fine.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,329
No, I have to mind you.

79
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,900
You're the director
of Jeongin Entertainment.

80
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,710
Fine.

81
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,379
Then, this is an order
as your senior director.

82
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:12,949
Get lost right now.

83
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,309
Ju Ryun.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,579
Now.

85
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:22,819
Thanks.

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
It was a bit harsh of me
to tell you to get lost. Sorry.

87
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,389
This is your seat, sir.

88
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,989
Please give me a moment.

89
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,069
You smell wonderful, Ms. Moon.

90
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,569
Many people are watching, sir.

91
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,710
In any case,
take a seat for a moment.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,759
I have already reserved a room.

93
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:36,400
I thought I'd done enough.

94
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,970
It's time to stop.

95
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,369
People could...

96
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,400
forget their grudges,

97
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,540
but they should never forget
the ones they were indebted to.

98
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,410
Why do you think you can
hold this fancy party today?

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,150
You probably haven't forgotten.

100
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:02,660
It's room 1004.

101
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,489
What a crazy jerk.

102
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,730
What?

103
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,400
I said you were a jerk.

104
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,999
Hey, Moon Jeong In.

105
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,569
Sit down.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,110
Let go of me.

107
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,309
Hello.

108
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,449
Honey.

109
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,749
May I have a moment with you?

110
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,420
Sure.

111
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,220
Let's go.

112
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,730
That evil woman.

113
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,199
That gold digger
became full of herself...

114
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,139
just because one drama did well.

115
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,840
I won't let this go.

116
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,410
I'll end that woman.

117
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,619
- My gosh. Hey.
- You.

118
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,160
What's wrong with you?

119
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,520
Remember.

120
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,389
We're still married.

121
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,829
Married? Us?

122
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,829
You must be full of yourself
because that drama became a hit.

123
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:31,079
Even someone like you...

124
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,379
must've wanted to play my spouse.

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,650
You!

126
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:42,559
What are you looking at?

127
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,760
You. You witch!

128
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,599
Don't you know
what the situation is like?

129
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,530
We might get arrested
by the police even tomorrow.

130
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,540
But you're here getting drunk,

131
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,069
fooling around with a man,
and talking about viewer ratings?

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,309
Ms. Moon!

133
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,280
Do not touch her!

134
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,819
She's not your woman.

135
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:21,459
You filthy things.

136
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,599
You're the one who's filthy.

137
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,929
You were the one who ruined my life.

138
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:30,069
Shut your mouth.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,640
If you speak one more time,

140
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,969
I will kill you.

141
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,579
Kill me.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,150
- Just kill me instead!
- You!

143
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:42,949
What an impertinent punk.

144
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
How dare you stand up against me?
Darn you!

145
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,959
That's enough.
This is a good occasion.

146
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,520
You jerk!

147
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,130
- How many guests have arrived?
- Around 200 people, sir.

148
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,040
May I help you?

149
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,280
By any chance,
where is Chairman Min Tae Chang?

150
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,050
Oh, the chairman?

151
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,719
He was inside just now.

152
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,250
Did he go to the men's room?

153
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:58,189
- Anyway, who are you with?
- Right.

154
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,199
"Police?"

155
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,630
So, what brings you here?

156
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,770
No, it's nothing.

157
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,569
Let's go.

158
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,990

159
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,859
We were dying to see you.

160
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,059
I'm sorry.
I had to meet some people.

161
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:36,130
See? What did I tell you?

162
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,459
I told you Seol Ah would be busy.

163
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,500
Anyway, Seol Ah. Congratulations.

164
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,670
Thank you, Eun Byeol.

165
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,809
Gosh, your first drama was
already a huge hit.

166
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,339
I can't believe this.

167
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,709
Then, has Seol Ah become
a famous scriptwriter?

168
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:55,309
I wouldn't say that.
Come on, Aunt Mi Sun.

169
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,449
You are a famous scriptwriter.

170

dying to get her next project.

- Really?

Yes.

you should go back to your seat.

176

- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

177
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,540
- Go now.
- See you.

You're here, Director.

- Hey. It's great to see you.
- It's nice to see you, Mr. Kim.

- Yes.

- Hello.
- Have you been well?

Good work.

Why? The drama was a hit,

362
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,659
so she reached
the pinnacle of her career.

363
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,889
And we haven't found a suicide note.

364
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,059
I'm suspicious of her husband,
Min Tae Chang.

365
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,800
He has had quite a history.

366
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,030
Min Tae Chang?

367
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,200
He got arrested for embezzlement
by the Seoul Police Agency's...

368
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,770
Regional Investigation Unit
on that night.

369
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,169
It was hard to tell...

370
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,909
if he got arrested
before or after her death.

371
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,079
He could've been taken away
after he killed her.

372
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,250
Actually, I am...

373
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,119
more suspicious
of Writer Park Jin Kyung.

374
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,450
- The writer?
- Yes.

375
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,690
And I feel the same way
about her daughter, Min Ju Ryun.

376
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,589
It's quite weird.
Her daughter's boyfriend...

377
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,790
No, he wasn't just a boyfriend.
He was her fiancé.

378
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,000
Anyway, Moon Jeong In
kept making passes...

379
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,069
at her own daughter's fiancé
out in the open.

380
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:42,599
Come on, Mr. Kim.

381
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,240
Even if that was true,
why would she kill her mother?

382
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:49,409
- Your imagination is too wild.
- Stop it.

383
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,940
What about the star, Jung Woo Jin?

384
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:55,210
There were rumors
about how he was in...

385
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,780
an indecent relationship
with the deceased.

386
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,579
It's kind of suspicious.

387
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,589
Ms. Moon was
rather obsessive over him...

388
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:03,290
after she made him a star.

389
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,619
On the other hand,
he tried to escape with all his might.

390
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:10,629
So, he killed her
because of this love scandal?

391
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,700
I don't know.
That industry is full of secrets,

392
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,369
so we'll have to investigate
to know the full story.

393
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,200
It's like a riddle or something.

394
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,669
Solving this case would be easy
if we found out who gave her...

395
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,379
the memo she had in her hand
at the time of her death.

396
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,109
Then, try to dig up anything.

397
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:31,280
Make sure you question
the suspects thoroughly.

398
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,379
I'm through with most of them.

399
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,419
I just have
Writer Park Jin Kyung left.

400
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,919
Okay.

401
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,730
(Writer Park Jin Kyung)

402
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:52,200
(The Late Baek Dong Ho)

403
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,669
I'm sorry, Dad.

404
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,579
It's been too long
since my last visit.

405
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,409
I've been busy writing my drama.

406
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,879
Anyway, Dad.

407
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,190
How does it feel...

408
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,319
to be in a new place?

409
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:18,359
I didn't like
how that woman knew where you were,

410
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,599
so I had to move you here.

411
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,899
I hope you like it.

412
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,169
(The Late Baek Dong Ho)

413
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:29,470
I'll come by more often from now on.

414
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,879
Please rest in peace.

415
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:41,490
(The Late Baek Dong Ho)

416
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
("What's the Secret Behind
CEO Moon Jeong In's Death?")

417
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,470
(CEO Moon Jeong In was
found dead at the hotel...)

418
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,540
(where the wrap party
of her drama was held.)

419
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,609
(Gangnam Police Station stated
the report of her death was made...)

420
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,109
("The Mystery of Her Death:
Was It Suicide or Murder?")

421
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,180
Writer Park Jin Kyung?

422
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:10,980
Who are you?

423
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,119
I'm the police.

424
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,919
"The police?"

425
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,940
(The police will be just
and trustworthy for the people.)

426
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,790
It's an honor to meet
such a famous writer in person.

427
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:52,919
I enjoyed "Poker Face" very much.

428
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,089
Have some.

429
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:57,559
Thank you.

430
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,329
You're quite amazing.

431
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:02,399
How do you remember
and write in all those characters?

432
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:06,069
I find detectives much more amazing.

433
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:10,710
You always find and arrest
countless numbers of criminals.

434
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,409
Is that so?

435
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,079
All we have to do is work hard.

436
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:19,649
It's the same for me.

437
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,319
You must know Ms. Moon Jeong In
of Jeongin Entertainment very well.

438
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,329
She was the CEO of the company
I signed with.

439
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,000
She was your mother.

440
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,139
"Mother?"

441
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,569
Yes, a stepmother.

442
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,809
Let me cut to the chase.

443
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,050
You're one of the suspects
of Ms. Moon's murder.

444
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,149
To tell you the truth,

445
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,790
you're the most prominent suspect...

446
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,990
among those who were
at the hotel banquet hall.

447
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:00,930
Detective.

448
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,730
I'm a scriptwriter.

449
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,399
The scriptwriter
and the CEO of production companies...

450
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,030
always get into small
and big conflicts.

451
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,899
But that doesn't mean
they will kill anyone.

452
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:15,440
It only happens in movies or dramas.

453
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:17,540
Why did you kill her?

454
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,079
Detective, you must be a cinephile.

455
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,119
Why did you kill her?

456
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,260
Ms. Park Jin Kyung!

457
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,659
Moon Jeong In.

458
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,500
That woman did have many reasons
why she deserved to die.

459
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,000
And she had to die.

460
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,669
Was that why you killed her?

461
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,020
Sadly, it wasn't me.

462
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,319
Look.

463
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,359
- Do you have evidence?
- What?

464
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,059
Do you have evidence
that I killed her?

465
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:11,500
We'll find the evidence soon.

466
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:18,000
That means...

467
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:21,109
you don't have the evidence.

468
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,889
(Snow White's Revenge)

469
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,069
The last person Ms. Moon talked to
on the day of her death was...

470
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,970
(Moon Kyung Sook!
You will be cursed.)

471
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,710
(You must die. I'll kill you today!)

472
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,740
Do you have any idea...

473
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:35,710
who did this to Mom?

474
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,220
Jung Woo Jin. Baek Seol Ah.

475
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:43,849
This...

476
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,690
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
