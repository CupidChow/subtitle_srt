8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,590
Ms. Moon, what should we do?

9
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,360
All you need to say...

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,599
to inquiries from now on is,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,029
"We will release
an official statement soon."

12
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,900
Then, do you plan to announce
your statement later?

13
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:43,379
I thought it'd be better
if you released an apology.

14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,349
Why should I apologize?

15
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,550
Those big names in the political
and the financial world...

16
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,179
all got out of this like sly rats.

17
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,120
Ms. Moon, this is completely different
from the previous one.

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,160
Not only are key figures
of politics and finances mentioned,

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,429
but the names of chairmen
who cooperate...

20
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,359
with Mind Trading Company,
were also mentioned.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,599
Mr. Kim, I already know that.

22
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:08,569
Those old trolls...

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,909
We're done here. Get out.

24
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,909
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,109
Let's leave.

26
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,210
- Okay.
- Okay.

Every day is like
walking on thin ice.

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,409
We'll go down with one blow
if we continue down this road.

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,519
(Director of Planning Min Ju Ryun)

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,219
Mr. Kim.

32
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,460
What is it, Ju Ryun?

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,059
I also think the best way...

34
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:13,399
and the only way out of this is
to admit to our fault honestly...

35
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,669
and release an apology.

36
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,570
Isn't that so?

37
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,709
It doesn't matter if we're at fault.
What happened already happened,

38
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,280
so it'd be better
if we apologized quickly.

39
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,709
Can you please convince my mom?

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,549
Me?

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,190
She listens to you more than me.

42
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,959
Okay, I guess.
I had to talk to her anyway.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,429
Thanks.

44
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:53,040
(CEO Moon Jeong In)

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,169
Come in.

46
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,350
I have to talk to you, Ms. Moon.

47
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,250
Stop it if you're here
to repeat the same thing.

48
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:11,190
The NDAs are
all written in initials.

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,500
So, it's unclear
as to who the entertainer is.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,829
That means people can't confirm
if that NDA is real or not.

51
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,799
That's true,
but you need to look at this.

52
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,609
What is this?

53
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,310
A civil complaint from Mr. Sato.

54
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,649
"A complaint?"

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,980
Yes.

56
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:42,889
(Pending Approvals)

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,200
Ms. Moon,
the chairman wants to see you.

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,269
My husband?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,700
Yes, he asked me
to escort you myself.

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,639
(Chairman Min Tae Chang)

61
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,179
Yes, so that was what happened.

62
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,510
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

63
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,880
Who's there?

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,079
Ms. Moon is here.

65
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,760
Have you lost your mind?

66
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,589
I told you to get some rest.
You're at work in that condition?

67
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,260
Please excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

68
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,329
Yes, you may leave.

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,670
I haven't lost my mind,
but you did, Jeong In.

70
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,709
What?

71
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,019
What is this?
The NDA for entertainers?

72
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,050
We cross one mountain,
then we face another.

73
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,589
We cross another one,
but we face another one.

74
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,320
If you keep dropping these bombs,
you'll end up going down, too.

75
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,130
Don't worry.

76
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,260
The most recent one was Woo Jin,

77
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,200
so that's all I need to handle.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,200
You're only thinking about Woo Jin
in this cursed situation?

79
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,940
Do you like him that much?

80
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,469
What?

81
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,110
You said he was worth a lot.

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,180
Then, sell him to another company
at a cheap price.

83
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,310
No.

84
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,380
"No?"

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,420
Gosh, you went that low
and have gone crazy for a young guy.

86
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,490
Don't just say whatever you want.

87
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,029
Look what you're doing
with your future son-in-law.

88
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,130
She may not be
your biological daughter,

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,599
but you brought her up,
even changing her diapers.

90
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,099
That makes you Ju Ryun's mother.

91
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:38,000
Woo Jin is her fiancee.

92
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,709
I'll never let Ju Ryun
marry Woo Jin.

93
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,849
Then, who will he marry?

94
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,620
Will he marry you?

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,620
Do you want a divorce?

96
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,120
Honey!

97
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,490
You like publicity.

98
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,990
This time,
you can get betrothed to him...

99
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:00,389
with a diamond ring,
no, a diamond necklace.

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,000
You'll make the news
around the world.

101
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,399
Kyung Sook, you will become...

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,269
the craziest woman in the country.
Get it, crazy woman?

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,110
Your way of thinking is...

104
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,310
absolutely disgusting.

105
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,250
Hey...

106
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:24,920
Darn it.

107
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,060
Hey, I need cold water.
And double it!

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,700
Yes, come in.

109
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,639
What brings you here?

110
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,079
(CEO Lee Sun Ae)

111
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,479
A complaint? I didn't send you this.

112
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,550
You should talk to Mr. Sato.

113
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,589
You two were on the same side,

114
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,060
and you were behind everything,
weren't you?

115
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,560
So, drop the suit.

116
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,159
You were the one
who got into a fraudulent contract.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
You were blinded by money,
so you lied and said...

118
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,300
you signed with the writer
and the director.

119
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:18,839
Have you already forgotten?

120
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,709
Don't be like this,

121
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,639
and drop the suit first.

122
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,479
I'll sign with Ms. Park
or find some money.

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
I'll find a way.

124
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,089
You said you knew
lots of influential people in Korea.

125
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,360
You should ask them.

126
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:38,690
Ms. Lee.

127
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,029
If you keep doing this,
I'll really go down.

128
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,070
I'd be as good as dead
without Jeongin Entertainment!

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,010
Please help me out. Please?

130
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,440
You built the company with the money
you stole by killing a man.

131
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,880
Why were you so obsessed with it?

132
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,050
Also, Jeong In, you'll die soon.

133
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll die soon?

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,519
Yes, Moon Kyung Sook.

135
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,190
Because you deserve to die.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Anyway, if you want me
to drop the suit,

137
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,029
come and see me with Tae Chang.

138
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,170
Then, you two can...

139
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,610
kneel before me and crawl
as you beg for forgiveness.

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,839
I'll consider it after that.

141
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,310
Don't be ridiculous.

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,390
Who do you think you are
to demand an apology?

143
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:43,459
Did I seem like a joke to you
now that I asked for a favor?

144
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,390
The choice is yours.

145
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,060
Do whatever you want.

146
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,849
Hello?

147
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,420
Mr. Na, it's me.

148
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,050
I just sent you the last episode.
Please check it.

149
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:49,489
You did?

150
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,290
Let me check my e-mail.

151
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,030
Yes, I got it.

152
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,729
Anyway, it feels kind of weird
to think this is the last script...

153
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,229
I'll get from you.

154
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,839
What? We have the last episode?

155
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,879
Great work, Ms. Park.

156
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:11,680
You too, Mr. Na.

157
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,680
Then, please do a great job...

158
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:14,979
until the very end.

159
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,619
Don't worry.

160
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,790
Also, we'll work together again
on the next project, right?

161
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,520
Sure, if you ask me to join you.

162
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,729
No, you have to ask me to join you.

163
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,859
Thank you so much...

164
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,729
for all your hard work, Mr. Na.

165
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,640
All right, then.
You can finally get a good rest.

166
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,170
It's quite late.

167
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,910
You, too. Goodbye, then.

168
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,369
Sure, goodbye.

169
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,450
Goodness, you two are so cute.
It's wonderful to see that, Mr. Na.

170
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:53,520
Hey, stop it.

171
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,759
I'll send you the script, too,
so go to your room and read it.

172
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,190
It's the last episode.

173
00:10:58,619 --> 00:10:59,790
Yes, right.

174
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,900
Anyway, who was the culprit?

175
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,329
No idea. I have to read it, too.

176
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,940
Hey, stop lying.
That makes no sense.

177
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,499
You and Ms. Park
discussed this already.

178
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,609
Tell me. Who was it?

179
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,570
This crazy brat!

180
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,869
What now?

181
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,869
I'm the culprit? And the murderer?

182
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,020
(Writer Park)

183
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,089
The person you have reached is...

184
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,489
This brat.

185
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,339
("Poker Face")

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,270
Hello.

187
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

188
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,979
(Director Na Hyun Woo)

189
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,249
Is everything all right
with everyone?

190
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,050
I was a bit concerned
to see many reporters...

191
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,219
staking out in the lobby.

192
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,629
She's right. It must be
because of the news or something.

193
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:42,489
I was a little scared.

194
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
Don't be scared.

195
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,099
Let's leave their work to them.

196
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,900
Our job is almost over,
so let's hang in there...

197
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,200
and stay strong.

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

199
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,209
I guess
publicity really is everything.

200
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,239
The rating
for our drama is skyrocketing.

201
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,479
He's right.
The rating yesterday was 29 percent.

202
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,950
Then, why don't we try
to go over 30 percent.

203
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,320
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,629
All right. Let us begin...

205
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,989
with the flashback scene.

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,629
- Ms. Moon.
- Mom.

207
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,239
Is Ms. Park not here today?

208
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,280
No, she said she couldn't come.

209
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,109
I see.

210
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,660
(Director Na Hyun Woo)

211
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,359
Let us begin.

212
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,259
Okay.

213
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,209
Who is it?

214
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,150
It's me. Open the door. Now.

215
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,099
What do you want now?

216
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,410
What are you doing?

217
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:38,040
Shin Kyung Mi's lone crime?

218
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,280
Yes, what about it?

219
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,780
What the heck is this nonsense
in the last episode?

220
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,749
"A drama is just a drama."

221
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,420
"You can go ahead
and do whatever you want."

222
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,359
You were so confident last time.
What's wrong?

223
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,430
What?

224
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,900
You aren't afraid
of taking the entire blame...

225
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,700
at this point in time, are you?

226
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,170
Shut up and revise the script now.

227
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:07,109
I can't.

228
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,239
Seol Ah.

229
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,609
I told you that
I didn't kill your dad.

230
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:15,079
It was you and your husband.

231
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
Min Tae Chang and Moon Jeong In.

232
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,349
It doesn't matter
even if you deny it now.

233
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,119
That fact will not change
as long as I'm around as the witness.

234
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Stop talking back at me
and revise the script.

235
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,259
If you don't,
I'll call the shooting off.

236
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,930
Do whatever you want.

237
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,300
Those NDAs
already got you in trouble,

238
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,629
and now you wanted
to call the shooting off?

239
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,369
All right. You can deck
the last of Jeongin Entertainment...

240
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,369
with finesse.

241
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,640
Baek Seol Ah.

242
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,579
- Woo Jin.
- You're here, Ms. Moon.

243
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,780
Did you run into any reporters
on your way back?

244
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
There were a few,
but I didn't pay attention.

245
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,719
Good.

246
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,619
Reporters will pursue you
persistently for a while.

247
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:36,759
But just as it was with everything,
it'd all be forgotten soon.

248
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,800
You don't have to mind me.
I'm not a kid.

249
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:42,999
Thanks, Woo Jin.

250
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,140
You're the only one who trusts me.

251
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,450
You're here again?

252
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,359
This is pretty much your room.

253
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,589
Get some rest, then.

254
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,209
She's disgusting and sickening.

255
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,440
Ju Ryun.

256
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,009
My mom likes you as a man.

257
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,380
Were you really unaware,

258
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,150
or were you pretending ignorance
on purpose?

259
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,959
Ju Ryun. Ms. Moon is your mother.

260
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,330
Do you have to talk like that
as her daughter?

261
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,360
You already heard that
I wasn't her biological daughter.

262
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,170
We don't share a drop of blood.

263
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,840
You were the one
who said she was your only mother.

264
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,370
Back then, I did.

265
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,180
But the moment I found out
I wasn't her daughter,

266
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,979
she began to keep an eye on you
out in the open.

267
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,979
She always buys you clothes, shoes,

268
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,249
and even herbal tonics.

269
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,350
She also checks in whenever she has time
and touches you, too.

270
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,489
And of course,
you didn't hate it, either.

271
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,529
How could you not like
the devotion she showed you?

272
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,930
Tell me.

273
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,400
Do you also like my mom?

274
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,370
Do you find her charming?

275
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,239
Is she a woman to you?

276
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,610
Are the feelings mutual?

277
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,140
- Hey, Min Ju Ryun!
- If that isn't the case...

278
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:32,940
If that's not the case,

279
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,580
hold me in our arms.

280
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,819
Now.

281
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,229
Why are you calling
at this hour, Ms. Moon?

282
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,559
Mr. Na.

283
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,299
Have you read the final episode?

284
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,330
I'm reading it now.
Why? Is there a problem?

285
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,999
I need to see you right now.

286
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,880
What are you trying to tell me?

287
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,489
I thought of telling you tomorrow,

288
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,360
but it probably would be better
if I told you in a hurry.

289
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,559
So, what is it, Ms. Moon?

290
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,759
Shin Kyung Mi...

291
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,700
wasn't the culprit in the synopsis.

292
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:05,239
Why did it suddenly change?

293
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,410
Then, is there a reason
why the culprit...

294
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,209
can't be Shin Kyung Mi?

295
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,880
No, I'm just wondering
if this is right.

296
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,019
Ms. Park is just unreasonable.

297
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,890
This is a full-length drama.

298
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,620
The plot can change
depending on the situation.

299
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,390
Do you really think
this is for the best?

300
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,930
What if the character dies...

301
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,269
with a heart attack
instead of getting murdered?

302
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,009
That route can make the drama
more interesting...

303
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,239
with a better twist.

304
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,880
So? What are you
trying to say, Ms. Moon?

305
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:52,819
You need to change the culprit,

306
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,650
so revise the script.

307
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,259
I made marks with a red pen...

308
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,860
to show you the revision.

309
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,269
(Delete lines, keep the direction)

310
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:14,370
(Delete)

311
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,069
(Make him look sick)

312
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,739
Ms. Moon.

313
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,319
I gave you the revision, okay?

314
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,549
All you have to do is
shoot the drama like this.

315
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,360
And don't even dream
of taking this to Park Jin Kyung.

316
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,430
What now?

317
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,700
Do not change anything...

318
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,930
and follow my revision.

319
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,769
If you don't,
I'll give up on the production.

320
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,809
Do that.

321
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,950
Let's end "Poker Face"...

322
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:55,709
without the ending.

323
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,989
Fine, let's do that.

324
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,640
Gosh, what are all these?

325
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,870
My present for everyone,
Uncle Il Joong.

326
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,509
Really?

327
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,509
But you gave us so much.

328
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
It's a cosmetic product.

329
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,350
Yes, men need
to groom themselves these days.

330
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,219
You should use some.

331
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,489
My gosh, Eun Byeol said
this was really popular...

332
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,029
and hard to find.

333
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,600
You're right.
It's really hard to find.

334
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,430
I tried it last time,
and it was wonderful.

335
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,069
My face was just feeling quite dry.

336
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,200
Then, should I try it, too?

337
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,110
I should use it
before I get all wrinkly.

338
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,880
Gosh. Like this.

339
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:00,650
And like this.

340
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,910
- Hey, Grandaunt.
- Yes?

341
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,950
You look at least ten years younger.

342
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,450
Really? She does?

343
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,590
- Let me try it, too.
- Here, take it.

344
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,690
And this is for you, Eun Byeol.

345
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,090
Oh, my. What is this?

346
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,130
You got a present for me, too?

347
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,630
Of course. You're my family, too.

348
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,600
Thank you.

349
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Thank you so much, Seol Ah.

350
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,539
- You're so cool.
- Right?

351
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,080
And let's all travel abroad.
Including you, Eun Byeol.

352
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:34,950
Really? Including me?

353
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,610
A trip abroad?

354
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,749
It'll cost a lot.

355
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,590
Gosh, don't worry about it.
It's all on me.

356
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:43,989
My gosh, I'm so excited.

357
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,690
Where do you want to go?
I like Hawaii.

358
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,289
No! I want to go to Hong Kong.

359
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,229
Back in my day,
everyone went to Hong Kong.

360
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:56,170
Gosh, Aunt. That's ancient history.

361
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,039
Where do you want to go,
Aunt Mi Sun?

362
00:23:58,499 --> 00:23:59,600
Me?

363
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,969
Well, I'll go
wherever you all want to go.

364
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:04,680
I'll be happy anywhere.

365
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,779
Eun Byeol and I will look into it.

366
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,019
Okay. You two can do some research.

367
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,450
Gosh, this is awesome.

368
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,890
Thank you, Seol Ah.

369
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,690
Gosh.

370
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,660
- Nice.
- I always wanted this.

371
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,959
Mr. Na, it's me.

372
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,959
It must be the director. Be quiet.

373
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,330
Be quiet, everyone.

374
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,729
I'm at my aunt's place.

375
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,999
You have to see me now?

376
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:34,569
At this hour?

377
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,239
Where at?

378
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,779
Where at?

379
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,249
I'm sorry I called you out
while you were having a good time...

380
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,819
with your family.

381
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,319
It's all right. Anyway, what is it?

382
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,789
I enjoyed the last episode.

383
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:58,799
But, Ms. Park...

384
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,870
Yes, please speak, Mr. Na.

385
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:07,269
We never decided on a culprit.

386
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,739
And the company is...

387
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,479
insisting that it's far-fetched
to leave Shin Kyung Mi...

388
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,279
as the lone criminal.

389
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:15,450
"The company?"

390
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,650
Was it CEO Moon Jeong In?

391
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,420
Yes.

392
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:27,130
Shin Kyung Mi is the culprit.

393
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,299
I believe
it's the right choice for the drama.

394
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:34,299
Ms. Park, yes, that's right. But...

395
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,469
I can always take in
your opinion and accommodate...

396
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:38,569
if it is purely about the script.

397
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,809
But Mr. Na,

398
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,880
you wanted to see me
because Ms. Moon blackmailed you...

399
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,440
to change the culprit.

400
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:48,249
I'm sorry,

401
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,350
but we need to finish the drama.

402
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,950
So, I thought we could revise it
since it seemed inevitable.

403
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,989
Who are we revising this for?

404
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,930
This drama
wasn't made for Moon Jeong In.

405
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,660
Of course, it wasn't.

406
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,999
But it also wasn't meant
to be used...

407
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,440
for Park Jin Kyung's
personal revenge.

408
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,509
Mr. Na.

409
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,279
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

410
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,219
I'm also sorry,
but I cannot revise it.

411
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,219
Ms. Park.

412
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,090
And Mr. Na,

413
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,090
please don't let me down anymore.
Please.

414
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:12,299
(Change to a heart attack,
delete altogether)

415
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,529
("Poker Face")

416
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,700
(Delete lines, keep the direction,
delete, make him look sick)

417
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,209
Dad, how do you feel?

418
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,249
Me? I'm fully well.

419
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,049
I was born very healthy.

420
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,019
Gosh.

421
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,130
Hey, Woo Jin,
did you read the script?

422
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,090
"The script?"

423
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,459
You'll get a new copy. I revised it.

424
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:49,229
What? You?

425
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,940
Gosh, Jeong In revised the script?

426
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
That's amazing.

427
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,410
She might even debut
as a scriptwriter soon.

428
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,450
Why? Do you think I can't?

429
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,950
Goodness, why not?
It's you, Jeong In.

430
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,660
We'll begin the practice today.

431
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,559
So, Woo Jin,

432
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,459
just show your best performance.

433
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,660
It was my revision.

434
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,569
Mom.

435
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,009
Gosh, didn't you think...

436
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,479
the script was much better
before the revision?

437
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,479
I find it much more shocking
and interesting...

438
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,880
to have Shin Kyung Mi
as the culprit.

439
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,620
- Did you think so?
- Yes.

440
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,890
What about you, Mr. Pyo?

441
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,489
What?

442
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,690
Well, I work in the drama industry,

443
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:49,660
but I don't really care for it.

444
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,799
- What?
- Gosh.

445
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,430
You should ask Mr. Kim.

446
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,900
Gosh, Mr. Pyo.
Don't dump this on me.

447
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,469
Please.

448
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,309
Everyone got here so early.

449
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,479
What's so funny?

450
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:08,080
Well, Director Min,
have you read the new script?

451
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,380
It said Shin Kyung Mi
wasn't the culprit.

452
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,819
But it's kind of weird.

453
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,590
Really?

454
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:18,920
I left the revision on your desk.

455
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,830
Thank you.

456
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,440
("Poker Face")

457
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:35,410
So, Seol Ah?

458
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,779
Mr. Na suggested
revising your last episode?

459
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:40,680
Yes.

460
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,749
But it was because Ms. Moon put
a lot of pressure on him.

461
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,090
She said...

462
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,690
she wouldn't allow him to shoot
unless he revised the script.

463
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,289
How can she be so unreasonable?

464
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:54,190
So? What did you say?

465
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,590
Did you say yes?

466
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:57,229
How can I revise that?

467
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,059
I came this far
just to have that ending.

468
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,840
You're right.
You cannot revise the script...

469
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,999
for you to get your revenge.

470
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:10,209
But what I worry about is...

471
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,539
that this incident may
make you and him grow far apart.

472
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:17,549
He likes you a lot.

473
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,759
- One moment, Eun Byeol.
- Sure. You can take it.

474
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,660
Hello?

475
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,930
Seol Ah, it's me.

476
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,700
Have you been well?

477
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:34,799
What do you want?

478
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:38,069
I heard we're practicing again
with the new script.

479
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,410
I wanted to ask you out for some tea
if you were coming.

480
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,340
"The new script?"
You got a new script?

481
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,709
You didn't know?

482
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:48,479
I heard Ms. Moon revised it herself.

483
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,789
Seol Ah.

484
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,360
("Poker Face," Last Episode)

485
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,860
Was this the script you revised?

486
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,630
(CEO Moon Jeong In)

487
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,330
Yes, what do you think?

488
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,569
Why did you do this?

489
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,110
Do you think Seol Ah will sit around
after finding out about this?

490
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:19,080
The illegal prostitution gig you ran
is all over the Internet,

491
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,249
as well as the NDAs.

492
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,380
Please stay quiet
and don't start anything, okay?

493
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,680
You know who I am.

494
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,450
I’m Moon Jeong In, of course.

495
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,259
And...

496
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,390
I'm going to mess with Seol Ah.

497
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,870
She always comes to the reading...

498
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:43,700
and nitpicks over everything
just because she's the writer.

499
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:48,969
Did you want to know
how it made me feel?

500
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,539
Do you really want to know?

501
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:54,110
You're here.

502
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:58,019
You must be afraid
Shin Kyung Mi in the script is...

503
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,880
actually Jeongin Entertainment's
Moon Jeong In,

504
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:01,890
in case you get arrested
as a murderer.

505
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,190
What are you talking about?

506
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,559
You'll find out over time.

507
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,259
Everything would be exposed
after the drama.

508
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,130
Shin Kyung Mi is the murderer.

509
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,269
It was you, Moon Jeong In.

510
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,529
(Snow White's Revenge)

511
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,229
Shin Kyung Mi was the murderer.

512
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,559
Hey, Director Na.

513
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,299
Don't be scared, Ms. Moon.

514
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,299
Where you'll end up...

515
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,900
after the drama ends
has been decided already.

516
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,170
So, did you think...

517
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:30,140
this was the timing, Mr. Kwak?

518
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,239
If you poke Chairman Min...

519
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,279
even with the tip of your finger,

520
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,749
he'd crash down right away.

521
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,819
Who are you?

522
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,719
I'm here to execute
the search and seizure warrant.

523
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,789
"Search and seizure?"

524
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,890
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
