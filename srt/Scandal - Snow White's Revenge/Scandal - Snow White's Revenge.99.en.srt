1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,090
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,529
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,159
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,530
(Episode 99)

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,900
Did you want to know
how it made me feel?

6
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,570
Do you really want to know?

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,169
(CEO Moon Jeong In)

8
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,310
You're here.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,549
You must be afraid
Shin Kyung Mi in the script is...

10
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:31,680
actually Jeongin Entertainment's
Moon Jeong In,

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,020
in case you get arrested
as a murderer.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,689
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,659
You'll find out over time.

14
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,329
Everything would be exposed
after the drama.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,259
Shin Kyung Mi is the murderer.
It was you, Moon Jeong In.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,829
And don't expect me
to revise my script.

17
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,299
That's never going to happen.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,070
Hey, you!

19
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:02,250
What did I tell you?

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,180
You should've done your best
to persuade her, Mom!

21
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:13,419
(Table Read Room)

22
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,290
Have a seat, Ms. Park.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm disappointed in you.

24
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,369
I felt utterly betrayed.

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,109
Things somehow ended up like this.

26
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:34,740
Tell me.
Am I the writer of "Poker Face?"

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,150
Or is it Moon Jeong In?

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,320
Please calm down
and hear me out first.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,089
Speak, then.

30
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,160
I have the responsibility
to end the drama peacefully...

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,359
as the director.

32
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,469
I had to make the inevitable choice
while the production company...

33
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:58,940
and the writer were in dispute,

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,210
putting a halt
to the shooting schedule.

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,809
I understand your situation...

36
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:08,180
and how you came to your decision.

37
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:13,420
But you knew very well
why I had to write this drama.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,119
And you promised to help me
time and time again.

39
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,420
You did.

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,189
Did I take you the wrong way?

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
Was I mistaken, Mr. Na?

42
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,170
I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:36,069
I failed to keep my promise...

44
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,439
to you.

45
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,670
Hyun Woo, what should we do?

46
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,039
Should I call the actors
and tell them to come to the read?

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,039
Be quiet for a moment, kid.

48
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,080
Fine.

49
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr. Na.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,749
Where's Ms. Park?
I heard she was here.

51
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,589
(Director Na Hyun Woo)

52
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,830
Ms. Moon, I will put a halt
to the entire schedule.

53
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,730
Hyun Woo.

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,740
You let Ms. Park
get the best of you.

55
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,469
Aren't you the director?
Grow a backbone...

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,069
instead of getting swayed.

57
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,210
Backbone or whatever,

58
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,409
I'll rethink this from ground zero.

59
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,279
Seung Woo, cancel today's read.

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,749
Go outside and call the cast.

61
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,990
Yes, Director Na.

62
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,129
Mr. Na.

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,469
Just use my revision.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,339
You don't need to sweat it
and worry about this and that.

65
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,110
Ms. Moon.

66
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,380
Why does having Shin Kyung Mi
as the culprit trouble you so much?

67
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,520
What's the reason?

68
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,719
Why can't Shin Kyung Mi be
the culprit?

69
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,589
Is it because she is...

70
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,400
you, Ms. Moon?

71
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,200
Mr. Na.

72
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,299
You're back early.

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,159
I thought you had a read.

74
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,630
It suddenly got canceled.

75
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,429
I'll go upstairs.

76
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,500
Okay. Come back down
around dinnertime.

77
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,169
Okay.

78
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:28,880
Hello?

79
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,250
Is this Actor Jung Woo Jin's phone?

80
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes, this is he. Who's calling?

81
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,250
Allow me to introduce myself.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,989
My name is Lee Hee Jin,
the CEO of SY Entertainment.

83
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes, hello.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,659
Actually, I called to see
if we could sign with you.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,900
Thank you for the offer,
but I still have a while with Jeongin.

86
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,870
I know, but we can pay the penalty
for the cancellation.

87
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,339
Is that so?

88
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,109
(Chairman Min Tae Chang)

89
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,650
I'm taking a break,
so come by later.

90
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,690
Mr. Chairman.

91
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,960
Darn it. I told you to come later.

92
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,099
Mr. Chairman, I have urgent news.

93
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,630
I heard this
from a friend in the prosecution.

94
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,339
A search and seizure warrant
for Jeongin would be issued soon.

95
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:31,609
What? "Search and seizure?" Why?

96
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,210
Because of the NDAs, sir.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,950
The prosecution received
many civilian complaints...

98
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,549
for not starting an investigation
despite the involvement...

99
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:41,820
of many people
in politics and finances.

100
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:44,890
This is insane.

101
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:49,089
If this goes wrong,
we'll end up getting hurt, too.

102
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,560
What should we do, sir?

103
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,929
You should come up with a measure
before it's too late.

104
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,130
You may leave, Mr. Kwak.

105
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,440
Tell Mr. Nam to come in.

106
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,339
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,620
Hey, Nam! Come in right away!

108
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,390
I'm sorry, sir.

109
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,989
I had to make
a quick run to the men's room.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,729
- Come closer.
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.

111
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,900
The drug we recently brought it.

112
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,830
Are you keeping it safe?

113
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,529
Of course, sir.

114
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,940
And have you tested the drug?

115
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,669
You've done it on Director Na.

116
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,739
On top of that,
you were forced to test it...

117
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,349
because of CEO Lee Sun Ae.

118
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,419
Be quiet. Keep your mouth shut.

119
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,690
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,419
Anyway, my boys tested it out,

121
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,330
and they said it was genuine
and great quality.

122
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,099
Mr. Chairman, if this drug
becomes a hit, it'll be a jackpot.

123
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,839
That's right.
We'd sit on a pile of money in no time.

124
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,339
But be careful.

125
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,770
There are talks of an investigation
for Jeongin Entertainment,

126
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,080
and if that goes wrong,
it'll put my business in danger.

127
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,979
Don't worry. I'll remember that.

128
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,279
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,529
So? Did you talk to Moon Jeong In
and put your foot down?

130
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,599
No, I just declared that...

131
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,830
I wouldn't make any revisions.

132
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,330
(Research Director Go Eun Byeol)

133
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,270
She must feel a lot of pressure
thinking the culprit in the drama...

134
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,039
points to her.

135
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,610
Of course.

136
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,069
And she should feel that way.

137
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:50,610
Anyway, what will you do
about Director Na?

138
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,880
You two are
still not talking, are you?

139
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:58,819
No, and I was starting to regret
if what I said last time was...

140
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,720
a bit too harsh.

141
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,159
Then, you should call him first.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,529
He also must be troubled
because of you.

143
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,169
I know.
But it's not so easy, Eun Byeol.

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,740
Who could it be at this hour?

145
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,840
Come in.

146
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,939
Hey, Mr. Na.

147
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:23,880
Hello.

148
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,419
I knew you'd be here, Ms. Park.

149
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,090
Mr. Na, how did you know
I'd be here?

150
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,720
Well, your phone was turned off.

151
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,260
I came to visit my mother
and stopped by before I left.

152
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,860
My gut feelings were right.

153
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,199
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,799
So, you're here...

155
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,169
to see Ms. Park Jin Kyung,
not me, Go Eun Byeol.

156
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,209
Gosh, no. I came to see both of you.

157
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,949
Gosh, Mr. Na. You're an awful liar.

158
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,220
Anyway, why were you
looking for her?

159
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,159
I urgently needed
to have a word with her.

160
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,329
With me? What is it?

161
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,699
Let's call a truce.

162
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:17,669
"A truce?"

163
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,169
Yes.

164
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,279
Ms. Park.

165
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,380
Fine.

166
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,620
All right, now. Shake your hands...

167
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,659
and call a truce.

168
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,870
Mr. Jung, we're saying...

169
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,039
we'll pay the compensation
for you to leave Jeongin.

170
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,439
Let's put our faith in this
and do this together.

171
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,750
But still,

172
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,579
I need more time to think about it.

173
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,949
Mr. Jung,
Jeongin Entertainment is over.

174
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,590
It's like the setting sun.

175
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,590
Woo Jin.

176
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,900
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

177
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,829
Who was that?

178
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,840
What? Just this person I know.

179
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,539
Did someone call to sign with you?

180
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:36,110
Did you come to get me
for breakfast?

181
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,650
Let's go downstairs.

182
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,659
You don't look well.

183
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,970
Well, you must be troubled
to hear all this talk...

184
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,240
about search and seizure.

185
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't you know
everything is nonsense?

186
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,679
But you were sued.

187
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,179
Don't worry.

188
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,720
I already asked someone for a favor
and turned a corner.

189
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,720
Those jerks.

190
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,789
They all used to be desperate
for a date with me,

191
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,829
but they all turned on me now.

192
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:27,699
I won't sit on my hands
if they continue to do this.

193
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:30,829
Then, what will you do?

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,240
I'll expose all their secrets
and get them locked up, too.

195
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,439
Now that I'm in this situation,

196
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,709
I may as well
turn the country upside down.

197
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:44,709
Wouldn't that be fun?

198
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,380
In your dreams.

199
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,279
Did you think
they'd be arrested that easily?

200
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,890
They'd destroy all evidence
even if you had some.

201
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:54,059
Stop talking nonsense
and handle your problems first.

202
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,230
I'm going to turn Woo Jin
into a world-renowned star...

203
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,500
after "Poker Face" ends
through his next drama...

204
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,600
produced by a streaming service.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,309
Then, Jeongin Entertainment will
also become global.

206
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,610
Don't you think so?

207
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,279
Good grief.
You're completely delusional.

208
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,850
Stop talking nonsense.
Cancel your contract...

209
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,419
with that eyesore
and hand him over to another agency.

210
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:21,579
Take whatever the amount they offer.

211
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,049
- Good grief.
- Forget it.

212
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,559
- Good morning.
- Darn it.

213
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,230
Come and sit. Let's eat.

214
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,299
Let's have a seat, Woo Jin.

215
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:52,150
Ju Ryun, have you finished
putting in all product placements?

216
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,049
I couldn't get Ryu Su Yeon...

217
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,220
to do the cosmetics product.

218
00:13:58,789 --> 00:13:59,919
Why not?

219
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,689
What do you think?

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,260
She just can't do it.

221
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:07,760
She's so ridiculous.
It's not like she's a Hollywood star.

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,569
Why won't she act out
the product placement scene?

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,240
Woo Jin almost died
due to an allergic reaction...

224
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,400
while doing
a product placement scene,

225
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,970
but he never even complained.

226
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:19,880
Isn't that so, Woo Jin?

227
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,020
I have the sales report
for the new product.

228
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,390
Great work.

229
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,390
I've heard great things
from my acquaintances already,

230
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,959
so I know how well it did
even without the report.

231
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,059
I thought it was a success...

232
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,329
because you insisted
on using caviar as the ingredient.

233
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:45,470
Is that so?

234
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,199
Anyway, an immediate result was
the key to our success,

235
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,569
so let's remember that
as we develop the next product.

236
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,079
Yes, Ms. Lee.

237
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,309
So, let me try some.

238
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,929
Right, anyway.

239
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,669
Do you meet Ms. Park often?

240
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,640
Actually, something serious
must've happened to her...

241
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,039
regarding a script revision.

242
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,809
"Script revision?"

243
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, CEO Moon Jeong In...

244
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,809
arbitrarily changed
the murderer in the story.

245
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,250
I don't know
what's bothering her conscience.

246
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,590
Anyway, so things were awkward...

247
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:38,350
between her and Mr. Na for a while.

248
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,270
Why are you two here so early?

249
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,309
I came with her to discuss
the script revision, Ms. Moon.

250
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,949
Mr. Na.

251
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,319
You still haven't figured out
that problem?

252
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,459
Listen up.

253
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,959
Shin Kyung Mi is the murderer.

254
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,890
I already said no to that.

255
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,329
Ms. Moon, this is
the last episode of the drama.

256
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,029
And the story is
solely the writer's discretion.

257
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,400
Please have some faith in her, okay?

258
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,679
What about you, Mr. Na?

259
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,350
Don't you have an opinion?

260
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,949
Is Ms. Park all you care about?

261
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,449
How on earth did she bewitch you?

262
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,120
Ms. Moon.

263
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:53,260
Why? Was I wrong?

264
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,429
Anyway, we're revising the revision.

265
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,569
Shin Kyung Mi was the murderer,

266
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,640
and her acquaintances
would be handled, too.

267
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,439
So, do not add to this anymore.

268
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,140
Hey, Director Na.

269
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,909
Don't be scared, Ms. Moon.

270
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,949
Where you'll end up...

271
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,519
after the drama ends
has been decided already.

272
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:19,659
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,689
You can think about it yourself,

274
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,659
since you seem to be quite clever,
CEO Moon Jeong In.

275
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,060
Let's go, Mr. Na.

276
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,239
What the heck is wrong with them?

277
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,370
(Clause 11: Special Notes,
Clause 10: Conflict Resolution)

278
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,370
(Clause 8: Cancellation,
Clause 9: General Clauses)

279
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,370
(Clause 6: Loss of Exclusiveness,
Clause 7: Investment Period)

280
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,840
(Standard Exclusive Contract
for Entertainer)

281
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
(CEO Son Ok Hyun of Oh Story Ent.
and Jung Woo Jin hereby enter...)

282
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,699
Mom, where's Woo Jin?

283
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,070
I don't know.
He must've gone out to jog.

284
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,269
Really?

285
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,969
By any chance, did he say
he'd sign with another agency?

286
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,709
Are you crazy?

287
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,009
Why would he go anywhere else?

288
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,449
He has a while
until his contract expires.

289
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,380
He could leave...

290
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,419
if the penalty was paid.

291
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,320
And it seemed like
he was contacted by many.

292
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:03,360
What?

293
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,199
Mom, if he wants to leave,
will you let him go?

294
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,570
No, I'll never let Woo Jin go.

295
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,310
Right? You have to hang onto him
no matter what, right?

296
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,880
Because he's the hope
of Jeongin Entertainment.

297
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:26,979
What are you trying to say?

298
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,419
Then, you only have one way.

299
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,489
You have to let me marry him.

300
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,259
Once he marries me,
he'll never leave Jeongin.

301
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:39,630
Isn't that so?

302
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,830
Woo Jin can't marry yet.

303
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,400
He'll lose all his female fans
the moment he marries.

304
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,769
You said you'd make him
a world-renowned star.

305
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,340
Then, his marriage
wouldn't matter anyway.

306
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,709
So, it'd be much better for you
to have him as a son-in-law...

307
00:19:56,709 --> 00:20:00,019
than lose him to another agency,
isn't that so?

308
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,840
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

309
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,610
I'm sorry
for visiting you this late.

310
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,580
I got you some hot coffee.

311
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:33,719
What do you want?

312
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,320
Did your mom ask you
to make me change the culprit?

313
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,019
If that's the case,

314
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,560
tell her that my answer is the same.

315
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,630
Well,

316
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,759
I honestly don't care about that.

317
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,900
Then, what is it?

318
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,169
I'm here to talk to you
as Ju Ryun...

319
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,169
- to ask for a favor.
- What favor?

320
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,610
Can you please...

321
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,179
let Woo Jin go in peace now?

322
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:09,019
Can you give me your support
so that we can marry?

323
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,650
You want my support
for your marriage with Woo Jin?

324
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,189
Yes.

325
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,060
We announced we'd have the wedding
after the drama,

326
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:23,030
but it seemed like both you
and Woo Jin had lingering feelings.

327
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,400
So, I want to ask you...

328
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,640
to abandon
those leftover feelings for good.

329
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,509
Please be the first
to discard those feelings.

330
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,580
What?

331
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,909
Seol Ah.

332
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,120
I really love Woo Jin.

333
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,719
And you don't even want
to marry him.

334
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,860
You're already with Director Na.
Isn't that right?

335
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,259
You aren't here to ask for my
permission to marry him, are you?

336
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,969
I don't care if it's permission
or whatever, just let him come to me.

337
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,840
Please?

338
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,810
Please.

339
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,280
You should beg Woo Jin
instead of me.

340
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,850
He's the one who wants to leave you.

341
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,419
No.

342
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,650
You need to let him go first.

343
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,999
All right.
I understand your position.

344
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,469
But Woo Jin is my fiance.

345
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Please don't forget that.

346
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:52,749
Seol Ah, how do you really feel?

347
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:55,219
What are your real feelings?

348
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:57,360
Why can't you let Woo Jin go?

349
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,790
Then, what about Mr. Na?

350
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,400
What am I going to do? What do I do?

351
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:13,479
So, did you think...

352
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,509
this was the timing, Mr. Kwak?

353
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,380
Yes, that's right.

354
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,650
If you poke Chairman Min...

355
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:22,719
even with the tip of your finger,

356
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,090
he'd crash down right away.

357
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:28,360
I see.

358
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,800
Thank you for your hard work.

359
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,169
And take this
as a token of my appreciation.

360
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:42,640
Goodness.

361
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,169
Thank you.

362
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,550
And when everything breaks out,
make sure you hide yourself.

363
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,110
It'd be a good idea
to travel abroad.

364
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,820
Sorry?

365
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,620
Doesn't an overseas family trip
sound wonderful?

366
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:05,959
Yes, I understand
what you mean, Ms. Lee.

367
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,429
Now, we'll meet again someday.

368
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:13,669
Ms. Lee, stay healthy.

369
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,110
Please excuse me.

370
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,159
Gosh.

371
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,640
(Letter of Resignation)

372
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,969
What's this?

373
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,370
(Senior Managing Director
Kwak Dong Woo)

374
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,509
What?

375
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,310
Did Mr. Kwak just resign?

376
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,820
Hey, Kwak,
what do you think you're doing?

377
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,179
Come to my office now!

378
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,189
I trusted you so much.

379
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:07,519
You can't leave this piece of paper
and disappear like this!

380
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,590
Mr. Chairman,
my family and I are emigrating.

381
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,729
I thought I'd get mentally sick
if I stayed around you any longer.

382
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,570
What did you say?

383
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,269
"Mentally sick?"

384
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:23,969
Hey, Min Tae Chang.

385
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:27,040
You'd only get a grip on yourself
once you got detained.

386
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,610
And thanks for the gift certificates
you kept as a slush fund.

387
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,179
So, rot in prison, you son of a gun!

388
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,249
"Son of a gun?"

389
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,790
Hey, Kwak, you punk!

390
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,689
That punk!

391
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,400
Unbelievable!

392
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,229
Darn it.

393
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,640
That son of a gun.

394
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,370
I curse you!

395
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:01,080
Have I been overworking lately?

396
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,620
Hello.

397
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,759
My gosh, Ms. Lee.
It's wonderful to see you.

398
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,229
What brings you all the way here?

399
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,169
I wouldn't have another reason
for coming here.

400
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,769
I wanted to get some presents
for my hard-working staff.

401
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,509
Do you have any recommendations?

402
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,479
Goodness, you came on purpose
to give us business.

403
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,679
Thank you so much.

404
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,050
Our product is excellent...

405
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,350
for your skin and weight loss,

406
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,449
so your staff will love it.

407
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:48,919
Honey, we're here.

408
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,030
Hello, Ms. Lee.

409
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,699
Oh, my. Look who this is.

410
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:57,969
My in-law is here.

411
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,100
- Sorry?
- Aunt.

412
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,769
Oh, my. How silly of me.

413
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,209
It's my personal wish
that Seol Ah...

414
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,080
and Mr. Na will
work things out to be together.

415
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,110
- Please take it like that.
- Yes, she's right.

416
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,749
Okay, sure.

417
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,919
- I'm here, Mom.
- Hey.

418
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
My gosh. Hello.

419
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,159
Ji Yeon, you came.

420
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:27,759
Yes, but you know, Dad...

421
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,229
Hello.

422
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:31,100
I came with presents
for Grandaunt and Ms. Choi.

423
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,100
My gosh.

424
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,669
It's you, Seung Woo.

425
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,540
Mom.

426
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:44,179
Why are you here?

427
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,380
Well, I came to drop these off.

428
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,719
Hello, we're dating.

429
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,090
Today is our day one.

430
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:55,689
What? Today is your day one?

431
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,689
Ji Yeon.

432
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,630
Why? Were you embarrassed?

433
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,159
Well, it's not that.

434
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,370
I see. You two began to date today?

435
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,209
- Yes.
- Yes, Mom.

436
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,340
Goodness.
Congratulations, Seung Woo.

437
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,209
I hope you two have
a great relationship.

438
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:18,610
Don't get into fights.

439
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:20,580
Of course.

440
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,320
Wait, if you two are dating,

441
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:28,189
what will happen
to Seol Ah and Mr. Na, Mi Sun?

442
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,989
I don't know.

443
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,659
I don't know.
They'll probably manage.

444
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,400
Yes, that's right.
We'll each do what we want.

445
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,709
Did you say
today was your first day together?

446
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,979
Goodness.

447
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,489
My gosh.

448
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,620
- Goodness.
- Do you like him that much?

449
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,090
How cute.

450
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:10,060
So, we didn't receive any inquiries
about Woo Jin's contract.

451
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,130
No, he's still under this contract,

452
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,269
so he can't sign anything
without an agreement.

453
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,380
Does this mean
I can relax for a while, Mr. Kim?

454
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,209
I don't know. We'll have to see.

455
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,449
Anyway, what will you do
with the wrap party for the drama?

456
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,880
Should we continue as scheduled?

457
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,620
Why not?

458
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:34,219
It costs a lot
to rent the venue and whatnot,

459
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,219
so it's a lot of pressure.

460
00:29:38,489 --> 00:29:40,090
But we still have to do that.

461
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,370
What will people think of us
if we suddenly cancel it...

462
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,100
or downscale the event?

463
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:53,110
On top of that,
it'll have an impact...

464
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,739
on selling Jeongin Entertainment.

465
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,719
I need to use this chance
to show off my influence.

466
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:04,820
- Show off your influence?
- Yes, Mr. Kim.

467
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,999
This envelope just came for you.
I signed the delivery confirmation.

468
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:19,530
Thank you.

469
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,479
What is this, Ms. Moon?

470
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,080
It's a petition of appeal.

471
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,060
In the end, Mr. Sato really sued us.

472
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,900
The trial date must've been fixed.

473
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,269
Excuse me, wait!

474
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,610
Ms. Moon.

475
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,380
Who are you?

476
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,620
Who are you with?

477
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,090
We're the prosecution.

478
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,860
You must be CEO Moon Jeong In
of Jeongin Entertainment.

479
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,090
Then, let us execute
the search and seizure warrant.

480
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,189
"Search and seizure?"

481
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,999
Wait.

482
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,840
- It's the real thing, Ms. Moon.
- What?

483
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,709
- Let us begin right away.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,949
(CEO Moon Jeong In)

485
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,150
Wait, hey.

486
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:43,620
Hey, no. You can't do this!

487
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,290
What do you think you're doing?

488
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,860
Do not do this. You're interfering
with a government official.

489
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,729
What?

490
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:54,530
Please stop, Ms. Moon.

491
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:57,330
Or you will be arrested right here.

492
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,239
Mom!

493
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,870
Ju Ryun.

494
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,640
These men are in our office
going through everything.

495
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,679
Everyone, do not move. Stay still.

496
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,179
If I catch you pocketing any files,

497
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,790
you will be arrested immediately
for obstruction of government officers.

498
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,050
Do you understand?

499
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:21,560
Take everything.

500
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,390
Take a look at that drawer.

501
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,509
(Snow White's Revenge)

502
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,909
You!

503
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,489
This is hilarious.

504
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:37,600
This is for you.

505
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:40,300
What is it?

506
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,540
(Moon Kyung Sook!
You will be cursed.)

507
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:45,269
(You must die. I'll kill you today!)

508
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,380
Hey, wait a moment.

509
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
