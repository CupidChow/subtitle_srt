[Episode 5]

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,300
What a big manor!

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,260
[Young Song Zhiyao]

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,300
Yao, do you like it?

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,100
Yes.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,620
It's quite spacious.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,780
From now on, this will be our new home.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,100
Now...

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,740
Aunt Ping,
this perfume pouch smells great.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,000
[Song Ping, Song Zhiyao's youngest aunt]

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,900
My dear, a garden here would be lovely.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,780
This is clove,

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,780
this is spikenard,

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,220
and this one is…

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,220
I know.

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,500
This is benzoin.

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,060
Benzoin is a resin

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,300
that resembles a small walnut in shape.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,380
It should not be burned directly,
yet it can release a rich fragrance.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Therefore,
it is used in incense mixtures.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,900
You're very smart, Yao.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,580
Mother!

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,580
- Yao!
- Father!

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,140
Yao!

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,340
Yao!

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,300
Aunt Ping...

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,620
I remember now.

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,620
I'm not some abandoned little beggar.

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,700
My father is Jiang Mushan,

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,620
my mother is Song Lian.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,140
I even have an aunt

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,260
named Song Ping.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,060
But wasn't she kidnapped by bandits?

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,340
Why is her perfume pouch here?

36
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,020
Could it be that she's still alive?

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,260
Where is she?

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,300
She said you instructed her

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,020
to go to the branch
to fetch the fragrance boxes.

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,700
I don't like this color.

41
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,580
Never mind. Let's go.

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,700
Let's take a look up ahead.

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,820
Miss, check out these pendants.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,100
Qiluo Fragrance.

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
It was only made today.

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,060
Even if she took it secretly,

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,060
she wouldn't have scattered it here.

48
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,260
Tell me. Where is the fragrance manual?

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,140
Didn't I already give you
the fragrance manual?

50
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,940
You dared use a fake one to fool us.
You've got a death wish.

51
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,820
Zhiyao.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,060
Zhiyao.

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,700
It hurts.

54
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,140
I was already holding back.

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
I never would have guessed

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
that this hidden cell
is part of the Pei Manor.

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,420
A grand household,

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,660
and so full of secrets.

59
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,700
Then, tell me

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,780
how exactly did you end up there?

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,300
How should I know?

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,900
I had just stepped
out of the fragrance shop

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,220
when they threw that sack over me.

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,180
Could it be that someone
from the Pei Manor

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,300
wanted to kidnap me?

66
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,540
She kept trying every possible way
to run away.

67
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,020
She was probably going to trade
the fragrance manual.

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,420
But then she got caught.

69
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,300
Clearly, the other party
intended to silence her.

70
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,860
Yet why did she end up in a hidden cell

71
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,580
under the Pei Manor?

72
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,700
Could it have something to do
with my aunt?

73
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,260
Looks like I was right.

74
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,540
I'm nothing but a lowly beggar.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,900
What could they possibly want from me?

76
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,140
Could it be
that they were really after you,

77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,580
and what happened to me
was just meant as a warning?

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,220
Alright.

79
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,620
I'll handle this matter

80
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,020
and give you an explanation.

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,340
But until then,

82
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,060
do not wander off.

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,700
Don't worry. Stay by my side,

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,220
and I'll keep you safe.

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,180
Ergou and the others are safe for now.

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
But my aunt's perfume pouch

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,300
has somehow appeared
in the Pei Manor's hidden cell.

88
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,180
This won't do.

89
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,220
I have to stay and find out
what happened to her.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,580
Who am I?

91
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,060
Have you remembered?

92
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,820
I've already given you plenty of time.

93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,400
[Song Ping, Song Zhiyao's youngest aunt]

94
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,620
Look!

95
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,580
Look!

96
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,980
Your body remembers me.

97
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
It remembers me.

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,580
Say it. Tell me.

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,860
Who am I? Tell me.

100
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,580
Tell me.

101
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,220
Master, Song Zhiyao has been rescued.

102
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,980
Why is everyone pushing me?

103
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,940
Including you!

104
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,740
It's me.

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,100
Why are you here?

106
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,220
Why are you here as well?

107
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,340
I...

108
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,660
None of your business.

109
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,660
I...

110
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,380
I figured
you'd come to the hidden cell tonight,

111
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,340
so I came to back you up.

112
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,500
Think about it.
Among all those who despise you

113
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,060
and are so eager to eliminate
the people around you,

114
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,780
who else could it be

115
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,060
but that aunt of yours?

116
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,060
Using Pei Jingheng

117
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,500
would allow me to uncover the truth
about my aunt more quickly.

118
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,660
Are you really willing

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,380
to live under her shadow forever?

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm telling you,

121
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,740
knowing too much

122
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,700
won't do you any good.

123
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,780
But I have to get to the bottom of this.

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,140
If I don't,

125
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
I'll be taken by them again.

126
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,060
And next time, I'll die.

127
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,260
We're in this together now.

128
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,220
So put all that past nonsense aside

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,500
and work with me properly.

130
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,700
Don't worry.
I work for you,

131
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,340
and I will never betray you.

132
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,980
What was the relationship

133
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,420
between those bandits
and the Pei family back then?

134
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,740
Why did they want to wipe out
my entire family?

135
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,580
We had only moved to Wu County
for a year at the time.

136
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,100
Aunt,

137
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,780
you're still alive, aren't you?

138
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,580
Zhiyao?

139
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,140
I was wondering who it was.

140
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Why are you here alone?

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,420
Eldest Young Master.

142
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,460
Looks like something's bothering you.

143
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,220
Did Jingheng give you a hard time?

144
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,540
No, not at all.

145
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,820
Second Young Master is very kind to me.

146
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,060
As for Jingheng's temper,

147
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,580
I, as his older brother,
of course know it well.

148
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,740
But the fact that he accepted you
as his apprentice

149
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,740
shows he values you.

150
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,140
You are right.

151
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
If you're feeling down,

152
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,660
I can take you out for a stroll.

153
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,620
The Fragrance Festival is coming,

154
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,980
so the county will be lively.

155
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,780
I may not have much say

156
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,300
in the manor,

157
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,620
but if you want to go outside,

158
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,740
I can help you.

159
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,940
Think of it as a chance to unwind.
Sound good?

160
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,340
Following Pei Jingheng
can be quite inconvenient.

161
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,740
It might be better to go out
with Eldest Young Master instead,

162
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,540
so I can meet Ergou and the others,

163
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
and look into what happened to my aunt.

164
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,620
In that case, I'll thank you in advance,
Eldest Young Master.

165
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,580
Go back now and rest.

166
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,380
I'll send someone
to inform you tomorrow.

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,060
Young Master.

168
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,260
Once we're out tomorrow,

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,780
search her room
for the fragrance manual.

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,220
