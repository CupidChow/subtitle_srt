My Lady.

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,340
Eldest Young Master,

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,300
I'm going to the fragrance shop.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,460
I'll go with you.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,020
I'm free anyway.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,980
It'll be a good chance
to lend you a hand

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,620
and learn a thing or two.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,740
Who knows, it might even help me
assist you in the future.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,420
All right.

[Pei's Fragrance Shop]

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,900
Miss, we happen to have an incense here

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,260
that's perfect for the study.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,980
It helps refresh the mind.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,460
Thank you, Eldest Young Master.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,860
Glad to help, My Lady.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Lady Song and Eldest Young Master
are newlyweds.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,020
They seem so happy together.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,100
You're new here,

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,140
so you probably don't know.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,580
Back then, Lady Song used to be
by Second Young Master's side.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,100
Seeing them together

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,700
made everything around them
seem to pale in comparison.

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,820
They looked like a match made in heaven.

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,340
But who would have thought
that in the end, Lady Song married…

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,140
Thank you.

28
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,740
So, Eldest Young Master
is staying close to Lady Song

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,540
to guard against…?

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,580
Enough now.

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
We still have customers here.

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,420
Why is he being so clingy today?

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,140
Miss.

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,940
There are some other fragrance products
on that side.

35
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,900
You can take a look around,

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,460
and ask the shopkeeper
if you need anything.

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,580
Eldest Young Master,

38
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,740
I'm planning

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,620
to visit the countryside estate later.

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,020
Most of the workers there are women,

41
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,340
so it might be inconvenient.

42
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,940
I'll have Guanyan escort you back first.

43
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,220
There are always violent incidents
at the countryside estate each year.

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,940
Since you've just joined
the Pei household,

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,540
I'll go with you,

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,540
so those unruly servants
don't overstep their bounds.

47
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,380
Eldest Young Master, we both know

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,540
that our cooperation
is purely a matter of mutual benefit.

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,980
You really don't have to go this far.

50
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,940
But you are my wife.

51
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,580
Um… I need to talk to you
about something.

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,700
Since Jingheng
has something to discuss with you,

53
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,980
you two should talk. I'll wait outside.

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,020
No... No need.

55
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,180
I… I still have some things
to take care of.

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,220
I don't have much time.

57
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,700
I'll go to the countryside estate now.

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,700
You're all sweaty, Jingheng.

59
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,140
Here. This should help you cool down.

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,100
You...

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,580
You've made an excellent choice.

62
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,500
Jasmine-scented balm, our new product.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,100

the bigger the discount.

64

Carry on, everyone.

65
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,340
It's nice to see the shop bustling.

66
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,940
Farewell.

67
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,700
Someone!

68
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,300
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,540
Take this away.

70
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,260
Yes.

71
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,180
What a nuisance.

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,940
Remove this as well.

73
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,660
Yes.

74
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,340
Remove this as well.

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,260
Yes.

76
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,820
Don't let me see

77
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,140
these paired items again.

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,740
What's wrong?

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,900
Nothing.

80
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,780
Wait.

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,110
You're acting like this
and you say nothing's wrong?

82
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,900
What's the matter?

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,540
All right, let me ask you this.

84
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
What was going on with the groom today?

85
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,140
Groom?

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,380
I remember now.

87
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,660
He delivered some medicine to me.

88
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,820
The way he looks at you isn't innocent.

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
As a man myself,

90
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,460
I know what men are like.

91
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,620
He's got ulterior motives.

92
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,100
He knows you're soft-hearted

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,180
and wants to be your concubinus.

94
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,780
Why would you think like that?

95
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,300
His intentions are so obvious.

96
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,500
How could I not overthink it?

97
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,020
Jinglan, what's all this about?

98
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,900
Jingheng? Why are you also here?

99
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,780
I...

100
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,260
I'm getting soaked in the rain, Jinglan.

101
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,740
You don't know this,

102
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
but something went wrong at the shop.

103
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
And I'm here
to confront the one to blame.

104
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
What do you mean?

105
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,940
What do I mean?

106
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Listen.

107
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,780
The steward from Lu County's Cheng Manor

108
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,220
has already come to the shop,

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,700
questioning us

110
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,420
about why the fragrance powder
wasn't delivered.

111
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,260
Only upon investigation did we find
that it went through you

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,380
and was sent to the Zhao Manor
in Qingshui County.

113
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,340
That's impossible.

114
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,420
Impossible?

115
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,580
The facts speak for themselves,

116
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,740
and you can't deny it.

117
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,020
You two...

118
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,940
Pei Jingheng,

119
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,140
I think you're simply unhappy

120
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,020
seeing me take charge

121
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,500
of Pei's Fragrance Shop.

122
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,380
Did you hear that?

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,780
I'm telling you,

124
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,540
I am not someone
who can't tell right from wrong.

125
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,340
Also,

126
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,540
don't think you can use your excuses
to cover up your mistakes.

127
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,500
The person is right there in the shop.

128
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,220
Why don't you
go confront him face-to-face?

129
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,020
Fine, I'll go.

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,980
I won't let you falsely accuse me.

131
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,780
- Go on then.
- Let's go.

132
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

133
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,780
- Let's go.
- "Falsely accuse?"

134
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,420
- It's raining.
- Let's go.

135
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,660
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

136
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,220
- I'll confront him myself.
- You think I'd falsely accuse you?

137
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,020
How ridiculous!

[Pei Manor]

139
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Not bad. You play your part well.

140
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,460
Of course.

141
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,180
You're quite good
at spinning stories too.

142
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,700
Just a few days ago, you were so close
while making fragrances.

143
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,420
And now,
you've already grown tired of Jinglan?

144
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,900
I guess your feelings for him

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,580
were short‑lived.

146
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,780
You...

147
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,980
Could it be that your heart
already belongs to someone else,

148
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
and you've grown tired of Jinglan?

149
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,060
You didn't come to see me

150
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,100
just to talk about this, did you?

151
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,380
As expected, you know me well.

152
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,140
There's an old saying:

153
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,700
"A mother knows her child best."

154
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,540
Second Young Master,
why have you stopped smiling?

155
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,740
Are you just not a cheerful sort
by nature?

156
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,820
All right. Just tell me.

157
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,220
Why did you come to see me?

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
Whether it's the countryside estate

159
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,540
or the counterfeit workshop,

160
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,100
every piece of evidence points to Aunt.

161
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,580
And yet, she can still

162
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,700
confidently promise Grandmother

163
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,220
that she will get to the bottom of this.

164
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,140
So, tell me…
what's really going on here?

165
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,340
Pei Jingheng,

166
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,740
this fragrance feels very familiar.

167
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,580
It contains storax.

168
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,220
As well as wild angelica, clove,

169
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,620
and...

170
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,700
ambergris!

171
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,100
This ingredient is both scarce

172
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,340
and precious.

173
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,020
Even in the incense
sold by the Pei family,

174
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,140
it's rarely included.

175
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,540
Aunt Ping, it smells amazing.

176
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,780
I'm utterly enchanted by it.

177
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,140
Do you find this fragrance quite unique?

178
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,460
That's right.

179
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,940
This fragrance smells even better
than the previous ones.

180
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,820
Did you add some special ingredients?

181
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,900
Zhiyao, your nose is really sharp.

182
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,740
Yes, I added a very special ingredient

183
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,740
called ambergris.

184
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,740
Aunt Ping, this incense smells so good.

185
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,220
If you sold it,

186
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,300
you'd definitely make a fortune.

187
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,300
This incense recipe isn't for sale.

188
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Why not?

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,340
For one, ambergris is so precious

190
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,700
that ordinary people

191
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,380
couldn't afford incense made with it.

192
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,780
For another,

193
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,820
this particular recipe

194
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,620
holds a special meaning for me.

195
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,780
This is Aunt Ping's incense recipe.

196
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
Yet if it's not meant to be sold,

197
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,340
how did it appear

198
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,900
in the Pei family's
counterfeit workshop?

199
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,260
Zhiyao.

200
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,060
Zhiyao?

201
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,740
Given how rare ambergris is,

202
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,060
any incense made from it

203
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,340
definitely wouldn't be sold
to the common folk.

204
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
So… this is what you were thinking about
just now?

205
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,140
Yes.

206
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,140
Don't you find it strange?

207
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,900
If it's not sold to ordinary people,

208
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,340
what's it used for?

209
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,820
I suspect your aunt
is embezzling family funds.

210
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,660
We can't let her get away with it.

211
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820
Let's hurry back to the manor and check.

212
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,220
There may be more evidence.

213
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,700
Is there nothing more
you wish to tell me?

214
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,660
Zhiyao,

215
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,700
I truly want to help you,

216
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,620
but even now I don't know
what you're trying to do.

217
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,900
I don't know how to help you.

218
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,140
Let me share this burden with you.

219
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,940
All right?

220
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,020
Aunt Ping is still missing,

221
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,620
and you're a member of the Pei family.

222
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,460
How could I possibly take that risk?

223
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,340
For this matter,

224
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,380
I can only rely on myself.

225
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,900
Even though my aunt isn't in the manor,

226
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,580
she has many eyes and ears
within her courtyard.

227
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,820
If we go in rashly, we'll alert her.

228
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,820
I can wait,

229
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,740
but Aunt Ping cannot.

230
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,780
I can't bet on Pei Xiuning's kindness.

231
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,100
We can just find a pretext, can't we?

232
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,340
You cover for me,

233
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,580
and I'll slip into her study.

234
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,820
No one will notice.

235
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,180
Have more people sent out
to look for her.

236
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,620
What happened?

237
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,180
I originally thought your aunt
had been staying at her paramour's place

238
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,100
and was unwilling
to return to the manor.

239
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,620
But two whole days have passed,

240
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,180
and only when I sent someone
to check did I learn

241
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,540
that she had returned long ago.

242
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,620
But now,

243
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,260
she's nowhere to be found.

244
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,340
Stop mumbling

245
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,380
and stammering.

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,220
Speak!

247
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,420
Madam,

248
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,420
as you know,

249
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,020
my wife has several paramours outside.

250
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,980
When she's in a bad mood,

251
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,500
she often stays out overnight.

252
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,140
So when she didn't return
the night before last,

253
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,700
I assumed that was the case.

254
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,580
But…

255
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,780
But she didn't come back
last night either.

256
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,220
You should have searched for her
last night.

257
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,780
Normally,

258
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,900
she always says I'm useless
because I can't have children,

259
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,980
so I didn't dare send anyone
to fetch her at night.

260
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,700
This morning, I sent someone to check

261
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,300
and learned she had returned
to the manor the night before last.

262
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,580
But she's nowhere to be found,

263
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,540
and that's when I started to worry.

264
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,020
As a husband,

265
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,020
your own wife has been gone
for two nights,

266
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,380
and you don't even know where she is.

267
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,700
You are not fit to be a husband!

268
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,500
Madam, the truth is that my wife

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,740
simply doesn't like
being restricted on such matters,

270
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,580
which is why I…

271
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,700
What did she say
before she left the manor two days ago?

272
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,940
Think carefully!
Don't leave out a single detail.

273
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,100
Yes.

274
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,380
The afternoon before yesterday,

275
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,340
my wife returned to the manor in haste.

276
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,740
Noticing she was in a good mood,

277
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,100
I couldn't help asking a little more.

278
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,540
Why are you so happy, My Lady?

279
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,220
Those two greenhorns
think they can outmaneuver me?

280
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,420
This time, I'll make sure

281
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,940
they never get the chance
to turn things around.

282
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,420
So you've found a fault
in Eldest Master's line, My Lady?

283
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,300
Calling it a "fault"
would be an understatement.

284
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,940
This alone

285
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,780
could drag them into total ruin.

286
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,900
We're now only one step away

287
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,540
from catching them red‑handed.

288
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,180
Well then, My Lady,
congratulations in advance.

289
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't worry.

290
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,740
Over these years,

291
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,420
even though you haven't been able

292
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,140
to give me a son or daughter,

293
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,940
your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.

294
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,300
When I inherit the family estate,

295
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,180
you will still be my husband.

296
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,740
Even if I have children
with others in the future,

297
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,380
they will be considered yours.

298
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,780
I always knew

299
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,580
you

300
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,020
treated me best, My Lady.

301
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,580
What are you waiting for?

302
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,580
Hurry and go look for her!

303
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,620
Yes.

304
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Chief, the Pei family's lady is missing.

305
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
Why are you helping to look for her?

306
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,720
Exactly.

307
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,380
She was the one
who had people kidnap you before.

308
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,780
Stop talking.

309
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,820
I suspect

310
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,940

who murdered my parents.
