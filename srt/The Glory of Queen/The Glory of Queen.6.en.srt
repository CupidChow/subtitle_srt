00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,500
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,780
Miss, this is freshly made puffed rice.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,100
It's sweet and crispy.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,180
Shall I get a portion for you
and your husband?

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,980
No.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,420
He's not my husband.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,420
We don't need it. Thank you.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,180
All right.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:34,860
Eldest Young Master,

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
we should keep some distance as we walk,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,220
so no one gets the wrong idea.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,540
I'm just a maid,

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,620
I wouldn't want to embarrass you.

15
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,180
Do not think so little of yourself.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,020
Being able to learn fragrance-making
from Jingheng

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,460
proves your extraordinary talent.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,820
With such ability,

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,980
you will never be confined to the role
of a mere maid in the Pei Manor.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,420
This is for you.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,700
What is this?

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,980
Noticing your love for sweets,

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,140
I thought I'd bribe you a little

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,380
before you become successful.

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,180
Sure. When I've made it,

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,580
I won't say no to anything

27
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,660
you need help with.

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,100
All right.

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,740
Don't say I didn't give you a good deal.

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,940
You won't find these goods

31
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,340
cheaper anywhere else in Wu County.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,700
Isn't that your elder brother?

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,180
Who's the woman beside him?

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,500
She's gorgeous.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,340
They're a perfect match.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,100
The Meng family is big and rich,

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,700
and the Pei family
buys far more than others.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,780
So the cost price

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,180
should be lower.

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,300
Let's lower it
by another twenty percent.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,300
Pei Jingheng,

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,900
you might as well take them for free!

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,780
Dusters.

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,940
Take a look.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,620
They are very durable.

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,380
What's that?

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,420
Come and take a look.

48
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,580
Come with me. Let's go take a look.

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,700
They are all on sale today.

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,140
On the last day
of the Fragrance Festival,

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,380
there'll be a Fragrance Competition.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,020
Today's the last day to sign up.

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,380
What do they actually compete in

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,300
at the Fragrance Competition?

55
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,780
It's the same stuff
you've been learning.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,100
Back then, this part

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,540
was meant to select people in the county

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,660
with a talent for fragrance-making.

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,980
Nowadays, it has been carried on

60
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,540
as the Pei family's way

61
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,780
of selecting talents for themselves.

62
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,260
Nowadays, in Wu County,

63
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,540
the Pei family dominates
the fragrance-making industry.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,500
Even if the winner
of the Fragrance Competition

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,180
isn't from the Pei family,

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,540
they will ultimately
be recruited by them.

67
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,380
You're very smart.

68
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,060
By the way, Eldest Young Master,

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,940
since Wu County is so big,

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,980
are there
no other fragrance shops around?

71
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,420
There used to be other shops,

72
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,330
but they all closed

73
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,420
because they couldn't compete
with the Pei family.

74
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,740
By now, who would dare
to challenge the Pei family

75
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,140
in this business?

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,620
Aunt Ping's fragrance shop
did very well back then.

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,460
There's no way
it couldn't compete with the Pei family.

78
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,820
The Pei family rules the industry.

79
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,300
On the surface, it's their skill;

80
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,900
but looking closer,

81
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,340
the Pei family may have deliberately
monopolized the trade.

82
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,340
Aunt Ping's disappearance back then

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,020
was probably connected to this.

84
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,620
I need to hurry and find
Ergou and the others.

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,580
What's on your mind?

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,140
Nothing.

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,820
Oh, Eldest Young Master,

88
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,140
I just remembered

89
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,420
that Second Young Master
had some tasks for me,

90
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,220
and I completely forgot.

91
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,660
Let's come out another time.

92
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,860
Thank you.

93
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
You won't sign up for the competition?

94
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,100
I won't.

95
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,780
Why are you still awake at this hour?

96
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,220
What are you doing here?

97
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,700
You scared me.

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,980
So you remembered to come back.

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,540
I admit I came back a bit late today.

100
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,300
A bit late?

101
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,260
Looks like you've been out
fooling around

102
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,980
with someone until now.

103
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,820
I just got carried away
and lost track of time.

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
I wasn't fooling around.

105
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,780
Besides,

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,020
I've been thinking about you,

107
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,740
and I even brought you something nice.

108
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,900
Your leftovers.

109
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,060
Is this how you've been thinking of me?

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,260
No.

111
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,820
This is really good.

112
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,900
You definitely haven't tried it before.

113
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,860
Give it a taste.

114
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,500
Here.

115
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,500
You...

116
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,780
Why are you being so stubborn
and unreasonable?

117
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,300
You're unbelievable!

118
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,260
I brought this back for you,

119
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,140
even though I wanted it myself.

120
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,300
Why are you yelling at me?

121
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,020
The Fragrance Festival
is only a couple of days away.

122
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
After giving it some thought,

123
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,420
I've decided that Jingheng
will host it this year.

124
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,340
No!

125
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,420
I've been the one hosting

126
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,860
the Fragrance Festival every year.

127
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,620
You should just focus on finding
the fragrance manual.

128
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,980
You did say

129
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,180
that if you couldn't recover it…

130
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,580
Fragrance manual… Day after day,
it's all you can talk about.

131
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,420
If I don't get it back,

132
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,620
will I no longer be the Pei family's
eldest legitimate daughter?

133
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Xiuning, Mother is just...

134
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,780
Shut it!

135
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,340
Stop pretending.

136
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,500
You just want to see me fail, don't you?

137
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,780
Not a chance.

138
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,780
He was too young before,

139
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,180
but now

140
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,180
that he can handle things on his own,

141
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Mother has him host
the Fragrance Competition.

142
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,780
Isn't it obvious

143
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,300
she favors Pei Jingheng as her heir?

144
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,100
Then what about me?

145
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,380
My Lady.

146
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,460
My Lady, please calm down.

147
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,380
Shut up!

148
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,460
You're no good either.

149
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,860
Since you started taking the medicine
at the beginning of the year,

150
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,540
that thing of yours still isn't working.

151
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,300
If you can't do anything right,

152
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,100
then get out of the Pei Manor!

153
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,940
My Lady,

154
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,460
it's all my fault.

155
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,300
After all these years,

156
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,740
I still haven't given you
a single child.

157
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,580
But… But I've found

158
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,860
two more obedient and sensible men.

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,140
The physician has already checked.

160
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,780
They are both fit to have children.

161
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,420
Once they enter the manor,

162
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,660
I'll have them serve you.

163
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,140
We'll do our best

164
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,460
to help you become pregnant
as soon as possible.

165
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,860
Look at you, all timid and submissive.

166
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,140
You're truly spineless.

167
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,940
Can't you do something useful for me?

168
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,500
Really?

169
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,180
Yes.

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,140
So you'll do anything for me?

171
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,540
Yes.

172
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Does it hurt?

173
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,780
If it does,

174
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,300
make sure you remember

175
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,220
the promise you just made to me.

176
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,140
I have an idea,

177
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,540
one that would totally prevent

178
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,700
Second Young Master
from competing with you.

179
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,020
Eldest Young Master,
that's truly impressive.

180
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,380
You can even do this?

181
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,500
A man's duty

182
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,740
is to marry and raise children.

183
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,100
Knowing more about household affairs
can come in handy.

184
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,380
With your skill and dexterity,

185
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,660
it's not only household affairs
you can manage,

186
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,100
but you can also accomplish anything

187
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
you set your mind to.

188
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,140
Here, try it yourself.

189
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,620
I don't know how.

190
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,220
I'll teach you. Come.

191
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,940
Sure.

192
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,500
Here, pinch it slightly.

193
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,740
What are you two doing?

194
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,420
Why are you sneaking around

195
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,580
like a ghost?

196
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,100
In broad daylight,

197
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,740
the Pei family's Eldest Young Master

198
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,100
and a maid,

199
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,740
so flirty and intimate.

200
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,660
How improper.

201
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,380
How is that flirty and intimate?

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,980
It's your filthy mind

203
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,420
that sees it that way.

204
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,940
I invited Zhiyao
to try the pastries I made.

205
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,860
If you don't like it,

206
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,620
I'll keep my distance in the future.

207
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,380
"Zhiyao"?

208
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,100
Sounds like you two are quite close.

209
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,860
Eldest Young Master, here's the thing:

210
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,140
Second Young Master

211
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,300
simply doesn't like me.

212
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
I'll let you get on with your business.

213
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
We'll leave now.

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,380
Eldest Young Master, didn't you say

215
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,660
you'd take me somewhere fun?

216
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,540
Let's go.

217
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,820
So this
is the Pei family’s Treasure Pavilion.

218
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,620
Zhiyao,

219
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
besides making fragrances,

220
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,740
there are many interesting things

221
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,820
and fascinating people in this world.

222
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,460
Is there anything you like?

223
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,340
I'll give it to you.

224
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,940
That won't be necessary.

225
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,740
These are far too valuable.

226
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,940
Eldest Young Master.

227
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,700
What's the matter?

228
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,980
Have you noticed any strange smells?

229
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,380
No.

230
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,900
What's wrong? Are you all right?

231
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm fine.

232
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,180
