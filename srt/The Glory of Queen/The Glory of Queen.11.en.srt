[Episode 11]

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,020
Grandmother,

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,220
Zhiyao has decided to marry me.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,940
Grandmother, please arrange my wedding
at your earliest convenience.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,860
Zhiyao,

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,740
have you made up your mind?

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,820
I...

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,420
Yes.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,820
I was planning

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,980
to tell you myself, Madam.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,420
It's the same if you and I

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,340
tell Grandmother together.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,060
Mother,

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,220
this is excellent news.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,620
Why not allow me to handle the wedding?

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
I shall ensure that Zhiyao

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,660
is married into our Pei family
with all due honor.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,020
Very well,

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,460
you may take charge of it.

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,020
Thank you, Mother.

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,660
You must be happy for me, too, right?

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Congratulations, Jinglan.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,300
Zhiyao,

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,380
are you mad?

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,060
Eldest Young Master,

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,660
I did agree to marry you,

28
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,540
but before you tell Madam,

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,300
shouldn't you have discussed it
with me first?

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,780
I admit I wanted to marry you
as soon as possible.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,220
I thought you felt the same way.

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,380
I...

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Never mind.

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,740
What's done is done.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,540
If I had been even a step slower,

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,020
would you have gone back on your word?

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,540
I should be happy
that I get to stay in the Pei Manor,

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
yet why do I feel
such a weight on my heart?

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,660
After the wedding,

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,600
I'll gain access
to the Pei family's most closely guarded

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,380
fragrance-making techniques,

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,540
and I'll be one step closer
to uncovering the truth

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
behind my aunt's abduction.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,180
Let's go.

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,940
Sirs,

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,940
you brought me here

47
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,420
and yet haven't killed me.

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,620
That means
I must still be of some use to you.

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,860
How about this? I'll pay you.

50
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Whoever hired you to abduct me,
how much did they offer?

51
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
I'll pay double.

52
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,260
Triple if you like.

53
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,020
I can also write to the Pei family.

54
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,420
Someone from the Pei family
will come to rescue me.

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,180
No wonder you've caught the attention
of the two Pei brothers,

56
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,100
you are quite a beauty indeed.

57
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,060
Sir.

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,900
You...

59
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,940
Do you know who my master is?

60
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,940
My master is Pei Jinghang.

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,900
With his terrible temper,

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,500
if he were to get angry,

63
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,780
I… I'm afraid
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

64
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,140
Is that a threat?

65
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,420
Once you're taken to the Quluo Kingdom,

66
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,180
you'll sell for no less
than a thousand gold.

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,820
Pei Jingheng is nothing.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,100
What are you doing?

69
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,820
Hold on. Lustful as you may be,

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
don't ruin her worth.

71
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,420
Once this job is done,

72
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,260
we'll have enough
to settle down in Quluo.

73
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,460
I became a kidnapper because I was sick

74
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,300
of being pushed around by women.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,860
Why is it always men who are humiliated?

76
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,060
Today, I'll do as I please with her.

77
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,260
Help!

78
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,060
Zhiyao.

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,940
I knew you'd come to save me.

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,780
It's all right now.

81
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,620
Let's go.

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,300
I just sprained my ankle.

83
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,820
Villains!

84
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,820
Release Zhiyao at once!

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,980
How dare you ruin my plans!

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,020
I'll kill you!

87
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,060
Are you all right, Jinglan?

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,980
Eldest Young Master,
what happened to you?

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,620
I'm fine.

90
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,900
That's good.

91
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,860
Eldest Young Master.

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,180
Why are you crying out?

93
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,900
Sir,

94
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
our Eldest Young Master's leg
has been hurting more severely

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,260
these past couple of days.

96
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,540
Do you know what might be causing it?

97
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,100
Your leg is injured in a critical spot.

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,580
If the wound had been any deeper,

99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,620
it could have been much worse.
So consider yourself lucky.

100
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,140
Eldest Young Master, don't worry.

101
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,900
Rest in bed for another month or so,

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,940
and you'll be fully recovered.

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,740
But in just a few days,
it will be my wedding day.

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,420
Is there any way

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
to help the wound heal faster?

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,140
It takes time
for muscles and bones to heal.

107
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,060
If you get out of bed too soon,

108
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,980
it will only make the injury worse.

109
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Thank you, sir.

110
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,500
It's my job.

111
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,500
Eldest Young Master, you were injured
all because of Miss Song.

112
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,820
She came to visit you
in the first couple of days,

113
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,740
but Second Young Master

114
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,380
kept finding every possible excuse
to stop her.

115
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,500
Surely he did it on purpose.

116
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,980
Enough!

117
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,420
Zhiyao can only be my wife.

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,700
I've come this far.

119
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,260
There's no turning back.

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,260
Father,

121
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,940
Mother,

122
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,780
rest assured.

123
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
I will find my aunt as soon as possible.

124
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,500
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

125
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,140
Second, bow to the parents.

126
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,620
All right.

127
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,020
Bow to each other.

128
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,020
My Lady.

129
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,700
How come it's you?

130
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,300
If you change your mind now,

131
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,260
I'll take you out of here.

132
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,840
The ceremony is complete,

133
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,220
the couple will now be escorted
to the bridal chamber.

134
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,540
Eldest Young Master is severely injured,

135
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,460
and he cannot leave his bed.

136
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,940
Therefore, Second Young Master
acted on his behalf

137
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,260
to go through
the wedding ceremony with you.

No need. How could I possibly let you
help me change the dressing?

Changing the dressing

175
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,780
is no big deal.

On your wedding night,

177
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,700
if you go out and have a servant
change your dressing for you,

178
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,340
and word gets out,

179
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,460
people will start gossiping.

180
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,260
Thank you.

181
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,820
It's nothing.

182
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,740
Second Young Master, what are you doing?

183
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,420
Hurry and go inform Eldest Master.

184
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,460
Yes.

185
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,100
Eldest Young Master,

186
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,860
you really don't need
to be so formal with me.

187
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,540
We're partners now.

188
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm happy to help you

189
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,780
change the dressing.

190
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,780
Zhiyao,

191
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,940
no one has ever truly loved me,
defended me,

192
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,740
or cared for me.

193
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,820
Eldest Young Master,
you are such a good person.

194
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,780
Someone like that
will definitely appear.

195
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,500
That person has already appeared.

196
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,900
Pei Jingheng.

197
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,140
Come here.

198
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,620
Why must you marry him?

199
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,420
Why can't she marry me?

200
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,980
She is already married to me.

201
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,980
You reckless child!

202
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,540
Jingheng,

203
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,820
just put down your sword
and we can talk it out.

204
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,660
Do it.

205
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,540
If you want to take Zhiyao away today,

206
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,900
you'll have to step over my dead body.

207
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,940
Jingheng!

208
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,220
