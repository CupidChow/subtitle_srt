Why must you do this?

00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,860
Naturally,
it's because I am fond of him.

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,740
Then what about your promise to me?

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,020

Chief,

42
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,820
I have to say,

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,140
with the way you're dressed,

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,820
you really do look like
a married woman now.

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,820
But

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,540
does the Pei family's Second Young Master
know about your fake marriage

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,900
with Eldest Young Master?

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,260
Stop teasing me.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,940
How's it going with the matter
I asked you to look into?

50
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,340
I've sent word to every beggar hideout

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,660
in Wu County.

52
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,580
I heard the person
who took you isn't from here,

53
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
but from another place.

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,700
As long as he's still around,

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,900
we'll find him for you.

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,580
Isn't this...?

57
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,460
Please take a seat.

58
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,900
Chief, we've got other matters
to attend to.

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,460
You...

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
should have a drink with him instead.

61
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,020
Once we have news,

62
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
we'll notify you immediately.

63
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,780
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

64
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,300
Let's get moving.

65
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,460
Wait. I haven't drunk my tea.

66
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,100
Leave it. Let's go now.

67
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,900
Come.

68
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,340
Stop pushing.
Where are we going, anyway?

69
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,940
That's not what I meant.

70
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,780
You have nothing to say?

71
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,380
What am I supposed to say?

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,180
About yesterday, you and my brother...

73
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,780
Your brother and I didn't...

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,380
Didn't what?

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,620
He didn't satisfy you?

76
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,260
Why did she slap him?

77
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,740
Let's go give her a hand.

78
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,500
Don't.

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,860
What do you know? That's just their way
to spice things up.

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,060
You'd better not butt in.

81
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,380
Exactly.

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,220
See. Now it's time for some forced love.

83
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,100
You are right.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,900
What are you doing?

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,100
Let go of me!

86
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,460
Chief's mad.

87
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,420
Other than sharing
the same gender as Chief,

88
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,260
you don't understand a thing.

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,940
This is clearly Chief teaching
the Pei family's Second Young Master

90
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,540
how to behave as a husband.

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,620
What are you doing?

92
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:23,940
Look at me.

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,180

I'm busy.

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,980
She's busy.

125
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,140
Please ask away.

126
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,340
Have you seen any fierce-looking men?

127
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,340
One of them

128
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,420
has a scar on his face,

129
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,740
roughly around

130
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,220
this area.

131
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,380
Yes.

132
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,820
They only booked one room.

133
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,500
The bed is only about this big.

134
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,970
Crammed together like that,
I dread to think

135
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,980
how they might smell in sweat.

136
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,820
I've never seen anyone so stingy.

137
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,260
But they looked so rough and tough

138
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,260
that I didn't dare complain.

139
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,460
Sir, did they commit a crime?

140
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,380
Should I report it to the authorities?

141
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,060
Let's not trouble
the authorities just yet,

142
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,300
so as not to alarm them.

143
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,820
Would it be possible for me,

144
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,940
I mean us, to take a look at their room?

145
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
Sure. No problem.

146
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,500
It's a mixture of hyacinth orchid
and notoginseng powder.

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,780
We used to use this
to reduce swelling, too.

148
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,860
Looks like it's been left here
for a long time.

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,740
They probably haven't come back
in the meantime.

150
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,860
Someone among them must be injured.

151
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,260
If they returned, their presence
would be too conspicuous

152
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,620
and draw attention.

153
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,540
Since they're injured,
they certainly couldn't have gone far.

154
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,060
So they must still be somewhere
in the city.

155
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,980
They still have to eat, right?

156
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,300
Great minds think alike.

157
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,860
Chief,

158
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,060
where should we go to eat?

159
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,740
Sir.

160
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,180
Two steamed buns, please.

161
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,980
Sure.

162
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,180
Here you go.

163
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,020
You two, keep an eye on him.

164
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,940
You come with me.

165
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:36,740
Let's go.

166
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,140
Who ordered you to kidnap me?

167
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,900
Speak up!

168
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,140
My vision is poor,

169
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,060
and my memory's bad.

170
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
I can't remember a thing.

171
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,540
Being stubborn, are you?

172
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,980
It's the rule of our line of work:

173
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
once you take someone's money,

174
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,020
you do their bidding.

175
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,620
I won't betray my patron.

176
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,260
Feel free to kill me
or torture me however you want.

177
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,980
Go ahead.

178
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,700
That's her.

179
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,360
She said she'd give me
another five hundred taels

180
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,900
once the job is done.

181
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,340
Are you sure?

182
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,020
I've got a keen eye. I'd recognize her
even if she were reduced to ashes.

183
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,140
Move.

184
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,860
She works for my aunt.

185
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,900
All she's doing

186
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,780
is trying to stop me
from marrying into the Pei family.

187
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,780
As long as you disappear,

188
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,020
my grandmother's promise
can't be fulfilled.

189
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,260
In the end, the Pei family
will still be hers.

190
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,340
You'd already guessed it long ago,
hadn't you?

191
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,020
Just like when you were little,

192
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,660
no matter how many dangers you ran into,

193
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,060
as long as you were fine in the end,

194
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,500
Madam would always downplay it

195
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,740
and sweep the problems under the rug.

196
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
This time, it's different.

197
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,420
What's different?

198
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,380
Anyway, I'm fine.

199
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,060
And I've successfully married
into the Pei family.

200
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,580
Madam wouldn't want us
to pursue the matter.

201
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,620
Why is it you two
coming to pay respects to Mother?

202
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,860
If someone didn't know,
they might think you married Jingheng.

203
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,940
Back when you were a maid,
you two were inseparable,

204
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,100
and now you don't even bother to avoid
giving people the wrong impression.

205
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,980
What's the matter?

206
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,180
Two weeks ago,

207
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,700
you took two thousand taels
from the shop.

208
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
What did you spend it on?

209
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,980
It's only two thousand taels.

210
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,980
What's the big deal?

211
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,820
I spent it on the shop.

212
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,140
Then what's this?

213
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,660
Isn't this a banknote
from the Pei family?

214
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,220
What about it?

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,860
This banknote

216
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,740
ended up in the hands
of your husband's family.

217
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,180
So what if Feng Lusheng
spent a little money on his family?

218
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,180
Mother,

219
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,100
which member of his family?

220
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,140
His cousin, Feng Yun.

221
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,260
Let me remind you.

222
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,340
These banknotes

223
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,060
are the very ones you personally took

224
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,380
from the Counting Room two weeks ago.

225
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,820
Is that true or not?

226
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,220
That's true.

227
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,300
You also personally handed them
to Feng Yun.

228
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,620
Is that true or not?

229
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,820
What exactly are you trying to say?

230
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,820
Do you know

231
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,100
it was Feng Yun who kidnapped

232
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,180
my sister-in-law?

233
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,340
Now that she's caught red-handed,

234
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
what else is there for you to say?

235
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,020
Are you saying

236
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,860
it was me who…

237
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,900
You...

238
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,500
That's a vicious slander!

239
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,140
You shameless liar!

240
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,900
Shut up!

241
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,020
If you were not part of the Pei family,

242
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,060
do you think

243
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,580
you'd be alive to stand here
and argue with me?

244
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,140
You...

245
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,940
Mother,

246
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,100
did you hear the way
they're speaking to me?

247
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,740
They show no respect for their elders,

248
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,140
and are utterly rebellious!

249
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,820
Zhiyao married into the Pei family
out of respect

250
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,860
for its achievement
in fragrance-making and family values.

251
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,580
But now she's faced
an unwarranted calamity

252
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,460
and was almost harmed.

253
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,460
If the Pei family
takes this matter lightly,

254
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,260
wouldn't she lose her trust in us?

255
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,300
If we treat her like this,

256
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,620
how could she ever be devoted
to our family, Grandmother?

257
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,860
Mother,

258
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,140
he's colluding with Song Zhiyao
to trick you.

259
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,100
They're deliberately trying
to drive a wedge between us

260
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,460
and frame me.

261
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,660
You mustn't believe them.

262
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,580
Mother!

263
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,660
Enough!

264
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,220
Zhiyao,

265
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,700
what do you propose?

266
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,500
From my perspective,

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,780
Madam, having married
into the Pei family,

268
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,580
I should be considered
half a member of the family.

269
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,820
All I ask for is the truth.

270
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,260
That's not too much to ask, is it?

271
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,100
Grandmother,
Zhiyao is only asking for the truth.

272
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,500
What the Pei household
as a whole needs, however,

273
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,380
is fairness and justice,

274
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,420
and a clear sense of right and wrong.

275
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,140
Please judge wisely, Grandmother.

276
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,740
Mother,

277
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,620
I really didn't do anything like that.

278
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,620
Please don't take their word for it.

279
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,020
Mother.

280
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,340
Mother.

281
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,100
Then explain!

282
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,100

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,940
