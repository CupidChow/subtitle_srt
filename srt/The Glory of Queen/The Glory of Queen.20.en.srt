[Episode 20]

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,340
Who are you brave people

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,140
that dare to trespass
into the Pei Manor?

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,460
State your purpose.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,660
Brave people?

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,300
Are you blind or what?

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,660
Can't you see we live on the streets?

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,220
That means we are beggars, understand?

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,980
I've never seen such arrogant beggars.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,180
Everyone, grab your weapons

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,060
and throw them out!

13
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,660
What should we do, Chief?

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,700
Split up and scatter.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,660
What do you mean by that?

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:30,980
Run!

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,380
- Over there!
- Quick! Over there!

18
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,580
- After them!
- You go there.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,020
Ping, I've got some good news.

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,380
Soon,

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,460
we'll be able to be together openly.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,220
Now,

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,580
no one can stop me anymore.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,740
When the time comes,

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,260
I will see to it
that you marry into the Pei family

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,020
with all due honor.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
You'll be my wife,

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,220
and I'll be your husband.

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,940
Then we'll have
a few children of our own,

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,660
and our whole family

31
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,420
will live together happily.

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,220
Eldest Master!

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
Bad news. A lot of beggars
have broken into the manor,

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,900
claiming they're here
to save Song Zhiyao.

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,140
There are just too many of them.

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,140
We can't stop them at all.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,020
Useless!

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,500
That wretched woman!

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,700
Eldest Master,
something has happened at the annex.

40
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,020
A bunch of incompetents!

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,820
Follow me!

42
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,540
Where's Pei Jingheng?

43
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,180
He went to save Aunt Ping.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,820
Aunt Ping?

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,900
Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,860
He mentioned something about directions.

47
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
A division tactic.

48
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,180
No, a divergence tactic.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,820
What he really said
was a diversionary tactic.

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,620
Let's go.

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,380
Zhiyao.

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,780
Aunt Ping is asleep.

53
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,700
Miss,

54
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,900
you are so fair and lovely.

55
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,300
You remind me of my niece,

56
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,740
whom I watched grow up.

57
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,740
If she were still alive,

58
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,420
she would probably be

59
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,620
just as elegant and poised as you are.

60
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,220
Perhaps

61
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,460
she's still alive.

62
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,340
If she's still alive,

63
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,440
having spent all these years

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,180
without her parents
and family by her side,

65
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,900
she must have suffered greatly.

66
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,060
Miss.

67
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,700
Miss, what's wrong?

68
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,820
There, there.

69
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,940
It's all right now.

70
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,300
Why didn't you tell Aunt Ping
who you really are back there?

71
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,700
Aunt Ping is still alive,

72
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,620
and she's here by my side.

73
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,900
That's already enough.

74
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,380
None of the rest matters.

75
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,300
Pei Jingheng,

76
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm no longer an orphan.

77
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,380
I have a family now.

78
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,820
It's just… Pei Jingheng,

79
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,100
I won't let the suffering
my aunt has endured

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,260
all these years go unavenged.

81
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,860
But that person is your father,

82
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,740
and I don't want to put you
in a difficult position.

83
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,860
Zhiyao,

84
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,900
ever since I was a child,

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,260
I've lived carrying my father's hopes
on my shoulders.

86
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,380
I never complained.

87
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,660
But now,

88
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,780
his obsession runs too deep,

89
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,020
and he's hurt
far too many innocent people.

90
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,700
So even though I know

91
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,820
he's suffered a lot all these years,

92
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,780
that cannot justify

93
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,940
his wrongdoing.

94
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,940
Ping...

95
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,540
Ping.

96
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Pei Qingshan.

97
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,540
Have you recovered?

98
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,940
Have you remembered everything?

99
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,420
That's wonderful, Ping.

100
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,940
Yes.

101
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,860
I remember everything now.

102
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,820
Why did you hire people
to kill my sister and her entire family?

103
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,620
No, I didn't.

104
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,140
Ping, listen to me.

105
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,900
I was just afraid of losing you.

106
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,180
All I wanted then
was to keep you by my side,

107
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,780
so I could take good care of you.

108
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
I never once intended to harm
your sister or her family.

109
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,700
I truly didn't know
that the people who took you away

110
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,540
would do something so cruel
to the Song family.

111
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Now, it doesn't matter anymore.

112
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,140
Let it all go, all right?

113
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,700
You no longer need to concern yourself

114
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,500
with the matters that once troubled you.

115
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,220
My wife passed away long ago,

116
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,540
and the Pei family
is now under my control.

117
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,380
I can have you marry into the Pei family

118
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,460
with dignity, openly and honorably.

119
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,260
You're terrifying.

120
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,380
For the sake of your own interests,

121
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,460
you'd even kill your own mother
and younger sister.

122
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,900
How many times do I have to tell you?

123
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,020
They left me with no choice!

124
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,940
And...

125
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,740
And that meddlesome Pei Xiuning.

126
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,220
She had already uncovered
the counterfeit workshop.

127
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,580
If she kept digging,
she would've found you next.

128
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,180
I had no choice but to kill her.

129
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,460
And as for my mother,

130
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,420
as long as she lived,

131
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,260
we could never truly be together.

132
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,980
Look how perfect things are now.

133
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,700
All I need to do
is offer her some incense

134
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,380
and finish her funeral rites,

135
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,540
then you can marry into the Pei family.

136
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,100
Also, I swear to Heaven

137
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,780
that the Pei family

138
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,180
shall belong to you and me alone.

139
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,420
You brute!

140
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,980
You wretched brute!

141
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,540
How dare you commit matricide
and murder your own sister?

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,740
Song Zhiyao,

143
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,780
this was all your doing, wasn't it?

144
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,180
Jingheng,

145
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,300
are you really just going to stand there

146
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,700
and watch that vile woman
scheme against your father?

147
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,740
Don't forget, you're a man, too!

148
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,460
Are you really willing
to spend your whole life

149
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,540
being trampled under these women's feet?

150
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,740
This has nothing to do with gender.

151
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,580
Wrong is wrong.

152
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,060
Father,

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,300
turn back while you still can.

154
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,500
Jingheng,

155
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,180
do you really think
I can still turn back?

156
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,700
Father.

157
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,180
Don't worry, Jingheng.

158
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm not going anywhere.

159
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,660
I am the Eldest Master
of the Pei family, after all.

160
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,940
You expect me

161
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,220
to bow and scrape,

162
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,300
to kneel and beg for mercy, don't you?

163
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,140
You expect me

164
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,460
to grovel like a dog, don't you?

165
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,980
You vicious women!

166
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,540
Don't even think about it!

167
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,180
Never!

168
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,820
It's...

169
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,020
It's all over.

170
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,260
Jingheng,

171
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,380
there's no turning back for me now.

172
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,020
Father!

173
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,660
Watch out!
