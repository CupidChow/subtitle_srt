No!

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
Why am I here?

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,220
I saw you asleep on the incense table,

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,540
so I brought you here.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,380
You've certainly enjoyed it.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,860
With your posture like this,

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,660
does it seem appropriate?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,740
No.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,220
Then why are you still here?

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,580
I'll get off you right now.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,060
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,540
I didn't mean to offend you.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,020
I just had a nightmare.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,740
I think I dreamed about my family,

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,620
but I can't even remember

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,500
what they look like.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,580
Actually,

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,900
sometimes
forgetting isn't such a bad thing.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,340
The presence of some family members
can be lethal.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,740
Next time you go to the fragrance shop,

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,940
could you take me with you?

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,020
Just look at me.

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,940
What ill intent could I possibly harbor?

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,460
I only wish to serve you,

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,660

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,660

Now that you know
a number of fragrance ingredients,

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,300
I'll test you
on what you've learned recently.

37
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,900
Please go ahead.

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,540
Listen carefully.

39
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,540
What's a Fragrance Beast?

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,420
The Fragrance Beast
is derived from Beast Charcoal.

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,140
You take charcoal powder,
mix in some other ingredients,

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,460
and shape it into beast-like blocks.

43
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,140
Then, when you add aromatic herbs,
it becomes the Fragrance Beast.

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,220
Why do people today
prefer to burn incense indirectly?

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,180
Placing a layer of mica or jade

46
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,820

reduces smoke

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,740
and allows the fragrance
to disperse more slowly.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,140
This is why fragrance connoisseurs
favor this technique.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,020
This is not mentioned
in the fragrance guide.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,980
Who told you that?

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,540
I don't remember.

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,620
I just heard someone
talk about it before.

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,220
I didn't cheat.

55
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,260
All right.

56
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,780

57
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,620
Second Young Master, I…

58

Jingheng's dedication
to studying fragrance

62
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,660
reminds me so much of myself
when I was young.

63
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,900
For a century, the Pei family
has preserved this legacy,

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,300
thanks to our continuous research
and refinement.

65

Jingheng is smart and diligent.

66
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,460
He is indeed commendable.

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,100
By the way, any updates on the assassin?

68
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,140
Mother,

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,700
I was just about to report to you.

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,780
Yesterday, only one servant
brought congee to the assassin,

71
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,860
and shortly after, the assassin died.

72
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,900
I've already questioned the servant,

73
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,580
and he said it was the steward

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,340
from the younger Xiuning's courtyard
who sent the congee,

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,900
and that the congee itself
came from the steward as well.

76
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,740
So you're saying I was the one
who had the assassin killed?

77
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,100
Qingshan, you spent ages investigating,

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,180
and now you are just throwing mud

79
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,180
to hide your own ineptitude?

80
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,940
Why so worked up, Xiuning?

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,100
I just find
the assassin's death suspicious.

82
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,020
Surely someone wished
to conceal the truth,

83
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,180
so they decided to eliminate him.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,580
Mother,

85
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,260
this matter
could be either serious or minor.

86
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,640
Perhaps we should report it
to the authorities

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,620
and have the coroner examine the body.

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,060
Enough!

89
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,980
Not only did we fail
to recover the fragrance manual,

90
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,580
but now such a scandal occurs at home.

91
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,460
Do you wish to make us
even more disgraced?

92
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,500
Mother, you're right.

93
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,020
You may all leave now.

I've been waiting for.

Be careful.

96
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,220
I must be cursed
to run into you two brothers.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
What did you say?

98
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,060
Nothing.

99
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,740
Second Young Master asked me
to run some errands.

102
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,420
you've been in the restroom forever.

103
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,020
I thought you'd gotten stuck there.

104
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,020
Come here.

105
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,140
Jingheng,

106
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,100
if this maid isn't to your liking,

107
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,060
I can swap in two
from my courtyard for you.

108
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,780
What do you think?

109
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,580
I will take care of
the maid's training myself,

110
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,620
so you don't need to worry about it.

111
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,260
It seems this maid isn't to your liking,

112
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
which is why she keeps upsetting you.

113
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,220
Since you're not satisfied with her,

114
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,340
there's no need
to make things so awkward.

115
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,900
If word gets out, people will think
the Pei family mistreats servants.

116
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,500
If you don't mind,

117
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,460
let her come to my courtyard.

118
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,460
I actually quite like her.

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,780
Did I mistreat you?

120
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,580
Of course not.

121
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,020
Second Young Master treats me very well.

122
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,420
It's my own fault.

123
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,860
I keep upsetting him.

124
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,380
Jingheng,

125
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,860
I may have no authority to decide,

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,860
but I truly feel for her.

127
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,180
Perhaps we should let her
choose for herself.

128
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,300
I've long wished to avoid upsetting you,
Second Young Master.

129
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,620
Since you don't like me,

130
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,380
I'll go with Eldest Young Master.

131
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,180
Then let's go.

132
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,140
She may not attend to me well,

133
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,260
but her gift for fragrance-making
is undeniable.

134
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,100
I've already taken her as my apprentice.

135
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,140
You should look for someone else.

136
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,020
Let's go.

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,700
So, you ran out and got caught
right away. Feeling disappointed?

138
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,620
I went out to the restroom,

139
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,780
and happened to run into
Eldest Young Master,

140
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,180
which is what caused the delay.

141
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,380
Eldest Young Master?

142
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,780
Why does he care for you so much?

143
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,940
How should I know?

144
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,220
Second Young Master,

145
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,980
Mr. Meng would like to see you.

146
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,820
Measure and pack
these fragrance powders carefully.

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,190
Second Young Master asked me
to go to the branch

148
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,140
to get the fragrance boxes.

149
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,620
Didn't Second Young Master ask you
to pack the fragrance powders?

150
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,100
Second Young Master said that
right before you came.

151
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,900
Do you dare to question him?

152
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,500
If you were to delay his affairs,

153
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,540
what punishment would you face?

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,180
This pouch is worth a fair sum.

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,740
I've managed to escape at last.

156
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,940
Now I can go rescue
Ergou and the others.

157
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,020
I wonder how they're doing.

158
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,900

159
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,980

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,620
These are on sale. Take a look.

and perfume pouches.

and only then will I give it to you.

173
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,860
Release them.

We'll never meet again.
