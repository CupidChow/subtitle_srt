00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,500
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,820
Mother,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,620
I really didn't do anything like that.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,140
Please don't take their word for it.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,380
Mother.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
Then explain!

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,340
What's the story with the banknote?

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,780
You've really disappointed me.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,100
Mother...

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,740
I really didn't do it.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,420
The workshop...

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,380
The workshop!

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,420
Mother,

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,460
I've already found the place

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,940
where the Pei family's products
were being counterfeited.

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,300
The person behind

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,100
it is extremely familiar
with our family's methods and formulas.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,790
I fear… I fear
that someone within the household

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,660
may be stealing from us.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,740
Please give me a little more time,

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,900
and I will surely
get to the bottom of it.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,980
Mother.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
For now, let's focus on investigating
the counterfeit workshop.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,700
As for Zhiyao's kidnapping,

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,660
I will ensure
a proper explanation is given.

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,340
How's your injury?

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,580
It's almost healed.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,620
That's good to hear.

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,100
Lan.

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,420
Since you and Zhiyao
are already married,

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,220
you should arrange for her to conceive
as soon as possible.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,420
Your grandmother is still waiting.

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,420
Zhiyao and I
are getting along just fine.

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,220
It's just that Jingheng
doesn't seem quite used to the fact

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,020
that Zhiyao is no longer his maid
but my wife.

37
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,900
He still comes to see her
from time to time.

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,900
Indeed, they should mind the boundaries
between men and women.

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,300
Since Zhiyao is already married,

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,380
Jingheng's behavior

41
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,180
is truly inappropriate.

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,060
Then why won't you
speak up for me, Father?

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,700
Jingheng and I are both men. If…

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,780
If I had been the one chosen back then,

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,260
I would have done
just as well as he did.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,260
Lan,

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,260
I've often regretted it
over the years, too.

48
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,420
If I had trained you back then,

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
you wouldn't be struggling
like this now.

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,860
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,300
My Lady, have you taken note

52
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,660
of everything I've said?

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,700
I have. Thank you, Madam Li.

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,820
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,940
Are you disappointed in the Pei family?

56
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,740
No, not really.

57
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,500
At least,

58
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,620
someone is still standing up for me.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,060
You take a seat. I'll leave now.

60
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,020
I will definitely give you
an explanation.

61
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,020
Trust me.

62
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,860
Jingheng, you're here, too?

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,580
Jinglan.

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,620
Take this out.

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,740
Yes.

66
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,220
I noticed you've lost
some weight lately,

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,500
so I made
some nourishing dishes for you.

68
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,500
Let's eat first.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,220
Jingheng, are you joining us?

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,340
Second Young Master just said
he's going to Tianxiang Pavilion.

71
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,910
How could meeting outsiders
be more important

72
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,940
than having a meal with family?

73
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,540
Jinglan, I hope you don't mind.

74
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,940
I'll have a taste.

75
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,620
I didn't know you'd be here.

76
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,780
If I had known, I'd have cooked more.

77
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,940
These

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,180
are all my wife's favorite dishes.

79
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,860
That won't be a problem, Jinglan.

80
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,820
I may be picky,

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,540
but my tastes

82
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,260
happen to be very similar
to Lady Song's.

83
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,620
These dishes suit me perfectly.

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,660
Eat this.
I've removed all the bones for you.

85
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,500
Jinglan, she doesn't like fish.

86
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,740
It's too fishy for her.

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,060
Oh, well, I'll help her take care of it.

88
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Jingheng, you still act
the same way you did as a child.

89
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,500
Jinglan, you're no different.

90
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,940
Honestly,

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,500
it's been ages
since we last ate together.

92
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,020
This is truly a rare occasion.

93
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,380
Jinglan,

94
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,420
you should eat, too.

95
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,660
Lady Song, don't hold back.

96
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,820
These are all your favorite dishes.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,140
You two

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,620
can enjoy your meal together.
I'll leave now.

99
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,180
You really won't eat any?

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,260
Yes, this is the one.

101
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,620
My Lady,

102
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,860
I've noticed you usually like

103
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,820
those light-scented sachets.

104
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,500
Will you teach me how to make them?

105
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,020
You want to learn
how to make fragrances?

106
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,140
I've always wanted to learn,

107
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,140
but unfortunately, I'm a man.

108
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,260
In my father's eyes,

109
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,340
rather than learning fragrance-making,

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,380
I should be learning
how to serve my wife properly

111
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
and win her favor.

112
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,420
What does it matter
if you're a man or a woman?

113
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,940
As long as you are willing to learn,
I'll teach you.

114
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,820
Sure.

115
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,940
Have a smell.

116
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,140
When making fragrance,

117
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
never rush.

118
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,020
You must stay calm and focused.

119
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,540
Any additions or reductions
should be tried in small amounts.

120
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,020
Even the smallest difference

121
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,300
can affect

122
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,020
the final scent and effect.

123
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Why don't you give it a try?

124
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,900
Sure.

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,060
Put this into that.

126
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,620
All right.

127
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,420
When making fragrance, never rush.

128
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,300
You must stay calm and focused.

129
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,740
Any additions or reductions
should be tried in small amounts.

130
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,420
Even the smallest difference

131
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,460
can affect the final scent and effect.

132
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,420
The things I once taught you,

133
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,460
you're now teaching to another man.

134
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Song Zhiyao, you're really something.

135
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,940
Now, add those in.

136
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,260
What's wrong?

137
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,700
Nothing.

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,620
It seems a little injured kitten
just ran past.

139
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,060
Mix in a bit more of this.

140
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,740
This?

141
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
Would this be enough?

142
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,460
Pei Jingheng,

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
now that we're in-laws,

144
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,780
we should mind our boundaries.

145
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
Divorce Jinglan.

146
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,940
I… I can't divorce him.

147
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,100
Is this how you treat me now?

148
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,140
Say what you have to say,

149
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,820
but keep your hands off me.

150
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Do you dislike me?

151
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,500
Why are you being so unreasonable?

152
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,740
So, in your eyes,
I'm being unreasonable?

153
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,700
If that's what you want to think,
there's nothing I can do.

154
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,580
Are you really that attached to Jinglan?

155
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Yes, yes. Whatever you say.

156
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,420
Song Zhiyao.

157
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,860
Pei Jingheng,

158
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,380
I don't want to argue with you.

159
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,460
