00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,500
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,100
Eldest Master,

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,060
what do you think you are doing?

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,580
Madam!

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,300
Greetings, Mother.

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,020
Seize that wretched woman, Song Zhiyao,
and take her away.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,340
Impudent!

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,060
You cursed one!

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,300
This is exactly why I will not entrust
the Pei family to him.

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,260
What are you doing?

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,260
- Let go of me!
- Move.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,580
Madam!

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,580
You wretched beast.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,260
You'd rather entrust the family estate

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
to an outsider than to me.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,060
Why?

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,300
You know best

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,420
how Xiuning died.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,660
Mother, this is so unfair.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,140
My talent clearly surpasses hers.

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,900
All she does is drink and play.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,180
She can do nothing else.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,780
And just because she is a daughter,

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,180
she gets to inherit the family estate

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
and receive all your attention?

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,900
You only care about her.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,740
This is the Pei family's rule!

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,020
What nonsensical family rule is this?

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,020
Rules are made by people!

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,540
A century-old rule like this
should be abolished!

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,020
How dare you!

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,600
How dare you
treat the centuries-old rule

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,980
of the Pei family and the Yuezun Kingdom

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,700
with such contempt!

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,860
You are always like this.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,900
My dear little sister,

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,660
taking advantage
of the privileges you gave her,

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,380
constantly oppressed me,

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,340
used me,

41
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,420
and humiliated me.

42
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,220
But you see none of it!

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,780
So…

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
You just killed your own sister?

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,340
Yes! I killed her.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,140
She brought this upon herself
by making my life miserable.

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,900
You...

48
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,580
She's your own flesh and blood!

49
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,380
My own flesh and blood?

50
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,060
So what if she is?

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,780
When she tried
to harm Jingheng back then,

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,500
did she remember
that she was Jingheng's aunt?

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,380
Besides,

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,740
haven't you always turned a blind eye

55
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,700
to all the filthy dealings
of our Pei family?

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,940
Now that I've killed her,

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,820
you should keep pretending
you know nothing.

58
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,700
You...

59
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,580
You!

60
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,140
Fortunately,
everything went rather smoothly.

61
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,660
Mother,

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,260
you are old now.

63
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,980
It is time to hand all of this over.

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,540
I will take care of the Pei family
in your place.

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,740
If I refuse,

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,540
would you kill me, too?

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,460
You…

68
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,340
You monster.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,700
If you insist on handing
the Pei family over to an outsider,

70
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,660
then for the sake of its future,
I will have no choice

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,540
but to ask you to bear this grievance

72
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,860
and be reunited
with my dear little sister

73
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,460
ahead of time.

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,660
You...

75
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,780
Oh, my dear mother.

76
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,220
I'm puzzled.

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,500
Why are you so upset?

78
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,780
It was because of you

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,300
that I fought with Pei Xiuning
to this extent.

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,340
By that reasoning,

81
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,820
you are the one

82
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,900
who truly killed her.

83
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:39,900
You...

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,860
It was you.

85
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,180
You...

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,740
You...

87
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,740
You...

88
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,540
You monster.

89
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,580
Monster.

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,580
Madam was already advanced in years,

91
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
her health failing.

92
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,740
Before her passing,

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,580
she entrusted the entire Pei family
to my care.

94
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,180
How could this be?

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,540
Eldest Master, what exactly happened?

96
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,900
Why did Madam suddenly pass away?

97
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,700
Prior to this,

98
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,220
Mother had a private meeting
with Song Zhiyao.

99
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,300
Unexpectedly, the woman
was unruly and insolent,

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,500
speaking with blatant disrespect
to my mother.

101
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,540
The head of our family

102
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,780
was provoked to death by that wretch.

103
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,540
Such a grudge can never be reconciled.

104
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,060
She must not go unpunished!

105
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,180
Take her to the authorities.

106
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,740
Yes, send her to the authorities.

107
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,820
As you know,

108
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,420
my mother valued
the Pei family's reputation above all.

109
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,060
Family scandals
should never be made public.

110
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,380
I have already locked Song Zhiyao away.

111
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,260
On the day of my mother's funeral,

112
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,820
that wretched woman
will accompany her to the grave.

113
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,860
Why must you kill me?

114
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,940
It was you. You were the one
who killed Pei Xiuning.

115
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,900
Yes.

116
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,980
All of you women deserve to die!

117
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,660
Zhiyao.

118
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,620
Go and check on Madam. Eldest Master...

119
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,900
Grandmother...

120
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,980
I'll get you out of here first.

121
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,780
Come.

122
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,580
Father,

123
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,100
you've always wanted Zhiyao dead.

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,300
What exactly are you hiding?

125
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,420
Why would I want her dead?

126
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,820
I don't know what that wretched woman
has been telling you.

127
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,340
But do you know this?

128
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,100
Your grandmother
had already entrusted everything

129
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,020
of the Pei family to her care.

130
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,940
Yet she was still not satisfied.

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,900
She wanted more.

132
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,820
When your grandmother refused,

133
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,540
she provoked her so badly
that she was angered to death.

134
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,780
I didn't.

135
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,820
Who ordered Feng Lusheng to kill Zhiyao?

136
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,020
And who was it that hid
the fragrance manual on my aunt?

137
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,860
Father, do you truly not know?

138
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,420
I don't.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,260
I'll just ask you this.

140
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,940
Were Grandmother and Aunt killed by you?

141
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,660
No!

142
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,900
But those two vicious women,

143
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,740
so lofty and self‑righteous,

144
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,420
they oppressed and humiliated
Jinglan, you, and me for so many years.

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,900
They deserved to die!

146
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,460
As for who the real killer was,

147
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,260
does it even matter?

148
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,220
Of course, it does.

149
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,660
They got what they deserved!

150
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,020
Then what about those innocent people?

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,260
When the Song family
was massacred ten years ago,

152
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,060
what crime did they commit?

153
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,660
Someone!

154
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,700
Zhiyao.

155
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,700
I'll get her out of here today,
no matter what.

156
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,660
Jingheng, I know you are highly skilled
in martial arts.

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,220
The people here cannot stop you.

158
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,060
But her death is inevitable.

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,260
If she dies,

160
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,180
I'll make sure everything you've pursued
your entire life comes to nothing.
