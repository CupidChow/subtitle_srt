1
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,980
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,870
[Episode 2]

3
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

4
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,420
You may rise.

5
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
I thought I misheard.

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
It truly is you.

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,640
A seat.

8
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Your Highness, please drink.

9
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,680
Blades crossed and blood spilled as we fought side by side;

10
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,320
I upheld my honor with no thought of fame or glory.

11
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,520
I offer this wine,

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,800
to honor the fallen

13
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Dingbei Army soldiers in Dongzhou.

14
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,950
Today is the Lantern Festival.

15
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,240
My dear ministers, please don't stand on ceremony.

16
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,300
[Shu Jingran, son of the Right Chancellor of Xian]

17
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,640
Now that the Prince of Dingbei returns in triumph,

18
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,280
it perfectly fulfills what I just wished for.

19
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,120
A double blessing indeed.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,180
Rong...

21
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
I've long heard of Prince of Dingbei

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
being brave and skilled in battle.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,090
He has rendered great service to Xian.

24
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
I, Liang Rong'er,

25
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,520
wish to offer a piece titled "Waters and Clouds of Xiaoxiang"

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,870
in honor of His Highness.

27
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,770
[Miss Liang Rong'er of Duke of Ling's Mansion]

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,530
I'm unworthy, please pardon the clumsiness.

29
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,329
If you know you're unworthy, then don't perform.

30
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
If it were me,

31
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,079
I'd find a hole to crawl into,

32
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,120
and never show my face again.

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Why aren't you back to your seat?

34
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,600
Prince of Dingbei speaks rightly.

35
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,320
My daughter overestimated herself,

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
and offended Your Highness.

37
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
Once I return,

38
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,600
I shall strictly discipline her.

39
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,930
Duke of Ling's Mansion needs discipline,

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
and not just this one person.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,630
Tan,

42
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,320
is the Prince of Dingbei

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,280
the worm inside your belly or what?

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
I wish he were.

45
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,130
Your Majesties,

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,810
the Prince of Dingbei grew up in the palace,

47
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,400
a reading companion to Your Majesty.

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,460
What heavenly music has he not heard?

49
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Liang Rong'er's zither skills

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
are truly unrefined.

51
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,200
However,

52
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
a top zither player from the capital

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,210
is also here today.

54
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Your Highness might as well listen.

55
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Ming Tan of Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,640
was taught by a famed master, with superb skills,

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
Known throughout the capital

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
as the best in zither playing.

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Why not have her play a tune

60
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
for Your Highness,

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
so we might share in the delight

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,390
and feast our ears.

63
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Fengzhao's suggestion is quite good.

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,280
Then let Miss Ming

65
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,840
play us a tune,

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,160
to celebrate the Lantern Festival,

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,020
and the victorious return of the Prince of Dingbei.

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
I thank Your Majesty for your favor.

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,920
But as I entered the palace today,

70
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
I brought no zither,

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,570
nor did I compose a celebratory piece.

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
To play without preparation

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
may disturb the sacred presence

74
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
and sully the Prince's ears.

75
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,680
In a palace this vast,

76
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,700
surely a good zither can be found.

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,340
If you find it lacking,

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll have someone fetch

79
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,840
the Empress Dowager's Jiaowei zither.

80
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,830
I did not return to the capital

81
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,520
to hear

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,050
these indulgent melodies.

83
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Your Majesty,

84
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,440
on this return to the capital,

85
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,720
I brought someone along.

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,580
I wish for Your Majesty to see him.

87
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,350
Summon.

88
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,120
Summon.

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,159
Minmin.

90
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,900
What's wrong?

91
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,920
It's a corpse!

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,010
This...

93
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
This Prince of Dingbei is even more

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,520
arrogant than the rumors say.

95
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
More than that,

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,720
I heard he is violent,

97
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,120
cold-blooded and ruthless.

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,280
If any family's daughter

99
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,140
were to marry into his household,

100
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,560
the rest of the capital's

101
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,870
ladies should

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
thank her.

103
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,190
[Imperial Censor of Xian, Chang Yunfu]

104
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,780
Prince of Dingbei, you...

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
What is the meaning of this?

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,680
Since Your Majesty and the ministers have matters to discuss,

107
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,300
I shall take the ladies and excuse myself.

108
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
The Prince of Dingbei

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,640
brings a corpse to court at the slightest disagreement.

110
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,280
Truly no sense of decorum.

111
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,200
They say he is a God of War.

112
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,390
I think he's more like the King of Hell.

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,320
Liang Rong'er was just unlucky today,

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
desperately trying to get attention,

115
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,680
only to end up humiliated.

116
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,320
Rong'er, don't cry.

117
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,950
The Prince of Dingbei was just stirring trouble

118
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,810
and used the moment to make a move.

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Your Grace, may I ask

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
why the Prince of Dingbei

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,600
targets the Liang family?

122
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,940
Did something happen to your household?

123
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,660
Nothing happened.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
They say the Prince of Dingbei

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,880
always had a strange temper.

126
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
My Rong'er

127
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,240
simply ran into him

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,050
at the wrong moment.

129
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,640
A strange temper?

130
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,080
But he didn't trouble others.

131
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,320
Exactly.

132
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
Just now Miss Ming refused to play,

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,960
the Prince of Dingbei said nothing.

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Why did he

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
specifically go after Liang Rong'er?

136
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,600
I say he's targeting

137
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,240
Duke of Ling's Mansion.

138
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,840
Could it be the Duke

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,360
did something

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,720
against the Dingbei Army?

141
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
If that's the case, then why

142
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,360
didn't the Prince of Dingbei hold us accountable just now?

143
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,920
Let's go.

144
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,080
Let's go.

145
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,160
Ming Tan, don't believe

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,320
these idle rumors.

147
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,120
The Prince of Dingbei returned to the capital

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,520
for his own reasons.

149
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
Matters of court

150
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,560
are not for us

151
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,240
to speculate on.

152
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
Rest assured, Your Grace.

153
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,050
If the Duke of Ling's Mansion is clean,

154
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,340
you can sleep peacefully.

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Exactly.

156
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,270
But Your Grace's eagerness to explain

157
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,080
makes it seem

158
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,540
like protesting too much.

159
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
Mother...

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
This...

161
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,880
Your Majesty,

162
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,440
the battle in Dongzhou was fraught with peril.

163
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
If not for the Dingbei Army's

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,520
sacrifice,

165
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,120
the Beihe army would have marched into Xian.

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,650
with their swords pointed at Ganzhou.

167
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,280
In this battle, some court officials

168
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,920
secretly colluded with northern bandits,

169
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,520
and plotted to rob the final batch

170
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,920
of military supplies for the Dingbei Army.

171
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,680
I returned to investigate this matter.

172
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
On the way, I encountered

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,920
repeated obstruction from the county constable of the capital region.

174
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,200
Even so,

175
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
this should have been investigated by the Supreme Court.

176
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,520
Why did you

177
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
privately take his life?

178
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
When I went to seize that Sheriff Wu,

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,180
he had already been silenced.

180
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
You should ask,

181
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,120
why the real culprit

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,370
took bribes and perverted the law,

183
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
why he murdered to cover his crimes,

184
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
why, for selfish gain,

185
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,640
he placed the safety of hundreds of thousands

186
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,500
of Dingbei Army soldiers at risk.

187
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,320
Duke of Ling.

188
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,200
H-h-here!

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
I'm present.

190
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
Do you know why?

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,520
Y-Your Highness,

192
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,610
you must be joking.

193
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,120
I have never

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
met that Sheriff Wu,

195
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
nor have I ever participated

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,360
in any military supply escort duties.

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
How could I possibly

198
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
know anything about this matter?

199
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,590
[Marquis of Cheng'en, Gu Jinzhong]

200
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,160
Marquis of Cheng'en.

201
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,560
Your Majesty, such a treacherous traitor

202
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,520
has emerged under the jurisdiction

203
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
of the Capital Prefecture.

204
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,360
I, along with the county magistrates of capital region,

205
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,840
cannot shirk responsibility.

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,330
I will thoroughly investigate this matter

207
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,920
and cleanse the prefecture office,

208
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,150
ensuring that no criminal exploits the system again.

209
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,430
Indeed, Your Majesty.

210
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,680
The Prince of Dingbei

211
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,400
implied that the murderer

212
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,720
of Sheriff Wu is also the one

213
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,560
who blocked your entry into the capital

214
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,960
and the mastermind behind the looting of military supplies.

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,980
With Your Majesty's discernment,

216
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,560
I was ambushed by Haiyou Sect assassins

217
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
on my way back to the capital.

218
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,830
How could a mere sheriff

219
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,880
of the capital region have the audacity

220
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,480
to collude with Haiyou Sect?

221
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,520
Besides, the delays and deficits in Dingbei Army's military pay

222
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,240
have gone on for years,

223
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,580
it's not the doing of a single man.

224
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,520
I wished to uncover the truth,

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,050
so I returned to the capital

226
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,620
without imperial orders.

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
I have long been stationed on the frontier,

228
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
and have grown accustomed to bluntness.

229
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,170
Forgive me for disrupting your pleasure.

230
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,080
You all are

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,880
virtuous officials serving the nation and its people.

232
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,520
I trust you will understand.

233
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,570
Once I have resolved this case,

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,180
the mastermind must apologize to you all,

235
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,110
and I shall offer his head

236
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
to appease the fallen souls of the Dingbei Army

237
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,220
who died in Dongzhou.

238
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,650
[Rende Gate]

239
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,560
Xu.

240
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,680
Quick.

241
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
When did you return?

242
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,520
Why didn't you inform any of us?

243
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
Yes, even if it's a surprise return,

244
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,520
you didn't

245
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,980
have to keep it from us too.

246
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
By the way, Xu,

247
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,280
what are your plans now that you're back in the capital?

248
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
How long will you stay?

249
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,920
The Dingbei Army is leaderless,

250
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,400
he likely can't stay long.

251
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,640
But the looting of military supplies,

252
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,240
what really happened there?

253
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Military payroll and supply transport

254
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
involve complex entanglements.

255
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
Xu, you returned

256
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
to the capital without an edict,

257
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,840
Trying to get to the bottom of this

258
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,680
may not be a task completed overnight.

259
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Lu.

260
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,320
You've just been promoted

261
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,920
to Deputy Commander of the Palace Guards, haven't you?

262
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
You're stationed up north,

263
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
yet your intel is quite up-to-date.

264
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,280
Are you on duty tonight?

265
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,440
On duty for what?

266
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
You only come back once in many years.

267
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,680
Tonight the four of us

268
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,840
must drink

269
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,300
heartily together!

270
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,320
Well said!

271
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll fetch Yu at once

272
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,180
to prepare fine wine and food.

273
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
A gathering is a must,

274
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,160
But while you're at it,

275
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,480
lend me a few men.

276
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,610
You're going to move against Duke of Ling?

277
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
Why so panicked?

278
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
Anyone with eyes

279
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,800
can see something's off.

280
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,600
I...

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
To catch the thief, one must find the loot.

282
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,520
As long as Jiang Xu doesn't have the silver,

283
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,200
you'll be safe.

284
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,920
Even if Wu You

285
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
hinted something before his death,

286
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,140
it won't change anything.

287
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,470
But the stolen silver

288
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,250
has already ended up

289
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,080
in Prince of Dingbei's hands.

290
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,500
What did you say?

291
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,080
I only discovered it

292
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,120
was gone from the manor yesterday.

293
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,150
Such a serious matter,

294
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
why didn't you say so sooner?

295
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,920
I warned you

296
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,240
not to dabble in embezzlement again.

297
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,400
But your greed was insatiable.

298
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,610
Now you face the consequences.

299
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,180
Chancellor, you must

300
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,860
show my Liang family a way out.

301
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,500
Jiang Xu won't rest

302
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,600
until he gets what he wants.

303
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,640
Whatever Sheriff Wu may

304
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,560
have uncovered

305
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
could only implicate you and the Marquis of Cheng'en.

306
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,550
At most, I can only protect one of you.

307
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
Duke of Ling is just the beginning.

308
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,690
[Zhenxiang Gate]

309
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,520
It's merely killing the chicken to scare the monkeys.

310
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
No need to use a butcher's knife on a chicken.

311
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
Now that you've returned to the capital,

312
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,120
those old foxes will certainly

313
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
keep a close eye on you.

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
It's inconvenient to employ too many men.

315
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Whatever you need,

316
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
just say the word.

317
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,720
Chancellor,

318
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,640
I have always been loyal to you.

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,200
You must not

320
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,720
abandon the Liang family.

321
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,400
I...

322
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
If I meant to abandon you,

323
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
why would I leave you with

324
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,300
the Marquis of Jing'an, your talisman of survival?

325
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,920
Even if Prince of Dingbei acts,

326
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,960
he would first need to assess the Ming family's position.

327
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
Were it not for your Liang family's

328
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,400
marital ties with the Ming family,

329
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,500
even I couldn't

330
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,200
protect you today.

331
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,720
Much thanks to you, Chancellor,

332
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,080
for planning ahead

333
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,520
on our behalf.

334
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,680
Your son's marriage to Ming Tan

335
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,200
must not fall through.

336
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Otherwise, you'd best pray for your own survival.

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,040
Understood.

338
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,090
I'll ensure this union is secured.

339
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,540
Lady Su...

340
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,640
My Lord.

341
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,280
Have the betrothal gifts all been prepared?

342
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
This time,

343
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,000
there must be no mishaps.

344
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Rest assured.

345
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,080
We spared

346
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
no expense this time.

347
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,920
Lady Su already

348
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,520
reviewed the gift list that day.

349
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
There are no mistakes.

350
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,890
That's good to hear.

351
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,520
No matter what,

352
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,850
Ming Tan must marry into our Liang family.

353
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,790
My Lord.

354
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,330
At today's palace banquet,

355
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,170
Prince of Dingbei deliberately targeted us.

356
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,800
Everyone could see it.

357
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,440
Ming Tan will surely grow suspicious.

358
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
If she digs further

359
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,300
and uncovers the truth about Zhu'er…

360
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,840
Zhu'er remaining in our Mansion

361
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,579
is a constant risk.

362
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,010
We must think of a way

363
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,040
to eliminate this hidden danger.

364
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,750
My Lord, strangely enough,

365
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,560
Prince of Dingbei took all

366
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,040
the silver from our secret chamber,

367
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,640
yet said nothing

368
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,040
in front of the emperor.

369
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,670
He is wary

370
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,550
because of our marital ties with the Ming family.

371
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,120
He's merely holding back for now.

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
If Zixuan and Ming Tan's

373
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
marriage is confirmed,

374
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,760
we'll have the Ming

375
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,840
family's backing,

376
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,230
and Prince of Dingbei will hesitate

377
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,040
to act rashly.

378
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,430
Precisely.

379
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,520
To avoid unforeseen changes,

380
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,800
Ming Tan must marry in as soon as possible.

381
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,790
[Melodies and Fluttering Grace]

382
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,020
[Heir of Duke of Ping's Mansion, Zhang Huaiyu]

383
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,000
Never expected the Liang family to stoop so low.

384
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
They'll eventually realize

385
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,440
I did it on purpose,

386
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
deliberately making things difficult.

387
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,080
So what?

388
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
I can't stand

389
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
Mrs. Li's hypocritical face.

390
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,080
Pretending nothing's wrong on the surface

391
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
while hiding Zhu'er to mislead others.

392
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,400
The Liang family can truly act.

393
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Every one of them is a born performer.

394
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,480
Fortunately, I saw through them early

395
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,360
and pulled back just in time.

396
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,240
Tan, what exactly did you discover

397
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,840
at the Liang's Mansion that day?

398
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,720
What did you find?

399
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,440
Huan...

400
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,200
What's wrong?

401
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,840
Sit.

402
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
What's wrong?

403
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,920
The Liang family is suspected of

404
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,740
embezzling government silver.

405
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,360
Embezzling government silver?

406
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,640
Keep your voice down!

407
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,840
Quiet down!

408
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,840
They actually dared to hide government silver?

409
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,440
I saw it with my own eyes, how could it be false?

410
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,960
But the silver

411
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,280
has since vanished.

412
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,210
Whether it's Zhu'er or the silver,

413
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,040
I haven't found solid proof.

414
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,240
But I'm certain

415
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,040
the reason the Liang family is in such a rush to deliver the betrothal gifts

416
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,440
is to drag the Ming family into this,

417
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,040
using my father's status

418
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,240
to escape blame.

419
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
That sly old fox, Duke of Ling,

420
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,640
he's truly devious.

421
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,600
This marriage must be

422
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,060
called off, immediately.

423
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,480
Being anxious won't help.

424
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,690
Canceling an engagement

425
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,890
must be done with caution and planning.

426
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,600
Sit.

427
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,390
As long as Zhu'er is still in the capital,

428
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,920
there's still hope.

429
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
At the palace banquet,

430
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,200
Prince of Dingbei publicly challenged the Liang family.

431
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,660
Did he uncover something?

432
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,000
If we can ride this wave

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,260
and use Prince of Dingbei's momentum...

434
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,710
It's not impossible.

435
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
But Prince of Dingbei is unpredictable.

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,120
He respects no one and is hard to read.

437
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,680
Asking him for help

438
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,850
would be like reaching for the stars.

439
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
True.

440
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,400
Calling off the engagement is hard enough.

441
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
Doing so without harming my reputation

442
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,790
is even harder.

443
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,760
Once the engagement is finally broken,

444
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,120
how should I act

445
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
to show my honor and resolve?

446
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,360
I remember when the fifth daughter of the Li family's

447
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,680
engagement was broken,

448
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,240
she went to her fiancé's house and cut her hair in protest.

449
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
The third daughter of the Fang family

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,680
hanged herself with a white silk ribbon.

451
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
No need to go that far.

452
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,500
This young lady...

453
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,640
Which family is she from?

454
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,750
So interesting.

455
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,000
They should be from the Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion

456
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,680
and the Duke of Chang's Mansion.

457
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,360
Marriages between noble families

458
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,480
have always been about benefits first.

459
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,080
This young lady seems to understand that well.

460
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,120
Xu,

461
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,960
is Duke of Ling truly

462
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,960
the main culprit behind the embezzlement?

463
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,840
He is indeed guilty of embezzlement,

464
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
but he's not the mastermind.

465
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
Xu targeted him

466
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
to set an example.

467
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,960
You just didn't expect

468
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,850
the Ming family would be caught in the crossfire, did you?

469
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,040
So the reason you haven't acted against Duke of Ling

470
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,240
is because of the Liang-Ming marriage?

471
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,440
And what of it?

472
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
It's just an engagement contract.

473
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,520
Even if they do get married,

474
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,640
there are still ways to sever ties.

475
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,920
You think a marriage

476
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,380
can be undone that easily?

477
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
It's far more complicated than that.

478
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,080
Never mind anything else.

479
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,320
Even just the girl's reputation

480
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
will be damaged for sure.

481
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,320
How will she ever

482
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,960
find a proper match again?

483
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,060
It's not that hard.

484
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Right now, there are three

485
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
eligible bachelors ready for the choosing.

486
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,460
Just depends on which one of you approve.

487
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Xu, since when

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,630
did you start joking like this?

489
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,960
Indeed, quite the bold joke.

490
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,560
This world really is unjust.

491
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
It's always the man's fault,

492
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,120
Yet it's the woman

493
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
who suffers the shame.

494
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,200
Exactly.

495
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Tan, even if you manage

496
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,040
to break off the Liang engagement today,

497
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,840
your godfather will still arrange

498
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,160
another marriage for you,

499
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,940
either to this powerful family

500
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
or that noble house.

501
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,840
You can't escape it.

502
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,280
And who's to say

503
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,760
that your next match won't be

504
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,000
worse than Liang Zixuan?

505
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't worry.

506
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,900
After all this,

507
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
I won't let anyone

508
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
control my marriage again.

509
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Rather than a blind or forced marriage,

510
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll choose my own husband.

511
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,560
That's a fine idea.

512
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,080
Come to think of it,

513
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,400
there are still a few men

514
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
in the capital

515
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,520
worthy of you.

516
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,840
Take the Right Chancellor's second son.

517
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,160
Graceful, talented,

518
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,720
of noble character and great promise.

519
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,280
I heard, given his talent and looks,

520
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,080
he's likely to be

521
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,360
the top scorer in this year's exams.

522
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,560
But he's far above me.

523
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
When it comes to choosing a husband,

524
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,320
I have my own criteria.

525
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,240
Let me help you think it through.

526
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Family background and appearance go without saying.

527
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
But he must also have ambition and a solid career.

528
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
No idlers,

529
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,200
no drifters.

530
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,640
That's the bare minimum.

531
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,200
He must be upright in character,

532
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,400
loyal in love,

533
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,160
principled and dependable.

534
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,840
Never the type to curry

535
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
favor or abandon morals.

536
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,570
Absolutely essential.

537
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
He must also be unafraid of power,

538
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,220
righteous and outspoken.

539
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,640
If hardship ever befalls me or the Ming family,

540
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,320
he must stand by our side,

541
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
face it with us.

542
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,480
If that's the standard, then in the entire capital,

543
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,500
no, in all of Xian,

544
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,680
only one man fits.

545
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,440
Who?

546
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,920
Prince

547
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,850
of

548
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,560
Dingbei.

549
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,280
Him?

550
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,120
That's impossible.

551
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,560
Right,

552
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
highly unlikely.

553
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,200
But think about it.

554
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,530
He's a decorated general.

555
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,640
He has both a bright future

556
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,840
and strong ideals.

557
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,960
His actions at the palace banquet

558
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,280
show he fears no power

559
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,160
and speaks his mind.

560
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,280
As for his background and appearance,

561
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,240
there's nothing lacking.

562
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,760
He checks all your boxes.

563
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
His background and appearance?

564
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,240
How can you be so sure?

565
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,960
He knew he was going to court,

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,650
yet didn't even change his shoes,

567
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,090
walked into the hall

568
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,230
caked in mud.

569
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,440
That Prince of Dingbei is either reckless and rude,

570
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
or dead broke.

571
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,010
And the way he conducts himself...

572
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,100
Far too wild and aggressive.

573
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,320
You can't expect

574
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,480
everyone to be like you,

575
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,040
polished and flawless in every detail.

576
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,570
But his character is truly questionable.

577
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,640
If he really had a grudge against Duke of Ling,

578
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,520
why drag innocent women into it,

579
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,090
publicly humiliating Liang Rong'er?

580
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,000
Wasn't that satisfying?

581
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,720
You looked

582
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,180
rather pleased yourself.

583
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,760
Of course

584
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,060
it was immensely satisfying.

585
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,040
Exactly!

586
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,040
Prince of Dingbei came

587
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
and avenged you at once.

588
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,660
So maybe, the legitimate daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an

589
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,290
and our kingdom's war god, Prince of Dingbei,

590
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,610
aren't so incompatible after all.

591
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,240
But that only proves

592
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,840
he's arrogant and reckless,

593
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
blantly disrespectful.

594
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,040
I'd never want to be like Liang Rong'er,

595
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,440
publicly mocked by him.

596
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Losing face is one thing.

597
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,400
But if I ever

598
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,920
angered him,

599
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
I might lose my life,

600
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,600
maybe even die with regrets,

601
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,460
my soul unable to rest.

602
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,560
It's not as scary as you say.

603
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,710
Anyway,

604
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,280
he is certainly not a suitable match for me.

605
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,000
That's too harsh.

606
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,320
How is it that our Xu

607
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,640
is suddenly crude and arrogant,

608
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,370
and unworthy to be her husband?

609
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,440
We can't just let that slide.

610
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,360
I...

611
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,160
I... She...

612
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,960
Not being her match

613
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,140
is actually a blessing for me.

614
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,920
If I were to marry such a woman,

615
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,840
I'd truly be blind.

616
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,480
Looks like the flower parade is starting.

617
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,810
Let's go take a look.

618
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's go.

619
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll go check it out.

620
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,600
Go.

621
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,080
Your Grace,

622
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,120
the young lady from the Ming family

623
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,440
went to South Yuhe Street

624
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,400
together with the lady from the Duke of Chang's Mansion.

625
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,520
I've asked

626
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,800
the Ming household servants.

627
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,960
They said the two young ladies

628
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,080
had arranged early in the day

629
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,480
to go watch the lanterns.

630
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
Go watch the lanterns?

631
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,880
She still has the leisure for lantern viewing?

632
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
You may go.

633
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,690
Yes, Your Grace.

634
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,850
If the Ming family

635
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,200
has no room left to maneuver,

636
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,290
then this marriage

637
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,400
will be a done deal.

638
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,030
Tan, look.

So beautiful.

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,090
Where is the young lady?

[Ruyi Flower Shop]

644
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,160
Xu, if you want to arrest someone,

645
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,600
why not use the Jinyun Guards?

646
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I happen to be returning them to you.

647
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,920
I've managed them for years now,

648
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,120
and frankly, I can't afford it anymore.

649
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,960
Just looking at me won't change anything.

650
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,720
All these years,

651
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,120
you've brought home so many orphans,

652
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,400
and dumped them all on me.

653
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,240
Bieyu Mansion is practically

654
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
a secret base for Jinyun Guards now.

655
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,120
Leaving them with me is fine,

656
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,800
but you can't expect me

657
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,060
to pay for everything.

658

I seem to recall

662
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,680
you were more than willing to take this on at first.

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,360
All these years,

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,970

I won't let you go!

Do you want her to die?

Make way!

Move aside! Move aside!

into the water to search.

729
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,040
Also, get two guards

to hold back Liang Zixuan.

731
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,200
He must not approach Tan.

732
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,110
And send more people

733
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,350
to keep the crowd back.

734
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,280
No one must find out

I heard you brought a girl home.

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
Truly the sun has risen in the west.

755
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,440
If only you cared half as much about

756
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,370
your studies as you do about drama,

757
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,570
the Duke of Ping

758
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,410
wouldn't be sighing every day.

759
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,960
What use is fame and rank to me?

760
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,400
Even if I ranked first in the exams,

761
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,260
I wouldn't earn as much as I do now.

762
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,140
Sir, the girl caught a chill in the water.

763
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,040
I'll go make her some ginger tea.

764
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,960
She fell in?

765
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,010
Don't tell me it was the Ming family's young lady.

766
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
I heard someone fell in

767
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,200
by the docks.

768
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,440
I rushed over to see the commotion.

769
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,080
Found out

770
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
it was the Duke of Chang's daughter.

771
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,240
She was in a hurry to save her.

772
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,840
Thought maybe

773
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,680
it was the Ming family's daughter who fell in.

774
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,280
Oh, and Liang Zixuan was there too.

775
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,480
He didn't listen to anyone,

776
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,940
just jumped in to save her.

777
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,480
Seeing how determined he was,

778
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,960
those who knew said it was urgent.

779
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,560
But to outsiders,

780
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,080
it may seem premeditated.

781
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,000
A woman soaked

782
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,880
and carried out by a man in front of a crowd,

783
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
what's left of her reputation?

784
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,620
You think Liang Zixuan

785
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,280
did this on purpose?

786
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,850
The Ming and Liang families have long had a betrothal.

787
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,730
This move

788
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,679
forces the Ming family's hand.

789
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,679
The Liang family's intentions are crystal clear.

790
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,520
But they'll never

791
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
get this marriage.

792
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,679
Send this hairpin to the Ming household.

793
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,679
Say their young lady

794
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,000
has already returned home.

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,360
Have someone go to the docks

796
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,690
and smooth things over.

797
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,420
Miss Minmin!

798
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,989
Miss Minmin!

799
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,570
Miss Minmin!

800
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,929
Lyu'e?

801
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,760
Miss Minmin.

802
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,260
Miss Minmin.

803
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,880
Why are you still here?

804
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,000
My lady made glutinous rice balls herself

805
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,659
and is waiting for you at the mansion to try them.

806
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
What did she say?

807
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,160
My Lady has grown weary from waiting at home.

808
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,060
We'd best hurry back.

809
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,680
It was the heir of Duke of Ling's Mansion

810
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,010
who fell into the water.

811
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,480
Young Master, slow down.

812
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,830
Young Master.

813
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,350
Yes,

814
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,080
Young Master Liang fell into the water.

815
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,680
I happened to pass by

816
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
and saw it myself.

817
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,610
I'm sending people to save him now.

818
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,670
Silence.

819
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:49,270
[Bieyu Mansion]

820
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,780
This is the place.

821
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,500
Let's go.

822
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,900
Mr. Wang,

823
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,580
Miss Ming, you've woken up.

824
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,830
You...

825
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,330
Who are you?

826
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,970
No need to worry, Miss Ming.

827
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,630
I am Zhang Huaiyu.

828
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,680
You saved me?

829
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,320
I'm not that capable.

830
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,480
Here.

831
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,400
He's the one who saved you.

832
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,390
You again?

833
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,120
Again?

834
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,540
You two know each other?

835
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,740
-We do not.
-We do not.

836
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
Miss Ming,

837
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
you were in danger of drowning just now.

838
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,640
Had it not been for

839
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,540
Xu's quick rescue,

840
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
you might

841
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,900
not have kept your reputation.

842
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Then I thank you.

843
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,580
Miss Ming.

844
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,800
Why are you in such a rush to leave?

845
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,000
Won't you stay and rest a little longer?

846
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Whatever your reason

847
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
for saving me today,

848
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,680
let's all agree

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
to act as if this never happened.

850
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
There's no need to mention it again.

851
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,880
I have not spoken

852
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,060
of yesterday's events to anyone.

853
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,500
I hope you will also

854
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,480
avoid harming innocents

855
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,440
and dragging me into your affairs.

856
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,800
We are even now,

857
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,040
and need not meet again.

858
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,880
Next time you fall into water,

859
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,610
try to choose a deserted place.

860
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,440
That way,

861
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,280
you won't run into anyone at all.

862
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,480
What happened

863
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
between you two yesterday?

864
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,880
This gentleman

865
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,210
looks rather familiar.

866
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,740
Just a friendly reminder,

867
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,200
don't associate

868
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,330
with shady people.

869
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,080
Better to cut ties early

870
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,210
than to suffer for it later.

871
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,070
Where is this place?

872
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,440
Miss Ming,

873
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,360
I forgot to introduce it.

874
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,040
This is the most

875
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,080
elegant and

876
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,760
bustling place

877
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,680
in all of the capital,

878
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,750
Bieyu Mansion.

879
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,080
Should you have free time in the future,

880
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,920
you are most welcome to visit.

881
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,880
Shuiying.

882
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,130
[Shuiying from the Bieyu Mansion]

883
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,440
This is Miss Shuiying,

884
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
one of Bieyu Mansion's own.

885
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,800
She was the one who took care of you earlier.

886
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,440
Thank you.

887
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,200
Miss Ming,

888
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
you fainted earlier from exhaustion.

889
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,600
Just rest now.

890
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,600
If you need anything,

891
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,280
tell Miss Shuiying.

892
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,420
Miss Ming,

893
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,570
please drink the ginger tea first.

894
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,570
Sir, there's movement at the Liang family.

895
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
The Liang family?

896
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,440
Good, good, good.

897
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,330
How could Tan be in such a place?

898
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,860
You must have heard wrong.

899
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,080
That person brought her Zhaoshui hairpin

900
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,000
and told me the story.

901
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,760
I didn't believe it at first,

902
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,000
but once I went to South Yuhe Street,

903
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
I realized it

904
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,680
was true.

905
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,080
Let's find Tan first.

906
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Yes, My Lady.

907
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,920
Young lady,

908
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,880
is there anything I can help you with?

909
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,280
No need. I'm looking for someone.

910
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,760
Well...

911
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,200
Young lady. Who are you looking for?

912
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
I can help.

913
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,960
No need.

914
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,840
Young lady, I...

915
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,720
You what?

916
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,080
I said no need!

917
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,800
Also,

918
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,080
why are you waving that fan around in the freezing cold?

919
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,760
Pretentious.

920
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,480
Young lady.

921
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,200
Move.

922
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Stop right there.

923
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,320
You...

924
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Wh-what are you doing?

925
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Are you going to use that fan like an axe

926
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,160
and chop me up?

927
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,280
Aren't you looking for someone?

928
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,310
I know.

929
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,320
If you want to find her,

930
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,880
apologize to me first.

931
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Apologize?

932
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,480
No apology,

933
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
but a fist ready.

934
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
Lead the way.

935
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,480
I...

936
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
Tan!

937
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,240
Tan!

938
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,000
Where is she?

939
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,600
Strange, she was just here...

940
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,140
She...

941
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
She...

942
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,280
Where...

943
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,210
Where did she go?

944
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Sir, according to Zhang Ji's confession,

945
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,760
the Duke of Ling's corruption

946
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,560
is closely tied to Zhu'er's father.

947
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,450
[Jinyun Guard, Zhuiying]

948
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,240
But the Duchess of Ling

949
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
has already sent Zhu'er

950
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,280
out of the capital overnight.

951
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,480
She's heading south.

952
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,960
Hold on.

953
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,680
Why are you investigating Zhu'er?

954
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,200
Why dig into the Duke of Ling's Mansion's affairs?

955
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
Who are you,

956
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,100
and what are your intentions?

957
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,880
If you want to live, don't meddle.

958
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,190
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

959
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,620
Don't get involved where you shouldn't.

960
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,960
If I really stayed out

961
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,240
of the Liang family's business,

962
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,600
I wouldn't live long.

963
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,680
My fiancé, Liang Zixuan,

964
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,660
has been having a secret affair with Zhu'er,

965
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,080
and she's pregnant.

966
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,640
Once she leaves the capital,

967
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,120
there will be no proof,

968
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,800
and I won't be able to break off the engagement.

969
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,170
I... I can see

970
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,760
you don't seem like a

971
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,120
cold-blooded villain.

972
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,640
Otherwise, you wouldn't have saved me earlier.

973
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,880
I don't care why you're

974
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,160
investigating the Duke of Ling,

975
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,090
but the enemy of my enemy is my ally.

976
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,360
We're more or less

977
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,600
in the same boat.

978
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,040
You wouldn't really

979
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,380
stand by and let an innocent like me

980
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,800
suffer lifelong misery

981
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
because of the Liang family, would you?

982
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,410
You care about reputation,

983
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,970
but I've only one horse.

984
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,840
It's improper for men and women to travel together.

985
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,280
Can't take you with me.

986
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,480
What did you say?

987
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,600
I told you to seal the engagement,

988
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,550
not to get any improper ideas.

989
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,680
Everything was going as planned,

990
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,360
and we could've moved the wedding date forward.

991
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,870
I never expected

992
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,410
Ming Tan can swim.

993
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,200
You still dare make excuses?

994
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,080
Luckily, Tan is safe.

995
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,640
If anything had happened to her,

996
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,080
your whole Liang family would've followed her to the grave.

997
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,360
Please, Chancellor, don't be angry.

998
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,960
I acted rashly, misunderstood the situation,

999
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,880
and let my wife's temper

1000
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,720
cause this mess.

1001
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,740
The betrothal will be renewed in just a few days.

1002
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,440
Why stir up more trouble now,

1003
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,370
using Tan's reputation as a wager?

1004
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,810
What exactly are you so anxious about?

1005
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,000
It's...

1006
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,900
It's Zixuan...

1007
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
He got my wife's niece

1008
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,080
pregnant.

1009
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,320
Chancellor, I truly

1010
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,480
had no idea about this before.

1011
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,080
But I've already sent her away.

1012
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,880
Just when everything is about to fall into place,

1013
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,200
you keep stirring up trouble.

1014
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
Do you find the position of Deputy Envoy to the Privy Council

1015
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,120
not prestigious enough?

1016
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,000
Or do you think

1017
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,480
Tan is too good for your Liang family,

1018
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,080
and must marry

1019
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,680
that useless son of yours?

1020
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,160
Please, Chancellor, don't be angry.

1021
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,800
My wife has already promised Zhu'er

1022
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,010
to a steward

1023
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,920
on a country estate in Lizhou.

1024
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,000
She won't show her face in the capital again.

1025
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,680
And how can you guarantee

1026
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,400
she won't resurface someday

1027
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,240
and cause trouble?

1028
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,920
I...

1029
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,480
I...

1030
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,280
Make her disappear.
