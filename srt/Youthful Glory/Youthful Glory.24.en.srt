[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,370
Just a guess.

4
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,800
I wonder how many

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,660
more surprises Mr. Wen is hiding.

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,300
Let's hope they won't disappoint me.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
What you saw today

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
is just an appetizer.

9
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,600
You'll see

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,530
my true capabilities another day.

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
The auction in Lingzhou City,

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,930
hosted by the Su family,

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,880
is nothing short of a spectacular.

14
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
The items on offer are rare—

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,850
not something money alone can buy.

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
If you'd honor me with your presence,

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,680
I will certainly reserve

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
the best seat for you.

19
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,560
I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,710
Only today do I truly feel

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,760
coming to Lingzhou City

22
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,740
was the right decision.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Please.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,370
Chancellor,

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,820
according to the news from Lingzhou,

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320
only Prince of Dingbei

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,120
and Officer Shu

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,390
arrived in Lingzhou.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
Princess Consort reportedly

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
turned back before entering Lingzhou.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,700
Yet, all this time,

32
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,590
our scouts have found

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,270
no trace of her

34
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,420
on the return route.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,400
Prince of Dingbei has achieved his goal.

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,510
If they still choose to press the matter,

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,190
the Su family

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,840
would be left with no choice
but to eliminate all threats.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,720
But if the Su family acts personally,

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm afraid

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
it may implicate you.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,000
I have my own plans.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,170
Any news on Yu Bozhong's whereabouts?

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
None as of yet.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Ever since he fled wounded that day,

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
he has vanished without a trace.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,600
I'll continue to have men search for him.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,840
I never expected him

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,920
to be Chief of Haiyou Sect.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I chose him as the Su family's son-in-law

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,810
because he seemed loyal and honest.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,040
But after all these years

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
of cultivating him and granting him

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
wealth and status,

55
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,560
he repaid the Su family

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,780
with betrayal!

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Idiot. Idiot.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Master.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
The new batch of goods has arrived.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
Tell Su Errong

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,760
that she can start preparing

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,440
for this month's auction.

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,360
All the goods this time are top-quality.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Master, you wanted to catch attention

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
of Xian's authorities

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,090
through the contraband, so that they

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,040
could investigate the Su family.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
But now, Miss He

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,630
came uninvited.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,540
I wonder

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,250
what her true intention is.

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
She's certainly no ordinary person.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,440
She saw through the flaws

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,520
in the tie-dyed silk at a glance,

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
and followed the lead of a hairpin

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,020
all the way to Fu Lu Gold Store.

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
She's certainly not here

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,920
just to eat and sightsee.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,159
She's not with the authorities,

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,150
yet she sensed something amiss.

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,150
Moreover,

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,510
Prince of Dingbei is now in Lingzhou.

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Prince of Dingbei

85
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
came for the Su family.

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
If he can discover

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,380
clues about the Su family's smuggling,

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
he'll surely investigate thoroughly.

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
leaving them nowhere to escape.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,720
I spent years planning in Lingzhou,

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
taking each step carefully.

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,560
Now,

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
it's finally time to put an end to it.

94
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,750
[Shengyi Inn]

95
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
I think you

96
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,080
are a smooth-talking,

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
disloyal,

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,590
and fickle playboy!

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,720
Last time we were together,

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,680
you said sweet words.

101
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,440
You said next time we met,

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,760
you'd make me a roast chicken.

103
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,950
I did say that,

104
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,560
but...

105
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,080
you insisted

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,200
on doing it yourself.

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
If I hadn't done it myself,

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
I would have starved to death!

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,000
Tell me,

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,820
this time we meet,

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,320
did you make a roast chicken for me?

112
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
I haven't even seen a chicken foot,

113
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
let alone a roast chicken!

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
I think

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
you're not sincere at all.

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,290
That's because you are injured

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
and shouldn't eat greasy food.

118
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Do you really think

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
your roast chicken tasted good?

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
It was dry and bland.

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
You didn't even pluck all the feathers!

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,660
Even pigs wouldn't eat it!

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Miss Yun, that is not

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
what you said before.

125
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,310
What did I say?

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,580
My roast chicken

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
was the second best delicacy in the world.

128
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
That was just lip service.

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
You actually believed that?

130
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
If it really wasn't tasty,

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
why did you just eat

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
more than half a chicken?

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,400
When people are starving,

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
they'll even eat pig slop,

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
let alone roast chickens.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
If that's really the case,

137
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
why did you ask me

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,280
for the secret recipe?

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,760
I...

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,680
You should learn.

141
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Look at this lady. How improper.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,760
You...

143
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,240
You... You shrew...

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
This way.

145
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,780
Look at him. And look at yourself.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
Wash all the clothes after we go back.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
Not just the clothes.

148
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll wash the shoes and socks too.

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's go eat.

150
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,000
My Lady,

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
the bedding has been changed.

152
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,430
It's the finest, right?

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes.

154
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,920
Also,

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
tell the kitchen

156
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
to prepare some wine and dishes—

157
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
nothing too rich,

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
just something that goes well with drinks.

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Yes.

160
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,600
You may all leave.

161
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

162
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Such tender bliss—

163
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
who wouldn't be enchanted?

164
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
Why do I think something is missing

165
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
by this bed?

166
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Shall I fetch

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
the glass lamp

168
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,780
your husband gave you?

169
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
You insolent maid! How dare you mock me!

170
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Forgive me, My Lady!

171
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
It was just a slip of the tongue.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I forgot to change
how I should address him.

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,080
Get lost!

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes.

175
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,039
Come back.

176
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
Bring the glass lamp.

177
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,679
Place it here.

178
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,520
Yes.

179
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,480
My Lady,

180
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,280
our watchers delivered a message.

181
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,200
Officer Shu made a move.

182
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Zhang Huaiyu still

183
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,370
hasn't shown up in the capital.

184
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
The claim of his return to the capital

185
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
should be Prince of Dingbei's attempt

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,000
to distract us.

187
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
He's not

188
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,410
an easy one to deal with.

189
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,780
Although he's retrieved the tax,

190
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,540
he might
have something else up his sleeve.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,650
Send more men to keep a close watch.

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,220
Whatever Zhang Huaiyu has

193
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,080
must not fall into anyone else's hands.

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Yes.

195
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
He came all the way here

196
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
just to avoid attention.

197
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,180
He must be up to something.

198
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,250
Where on earth is he going?

199
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
People always say nature calls,

200
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,820
but why isn't she slightly bothered?

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,920
Why are you here?

202
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you here?

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,450
She's fishing here.

204
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,640
Of course I'm here keeping an eye on her.

205
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,770
He's been circling around on the cart.

206
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,520
Why haven't the backup people

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
arrived yet?

208
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,360
Stop talking!

209
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,200
Hurry! Keep up!

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm exhausted.

211
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Why did you bring so much food?

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,440
It's enough for us

213
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,500
to have a few rounds of meals tonight.

214
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,470
What would you like to eat tonight,
Second Young Master Shu?

215
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,320
You didn't get to try
the grilled fish last time.

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,780
How about trying it today?

217
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,720
The fish I caught today

218
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,880
would surely be tasty if we grill them.

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
But roast chickens are not bad either.

220
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
What do you think?

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
Didn't you think

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
my roast chicken was so awful

223
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,130
that even pigs wouldn't eat it?

224
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Pigs aren't that lucky.

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,700
So,

226
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,050
you were just acting back at the inn?

227
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,380
You actually meant the opposite?

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Second Young Master Shu,

229
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,860
weren't you acting even more convincingly?

230
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,240
I...

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,280
But in my opinion,

232
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,720
you don't need to keep acting.

233
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
Those two fools are far behind.

234
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,720
They can't hear a thing.

235
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,490
His Highness's idea

236
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
is truly brilliant.

237
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Just a quarrel has made them

238
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,010
utterly confused.

239
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,160
Interesting.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Your Highness, why are you here?

241
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,060
I thought it was Ms. Su

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
who invited me here.

243
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I guess Ms. Su

244
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
misunderstood.

245
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
She must think I like you,

246
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
so she's trying to play matchmaker.

247
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
Ms. Su thinks

248
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
you like me?

249
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,150
So you mean

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
you don't like me?

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,250
That's...

252
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,080
not what I meant.

253
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,820
Then what did you mean?

254
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,080
Right,

255
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,640
of course you don't like me.

256
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,050
After all,

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
Miss Qingyu alone

258
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,440
outshines all the beauties.

259
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
Where is Miss Qingyu?

260
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,460
Why didn't you bring her back?

261
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
Are you waiting for an auspicious day

262
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,690
to bring her back from Hui Mansion?

263
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,880
Do you really want me

264
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
to bring her back?

265
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,440
That's what you want.

266
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
Why did you say I want that?

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't you know

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,720
if I want that or not?

269
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,280
Indeed, a drunk man's words

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,810
are a sober man's thoughts.

271
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,520
So much for starting over

272
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,780
and pursuing me again.

273
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,440
It was all a lie.

274
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,880
I heard Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
is a lonely place.

275
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,560
If Princess Consort
could have someone for company,

276
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,690
that would be great.

277
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
It's just that

278
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm not considerate enough.

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
I don't know how to serve you.

280
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm simply not destined

281
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
to be your family.

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
Fine.

283
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,520
I'll order someone

284
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
to bring her here now.

285
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,200
Why did you hit me?

286
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,840
I haven't even asked you

287
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,360
about

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,910
you being fickle,

289
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,440
and you're accusing me first.

290
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,190
Me being fickle? When?

291
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,800
I...

292
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
Xu,

293
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,360
we're in Su's Mansion.

294
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,630
Just because we're in Su's Mansion,

295
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,360
we should act more recklessly.

296
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
Consummating our marriage here

297
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,860
is not appropriate. Don't you think?

298
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,650
I'd love to,

299
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,400
but I have urgent matters to handle.

300
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,720
Yu is still waiting for me.

301
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I'll be back soon.

302
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
I have to trouble you

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
to finish this act.

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
How am I supposed

305
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,770
to finish this act on my own?

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
I see.

307
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,359
Keep watching.

308
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Tender romance

309
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,819
is the path to the underworld.

310
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
Money and women—

311
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,920
either of them will be your doom.

312
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,800
Granny.

313
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
-I can't go any further.
-I can't either.

314
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,610
If they move again,

315
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,740
you go follow them.

316
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,240
I... I'll rest for a while
and catch up later to take the shift.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,500
I can't go any further.

318
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,290
Even if they move again,
I'm not going to follow them.

319
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,340
Where are they?

320
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,310
You're finally here.

321
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,520
Why don't you just wait until tomorrow

322
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,740
to show up?

323
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,120
You two have the nerve to complain?

324
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,020
The marks you left

325
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,880
are almost all over the city.

326
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,930
It's a miracle

327
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,720
we found this place.

328
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,350
Yeah.

329
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,410
Are they inside?

330
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Yes.

331
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,420
We saw them go in.

332
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,400
That Shu fellow

333
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,560
circled around all day.

334
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,120
I think

335
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
he did that on purpose.

336
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,930
He was just trying
to conceal his true intention.

337
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,520
I think it's very likely

338
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
that they... they're meeting here.

339
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,440
Guys,

340
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,480
Ms. Su gave an order.

341
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,080
We must find

342
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Zhang Huaiyu

343
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,800
and take back the evidence.

344
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Even if we kill the wrong one,

345
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
we can't let them escape!

346
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,310
Go!

347
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,490
Go, hurry.

348
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm worn out.

349
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,670
If he circled around on purpose,

350
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,240
then...

351
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,440
that would be exactly his true intention.

352
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,400
Why do I think...

353
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,860
-we've been fooled?
-We've been fooled?

354
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,200
Granny, please stay.

355
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,560
You brought so many things.

356
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
I really can't accept them.

357
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
Madam,

358
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,360
we troubled you enough before.

359
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,000
Consider this

360
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,410
our way of thanking you.

361
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,560
You live alone,

362
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,880
so take good care of yourself.

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
Don't overwork yourself.

364
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,630
Okay.

365
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
This... This...

366
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Boss.

367
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,440
I've checked.

368
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,700
There's no one inside.

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,390
Isn't that obvious?

370
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
Don't be afraid, Granny. They're with us.

371
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,010
You go inside first.

372
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,640
This...

373
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,130
Gentlemen, are you here

374
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,170
for Granny

375
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
or for the two of us?

376
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,880
You've been traveling all day.

377
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,080
You must have something urgent, right?

378
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Let me explain.

379
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,080
We were ordered to come here

380
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
to protect you two.

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,600
And

382
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,760
whose order?

383
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,520
We are guards of the Su family.

384
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,160
Of course it's Ms. Su's order.

385
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,000
You came all the way from the capital,

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
and you're not familiar with this place.

387
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,480
The Su family

388
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,730
simply wishes to act as a proper host

389
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,480
and ensure your safety.

390
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,400
Yes, yes.

391
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Well, that's...

392
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,880
very kind of Ms. Su.

393
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,680
Yeah.

394
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,360
No, no, no.

395
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,560
It's what we should do.

396
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
You're as stupid as pigs,

397
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
and you think everyone else

398
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,010
is just like you!

399
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
B-Boss,

400
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,880
should... should we kill them or not?

401
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,360
She called you a pig,
and you're really acting like one.

402
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,120
I just said

403
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,920
we're here to protect them.

404
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,760
Fighting them now
would be a slap in the face!

405
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,000
Boss, I get it now.

406
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,720
We're here to protect Officer Shu.

407
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,330
Let's... talk... properly.

408
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Get... off me.

409
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,700
Move.

410
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,240
What time is it now?

411
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Where are you from?

412
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,520
7 p.m. I'm from the north.

413
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,680
Sir.

414
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,880
Just delivering a few letters—

415
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
is that going to cost you your lives?

416
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
How many times do I have to say it

417
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
for you to understand?

418
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm...

419
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,840
worried...

420
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,770
Someone might be worried about me.

421
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,640
It's just a few letters.

422
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
They don't even mention names or origins.

423
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
What's there to be afraid of?

424
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,720
All of you

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,800
have worked for Xu for too long,

426
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,730
and you've become as rigid as he is!

427
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,720
Young Lord Zhang, you're full of life

428
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,840
and eloquent.

429
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Looks like I should lock you up
for a few more days

430
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,020
to smooth out your temper.

431
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,480
Xu.

432
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,760
What took you so long?

433
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,720
Miss Yun, you haven't fully recovered.

434
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,410
Did that fight earlier
affect your injuries?

435
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,140
Just a superficial wound.

436
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm fine now.

437
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
Second Young Master Shu,

438
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
from now on, no matter what happens,

439
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,440
don't risk your life like that again.

440
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
But I'm a man.

441
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,290
Of course I should protect you.

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm skilled in martial arts.

443
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,500
It should be me protecting you daily.

444
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
Miss Yun, do you think...

445
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm completely useless?

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,460
Since we left the capital,

447
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,650
you've been the one
saving and protecting me.

448
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,280
I've been of no help,

449
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,600
and I've been a burden.

450
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,580
Not at all.

451
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,810
Everyone has their own strengths.

452
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,510
I might not be good

453
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,400
at what you excel in.

454
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,600
As they say, each plays their own role.

455
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
We should complement each other.

456
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,260

certainly not my strengths.

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,270
♪ May the fleeting years

Second Young Master Shu, sit tight.

497

this road

Even if we're not tired,

524
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
the horse will be.

525
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,180
Slow down, please.

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
please slow down.

528
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,040
We can't walk any further.

529
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Let us rest for a while.

530
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
Just a short break, please.

531
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,680
My Lady.

532
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,200
Come in.

533
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,700
My Lady,

534
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,090
around Officer Shu,

535
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,370
we didn't see Young Lord Zhang.

536
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,480
They only

537
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
took a ride to the outskirts.

538
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,080
But... our men were caught.

539
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
Your subordinates' failure

540
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
is your responsibility.

541
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
Those who are useless

542
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,080
don't deserve to stay in the Su family.

543
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Yes.

544
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,240
But I think it's strange.

545
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Even if Officer Shu

546
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,040
noticed someone tailing them,

547
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,560
it doesn't explain why

548
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,090
they took such a long detour

549
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,520
and deliberately aroused our suspicion.

550
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,850
Something's not right.

551
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Could that...

552
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
be a diversion?

553
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
It's been almost two hours.

554
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,770
Why hasn't he come back yet?

555
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
My Lady.

556
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
Are they still inside?

557
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,120
My Lady,

558
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,800
I have been here the entire time.

559
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
They've never come out.

560
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,040
Was there any noise inside?

561
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,080
Did they...

562
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
I heard everything clearly.

563
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,460
Your Highness.

564
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,800
Miss He.

565
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,100
Your Highness?

566
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,900
Your Highness.

567
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,050
Your Highness?

568
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,700
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

569
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,000
Just now, the maid knocked on the door,

570
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,720
but there was no response
for quite a while.

571
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,450
Out of concern for your safety,

572
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,470
we entered without permission.

573
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,560
Miss He, what's wrong?

574
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
You should

575
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
ask yourself.

576
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
Today, you were the one

577
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,290
who invited me here, right?

578
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,240
But why did

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,900
His Highness show up instead?

580
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,690
Last time, I invited you two
to Xianquan Restaurant,

581
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
but I had to leave early
due to some matters.

582
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,260
I failed to be a proper host.

583
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,000
So today, I thought I might as well

584
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,530
invite you two to my mansion

585
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,760
to make amends.

586
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,300
But who would have thought

587
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
something came up again

588
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
and delayed me until now?

589
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
Miss He,

590
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,140
I've hosted you poorly

591
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,320
and caused this misunderstanding
between you and His Highness.

592
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
Since it's a misunderstanding,

593
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,840
clearing it up is enough.

594
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,400
Your Highness,
thank you for your affection.

595
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
But what I want

596
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,920
is love true and undivided,
lasting for a lifetime.

597
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,580
Since you already have a wife,

598
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,020
you can no longer give me

599
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,680
love that belongs to me alone.

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,670
You and I

601
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
are not meant to be.

602
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

603
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Miss He.

604
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,320
Miss He, you're truly straightforward.

605
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,880
I respect your decision.

606
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,250
I'll take my leave.

607
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Ms. Su,

608
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,760
I apologize for the disturbance tonight.

609
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,700
I'll visit you another day.

610
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,280
Ms. Su,

611
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,210
is there anything else?

612
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Nothing else.

613
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,100
Your Highness, please rest well.

614
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,880
This was intercepted
by the secret guards today.

615
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,280
It came from the capital.

616
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,210
The letter is for Su Errong.

617
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
Make sure to return it intact,

618
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,880
so that those in the capital
won't be suspicious.

619
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,720
Yes.

620
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,920
According to the content of the letter,

621
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,340
the Su family is getting impatient
and ready to make a move.

622
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,280
[Su's Mansion]

623
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,760
So? Did you see Young Lord Zhang?

624
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,880
The Su family has noticed
you haven't returned to the capital.

625
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,260
Whether it's
thoroughly investigating the Su family

626
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,520
or the smuggling case,

627
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,440
we have to make a risky move

628
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,700
and finish it quickly.

629
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,720
With the Su family's methods,

630
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,600
if they find out who you really are,

631
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,060
they will surely kill you.

632
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,380
Right now,
we have merchants from the capital

633
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,710
and Mr. Wu as witnesses.

634
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
Mr. Luo is the source of smuggling.

635
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,760
That much is clear.

636
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,600
But I think

637
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,040
he's just a pawn.

638
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
The real mastermind

639
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,680
is someone else.

640
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,490
The Su family will

641
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,200
hold an auction in the coming days.

642
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,280
I haven't figured out

643
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,410
its true intention.

644
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,400
Once I uncover the truth,

645
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
we'll catch them red-handed

646
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,010
and solve the problem once and for all.

647
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,400
Tan,

648
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,680
I have never felt

649
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,810
this uneasy before.

650
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
The closer we get to the truth,

651
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,890
the greater the danger.

652
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,560
I'm worried if you investigate further,

653
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,690
you'll be in danger.

657
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,880

will surely make the Su family suspicious.

664
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
But for the court

665
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,640

what I just heard

690
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,250
wasn't like this.

691
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,320
You know the rules of the Su family.

692
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
Go accept your punishment.

693
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
Yes,

694
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,050
thank you for your mercy.

695
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,120
Ms. Su.

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,920
Second Young Master Shu,

697
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,160
what is this about?

698
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,480
Today, Miss Yun and I

699
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,520
were hunting in the outskirts of the city.

700
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,360
We accidentally

701
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,090
encountered these lost souls.

702
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,400
After asking them,

703
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
we learned they're the Su family's guards.

704
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
To prevent them from getting lost again,

705
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,000
I

706
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,930
escorted them back to the mansion.

707
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,240
These people were ordered

708
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,160
to protect you.

709
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,000
It seems they have failed in their duty

710
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,810
and have troubled you instead.

711
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,560
With such poor skills,

712
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
they can't even protect themselves.

713
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
How can they protect others?

714
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,080
The Su family's guards

715
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
should protect the Su family's members.

716
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,080
His Highness and Second Young Master Shu

717
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,560
have their own people to protect them.

718
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,820
It's not your concern.

719
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,790
Goodbye.

720
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,720
My Lady,

721
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,140
there's a letter from the capital.

722
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,340
[Princess of Dingbei isn't in the capital.
She may be in disguise in Lingzhou.]

723
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,830
[Investigate thoroughly
in case she's up to something.]

724
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,540
Princess of Dingbei is in Lingzhou City?

725
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,120
The taxes have been paid.

726
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,120
But Prince of Dingbei shows

727
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,850
no sign of preparing to depart.

728
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,330
It must have something to do with this.

729
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
Jiang Xu deliberately said

730
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,490
Zhang Huaiyu had returned to the capital.

731
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,710
It was to make us lower our guard

732
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,850
and stop looking for Zhang Huaiyu,

733
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,660
so they could meet each other.

734
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,880
Shu Jingran's behavior today

735
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,040
was a diversion,

736
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,320
but it has proved

737
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,860
Zhang Huaiyu certainly hasn't left.

738
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,250
The evidence is still in his hands.

739
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,960
I'll send more men

740
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,420
to secretly investigate
across Lingzhou's 12 districts.

741
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
Looks like Jiang Xu

742
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,720
will stop at nothing.

743
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
He's made up his mind

744
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
to thoroughly investigate the Su family

745
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,500
and leave us no chance to make a comeback.

746
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,540
We must find Zhang Huaiyu.

747
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,770
And the guest in our mansion

748
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
can't be kept any longer.

749
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,320
Yes.

750
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,840
But... how should we proceed?

751
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,090
I await your instruction, My Lady.

Although Father offered help,

753
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,320
if we can solve the issue
with just one move,

754
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,660
why stir up chaos needlessly?

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,810
Go to Qingyu in Hui Mansion.

756
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,440

please come inside for some tea.

Mr. Wen,

768
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,720
we've reserved

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,120
a good seat for you today.

770
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,660
Mr. Zhang,

771
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,640
it's been a while
since you came last time.

772
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,120
Today, you must take your time
enjoying the tea

773
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,560
and buy some top-quality goods.

774
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay.

775
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,400
Since I rarely come here,

776
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,900
I plan to leave thoroughly satisfied.

777
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,200
Okay. The usual seat.

778
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,800

How was the blood bird's nest

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,660
I gave you last time?

783
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,680
It was quite good.

784
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,430
If it wasn't enough,

785
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,360
feel free to get more from my mansion.

Ms. Su.

789
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,900
Regarding the hairpin incident last time,

790
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,340
I sincerely apologize.

791
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,760
To make it up to you,

792
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
I've specially arranged for you

793
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,360
to sit in the front row today.

794
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,040
The hairpin incident
had nothing to do with you.

795
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,300
I'm well aware of that.

796
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,640
Ms. Su, thank you

797
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,640
for inviting me to every auction.

798
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,000
They've opened my eyes

799
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
and allowed me to earn

800
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,120
some more money of my own.

801
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,880
Then I hope you

802
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,920
can also get what

803
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,880
you like today.

Thank you, Ms. Su.

Rest assured, My Lady.

808

Everything has been arranged properly.

809

We just need to wait
for them to take the bait.

Go keep an eye there.

Yes.

Look at you.

Yes.

820
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,640
have you brought enough money today?

821
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,560
Don't worry.

822
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
It's definitely enough.

823
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,400
Come on.

824
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,900
This way please, Fourth Miss.

825
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,130
You'll get a clearer view from inside.

826
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,360
Please have a seat, Fourth Miss.

827
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,520
Mr. Wen, I'm here today

828
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,540
thanks to your recommendation.

829
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
If I miss such an occasion,

830
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,040
I'm afraid
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

831
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,810
You're too kind, Fourth Miss.

832
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,320
Once the gong strikes three times,

833
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,240
the auction will officially begin.

834
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,000
If there's anything you like,

835
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
I can bid on your behalf.

836
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,440
If the bidding outside gets too fierce,

837
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,280
I'll talk to Ms. Su and ask her

838
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,600
to reserve one or two pieces.

839
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,060
It shouldn't be a problem.

840
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,140
I appreciate your kindness, Mr. Wen.

841
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
If there really is something I like,

842
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,320
I won't hesitate.

843
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,160
But an auction

844
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,960
must still be fair.

845
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,520
I don't intend to force others.

846
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
Whether I get it or not,

847
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440
I'll leave it to fate.

848
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,280
You're truly different from the rest.

849
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,320
This is Mr. Wen's reserved seat.

850
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,600
I heard that today,

851
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,200
he wanted to add a seat

852
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,720
for a special friend,

853
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,720
so I came out of curiosity.

854
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,810
I didn't expect it to be Miss He.

855
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,440
Your Highness, you came to this banquet.

856
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,320
I am deeply honored.

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,120
to host a banquet

for you, Your Highness.

860
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,760
But he was worried it might be improper.

861
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,880
So he asked me
to arrange this banquet and invite you.

862
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,360
Fortunately, you accepted my invitation

863
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,080
and did not embarrass me.

[Yin Shi, Deputy Envoy
of the Maritime Trade Bureau]

865
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,440
Your Highness, there are some words

866
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,550
that I've been kept in my heart
for a long time.

867
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,080
Now that I've met you today,

868
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,000
I must speak my mind.

869
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,080
The Maritime Trade Bureau has suffered
from deep-rooted corruption for years.

870
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,120
It's hard to eliminate the issue.

871
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Although I have great ambition,

872
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,460
I have to compromise

873
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,280
given my lower rank.

874
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,410
Your presence here

00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,800
is the salvation
of the Maritime Trade Bureau

876
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,240
and a blessing for Lingzhou.

-Yes.
-Yes.

878

I will fully cooperate.

882
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,840
I'll burn the bridge behind me

883
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,200
and replace the old rules with new ones.

00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,560
what does this mean?

890

This is a memorial

detailing your crimes.
