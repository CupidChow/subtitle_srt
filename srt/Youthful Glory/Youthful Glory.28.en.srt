You and I are the same.

We have no control over our own bodies

I'm here today

to tell you the truth

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
because I cherish my talent.

11

You're the backbone of the nation.

12
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,810
I cannot bear to see you

13
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,330
deceived and used by others,

14
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,560
only to sacrifice your life
for them so willingly.

15
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,190
I'll give you two days.

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,130
If you change your mind,

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,600
there might be a chance

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,860
to turn things around.

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,010
Wait, Your Majesty,

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
this is a token given to me by Su Wenchun

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
when he took me in.

22
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,340
Please have someone fetch brush and ink.

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,800
I, Liu Mo,

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
am willing to confess and testify that
Chancellor Su

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,020
is not only my true master
behind the scenes,

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
but also the mastermind
behind the Su family case.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,440
I, Liu Mo,

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,560
know full well that my crimes
are unforgivable,

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
and I do not regret dying.

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,980
I only beg Your Majesty

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,530
to thoroughly investigate the
case from years past,

32
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,110
and return my father's innocence.

33
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
The crimes of Su Wenchun

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,190
are too numerous to record,

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
and the souls wronged under his hand

36
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,490
are far more than just your father.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,970
This time,

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,980

39

wrongfully silenced.

00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,240
Bring brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

Yes.

42
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,329
You still betrayed him.

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,280
If not for the hatred of
my father's murder,

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
I would have gladly gone to my death.

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,590
Only then did you ask me

46
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,560
why I suddenly vanished
all those years ago.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,020
Because the Chancellor knew that

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
even the most loyal soldier

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
may one day grow out of control.

behind the Su family case in  Lingzhou.

to you, my dear in-law,

You truly need not blame yourself.

114

so she can sincerely repent and reform.

121
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,650

Guo Bingmao has mustered tens of thousands of troops

How dare he?

142
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,760
Given Guo Bingmao's cautious nature,

143
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,490
he'd never act without orders!

144
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,330
This must be Chancellor Su's scheme

For this journey back to the capital,

155
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,940
I must trouble Father-in-Law
to personally provide protection.

167
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,280
is Guo Bingmao truly rebelling?

168
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,610
The news should be true.

169
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,480
According to Liu Mo's testimony,
the Ming family's case

170
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,150
was orchestrated jointly by Guo Bingmao

171
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,550
and Su Wenchun.

172
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,760
The moment Su Wenchun was imprisoned,

173
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,300
Guo Bingmao raised troops in revolt.

174
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,250
The Yangxi Prefecture must be

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,280
But even if he

177

rescues Chancellor Su,

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200

Unless he eliminates all opposition,

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,980
aligns with Chancellor Su's faction,

182
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,580

If unrest truly breaks out in the capital,

189
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,480
have Father-in-law take Tan

190
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,010
to take refuge in Jiangnan.

191
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,880
Okay.

192
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,240
Be careful.

193
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,710
[Feng's Mansion]

194
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
Take care.

195
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,440
[Lingzhou]

196
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,050
Scouts report—utmost urgency!

197
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,940
Scouts report—utmost urgency!

198
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,540
[Lingzhou]

199
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Father,

200
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,640
Nanlyu must have learned

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,940
Yangxi Prefecture's defenses are weakened.

202
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,120
So they're launching a surprise attack.

203
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,660
I'll go to the City Defense Office
immediately to organize defenses

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
I won't let Nanlu's scheme succeed!

205
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you worried that

206
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,330
we lack sufficient troops to
defend the city?

207
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,270
The Nanlyu army is attacking.

208
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
At least they have ten thousand troops.

209
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,960
With Yangxi Prefecture's forces
mobilized northward,

210
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Lingzhou stands isolated

211
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,220
and vulnerable.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,280
We likely won't hold out for long.

213
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Even if Guo Bingmao has rebelled,

214
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,850
Yangxi Prefecture still has
garrison troops.

215
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,610
But

216
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
without a commander present,

217
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
no one would dare authorize
reinforcements,

218
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
even if we requested
them.

219
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,610
If we report this to the court now

220
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,080
and wait for an imperial decree,

221
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,480
it'll be far too late by the
time it arrives!

222
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,820
Who says Yangxi Prefecture
lacks a commander?

223
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,760
There may yet be one

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,320
who can resolve this crisis.

225
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,110
Ever since learning of
Guo Bingmao's rebellion,

226
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,200
I have harbored

227
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,440
dark premonitions.

228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,420
Nanlyu has coveted Lingzhou for years.

229
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,850
While their opportunistic strike

230
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,680
seems sudden,

231
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,320
it was only to be expected.

232
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,400
The current situation in Yangxi Prefecture

233
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,920
remains unclear.

234
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,320
Putting aside whether we can

235
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,050
secure reinforcements at all—

236
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,490
what I truly fear is...

237
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,150
Fear what?

238
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,880
I fear you

239
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,080
walking into the lion's den alone.

240
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,230
There remain in the ranks my sworn brothers,

241
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,240
bound by life-and-death oaths.

242
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,840
I believe

243
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,200
they will never fight against me.

244
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,040
The Yangxi Prefecture's sacred duty

245
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,300
is to repel Nanlyu invaders
and guard our borders.

246
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,520
Now the enemy comes;

247
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,180
they must meet them in battle.

248
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,140
If military orders give you pause,

249
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,030
I shall bear all consequences

250
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,260
when the dust settles.

251
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,140
Please think twice.

252
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,220
The realm is in peril; we cannot hesitate.

253
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,240
Whatever lies ahead,

254
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
I must try.

255
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,370
Second Young Master Shu,

256
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,670
with my departure,

257
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,210
Tan is in your care.

258
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,110
Find a way to

259
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,810
keep her from suspicion.

260
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,120
With enemy forces now at our gates,

261
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,380
chaos in Lingzhou

262
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,540
is inevitable—

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,680
whether Yangxi Prefecture
sends reinforcements or not.

264
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,900
It's late tonight.

265
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,630
But you must leave

266
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,900
tomorrow morning.

267
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,090
I won't let you down.

268
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
May you go with caution

269
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,340
and return victorious.

270
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,920
Thank you.

[Lingzhou]

272
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,670
Your foresight proves infallible, Master.

273
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,090
The Prince of Dingbei hastened north

274
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,360
the moment Yangxi Prefecture rebelled.

275
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,950
All is prepared;

276
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,960
we await only your command.

277
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,620
It's time to close the net.

278
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,130
Order the army to advance at once.

279
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,530

281
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,050

[Shengyi Inn]

284
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,980
Let me do it.

285
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,170
Thank you.

286
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,280
Here, put these inside.

Your Highness.

288
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,250
Why did Father rush back to

289
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,060
the Yangxi Prefecture overnight?

290
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,640
Guo Bingmao has rebelled
against the throne.

291
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
His Lordship fears unrest

292
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,740
among the Yangxi Prefecture

293
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,010
may compromise border defenses,

294
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,070
so he's making an urgent inspection.

295
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,800
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

296
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,130
His Lordship will be back soon.

297
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,240
He specially asked us

298
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
to ride ahead

299
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
and meet at Shaxi.

There's no telling

Should war come to Lingzhou,

307

If you dare to act rashly,

I have an appointment with a beauty today.

Do you think this fan

338
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
matches my clothes?

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,660
Young Master, a secret letter
from His Highness.

340
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,280
It's just a letter from Xu.

341
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
How can it be called a secret letter?

342
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,200
Let me see.

343
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,310
Guo Bingmao is secretly
mobilizing troops northward.

344
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,580
Something might be brewing in the capital.

345
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,160
Keep a close watch on all movements there—

346
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,350
especially in the palace.

347
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,390
If anything seems off,

348
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,850
send word immediately so
we can make preparations in advance.

His Majesty's special permission

Without an imperial decree,

no one is allowed to enter.

367
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,560
Why would there be sudden
changes in the palace?

The guards at the palace gate

369
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,560
look unfamiliar.

a fight may be inevitable.

376
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
If that's the case,

377
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,440
I have to go home

378
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,480
and tell my dad.

379
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,130
Let's go.

380
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,830
Find a way to enter the palace.

381
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,270
I'm thinking about it.

382
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,480
You're not scared, are you?

383
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,600
Scared?

384
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,010
My elder sister is still in the palace.

385
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,070
How can I be afraid?

386
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,590
Then why are you shaking?

387
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,900
My legs are shaking.

388
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,490
I can't control them.

389
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,910
Sir.

390
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,360
Young Lord Zhang sent back a message.

391
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
His Majesty has gone
hunting in the outskirts.

392
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,780
He knows nothing
about the situation in the palace.

393
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,360
How many Imperial Guards
has His Majesty brought?

394
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,590
Commander Lu is leading the escort.

395
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,400
He only brought
thousands of elite soldiers.

396
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,490
According to the secret guards,

397
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,150
Guo Bingmao's army
is approaching the capital.

398
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,820
[Taiji Hall]

399
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,380
[Rende Gate]

400
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,520
Who is it?

401
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
Sister!

402
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,160
Yu.

403
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Eat.

404
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,680
Eat your last meal.
You'll be on your way by noon.

405
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,650
Who did this?

406
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,440
Hurry! Someone's breaking into the prison!

407
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,420
Come on, fight our way out!

408
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,280
Kill! Kill!

409
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,020
Run!

410
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,290
Let's go.

411
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,670
Go! Hurry!

412
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Go.

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,260
Let's get out from that side.

414
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,900
Let's go.

415
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,300
Your Majesty,
something happened in the capital.

416
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,530
Someone broke into the Court of Review

417
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,440
and released the prisoners.

418
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
All the prisoners have risen in revolt.

419
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,760
Su Wenchun and Liu Mo

420
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,900
were missing.

421
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,280
It's Yangxi Prefecture.

422
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,540
The army has arrived.

423
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,920
Have all Imperial Guards

424
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,830
on high alert.

425
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,720
Be ready for battle at any moment.

426
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,480
Yes.

427
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,870
[Jinshun Gate]

428
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,920
By His Majesty's order,

429
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,140
We've returned to the palace early
for guard rotation.

430
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,040
[Order]

431
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,350
[Jinshun Gate]

432
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,490
[Jinshun Gate]

433
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,600
[Chongfeng Gate]

434
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,920
You four

435
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,500
go to Shoukang Palace
to protect Empress Dowager.

436
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,520
The rest follow me
straight to Changchun Palace.

437
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,320
Yes.

438
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,150
[Zhenxiang Gate]

439
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,960
We're here under orders
to rotate the guard.

440
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,160
Why did you ambush us?

441
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,900
You said you are the Imperial Guards.

442
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Then tell us.

443
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,030
Who's currently commanding

444
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,110
the Six Divisions
of the Northern Barracks?

445
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,970
And which divisions
from the Southern Barracks

446
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,160
inspected the Imperial Tombs

447
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,960
a few days ago?

448
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,180
Too many flaws.

449
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,860
[Zhenxiang Gate]

450
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,990
They're rebels from Yangxi Prefecture,

451
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,660
invading the palace
with treasonous intent.

452
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,010
By the Empress's order,

453
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,300
execute them on the spot.

454
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,180
Kill them!

455
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,600
Your Highness.

456
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,020
Chancellor has made a move.

457
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,840
There's chaos both inside
and outside the palace.

458
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,040
Chancellor Su has colluded
with Yangxi Prefecture to rebel.

459
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,980
Even if he succeeds,

460
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,910
their actions won't be justified.

461
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
If he wants to clear his name

462
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,760
and stay in power,

463
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,160
he'll need Empress Dowager to step forward

464
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,210
to stabilize the court.

465
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,410
Choose one obedient from the royal family

466
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,870
and appoint a new emperor.

467
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,680
Yu was not allowed to enter the palace.

468
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,500
I thought the situation
in the palace had changed.

469
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,330
Now it seems

470
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,320
His Majesty saw it coming

471
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,380
and planned ahead.

472
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,170
I just didn't expect

473
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,440
he would be so bold

474
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,320
to break into the palace at night.

475
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,050
Yu was worried about you.

476
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,350
I wonder

477
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,770
what's going on outside.

478
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,000
Those rebels

479
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,490
have been to the battlefield.

480
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,130
Yu

481
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,200
doesn't stand a chance against them.

482
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
Yu never had any interest
in court affairs.

483
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
No matter how hard my family tried,

484
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,530
he refused to become an official.

485
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,680
But now,

486
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,360
he's dragged into this because of me.

487
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,680
Your Majesty.

488
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,120
Please don't blame yourself.

489
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,720
You and Yu are siblings.

490
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Blood is thicker than water.

491
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
With his personality,

492
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,020
he'd do anything to keep you safe.

493
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,640
If anyone's to blame,

494
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
it's

495
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Su Wenchun.

496
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,240
His Majesty should have

497
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
killed him long ago.

498
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,240
When he took Tan

499
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,040
as his adopted daughter,

500
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,520
I thought he was up to no good.

501
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,360
I knew it.

502
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,240
All that kindness and righteousness

503
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,180
were all fake.

504
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,160
In my opinion,

505
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
such an evil

506
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,040
with wild ambition

507
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,370
should be sliced to death,
and even that wouldn't be enough.

508
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,410
Your Majesty.

509
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,550
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,920
I've offended your ears.

511
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,080
I-I just...

512
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,190
I was too anxious.

513
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,790
I just...

514
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,760
Help!

515
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,870
I can't hold...

516
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,730
Yu!

517
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
Zhang Huaiyu.

518
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,140
Zhang Huaiyu.

519
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,440
Are you okay?

520
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
I-I can't take it anymore.

521
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm going to hell soon.

522
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Hurry, help him in.

523
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,800
Okay.

524
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,320
Be careful.

525
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,100
Be careful. Don't touch the wounds.

526
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,020
Let's move.

527
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Slow down.

528
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,320
You're not good at martial arts.

529
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,000
You should've stayed back.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Why tried to play the hero?

531
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,240
I...

532
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Yu!

533
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,160
Why are you covered in blood?

534
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,520
Where exactly are you hurt?

535
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,160
My left arm

536
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,500
got slashed with a sword.

537
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,380
Here, here.

538
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,730
My right arm

539
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,830
was stabbed.

540
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,930
And the back.

541
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,820
My back and waist.

542
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,890
I'm wounded all over.

543
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,580
It hurts. I can't take it anymore.

544
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,200
I'm badly hurt.

545
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,600
I-It hurts so much.

546
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,930
It hurts.

547
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,990
Minmin.

548
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,620
I was just kidding.

549
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,840
I-I was just trying to scare you.

550
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,560
I'm fine.

551
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,720
I just got a minor injury.

552
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,980
It's nothing serious.

553
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,320
Alright, alright.

554
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,480
Don't cry.

555
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,120
Minmin, I'm really fine.

556
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
Look.

557
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Are you really okay?

558
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
Really. Look.

559
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,750
I'm fine.

560
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm fine.

561
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,130
I'm really fine.

562
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,850
It hurts.

563
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Even a minor wound is a wound.

564
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,700
Don't make it worse.

565
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,930
How dare you lie to me!

566
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,120
I'm fine.

567
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,970
These are the rarest spices

568
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,750
in the world.

569
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,590
Especially this ambergris.

570
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,800
Comes from the deep sea
of Nanyang.

571
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,360
The annual gain is only half a catty.

572
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,540
Fourth Miss, would you like to
take a look?

573
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,760
You're someone

574
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,640
who loves, understands,
and cherishes fragrance.

575
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,360
The book written by the Taoist Ruoxu,

576
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,090
Yunxiao's Fragrance-Making,

577
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,120
may suit your tastes.

578
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,500
Last time

579
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,580
I bid on the sachet Taoist Ruoxu used.

580
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,560
It was meant as a gift for you.

581
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,360
Unfortunately,
things didn't go as planned.

582
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,980
So let this fragrance-making ancient book

583
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,180
as my late gift.

584
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,080
You truly have a remarkable ability.

585
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,000
This ancient book
has been lost for a long time.

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
It's hard to find it.

587
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Yet you found it

588
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,920
in a short time.

589
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
As long as you accept it,

590
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,080
everything I've done

591
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,770
is worth it.

592
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,870
I have no interest in smuggled goods.

593
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,760
What I care about

594
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
is how you plan

595
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,840
to handle the Feng family.

596
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,420
That depends on whether

597
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,180
they are willing to surrender.

598
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,430
The Feng family

599
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,450
are the morale of the Lingzhou army.

600
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,260
If they surrender,

601
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,690
the people of Lingzhou

602
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,870
will be loyal to the Nanlyu.

603
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,530
If they don't surrender,

604
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,870
I'll have no choice but to kill them

605
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,450
to warn others.

606
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,850
If you'd

607
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,480
accompany me today,

608
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,450
I may consider

609
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
sparing their lives.

610
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,239
[Shengyi Inn]

611
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,410
I'll

612
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,790
go with you.

613
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,050
But aside from the Feng family,

614
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,320
you must not harm

615
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,760
anyone by my side.

616
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,600
I really envy

617
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,239
the people around you.

618
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,480
They can be protected by you.

619
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,389
I can set them free.

620
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
As long as

621
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
you return with me

622
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,639
to Nanlyu.

623
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,199
But if the rest of my life

624
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,080
is to be like a caged bird.

625
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:41,020
[Shengyi Inn]

626
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,659
No freedom.

627
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,730
Be fooled by others.

628
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,280
Just to satisfy

629
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,159
someone's selfish desires.

630
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,800
Why would I live in the world

631
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,800
and suffer such humiliation?

632
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,740
In Nanlyu, the world is vast.

633
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,970
Would I ever keep you from being free?

634
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,780
It's not what I want.

635
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
How can I be free?

636
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,080
If you've come

637
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,880
just to

638
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,600
debate empty ideals with me,

639
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,080
then I must excuse myself.

640
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,800
Fourth Miss, please get on the carriage.

641
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,620
Our Xian people value reputation.

642
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,080
We strictly observe gender segregation.

643
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,800
I am the Princess of Dingbei.

644
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,340
How could I share a carriage

645
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,960
with another man?

646
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,300
It's been a whole day.

647
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,520
I wonder how Her Highness is now.

648
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,090
Why did you both go quiet?

649
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,230
We need to find a way to get out of here.

650
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,780
I've been thinking about it all day.

651
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,900
If you have a way,

652
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,650
why are you still trapped here?

653
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,950
After a full day of observation,

654
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,850
I've concluded these knots

655
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,200
can only be cut with something sharp.

656
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,640
If you keep struggling,

657
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,040
it will only get tighter.

658
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,120
And where are we supposed
to find something sharp?

659
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,120
Have you Jinyun Guards ever

660
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
trained for this kind of

661
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
self-rescue when trapped?

662
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,160
Jinyun Guards are human too.

663
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,040
Do you expect us to

664
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,060
be capable of everything?

665
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,020
It sounds like

666
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,680
we are trapped here

667
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,090
because we don't want to leave.

668
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,920
Second Young Master Shu is not
from the Jinyun Guards.

669
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,780
And he doesn't practice martial arts。

670
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,900
He's just curious.

671
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,590
Why take your anger out on him?

672
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,800
If he doesn't understand martial arts,

673
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
then why ask so many questions?

674
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,080
I don't understand poetry,

675
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360
yet I don't go around asking about it.

676
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,680
That's like playing the lute to a cow.

677
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760
Who are you calling a cow?

678
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,840
I'm referring to

679
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,680
Zhuifeng.

680
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,270
No one is a cow.

681
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,930
Yun Yi, it's just a figure of speech.

682
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,760
In my opinion,

683
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,560
we should strike first.

684
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,760
If Zhuifeng

685
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,920
hadn't held me back today,

686
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,520
I'd have taken Wen Zong down.

687
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,880
If I had taken him down,

688
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,600
we wouldn't have

689
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,720
ended up like this.

690
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,860
Say something, Zhuifeng.

691
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,740
-I...
-Shut up!

692
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,570
If we had actually fought today,

693
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,240
General Feng would have died for sure.

694
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,280
Besides, Her Highness gave orders.

695
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
How could we disobey?

696
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,940
If we had acted,

697
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,120
she'd be in even greater danger.

698
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,680
Before Sir left, he told us

699
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,040
to protect Her Highness.

700
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,160
If she is in danger,

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,620
it will be our negligence.

702
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,640
Wait.

703
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,320
You are Her Highness's personal guard.

704
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,560
You failed your duty.

705
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,760
Why did you drag us into this?

706
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,840
You are not?

707
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,600

00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,160
you've been with Her Highness these days.

Following her is one thing.

710
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,280
Guarding her is another.

711
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Do you think following her around

712
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,870
is just for fun?

713
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,480
I...

714
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Zhuiyu.

715
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,720
A man should be broad-minded

716
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,640
and generous.

717
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,920
How could you

718
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,440
fight over every little thing?

719
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,240
Besides,

720
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,840
making things difficult for a lady

721
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,700
is not what a gentleman should do.

722
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,000
Shut up!

723
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,130
You shut up!

724
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,240
You too.

725
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,890
Shut up!

726
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,120
Why did you bring me here?

727
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,890
This is Lingzhou.

728
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,160
It will always be.

729
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,870
Whether it belongs to Xian

730
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
or Nanlyu,

731
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,320
it will never change

732
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
its original appearance.

733
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
In fact,

734
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
you are the mastermind

Mr. Luo tried to take the blame

738
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,830
and said that he colluded with

739
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,950
Su Errong.

740
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,410
In fact, he was covering for you

741
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,530
and trying to pin
everything on the Su family.

742
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,600
He would rather die

743
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,000
to protect you.

744
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,100
Everyone in their position

745
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,060
has their own burdens

746
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,050
and purposes.

747
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,120
Mr. Luo did it for Nanlyu.

748
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,530
Su Errong did it for his family.

749
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,200
From their different perspectives,

750
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
how do we judge right from wrong?

751
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,820
What about you?

752
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,360
Why are you doing this?

753
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,720
Money?

754
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,800
Interests?

755
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,760
Or selfish desires?

756
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
Look.

757
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,600
They say if you make a sincere wish

758
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,320
when you see a sky lantern,

759
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,740
it'll come true.

760
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,990
Do you have a wish, Fourth Miss?

761
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,370
No matter what you want,

762
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,950
I will find it for you

763
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,200
even if it's in mountains, rivers,
distant lands or the ends of the earth.

764
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,440
A few days ago,

765
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
Lingzhou City was
the most prosperous place

766
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
in Xian.

767
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,920
People in Lingzhou City
are good at business

768
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
and hospitable.

769
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,440
Even at night,

770
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,760
the city remained lively
as if it were daytime.

771
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,360
But ever since Nanlyu invaded,

772
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,020
the people have shut themselves indoors.

773
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,700
Trade has come to a halt.

774
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
All I want

775
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,040
is to withdraw your army from Xian

776
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,690
and return Lingzhou to
its former vitality.

777
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,960
Can you grant me this wish?

778
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,850
I promise.

779
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,540
After tonight,

780
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,200
Lingzhou will be more prosperous

781
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,320
than ever.

782
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,160
I will never

783
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
hurt the people in Lingzhou.

784
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,540
No condition?

785
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
I want you to come back to Nanlyu with me.

786
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,410
When we return to the Nanlyu Royal Family,

787
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,400
you will still be the Princess Consort,

788
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
with even greater honor,

789
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,740
status, and power.

790
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,470
I am a Princess Consort.

791
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,790
And I have

792
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,280
only one husband.

793
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,520
The God of War of Xian.

794
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,190
Prince of Dingbei, Jiang Xu.

795
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,600
I know.

796
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,670
It's asking too much

797
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,890
to expect you to change

798
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,980
and accept all this overnight.

799
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,970
But I can wait.

800
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,010
Bah!

801
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,460
What kind of woman is Yun Yi?

802
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,570
In the battle with Jinyun Guards,

803
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,370
she beat Zhuifeng so badly,

804
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,550
the Prince almost couldn't recognize him.

805
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,080
She's tougher than any man.

806
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,040
That's because Zhuifeng is
not as good as others.

807
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,020
What does it have to do with Miss Yun?

808
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,620
Why are you bringing this up?

809
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,400
Just tell me if you want to embarrass me.

810
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,080
I haven't even mentioned

811
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,020
that when you joined the Jinyun Guards,

812
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,970
you have hidden in your quilt

813
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,590
and cried like a girl

814
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,520
for half a month.

815
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
Like a girl?

816
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,210
You men never cried in your lives?

817
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,550
You've been smiling since you were born?

818
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,180
You're right.

819
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,600
I've been smiling since I was young.

820
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,640
I've been smiling since I was born.

821
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,360
What? I said so.

822
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,160
I laughed when I slept.

823
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,760
I've been smiling since I was a kid.

824
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,440
You're being unreasonable.

825
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,520
I was laughing when I went to the toilet.

826
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,000
Fine, hit me.

827
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,440
I'll laugh.

828
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,240
Hit me. Hit me.

829
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,760
Hit me!

830
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,360
Stop arguing!

831
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,090
Shut up or I'll chop you all off!

832
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,650
It's you.

833
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,250
It's not me. I don't know martial arts.

834
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,270
Go!

835
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
Impossible.

836
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,570
Greetings, General.

837
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,850
Open the city gate.
