Everyone,

10
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,190
follow me to fight our way out.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,450
Join forces with the Yangxi Prefecture,

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,450
and kill the enemy together!

13
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Yes, sir!

Let go!

Don't hurt her!

20
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,470
Put down your sword!

21
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,850
Stand back!

Let go.

28
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,000
Your Highness.

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
I order you to let go!

30
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
No.

31

I'm afraid I can't
obey your order, Your Highness.

32
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,520
My duty is to

33
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,810
protect Your Highness.

34
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,670

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
please leave now.

42
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,890

We have no way out.

45
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,280
Alright.

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
No matter what,

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,640
I will accompany Your Highness

48

It's just...

50
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
It's just that Your Highness has ended up

in such a predicament today

00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,460
all because of her!

with no place to shelter,

60
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,490
and lost you too.

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200

[Feng's Mansion]

66
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,130
Let go of me.

Where are you taking me?

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,620
Your Grace.

69
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,960
What?

70
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,560
You've reduced me to this state.

71
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,520
Isn't that enough?

72
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,330
You even came here to mock me.

73
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,340
Now you've seen it.

74
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,900
Are you satisfied now?

75
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,330
Chu, you and I

76
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,380
are both daughters of the Ming family,

77
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,980
both born of the same father.

78
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,610
We're bonded by blood.

79
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
If I wanted to harm you,

80
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,680
or come here

81
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,180
to mock you,

82
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,700
what would I gain?

83
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
At this point,

84
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
there's no need

85
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,280
for such pretense between us.

86
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,890
There's no outsiders here.

87
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,550
You don't need to act anymore.

88
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,370
We've been at odds since childhood,

89
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,160
but no matter how awkward
or conflicted we've been,

90
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,400
it's nothing more than

91
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,460
some trivial matters between girls.

92
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,540
Even if it's all laid bare,

93
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,540
it's not worth mentioning at all.

94
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,160
But this smuggling case

95
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,480
concerns the Ming family's reputation

96
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480
and Father's innocence.

97
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,000
If you get involved,

98
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
it's not only detrimental to yourself,

99
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
but also to both
the Ming and Feng families.

100
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,520
You must understand

101
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
the stakes involved.

102
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,510
Why do you have to act on impulse

103
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,440
and hurt your own people?

104
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,520
Ming Chu,

105
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,680
I'm sorry for the hardship
you've endured these days.

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,340
But neither Father nor I meant

107
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,120
to punish you.

108
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,920
Now that you've
married into the Feng family,

109
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,230
you are one of us.

110
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,080
The entire Feng family shares both glory

111
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,460
and misfortune.

112
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,540
If you continue to be stubborn,

113
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,390
you'll only hurt

114
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
yourself in the end.

115
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
But if she hadn't targeted me

116
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,140
and always tried to outdo me,

117
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,870
would I have ended up like this?

118
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,760
If you truly can't stand to see me well,

119
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,160
you might as well return to the capital

120
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
and be your princess.

121
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,650
The two of us

122
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,290
will have nothing to do with each other.

123
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,250
Ming Chu.

124
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,280
Is this truly what you want,

125
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Chu?

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,280
As you said,

127
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,410
I could've returned to the capital

128
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,210
without regard for your future.

129
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,620
Then why would I come

130
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
all this way to see you?

131
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,280
Chu,

132
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,090
I hope you can live well

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,520
and our Ming family will be well.

134
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,260
I sincerely wish for you

135
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,880
to live the life you want.

136
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,400
Chu, you are so beautiful.

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,670
As a daughter of the Ming family,

138
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,400
you must never lose your grace.

139
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,730
Let me help you with your makeup.

140
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,240
Chu, you may not know,

141
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,360
there's someone who always

142
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,400
worries for you,

143
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,710
wondering if you're

144
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,950
happy and doing well.

145
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,160
If he saw

146
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,480
you like this,

147
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
he would be heartbroken.

148
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
Fa-Father.

149
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,090
Father!

150
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,560
How could this be?

151
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,590
Chu.

152
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,520
Alright.

153
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,520
It's all over now. Look.

154
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,730
Look.

155
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm doing just fine.

156
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,210
Don't worry.

157
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,130
Chu,

158
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,330
I know that

159
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,330
you grew up in Yangxi Prefecture,

160
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,320
with a straightforward personality,

161
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
unwilling to suffer any wrong.

162
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,870
But deep down,

163
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,600
your have a good heart.

164
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,190
Don't let a moment of impulse

165
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,960
ruin your entire life.

166
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,760
As long as you're willing,

167
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,450
the Ming family,

168
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,680
Father,

169
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,760
and I

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,880
will all be your support.

171
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,560
Ming Chu,

172
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,640
if you miss Father in the future,

173
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I'll go back to the capital with you.

174
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,840
Father, please rest assured,

175
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,880
I will

176
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,150
certainly treat

177
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,660
Ming Chu well as always.

178
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,640
Father,

179
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,710
I know I was wrong.

180
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,010
Alright, get up.

181
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Being able to see you again,

182
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
that's all that matters.

183
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,570
From now on,

184
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,650
I won't disappoint you again.

185
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,150
I believe you.

186
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,960
Your Majesty,

187
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,140
what a fine shot.

188
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
Your Majesty's arrows never miss,

189
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,160
hitting the spot every time.

190
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm ashamed to compare.

191
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,460
General Guo, your strategy is brilliant.

192
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,920
Having the army strike overnight

193
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,250
and seize the outposts.

194
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,720
The Imperial Guards at the hunting
grounds received no warning,

195
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,610
so they're completely unprepared.

196
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,810
Pass down the order:

197
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,540
If a military horn is heard
within three quarters of an hour,

198
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,940
the army is to halt at once

199
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,580
and await my new orders.

200
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,520
If not heard,

201
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,920
the original order stands—

202
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,120
Wipe out the hunting ground

203
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,780
and strile the imperial tent.

204
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,390
Yes, sir.

205
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,230
If we could capture His Majesty,

206
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,270
Yangxi Prefecture would easily

207
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,530
achieve unprecedented merit.

208
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,700
Those of you who lead the charge

209
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,360
will be especially meritorious

210
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,290
and richly rewarded and promoted.

211
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
We pledge our lives to follow you.

212
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,480
Kill!

213
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,890
Kill!

214
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,319
Protect His Majesty!

215
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,800
No! It's a trap!

216
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,800
Retreat!

217
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,900
Retreat.

218
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,070
The wind turns against us!

219
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,300
Fall back with the wind, quickly!

220
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,920
Yes!

221
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
Now, His Majesty

222
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,080
has only Lu Ting by his side.

223
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
If we capture Lu Ting,

224
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,040
we can win without fighting.

225
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,520
Pursue!

226
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,860
Let's go!

227
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,730
Clear the hunting grounds
and attack the imperial tent!

228
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,190
Your Majesty,

229
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,210
the main force from Yangxi Prefecture

230
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,480
is advancing towards our camp.

231
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,170
Following Your Majesty's plan,

232
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,080
we've already defeated
two of Guo Bingmao's troops.

233
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
However, their main force

234
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
is still overwhelming

235
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,140
compared to the Imperial Guards.

236
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,560
All of you, follow me to meet the enemy.

237
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,950
We'll fight

238
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,960
to the death against traitors!

239
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,020
Yes, Your Majesty!

240
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,020
Kill!

241
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,040
Kill!

242
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,760
Guo Bingmao,

243
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
you've conspired with traitors
to plot against us.

244
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
Have you considered your own fate?

245
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,820
You're just a homeless cur.

246
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,680
How dare you speak to me like this?

247
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,220
Your Majesty!

248
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,960
Kill!

249
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,700
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

250
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,760
I apologize for arriving too late.

251
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,190
As long as you're here, it's not too late.

252
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,210
Today,

253
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,610
I will act on behalf of my father-in-law

254
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,760
to thoroughly purge Yangxi Prefecture.

255
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,690
Dingbei Army!

256
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,500
Yes!

257
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,840
Kill!

258
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,590
Rebels committing treason!

259
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,010
The country is in peril!

260
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,620
All of you, follow me
to protect His Majesty!

261
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,960
Eliminate the traitors!

262
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,410
Fight to the death!

263
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,190
Yes, sir!

264
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,940
What about the Dingbei Army?

265
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,240
They're hopelessly outnumbered.

266
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,480
Like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

267
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,470
This battle—

268
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,040
Yangxi Prefecture will surely win!

269
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,570
Attrition warfare!

270
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,940
The Dingbei Army is

271
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,530
underestimating our Yangxi Prefecture.

272
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,350
With just one elite force,

273
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,440
you think you can turn the tide?

274
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,520
Send word to the rear guard—

275
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,870
Surround the camp tightly.

276
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,840
Yes, sir!

277
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
Without the Marquis of Jing'an,

278
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,210
Yangxi Prefecture is

279
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,890
nothing but a paper tiger.

280
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,300
You only know how to win by sheer numbers.

281
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,580
It's true that an incompetent general

282
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,220
can doom the whole army.

283
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,270
Very well.

284
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,870
I'd like to see

285
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,360
how the Dingbei Army breaks through today!

286
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,370
Kill!

287
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,330
[Quiet and Still]

288
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,490
Chancellor,

289
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,700
do you have any last words?

290
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,500
When did you

291
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,680
join my service?

292
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,780
Fifteen years ago.

293
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,810
For these fifteen years,

294
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,160
I helped you escape from the mire,

295
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,230
taught you strategy and warfare,

296
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,860
and paved your path to power.

297
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,040
Without me,

298
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,280
you would've been ordinary

299
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,520
or died in exile.

300
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,320
That would be better than
being deceived and used,

301
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,460
taking the blame for the murderer

302
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,940
who killed my father.

303
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,130
It seems

304
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,560
years of nurturing

305
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,360
and care

306
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,520
still can't outweigh

307
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
a few slanders.

308
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,040
Are you truly clear about

309
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,740
who you should seek
revenge for your father?

310
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,920
What others say may not be true,

311
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,600
but Mr. Si's words

312
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,940
cannot be fabricated.

313
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,480
It was he who, by your order,

314
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,140
silenced my Father back then!

315
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,570
Things have come to this point.

316
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,300
Chancellor, no more false sympathy.

317
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,360
All these years,

318
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,760
both Mr. Si and I have

319
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,600
pledged our loyalty to you.

320
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,190
Our lives are yours.

321
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,200
We would even die for you.

322
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,290
However,

323
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,740
my father couldn't die in vain.

324
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,320
Although he was just a scout,

325
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
he was loyal his entire life.

326
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,520
I can't let him die a traitor, smeared

327
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,760
and wronged!

328
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,810
Once I avenge Father and clear his name,

329
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,090
this worthless life of mine

330
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,840
is yours to take.

331
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,520
All your martial arts skills
were taught by me!

332
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,250
Why make yourself suffer here?

333
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,230
Why not run far away

334
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,130
and start a new life?

335
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,210
If I don't avenge my father,

336
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,380
I'm unworthy of being his son!

337
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,960
To hear one's music is to know their heart,

338
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,690
and to resonate with each chord.

339
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,610
In that case,

340
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,440
I shall gift you this guqin.

341
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,970
May you one day, like the legends,

342
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,430
pluck strings like pines

343
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,050
in mountain winds, or silence them

344
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,540
more powerful than rain on Mount Tai.

345
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,570
Guo Bingmao has been captured!

346
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,120
If any from Yangxi Prefecture
still resist,

347
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,520
execute them on the spot!

348
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,460
For those who surrender,

349
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,020
their families will be pardoned,

350
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,080
spared from collective punishment!

351
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,840
Your Majesty,

352
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,970
Guo Bingmao is here.

353
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,180
Guo Bingmao,

354
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,330
do you admit your guilt?

355
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,600
Your Majesty,

356
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,120
I... I am guilty of a capital crime.

357
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,680
But...

358
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,480
but I was forced into this situation.

359
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,440
It was that traitor Su

360
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
who held my family hostage

361
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,680
to coerce me.

362
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,480
I truly had no other choice.

363
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,320
Then what about the incident in Lizhou?

364
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,050
Were you also forced by others?

365
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,480
Liu Mo has confessed

366
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,740
everything in prison.

367
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,520
The disaster relief scandal
involving the Marquis of Jing'an

368
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,920
was planned by you and Su Wenchun.

369
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,490
That's a false accusation!

370
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
Regarding the smuggling matter,

371
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,280
Princess Consort has thoroughly
investigated it in Lingzhou.

372
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,760
The real one behind
the smuggling and collusion

373
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,700
is the Su family,

374
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,610
not the Marquis of Jing'an.

375
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,680
Your ambiguous statements

376
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,410
in the Imperial Study back then

377
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,520
were clearly fabricated

378
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,140
to confuse the issue.

379
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,720
No, Your Majesty.

380
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,630
Please believe me!

381
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,560
It was the traitor Su.

382
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,280
It was him forcing me into this situation!

383
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,760
Your Majesty!

384
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Take him away.

385
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,210
Hand him over to the Court of Review

386
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,800
to be judged by law.

387
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

388
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,450
Your Majesty, please!

389
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,600
Your Majesty, please believe me!

390
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
It was the traitor Su!

391
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,480
It was all Su's scheme!

392
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,240
Your Majesty!

393
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Your Majesty, please have mercy!

394
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,130
Xu,

395
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,900
this time,

396
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,630
we have finally won our bet.

397
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

398
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
If I had arrived a moment later today

399
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,159
and the Imperial Guards been defeated,

400
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,960
what were Your Majesty's plans?

401
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,900
To die heroically?

402
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,400
To sacrifice yourself for the country?

403
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,370
Your Highness,

404
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,310
I tried to dissuade His Majesty,

405
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,600
but His Majesty
insisted on going personally,

406
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,480
saying

407
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,199
only by attending the hunt himself

408
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,400
would the traitors

409
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,360
fall into the trap

410
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,580
without suspicion.

411
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,489
Xu, don't listen to him.

412
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,480
I just believed

413
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
that you could surely turn the tide.

414
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,310
See?

415
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,400
Everything

416
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,520
turned out fine, right?

417
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,980
What else did
Your Majesty expect to happen?

418
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,480
Your Majesty!

419
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Majesty!

420
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,639
News has come from the palace.

421
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,739
The Empress Dowager has

422
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
hanged herself in Shoukang Palace.

423
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,920
[One month later]

424
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,270
Xu.

425
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,210
Xu.

426
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,400
I just told you so much.

427
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,730
Did you take it all in?

428
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,840
I did.

429
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,840
I feel like when
the Princess Consort is away,

430
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,310
you lose all sense of time,

431
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,200
even forgetting about

432
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,130
the matters concerning the court.

433
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,000
Is that so?

434
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,260
Has the Princess Consort

435
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,780
been near the capital?

436
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,840
I just calculated this morning.

437
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,520
She'll arrive in the next day or two.

tomorrow or the day after?

496
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,040
I missed you,

497
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,320
so I told them

498
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,650
to speed up the journey.

499
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,380
After such a long trip,

500
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,400
are you tired?

501
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,850
Yes, a bit tired.

502
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,870
But seeing you

503
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
makes it all worthwhile.

504
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,800
You've suffered much

505
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,360
on this journey.

506
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,720
When we return home, you should rest well

507
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,040
and eat some good food

508
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,480
to replenish your strength.

509
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,940
I wouldn't say I suffered.

510
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,240
In fact, I feel

511
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,260
this journey was very beneficial.

512
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,920
I not only strengthened my resolve,

513
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,250
broadened my horizons,

514
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,460
but also learned about
the greater good of our country.

515
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
In this short time,

516
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,680
I've gained more than I did

517
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,010
in over a decade before.

518

If I don't bring you along,

521
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm afraid I'll be too homesick every day

522
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,440
to get anything done.

523
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,620

528
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,450

What time is it? She's still not up?

558
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,620
I'll go wake her up.

It's His Highness's order.

00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,650
Your Highness,

571
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
I humbly request your guidance.

572
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,910
Get lost.

573
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,680
Xu,

574
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,140
don't be so stingy.

575
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,630
Just say a couple of words.

576
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,200
One word.

577
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
One word would do.

578
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Before you got married,

579
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
what exactly did you prepare in advance?

580
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,120
How did you prepare for it?

581
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,230
Were you nervous at that time?

582
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,760
And how did you deal with it?

583
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,790
I remember,

584
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,120
when I got married,

585
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,520
you taught me quite a bit,

586
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,100
claiming to have a lot of experience.

587
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,620
What's the matter now?

588
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,960
Things have changed.

589
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,680
Besides,

590
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,440
my so-called experience pales

591
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,840
in comparison to what you've gone through.

592
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,360
The national mourning
will last for three years.

593
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,600
Your wedding date is still far off.

594
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,520
Who knows if there
might be changes in between?

595
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:34,990
Stop.

596
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,320
There will be absolutely no changes.

597
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,850
No changes will be allowed.

598
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,600
There is a proper process
to betrothal and marriage.

599
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,060
Why are you in such a hurry?

600
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
I just feel that weddings in the capital

601
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,930
are all the same.

602
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
So I'm thinking of

603
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,720
adding some of my own ideas to it.

604
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,880
Not only will it surprise Minmin then,

605
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,010
but it will also show

606
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,640
how much care I've put in.

607
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,720
Sir,

608
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,040
His Majesty has issued an edict.

609
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,920
All owed military stipends

610
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,820
for the Dingbei Army

611
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,020
over the past years will be paid in full.

612
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,360
Official duties have piled up
in the Capital Garrison.

613
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,560
I don't have time for idle chat with you.

614
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,060
Miss Bai is now in the mansion.

615
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,610
Young Lord Zhang,
aren't you going to see her?

616
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,040
She's here?

617
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,660
Then Tan won't have any peace.

618
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,360
I saw these at a glassware stall.

619
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,190
These earrings caught my eyes.

620
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,930
Elegant in color and lively in design.

621
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,330
I thought they'd suit you perfectly.

622
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,120
I knew you

623
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,160
would think of me.

624
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Was Lingzhou fun?

625
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,590
Yes.

626
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,440
Not only fun, but also great
for food and shopping.

627
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,150
Then next time you travel far,

628
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,520
you must take me with you.

629
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
I'd love to,

630
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,790
but Young Lord Zhang

631
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,300
won't come looking for trouble, will he?

632
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,800
Oh, right.

633
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,620
Wentao Pavilion has a new storybook out.

634
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,550
When you're free, I'll go with you.

635
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,610
Wonderful, I'd love that.

636
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,120
If Tan wishes to go,

637
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,960
I'll accompany her myself.

638
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,680
Since when has Your Highness been

639
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,560
interested in storybooks?

640
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,400
Tan,

641
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,800
why don't we go shopping

642
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
when you're free?

643
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,640
Li's shop has just released

644
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,880
a new persimmon pastry.

645
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,140
It's quite delicious.

646
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,520
-I was thinking...
-Persimmons are bad for the stomach.

647
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,080
You shouldn't eat too much.

648
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Why don't you take these gifts

649
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,320
back with you?

650
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,080
So you can take your time.

651
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,000
I... I...

652
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,480
Tan, are you tired?

653
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,740
I'm not tired.

654
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,560
Would you like some snacks?

655
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,870
I'm not hungry yet.

656
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,830
It's better to have some prepared.

657
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,800
Suxin.

658
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,840
Yes.

659
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,420
Tan.

660
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,560
Turn around.

661
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,710
Turn around.

662
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,040
Turn around.

663
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Tan,

664
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,610
has he been possessed or something?

665
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:57,490
He...

666
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
Is he making excuses to eat snacks?

667
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,360
If all men are this fussy after marriage,

668
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,680
I'd rather not get married.

669
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,330
You can't say that.

670
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,470
Everyone is different.

671
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,160
I'm different from Xu.

672
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,920
Xu is used to being unromantic.

673
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,440
You can't compare him to me.

674
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,860
You... I...
