00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,010
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,320
I heard

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
the Empress Dowager is seeking candidates

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,979
to select a concubine for you.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,910
How did you come to know this?

7
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,310
Her Majesty summoned Yu

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
to Changchun Palace a few days ago

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,900
and brought up the matter.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
She clearly wanted Yu
to pass the message to you

11
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
so you could be prepared.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,539
How do you plan to handle this?

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,300
The Empress Dowager's
intentions are obvious.

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,720
But she's using the excuse

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
of securing your family's lineage.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,840
How could you refuse that?

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
If I want to refuse, I need no reason.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,280
Such a strong rejection

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,160
might be seen as disrespecting her goodwill.

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,720
Then it becomes your fault.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Absurd.

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,120
Everything I do is for the my household,

23
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,960
for His Majesty,

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,320
and for the people of this nation.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
What fault is there in that?

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,720
Your Highness is truly selfless,

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,710
sacrificing much
for the country and its people.

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,210
But the household is thin in heirs.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,340
If you don't extend the line soon,

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,640
how can you nurture someone

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,520
as capable as yourself for the court?

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
Tan, so you already know.

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
I... I'm fine.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,800
This is Your Highness's regular medicine,

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,079
most effective.

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,740
These surface wounds

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,620
should heal within a few days.

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,900
Then you can

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
once again focus on

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,620
your duty to continue the royal line.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,340
Her Highness is so meticulous,

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,400
even remembering
His Highness's usual remedy.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
The one truly meticulous

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,970
is someone else.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
How would I know

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,079
what His Highness has used for years?

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,500
Even a simple gift
from afar carries deep feeling.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,620
Your Highness,

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
please don't let that sentiment go to waste.

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,650
When Her Highness
heard Your Highness were hurt,

51
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,970
she was frantic.

52
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,420
She rushed here right away.

53
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,960
This is what deep affection
between husband and wife

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,360
is...

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Is truly about.

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,320
Yes, yes.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I also heard

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,550
that the Empress Dowager wants to
choose a concubine for Your Highness.

59
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,910
And I share that view.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
While you're recovering

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
in the residence,

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
why not let me

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,340
carefully select
a few good families for your consideration?

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,980
Then you can make the final decision.

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,320
The Empress Dowager's intent is clear.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,560
I will deal with it in my own way.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
Your Highness will have
to take a concubine eventually.

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,120
Rather than let the Empress Dowager
force someone in,

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,160
why not choose someone

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
you actually favor?

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Rest assured,

72
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,960
I will choose a young lady

73
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,240
from a good family

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,920
with all the right qualities,

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,300
preferably someone even better than me.

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,720
But to have such a fine girl

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
as a mere concubine

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,040
would be quite the injustice.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Once she bears an heir for Your Highness,

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,230
you could petition
to make her the principal wife.

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,290
That wouldn't be out of the question.

82
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
What do you mean by this, Tan?

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Does His Highness's
injury need herbal decoctions?

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
How long before

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
he can bathe again?

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Take good care of yourself, Your Highness.

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
I won't disturb you further.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll visit again another day.

89
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,660
Second Young Master Shu, please stay.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,160
The medicine's delivered,

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,820
so I should be the one to leave.

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,540
Your Highness.

93
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,580
I... I'll walk Her Highness out.

94
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,310
Your Highness, slow down.

95
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,130
What's wrong with Her Highness?

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Qizhi,

97
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,860
how did you offend her?

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,590
I just took a flogging on her behalf.

99
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,450
What more could I have done wrong?

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,680
There are things I shouldn't say...

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Then don't say them.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,200
I must.

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
For your sake, Qizhi,

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
I must.

105
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,680
You must understand:

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,320
only with tolerance
can we accommodate others,

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
and only with depth can we bear weight.

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,800
Flowers need rain and dew,

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
and women need gentleness and care.

110
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,940
If Her Highness is upset,

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
she has her reasons.

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,950
Women often overthink and doubt.

113
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
Bad moods are natural.

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,530
And if there's blame to go around,

115
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,290
it falls on us men.

116
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Qizhi,

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,100
you must learn to be understanding.

118
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,660
Develop a heart vast as Mount Tai,

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,090
broad as rivers that accept every stream.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't ask for reasons,

121
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,830
don't argue right or wrong.

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
Just offer a sincere apology.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
It'll smooth things over

124
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,710
and dispel any discord.

125
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,150
What nonsense.

126
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,040
You don't even have a woman

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,960
close to you.

128
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
What right do you have to lecture me?

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,300
These were wise words from my father.

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,680
That's all I have to say.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Take care of yourself, Qizhi.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
I'll visit another time.

133
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,670
Hey, wait...

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,159
No need to see me out.

135
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm not the one who's injured.

136
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,600
Sir, bear with it.

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,440
When did

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

139
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,610
gain such a girl?

140
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,220
Chai Gui,

141
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,120
take this to His Highness while it's hot.

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,919
-Hurry.
-Yes.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait.

144
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,610
What's His Highness meal today?

145
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,790
This West River stew,

146
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,660
and this Yunmeng pork,

147
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,480
his favorites.

148
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,320
His Highness is seriously injured.

149
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
He should watch his diet.

150
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,650
Heavy meat,

151
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,400
high salt, greasy dishes,

152
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,140
none are good for recovery.

153
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Your Highness,

154
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,970
external wounds

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
only require avoiding alcohol and spice.

156
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,920
It's not like

157
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,380
he can't touch meat at all.

158
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,370
A balanced diet of meat and vegetables

159
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,330
is best for healing.

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll prepare a proper meal plan

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
for the kitchen to follow.

162
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
His Highness risked it all,

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
flying into a rage for Her Highness's sake.

164
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Such love,

165
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
even Heaven bears witness.

166
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,750
But still, that thing he did

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
was too reckless.

168
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,410
Even I couldn't bear to watch.

169
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,680
Still, rest assured, Your Highness,

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
everyone in the mansion

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,880
is on your side.

172
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,120
To us, there is only one true mistress

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,760
of this household,

174
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
and that's you.

175
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Isn't that right?

176
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,070
You may all go.

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Sir,

178
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,330
it's time to eat.

179
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Is the mansion tight on money lately?

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,010
Her...

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Have Concubine Yun

182
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
deliver this to His Highness later.

183
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
He's injured.

184
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,430
A calming scent

185
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,730
will help him sleep.

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,250
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,840
I'd say Your Highness

188
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,800
has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

189
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,020
He did get hurt because of me, after all.

190
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,440
I just don't want to owe him anything.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Yes.

192
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,900
Your Highness,

193
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
there are many new trinkets

194
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,560
and ornaments on South Yuhe Street.

195
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,820
Why not go for a stroll?

196
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,490
Getting out and about

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,290
is surely better than
moping around the mansion.

198
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,580
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

199
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,930
Your Highness, where are you heading?

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Madam Yun, such recklessness and disrespect

201
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
is completely improper.

202
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,320
So what if you know martial arts?

203
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
Does that make you superior?

204
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Since you've entered
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

205
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,840
you ought to follow
the rules and observe proper conduct.

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,370
If you offend Her Highness,

207
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,130
can you bear the consequences?

208
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,290
Enough. Let her be.

209
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,730
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

210
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,480
Madam Yun, how can you
be so ignorant of protocol?

211
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,210
Do you even see
the Her Highness as your superior?

212
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,050
I see no one above Her Highness.

213
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,510
Then are you aware

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,160
according to proper customs and etiquette,

215
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,400
a concubine may not

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
share a carriage

217
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,080
with the Prince and Princess Consort,

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480
unless explicitly permitted.

219
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm aware.

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
And yet you act so brazenly?

221
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,660
This was His Highness's instruction.

222
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,860
He said that if Her Highness goes out,

223
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,720
I must not leave her side.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,730
Is this meant as a show of force,

225
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,780
or are you trying
to force me to acknowledge her?

226
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
Well then,

227
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,430
since it's His Highness's command,

228
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,330
let Concubine Yun come along,

229
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,050
so others won't accuse me

230
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,830
of being petty

231
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,990
and unable to tolerate a concubine.

232
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,840
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

233
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
Miss, have a look at our fans.

234
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,120
All handcrafted.

235
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,730
This one is elegant and understated.

236
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,630
This one is dignified and graceful.

237
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,490
Each has its own charm.

238
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
Which one do you like?

239
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

240
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,160
I don't usually use fans.

241
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,880
And there's no reason for the Princess

242
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,410
to buy a fan for a concubine.

243
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,740
How could Madam Yun
be so unaware of her place?

244
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,480
How long does she intend to follow us?

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,780
With her tailing us like this,

246
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,760
it just feels off.

247
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,290
What feels off?

248
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,110
I can't quite explain.

249
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,330
In any case,

250
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,890
find an excuse to
send her back to the mansion.

251
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,450
I want some time alone.

252
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,960
You've already shared
Her Highness's carriage,

253
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,560
and followed along this far.

254
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
You should return now, Madam Yun.

255
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Her Highness hasn't returned yet.

256
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
How could I go ahead of her?

257
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
If something happens to her,

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
what then?

259
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,600
You being here would cause more danger.

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,930
What do you mean by that?

261
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,060
Can't you tell, Madam Yun?

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,220
Her Highness doesn't want to see you.

263
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,910
Why doesn't

Just earlier, Her Highness

285
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,160
went to South Yuhe Street

286
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,760

On the battlefield, food is often scarce.

goes nowhere else.

307
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,840

314
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,440
Didn't you say

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,480

I am Liu Mo, Vice Minister of Revenue.

320
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,840
Didn't expect

321
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,420
to run into Your Highness here.

322
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Who is that?

323
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,520
Her Highness didn't seem

324
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,640
to know him.

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,330
Her Highness's matters

326
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,460
aren't your concern, Concubine.

327
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,210
We're all part
of the household. It's only right.

328
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,320
Who says that?

329
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,310
Vice Minister Liu. How do you know me?

330
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,220
Your Highness,

331
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
have you truly forgotten me?

332
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,480
You've brought this guqin
for repair dozens of times.

333
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,680
It really can't be fixed anymore.

334
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
Perhaps it's time to replace it.

335
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
Once I pass the Spring Imperial Exam

336
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,280
and receive a salary, I'll buy a new one.

337
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,360
Mr. Fang.

338
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,390
Please continue to care

339
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,280
for my Fourth Miss's guqin personally.

340
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
Of course.

341
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,880
As it happens,

342
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,020
Fourth Miss, the one
you ordered last time has arrived.

343
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,340
Much appreciated.

344
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,870
This really is a fine instrument.

345
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,540
Sir,

346
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,280
do you have

347
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,420
any used guqin at a lower price?

348
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,240
We only sell new ones here.

349
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,620
But if you're serious,

350
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll keep an eye out.

351
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,920
Can't say when one will appear though.

352
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,440
Thank you, sir.

353
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Oh.

354
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,840
If it's not too much trouble,

355
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,700
I could help around the shop,
run errands, odd jobs,

356
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,760
and use the wages
to offset the price of a new guqin.

357
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,920
Would that be acceptable?

358
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Well…

359
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,680
Young Master, might I have the honor

360
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,890
of hearing you play?

361
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm afraid my guqin is too damaged.

362
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,770
You might be disappointed.

363
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,280
Suxin,

364
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
fetch my guqin.

365
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
Catalpa wood, Fuxi style,

366
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
lacquered smooth as oil.

367
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,010
Young Miss, if you don't mind,

368
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,450
I shall humbly perform.

369
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,900
You truly are devoted to the guqin.

370
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
How can a guqin lover be without one?

371
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,410
Here, consider this guqin a gift from me,

372
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,660
as a token of shared passion.

373
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,230
To play this guqin is already my fortune.

374
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
But I dare not

375
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,880
accept such a generous gift.

376
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
Your kindness

377
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,440
will stay with me.

378
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,690
Farewell.

379
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,130
Young Master. Please wait.

380
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,830
My lady has a new guqin now.

381
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,560
This old one

382
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,600
will only collect dust on the shelf.

383
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Please take it,

384
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,480
treat it with care.

385
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,380
Let it be your memento
of this melody you shared.

386
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,810
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

387
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,240
To hear one's music is to know their heart,

388
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,040
and to resonate with each chord.

389
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,530
That one song just now

390
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,360
proves you have the talent of Bo Ya.

391
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,340
May you one day, like the legends,

392
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,160
pluck strings like pines

393
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,090
in mountain winds, or silence them

394
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,030
more powerful than rain on Tai Mountain.

395
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,440
One should not
receive reward without merit.

396
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,000
I cannot

397
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
accept such a gift lightly, Young Miss.

398
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
Earlier, hearing your tune

399
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,410
was like witnessing
all the beauty under heaven.

400
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,250
Exchanging a guqin for a song,

401
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,890
clearly, I got the better deal.

402
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,450
To hear one's music is to know their heart,

403
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,320
and to resonate with each chord.

404
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,760
Miss Ming,

405
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,320
surely you know

406
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,180
the second half of that poem goes:

407
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
“Cease lamenting Heaven's melody,

408
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,440
let it join

409
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,490
our hearts in harmony.”

410
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
That was never my intention.

411
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,020
Vice Minister Liu,

412
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,520
you're stretching the meaning too far.

413
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,840
The gift of the guqin back then

414
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,500
was a gesture of passing fate.

415
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,930
As for that matter,

416
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,860
I've long put it behind me.

417
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,810
To you, it was a passing gesture,

418
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,700
but to me, it's remained unforgettable.

419
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,650
Vice Minister Liu, mind your words.

420
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,300
I am already married,
a woman with a husband,

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,820
the Princess Consort of Prince of Dingbei.

422
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,640
The one I entrust my life to

423
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,660
is none other than
my husband, Prince of Dingbei.

424
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
I ask you, Vice Minister Liu,

425
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,440
to put an end to these deluded thoughts.

426
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,770
Show some respect.

427
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,660
This scent...

428
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,360
I know I am unworthy of you, Miss Ming.

429
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,070
All I hope

430
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,100
is for your safety and well-being.

431
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,530
We barely know each other.

432
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
We're strangers in passing.

433
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,850
Vice Minister Liu, don't you think

434
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,610
these words are

435
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,330
rather presumptuous and inappropriate?

436
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,060
More than just inappropriate.

437
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,730
Vice Minister Liu, what is the meaning

438
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,270
of pestering my Princess Consort?

439
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,670
Your Highness, don't jump to conclusions.

440
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,510
If I am misunderstood, so be it.

441
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,710
But don't wrongly accuse the Princess.

442
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
Tan has always been above reproach.

443
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,190
It's others

444
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,250
who may harbor hidden intentions.

445
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,400
Tonight, I...

446
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,300
I don't care

447
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,490
why you're here.

448
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,260
Tan's safety

449
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,220
is the responsibility of the palace guards.

450
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,190
And her future,

451
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,430
will be protected by me alone.

452
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
I suggest you

453
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,610
know your place.

454
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,670
Why are you upset today?

455
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,370
You know the answer.

456
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,200
You and Vice Minister Liu

457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,970
ran into each other by chance earlier?

458
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,020
If you ever see him again,

459
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,810
you'd better avoid him.

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,310
Vice Minister Liu and I

461
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,440
knew each other in the past.

462
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,640
A brief encounter and a few words.

463
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,910
It's quite normal.

464
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,600
Why should I avoid him?

465
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,610
From before?

466
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,570
That's right.

467
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,330
I met Vice Minister Liu

468
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,470
five years before I ever

469
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,560
met Your Highness.

470
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,050
Your meeting a man at night in private,

471
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,310
is that proper?

472
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,480
Me, meeting a man in private?

473
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Did you feel it improper

474
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,280
when you met with other women?

475
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,760
Official duties have
piled up in the Capital Garrison.

476
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,960
I work day and night.

477
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
How would I have time for secret meetings?

478
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,910
She's already entered your mansion,

479
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,840
and yet you still defend yourself?

480
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,800
Feeling guilty, are you?

481
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
Men are all the same.

482
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,020
And you, Jiang Qizhi,
you're the worst of them.

483
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,220
All your promises and vows,

484
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,170
nothing but lies.

485
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,900
So you are angry with me

486
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,650
because of Yun Yi?

487
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,290
Still acting?

488
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,700
You truly are a master of playing dumb.

489
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,040
Lately,

490
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,480
the Empress Dowager, citing the need

491
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,880
for heirs of our mansion,

492
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
planned to arrange a concubine for me.

493
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,280
So you just went along with it

494
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,930
and took in a concubine?

495
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,080
Why not go all the way

496
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,280
and bring Fengzhao

497
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,400
into the mansion too?

498
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,040
The Empress Dowager's been trying

499
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,160
to pair you two for ages.

500
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,200
That way,

501
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
you could fully enjoy

502
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,540
the blessings of many women.

503
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,760
I don't like a crowded household.

504
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,000
You say that, but...

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,660
Yun Yi is a secret guard of Jinyun Guards,

506
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,390
no less skilled than Zhuiying.

507
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
Bringing her in as a concubine

508
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,320
was to avoid the Empress Dowager's meddling

509
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,850
while also protecting your safety in secret.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,840
So...

511
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,770
She's not a real concubine?

512
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,230
She's just a secret guard?

513
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,110
And no one thought to tell me?

514
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,260
Why didn't you say so earlier?

515
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,820
You nearly had me

516
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,590
wrongfully suspect you.

517
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,510
Since it's a secret identity,

518
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,040
it couldn't be made public.

519
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,300
Yun Yi is a soldier

520
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,460
who follows orders.

521
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,840
When I told her to pose as a concubine

522
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,150
and keep it from everyone,

523
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,790
she kept the secret with her life.

524
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,100
Everyone?

525
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,350
Even me?

526
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,250
So I spent the whole day upset for nothing?

527
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

528
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,480
I thought

529
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,240
you took in a concubine

530
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,400
because you resented me

531
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,200
for what happened with Gao Chen.

532
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,480
When I heard Yun Yi

533
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,900
had been with you for many years,

534
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I was heartbroken for quite a while.

535
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,800
I already told you

536
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,960
I never held that against you.

537
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,570

This misunderstanding

541
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
is entirely your fault.

542
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,210

worth of porridge and cakes daily,

Clearly, you and your brother

744
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120

00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,770
our people hope.

748
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
Of course, we must do our part

749
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,100
and avoid adding unnecessary expenses.

750
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,900
This...

751
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,960
Roof repairs,

752
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,880
medical care,

753
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,200
firewood for various locations,

754
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,260
all require funds.

755
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,690
Take this first.

756
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,730
Record all expenses as they come.

757
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

758
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,650
I'll go check on the others up front.

759
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,330
By the way, Yun Yi,

760
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,740
why did you join the Jinyun Guards?

761
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,180
Isn't that job harsh?

762
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,200
It's not harsh.

763
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,200
I was orphaned and helpless since childhood.

764
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,840
I survived thanks to His Highness.

765
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,230
So I swore loyalty

766
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,130
to him for life.

767
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,420
But he told me,

768
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
once I entered the mansion,

769
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,570
he'd no longer be my master,

770
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,970
Your Highness would be.

771
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,850
You are your own person.

772
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,020
You don't need a master.

773
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,400
But Suxin and Lyu'e

774
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,440
both see you as theirs.

775
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,590
That's just their duty.

776
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,710
If one day

777
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,610
they find a good future elsewhere

778
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,810
and know

779
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,510
what kind of life they want,

780
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,830
I won't stop them.

781
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,530
As for me, I've got no one.

782
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
I'll follow Your Highness wherever you go.

783
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,440
[Capital]

784
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,580
Open the gates!

785
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,200
Marquis of Jing'an
failed in disaster relief!

786
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,560
He's negligent and careless!

787
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
He doesn't care if people live or die!

788
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,040
Don't push! Don't run!

789
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,760
We beg His Majesty to deliver justice.

790
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,680
Go report this to the officials.

791
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,040
Yes!

792
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,810
Everyone, come with me!

793
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,840
Xu!

794
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,020
Something's happened to Marquis of Jing'an!

795
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,360
How dare you!

796
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Is this

797
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,940
a charity hall sheltering refugees?

798
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,580
Are you from Lizhou?

799
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,980
Yes, yes, that's right.

800
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,720
Alright.

801
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Everyone, please

802
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,040
head to the tents to rest first.

803
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,300
Once we've finished registering your names,

804
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,020
I'll take you to receive your food.

805
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,000
-Let's go, let's go!
-Quickly!

806
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,480
-This way.

807
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,240
Let's go.

808
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,420
This is wonderful.

809
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,840
There's more if it's not enough!

810
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,040
Eat slowly, eat slowly.

811
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,760
You'll definitely have your fill.

812
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,420
Here you go.

813
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,130
There's more if you need it!

814
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,180
This is for you.

815
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,400
That's better now.

816
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,930
Greetings, Your Highness.

817
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,840
Everyone,

818
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,110
this is the Princess of Dingbei.

819
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,970
This relief hall

820
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,140
was built and funded by Her Highness.

821
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,060
The refugees from Lizhou

822
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,460
were also resettled thanks to her efforts.

823
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,410
Princess of Dingbei.

824
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,500
Isn't she the daughter
of the Marquis of Jing'an?

825
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,560
The daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an?

826
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,280
Thank you, Your Highness!

827
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,400
Thank you, Your Highness!

828
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,000
There's no need for all this.

829
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,830
The Marquis of Jing'an is my father.

830
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,530
He went to Lizhou for disaster relief,

831
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,990
and I couldn't be of much help.

832
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,440
So I'm simply doing
what little I can here in the capital.

833
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,820
If there's anything you need,

834
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,980
just let Jin Er know.

835
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
It was the Marquis of Jing'an

836
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,200
who left us homeless!

837
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,130
Relief? He did no such thing!

838
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,080
He brought ruin to the people!

839
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,900
That's right!

840
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,750
How can that be?

841
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,450
My father was sent
to Lizhou by imperial decree.

842
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,760
He would have done everything in his power

843
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,090
and put the people first.

844
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,800
There's no way it happened as you claim.

845
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,840
Why not?

846
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,490
The Marquis of Jing'an failed in his duties!

847
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,170
Many in Lizhou

848
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,440
died in vain!

849
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,560
My son was perfectly fine.

850
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,850
But the Marquis conscripted him

851
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,250
to help with the flood defense.

852
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,430
He was swept away by the floodwaters,

853
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,250
and we still haven't found his body.

854
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,990
Give me back my son!

855
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,810
Don't be rash!

856
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,680
Don't be rash!

857
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,000
Give me back my son!

858
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,130
Stay calm!

859
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,230
What right do you have?
