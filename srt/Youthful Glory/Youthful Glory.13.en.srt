00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,980
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,960
The first is the Five Rites,

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
the second is the Six Forms of Music,

5
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,160
the third is the Five Techniques
of Archery,

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
the fourth is the Five Techniques
of Horsemanship,

7
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,800
the fifth is the Six Styles
of Calligraphy,

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,880
and the sixth is the
Nine Arithmetical Operations.

9
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,960
The Nine Arithmetical Operations include

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
measuring farmland,
converting grain ratios,

11
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,180
calculating tax distribution,
measuring land dimensions...

12
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,960
Young Master Zhou...

13
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,160
Estimating earthworks,
calculating transport costs,

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
solving equations,
computing gains and losses...

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,020
Young Master Zhou!

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Young Master Zhou,

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,940
while he may fall short of
Jingran's peerless charm,

18
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,800
can still be considered handsome
and dignified.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,720
But the moment he opens his mouth,

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
he's like an old monk chanting sutras,

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,539
enough to put anyone to sleep.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Are you finished?

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,990
Miss Bai, since you interrupted me,

24
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,600
you must have something to say.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,199
I shall listen attentively.

26
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,639
May I ask if your visit today
for matchmaking

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,720
is of your own free will?

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,640
In matters of marriage,

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
one must obey one's parents' orders—

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,160
this is one of the three fundamental
principles of filial piety.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,720
I naturally came willingly

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,320
to show filial piety to my parents,
respect my elders,

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,020
and fulfill my family's expectations.

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,820
This is what you call "willing"?

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,670
Then, Young Master Zhou, how do you think

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,430
a marriage

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,520
should be managed after the wedding?

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,060
The way of husband and wife

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
is to follow the way of Heaven.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,320
Each performs his or her own duties.

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,560
That is, men handle external affairs,
while women handle domestic matters.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
Men should shoulder

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
the family responsibilities,

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,760
focusing on exams and official careers,

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
while women should serve
their parents-in-law,

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
raise children,

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,610
and ensure that their husbands
have no worries at home.

48
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,040
Thus, with husbands leading
and wives following,

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,930
this is truly the joy of life.

50
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,370
You are not the fish,

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,230
so how can you know the fish's joy?

52
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,800
Young Master Zhou, your so-called
joy in life

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,390
is merely imposing your own views
on others,

54
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,610
forcing them onto the "fish."

55
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,950
Zhang Huaiyu?

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,880
Let's go.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,330
Why are you here?

58
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,980
Just passing by while touring the garden.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,860
Suxin,

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,200
why did you bring Young Lord Zhang here?

61
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
If he disrupts

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,370
My Lady's matchmaking,

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
how am I supposed to explain this to

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,860
His Grace and Her Grace?

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,860
No.

66
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,750
I must go back and keep an eye on it.

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
Let me ask you,

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,440
why is Miss Minmin having
a matchmaking meeting today?

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
Naturally, it's to find
a suitable husband.

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Then that's all that matters.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,040
As for the husband,

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,560
it could be Young Master Zhou

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,290
or it could be Young Lord Zhang.

74
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,920
What matters most is
finding a suitable match.

75
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,320
Suitable?

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
Then just think of it as Miss Minmin

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
meeting with

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
two young masters today.

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Two young masters?

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,100
Greetings, Young Lord Zhang.

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I am Zhou Yanxi, the Vice Supervisor
of the Imperial Academy.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
What you said earlier was
quite reasonable.

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,160
However,

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,600
since you are not me,

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
how can you know whether I truly
understand the joy of fish?

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am not you; thus, I do not know.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
You are certainly not a fish;

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,260
therefore, you can't fully know
the joy of fish.

89
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,440
Following this logic,

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,290
I indeed do not know the joy of fish.

91
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,820
However, I know my own joy.

92
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,160
Isn't that acceptable?

93
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,040
Your joy

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
is not the joy of fish.

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,630
Do you know the joy of fish?

96
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,220
I happen to speak fish.

97
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,149
And I can tell this fish is unhappy.

98
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,470
What fish? What joy?

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,590
You two debate whether fish are happy,

100
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,440
yet I'm certainly not happy anyway.

101
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,310
I know you're not happy.

102
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,760
That's why I've come to rescue you.

103
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Young Master Zhou, please excuse us.

104
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
Miss Bai and I

105
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
still have business to discuss.

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,370
We'll take our leave first.

107
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm not leaving.

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,940
If you want to be happy, leave with me.

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,080
Young Lord Zhang

110
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,780
is truly interesting.

111
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,650
Zhang Huaiyu!

112
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,640
If you want to leave, then leave.

113
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,520
Why are you dragging me along with you?

114
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,080
You don't want to leave,

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
so you want to stay there
and continue matchmaking?

116
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,200
What's wrong with my meeting with men?

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
Nowadays, which young lady
waiting to be married

118
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,760
doesn't attend a matchmaking meeting
or two?

119
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Besides,

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,160
I think Young Master Zhou is quite good.

121
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,930
He's well-educated, reasonable, gentle,
and refined.

122
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,850
Unlike you,

123
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,080
who's rude and impolite

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,720
and doesn't know how to cherish a lady.

125
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,740
If I can't get married,

126
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,380
will you marry me?

127
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,300
I'll marry you!

128
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,960
No, I mean...

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Well...

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,320
I came to find you today

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,090
because I indeed have some business
to discuss with you.

132
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,800
Then, I'll get down to business directly.

133
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,980
I want to buy your storybooks
at a high price.

134
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,980
My storybooks?

135
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,780
That won't do.

136
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,320
You're trying to reap what I've sown—

137
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,490
to enjoy the fruits of my labor!

138
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,370
I'm sincerely proposing a deal.

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,060
The price is negotiable.

140
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,490
Absolutely impossible.

141
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,200
Then, how about I join as a partner?

142
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,280
All profits, 50-50.

143
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,780
Rest assured,

144
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,690
I absolutely won't

145
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,040
take your share for nothing.

146
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,840
Think about it.

147
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,970
Your open-air stage is
in terrible condition.

148
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,230
It barely scrapes by on fair-weather days,

149
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,500
but when it rains or the wind blows,

150
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
even the best storybook
won't draw a crowd.

151
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,960
If your storybooks can be

152
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,540
performed at my Wentao Pavilion,

153
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,660
the profits would at least triple.

154
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,970
50-50 split...

155
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,390
Absolutely impossible.

156
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Fine,

157
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,470
then how about 40 for me, 60 for you?

158
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,130
I can't go any lower than that.

159
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,870
I get 70, you get 30.

160
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,950
My lady!

161
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,970
The venue, refreshments, and musicians—

162
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,320
I pay for all of those.

163
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,420
I haven't even included

164
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,720
those major expenses in the calculation.

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Well, no matter what,

166
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,400
you can't expect me to

167
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,860
make a losing deal, right?

168
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,159
Then let's just pretend

169
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,440
you never brought this up today.

170
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Let's drop it.

171
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,780
30, 30, 30!

172
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,920
30 it is.

173
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,840
I'll go draft the contract now

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,170
and have us both sign it.

175
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,460
No rush.

176
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,990
I'll draft the contract.

177
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,520
My lady,

178
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,080
this is already my final offer.

179
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,810
What other demands do you have?

180
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,600
Regarding those storybooks,

181
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,940
Tan is also a partner.

182
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,390
Let me discuss this with her first

183
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,920
before drafting anything.

184
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,560
Alright then.

185
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,310
Where is Her Highness?

186
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,300
This is Her Highness's handkerchief.

187
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,710
Where is she?

188
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,520
Excuse me, young ladies,

189
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,170
have you seen the Princess of Dingbei?

190
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,630
-We haven't.
-We haven't.

191
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Excuse me, young lady,

192
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,530
have you seen the Princess of Dingbei?

193
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,780
I haven't seen her.

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
Excuse me, young ladies,

195
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,280
have you seen our Princess of Dingbei?

196
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,960
No.

197
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
Since we're going to be partners,

198
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,520
we're on the same team now.

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,600
It's fine that you don't manage

200
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,520
the business of Wentao Pavilion,

201
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,440
but for the storybooks—

202
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,510
from writing to rehearsal to debut—

203
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,840
you must personally oversee everything.

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,400
So,

205
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,080
you need to come to Wentao Pavilion
every day

206
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,120
to give instructions in person.

207
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,850
Every three days,

208
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,050
you and I will hold a co-owner's meeting

209
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,930
to review and report progress.

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,900
I can't do that.

211
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,960
Without rules, there can be no order.

212
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,060
Since we're to cooperate,

213
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,310
we need to establish a clear system

214
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,820
so that in the future, we can work
in an orderly manner

215
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,080
and follow the procedures in the future.

216
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,520
Well then, how do you suggest

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,400
we proceed?

218
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,679
For my storybooks,

219
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
I'll stage them however I want.

220
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,559
I'll go

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,520
whenever I feel like it.

222
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,159
Also,

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
regarding the daily matters
of the storybooks,

224
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,520
it won't be me reporting to you,

225
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,120
but you

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,400
will update me on the progress every day,

227
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,380
down to the very details.

228
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,220
Deal!

229
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,780
You agreed so readily?

230
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,680
As long as you come, I'll agree
to anything.

231
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,170
Miss Minmin!

232
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,170
Miss Minmin!

233
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,170
Something terrible has happened!

234
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,570
Her Highness is missing!

235
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,140
What?

236
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,810
[Changchun Garden]

237
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
Sir.

238
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,020
I've found something.

239
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,160
Liu Mo, at the age of fifteen,

240
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
came to the capital alone.

241
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,880
But nothing can be traced

242
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,320
about his background before that.

243
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,760
There's no record of him
even in the official registers.

244
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
Normally,

245
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,160
someone like that shouldn't have

246
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,640
been admitted to an academy.

247
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
But the very next year, not only
did he get in,

248
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,040
but he was also admitted to the capital's

249
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,120
best academy.

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
Someone sponsored and vouched for him?

251
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,040
Yes,

252
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,260
it was an accountant surnamed Wu.

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,520
I've discovered

254
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
that this Mr. Wu

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,520
had served in Chancellor Su's household
for many years

256
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,380
and died of illness six years ago.

257
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,530
So that means

258
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,680
Chancellor Su is behind Liu Mo.

259
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,830
This way,

260
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,300
it all makes sense now.

261
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,680
The kidnapping of my Princess Consort
before the wedding

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,450
must have been done by him
under Chancellor Su's orders,

263
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,310
and he wasn't allowed to harm her.

264
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,780
However, as I continued to investigate,

265
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,400
I found that Liu Mo and Chancellor Su

266
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,570
had no further connections.

267
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,910
Even his entry into official service

268
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,880
wasn't recommended by Chancellor Su.

269
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,810
On the contrary,

270
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,620
Liu Mo and the Su family in Lingzhou

271
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,680
seem to have intricate connections.

272
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,530
I found one of

273
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,480
Liu Mo's old classmates from when he
first arrived in the capital

274
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,280
and obtained some information.

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,630
What classmates?

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
It was just a few of us

277
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,880
homeless kids

278
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
who got together,

279
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
living in the same abandoned house.

280
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,290
We begged during the day

281
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,700
and stole at night,

282
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,940
just to keep our bellies full.

283
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,000
But there was indeed someone surnamed Liu

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,260
who was quite special.

285
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,040
He always had a book in his arms,

286
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,000
acting all mysterious.

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,930
He didn't even seem to feel hungry.

288
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,160
He was an orphan

289
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,640
with nowhere to go.

290
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,400
But not only did someone bring him food
every day,

291
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
but he also had a specially hired teacher

292
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
to tutor him.

293
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,940
Do you still remember

294
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,410
what the person who brought him food
looked like?

295
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,870
How would I remember that?

296
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
It's been so many years.

297
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
However,

298
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
that Liu guy

299
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,960
always called him "Mr. Si."

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,660
Whenever he came,

301
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
we all had food and drink.

302
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,260
So,

303
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,120
we all called him Mr. Si too.

304
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,360
But after more than half a year,

305
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,760
that Liu guy left.

306
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,280
They said he got into some academy.

307
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,120
He really had good fortune,

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
having someone important
looking out for him.

309
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,440
Who knows

310
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,240
where he's prospering now?

311
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,460
He deliberately concealed his background.

312
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,160
There must be

313
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,330
something he's trying to cover up.

314
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
No matter how one tries to
erase their tracks,

315
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,560
it's impossible to completely

316
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
eliminate all traces of their past.

317
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,240
Keep digging deeper.

318
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,730
And that guy surnamed Si

319
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,260
might be a lead.

320
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
Yes, sir.

321
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,800
No.

322
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,460
I need to calm down.

323
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,060
Calm down.

324
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,480
Calm down.

325
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
My Lady,

326
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
I've asked everyone in the garden,

327
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,700
and they all say they haven't seen
Her Highness.

328
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,340
Let's keep looking.

329
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,160
What's wrong?

330
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,880
Your Highness,

331
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,860
Her Highness is missing.

332
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,250
We've searched the entire garden

333
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,650
and found no trace of her.

334
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,620
She's missing?

335
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,610
Where did she go earlier?

336
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,480
Her Highness was resting
in the stone pavilion.

337
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,940
But given Her Highness's nature,

338
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,280
she wouldn't leave
without saying anything.

339
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,040
Are you sure

340
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,280
you've searched the entire garden?

341
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,900
Minmin and I searched separately

342
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,360
and indeed didn't see her.

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,140
Your Highness,

344
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,430
I've asked the guards at the gate,

345
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,760
and they said they didn't see
Her Highness leave the garden.

346
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh, right,

347
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,410
there's one place we haven't searched.

348
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,070
Changchun Garden is a royal garden

349
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,120
with designated chambers

350
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,720
for the royal family to rest.

351
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
For privacy,

352
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,010
these chambers are intentionally built

353
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,070
in a secluded area of the back garden.

354
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,290
Your Ladyship.

355
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm here.

356
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,740
Your Ladyship.

357
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,220
He has gone inside.

358
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Even the heavens are on my side,

359
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,490
allowing me to find her alone here.

360
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,590
I'd like to see,

361
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,040
after today,

362
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,990
how this marriage

363
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
can still go through.

364
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,020
Such a debauched scoundrel,

365
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,350
utterly without shame,

366
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
yet he dares to covet Your Ladyship.

367
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,890
Ming Tan,

368
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,690
you've been caught up in
such a scandalous affair today.

369
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
You'll surely be ruined.

370
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I'd like to see how you'll show your face
in public from now on

371
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,720
and how you'll have the nerve
to live in this world.

372
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,700
As for that Gao Chen,

373
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,180
he'll surely be condemned by everyone,

374
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,510
becoming the target of public criticism.

375
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
By then, no matter how hard Grandmother
tries to facilitate it,

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,640
my marriage to him

377
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,120
will have to be called off.

378
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,240
Your Ladyship's plan of killing two birds
with one stone

379
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,370
is truly brilliant.

380
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,120
Set off some smoke to draw people here.

381
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,050
It's best to draw

382
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,570
everyone in the entire garden

383
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,570
to come and watch.

384
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,890
Yes, Your Ladyship.

385
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,000
If I can't have peace,

386
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,320
then none of you will either.

387
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,640
[Gao Chen, Heir to
the Marquis of Jiangyang]

388
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,400
Forgive me for arriving late,

389
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
keeping Your Ladyship waiting.

390
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,240
The Empress Dowager is truly

391
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,040
so considerate of me.

392
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
She knows you're stubborn

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,370
and unwilling to marry,

394
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,880
so she specially allowed me

395
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,100
to consummate our marriage first.

396
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,920
Your Ladyship, you're gagged,

397
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,560
so you must be uncomfortable.

398
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,960
Let me help you remove it.

399
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm a considerate man myself.

400
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,540
Do you feel better?

401
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,970
You are Gao Chen, son of
the Marquis of Jiangyang?

402
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,430
I am not the Princess of Fengzhao.

403
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,960
You've mistaken me for her.

404
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,320
Please, sir,

405
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,680
let me go immediately

406
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,600
before this becomes a disaster.

407
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,300
What are you afraid of?

408
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,560
So long as I pretend

409
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,560
not to know you're not the princess,

410
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,690
all will be fine.

411
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,020
Moreover,

412
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,200
I have

413
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,640
the token from the Empress Dowager's
message.

414
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,480
By then,

415
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
who would dare to stand in my way?

416
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,050
A night together is more precious
than gold.

417
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,450
Why waste time talking?

418
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
Help! Someone, help!

419
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
-You little hussy.
-Someone, help!

420
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,650
-Trying to run away?
-Help!

421
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,670
Someone, help!

422
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,720
-Help! Help!
-Come on.

423
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,160
Help!

424
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,880
Someone, help!

425
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,280
Let's see where you can run now.

426
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,880
Someone, help!

427
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,120
Stop yelling.

428
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,000
Let go of me!

429
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,740
Your Ladyship,

430
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,620
is that enough?

431
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,130
Not yet.

432
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,880
Burn some more.

433
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,360
Only when the smoke is thick enough

434
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,700
can we draw more people here.

435
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,790
Yes, Your Ladyship.

436
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,910
Let go of me!

437
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,280
Come on.

438
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,120
Help!

439
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,520
Help!

440
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
You dare to kick me?

441
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You can shout your lungs out.
No one will come.

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,560
Help!

443
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,170
Today, we'll...

444
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,240
Why are you here?

445
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,240
Why can't I be here?

446
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,839
Help!

447
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,200
Sweetie.

448
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,230
Help!

449
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,079
Dear.

450
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
Tan.

451
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,310
Thank goodness you arrived in time.

452
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,330
Are you hurt?

453
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,280
Tan!

454
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,990
Are you alright?

455
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,120
Take Tan away first.

456
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,960
Okay.

457
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,440
Let's go.

458
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,010
Be careful.

459
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,790
Minmin.

460
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,190
Please, have mercy!

461
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,280
Let me explain.

462
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,720
I have nothing to do with it.

463
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
It was her.

464
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,920
She seduced me first.

465
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,360
It was her!

466
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,770
The Marquis of Jiangyang has
the Emperor's trust.

467
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,100
And Gao Chen is his eldest legitimate son.

468
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,690
You did that to him today, dear.

469
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
How will you explain this to His Majesty?

470
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,900
I already castrated him.

471
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,480
What can they do to me?

472
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Was it you

473
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,640
who deliberately set her up?

474
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,480
How dare you!

475
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,860
You dare to lay your hands on me?

476
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,060
Have you all gone mad?

477
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,760
So what if you're a princess?

478
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,720
Even princes must be punished
like commoners when they break the law.

479
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,950
You're just a mere princess,

480
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,200
and you think you can escape justice?

481
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,510
Nanzhi, go report this to the authorities.

482
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,240
Yes, My Lady.

483
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,760
Report to the authorities? So what?

484
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,520
The Empress Dowager is my grandmother.

485
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
She will surely stand up for me.

486
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,760
By then,

487
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,510
you'll all be thrown in prison.

488
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,870
If you hadn't mentioned
the Empress Dowager,

489
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,400
I'd have nearly forgotten.

490
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,260
You came to Changchun Garden today

491
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,480
on the Empress Dowager's orders

492
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,250
to have a matchmaking meeting
with Gao Chen, didn't you?

493
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,710
What... what Gao Chen?

494
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,800
Nonsense!

495
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,520
This news has spread
throughout the capital.

496
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,500
Everyone knows about it.

497
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,600
Since it's the Empress Dowager's order,

498
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,430
how could you, a princess, disobey?

499
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,560
Zhang Huaiyu!

500
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,000
Throw her in that room.

501
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,740
You...

502
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,780
What are you... what are you doing?

503
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,240
Stop right there!

504
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,490
Stop!

505
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,520
What do you think you're doing?

506
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,630
Let go of me!

507
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,730
Move.

508
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,600
How dare you!

509
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,040
Let go!

510
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,690
Let me out!

511
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,680
Open the door! Let me out!

512
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,440
Bai Minmin, don't you dare walk away!

513
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,750
I'll make you pay for this!

514
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,450
I saw a lot of smoke coming from
here earlier.

515
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,710
The smoke was coming from this very spot.

516
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,060
What happened here just now?

517
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,420
Could we have come to the wrong place?

518
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,520
Young Master Gao, since you're
already here,

519
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,680
have a good meeting with
the Princess of Fengzhao

520
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
and get to know each other well.

521
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,120
Don't let the Empress Dowager's

522
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
good intentions go to waste!

523
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,320
So, it's the Princess of Fengzhao
and Young Master Gao.

524
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,580
A man and a woman alone
in a room together.

525
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,390
They actually make quite a pair.

526
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,280
Indeed, when women become ruthless,

527
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,880
men can't compete with them.

528
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
Especially this Miss Bai.

529
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,890
They must be having
a delightful conversation.

530
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,650
[Qi'an Hall]

531
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,220
Little kitty,

532
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,960
did you get separated from your mommy?

533
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,960
Are you hurt anywhere else?

534
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,560
Are you scared?

535
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,060
Don't be afraid.

536
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,270
I'm here.

537
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,010
Fengzhao won't be able to leave

538
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,740
the Court of the Imperial Clan.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,870
Wait for me.

540
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,880
Dear.

541
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,950
Where are you going?

542
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,370
Are you bothered

543
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,170
that today, I was with the son of
the Marquis of Jiangyang

544
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,250
in the same room?

545
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,300
Never.

546
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,720
Tan, please don't overthink it.

547
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,120
I only blame myself

548
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,520
for not arriving earlier

549
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
and for not protecting you well enough.

550
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,880
Dear.

551
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,270
Then why are you still leaving?

552
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,130
I'm going to the palace.

553
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,740
Do you have to go to the palace right now?

554
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,900
This matter...

555
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,700
needs to be addressed after all.

556
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,440
His Majesty is waiting for me
in the palace.

557
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,240
Tan, don't worry.

558
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,280
I'll be back soon.

559
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,560
Nothing will happen.

560
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,110
Zhuiying.

561
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,600
Find someone capable in the Jinyun Guards

562
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
for me.

563
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,210
[Taiji Hall]

564
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,080
It's been hours,

565
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,560
and you're only coming now.

566
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,200
What?

567
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Did you have dinner at the residence

568
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
and comfort your wife

569
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,310
before finally deciding to come?

570
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,770
How did Your Majesty know?

571
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,540
If I were to suddenly drop dead one day,

572
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,940
it'd likely be due to the anger
you cause me!

573
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,460
Take a good look for yourself.

574
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,720
Before you entered the palace,

575
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,040
the memorials from the Imperial Censors
accusing you

576
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,720
were flooding in like snowflakes.

577
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
The Marquis of Jiangyang has just resumed
his office in the capital,

578
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
and you've already caused such a mess.

579
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,940
How am I supposed to clean this up?

580
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,280
I thought that after you got married,

581
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,450
you'd become steadier

582
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,750
and you'd cause me fewer troubles.

583
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,250
Who knew the troubles would only

584
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,380
get bigger, spiraling out of control?

585
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,480
Gao Chen

586
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,050
brought this upon himself.

587
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,490
Gao Chen alone would be one thing,

588
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
but this matter also involves Fengzhao.

589
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,080
Tomorrow at Shoukang Palace...

590
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,040
I fear the Empress Dowager will once again

591
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,080
find fault with your sister-in-law.

592
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,540
The Empress Dowager won't
have that chance.

593
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Today's incident

594
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,720
was entirely Fengzhao's doing.

595
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,520
I have already confined her in
the Court of the Imperial Clan.

596
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,480
What?

597
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,500
If the Empress Dowager wants Fengzhao
to come out unscathed,

598
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,060
she needs to hold her tongue

599
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
and behave herself.

600
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,480
Jiang Xu, oh Jiang Xu,

601
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,250
good for you.

602
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
If today's matter

603
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,520
had fallen into someone else's hands,

604
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,430
who would've dared to act

605
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,290
with such a thunderous approach?

606
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,440
Fetch a bronze mirror for His Majesty.

607
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,530
What do you need that bronze mirror for?

608
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,120
The speed at which Your Majesty's
expression changes—

609
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,660
how could Your Majesty himself miss it?

610
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,800
Gao Chen today

611
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,560
indeed made a mistake first.

612
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,650
I'll have the Ministry of Justice conduct

613
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,810
a thorough investigation and convict him.

614
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,350
But your actions were too impulsive,

615
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,280
acting first and reporting later.

616
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,080
You can't escape blame for that.

617
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,460
This trip to the palace

618
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,480
is precisely to submit myself
for punishment.

619
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,880
Your Majesty may deal with me
as you see fit.

620
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,120
Only this way can we silence the masses.

621
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Sixty strokes of the imperial cane.

622
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,960
Any objections?

623
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,520
I willingly accept the punishment,
Your Majesty.

624
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
What's the smell?

625
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,210
It's quite pungent.

626
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,060
Did the chamber pot spill?

627
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,680
Liu Yiding!

628
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,270
Yes, Your Majesty!

629
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
What's that smell? It's so unpleasant!

630
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Your Majesty,

631
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,290
I also smell something.

632
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,130
It seems to be a scent mixed with an odor,

633
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,710
an odor with a hint of fragrance.

634
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,720
Jiang Xu, oh Jiang Xu!

635
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,280
Tell me,

636
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
how long has it been
since you last bathed?

637
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,200
You're a married man after all!

638
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
You should pay more attention to
such matters!

639
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,320
Liu Yiding!

640
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,280
Yes, Your Majesty!

641
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,200
Open the doors and windows!

642
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,260
Yes, Your Majesty!

643
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,540
Heavens! It's unbearably stinky.

644
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,460
It's stinky!

645
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,300
So stinky.

646
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,280
This fragrance is refreshing and unique.

647
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,720
During the summer,

648
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,890
it can repel insects and ward off evil.

649
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,000
This gift

650
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,590
is excellent.

651
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,860
I just

652
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,680
visited the Marquis of Jiangyang's
residence.

653
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,010
Gao Chen

654
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,770
may never be able to stand again
in this lifetime.

655
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,050
Today's plan

656
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,180
was to finalize the Princess's

657
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,080
marriage to the son
of the Marquis of Jiangyang.

658
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,040
Unexpectedly, the Princess resorted
to such a low tactic,

659
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
dragging the Princess of Dingbei

660
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,080
into this as well.

661
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,240
A blessing in disguise.

662
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,280
That sword strike of his

663
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,000
nearly killed Gao Chen.

664
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,360
From now on,

665
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,850
the Gao family and the Prince of Dingbei

666
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,170
will be sworn enemies.

667
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,520
Though the marriage did not go through,

668
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,440
at least

669
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,140
there is no chance
the Marquis of Jiangyang

670
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,040
will ally with the Prince of Dingbei.

671
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,560
We've got a long road ahead.

672
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,760
I will wait and see.

673
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,760
Rest assured, Chancellor,

674
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,560
everything is all set in Lizhou.

675
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,280
With those sixty strokes delivered to
the Prince of Dingbei,

676
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
he won't be moving for at least
half a month—

677
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,280
more than enough time for us to proceed
with our plans.

678
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,890
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

679
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,240
His Highness specifically instructed me

680
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,520
to use this bridge-drawing technique

681
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,080
to alleviate the pain and swelling
of the wounds.

682
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,860
Tan!

683
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,250
How are you feeling?

684
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,370
I just got a bit of a scare,

685
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,620
nothing serious.

686
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,760
Usually,

687
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,720
I thought Zhai Nianci

688
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,680
was just arrogant because of her
favored status,

689
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
accustomed to being overbearing.

690
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,800
I didn't expect her to be so treacherous.

691
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,760
But don't worry,

692
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,760
yesterday I already

693
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
taught her a good lesson for you.

694
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Consider it revenge on your behalf.

695
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Zhai Nianci comes from a noble background

696
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,450
and is favored by the Empress Dowager.

697
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,600
But in the end,

698
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,800
she still ends up being

699
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,260
a pawn in the Su family's
marriage alliance.

700
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,760
She can't even decide on her own marriage.

701
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,720
She was also driven to desperation,

702
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,250
which is why she resorted to
such a low tactic.

703
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,600
But even when driven to desperation,

704
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
she shouldn't have implicated others.

705
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,440
Exactly.

706
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,360
My husband has her locked up
in the Court of the Imperial Clan,

707
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,960
which is what she deserves.

708
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Since ancient times,

709
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,000
marriages have been arranged
by parents' orders.

710
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,720
How many people can make their
own decisions?

711
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
How many can be like you,

712
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,040
who have their own opinions

713
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,360
and dare to fight and marry

714
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,760
a satisfactory husband?

715
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,480
You're making me blush.

716
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,760
Yesterday,

717
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,820
I saw that His Highness cares for you
very much.

718
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,080
He is indeed a rare

719
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,000
good husband.

720
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,000
However, once a new woman enters
the household,

721
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
things might change.

722
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
What new woman?

723
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,140
Don't you know?

724
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,060
My old man mentioned last night

725
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,280
that the Empress Dowager intends to send
someone to your household.

726
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,480
She says your household lacks heirs

727
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
and that His Highness should
take a side consort

728
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,380
to produce offspring.

729
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,520
How long have Xu and I been married?

730
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,230
Even if the Empress Dowager is anxious,

731
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,970
she shouldn't be so improper.

732
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,120
Sending a woman here just like that.

733
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,700
It might not happen now,

734
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,930
but what about later?

735
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,670
My old man

736
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,360
asked me to pass on a message to you.

737
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,840
He says His Highness is young and capable,

738
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
with a high position and great power.

739
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
Right now, you're the only one,

740
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,920
but that doesn't mean you'll be
the only one in the future.

741
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,000
In a household,

742
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,170
offspring are the most important.

743
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,560
While you and His Highness
are still in love

744
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,720
and no one else is competing,

745
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,840
you should have children early.

746
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,000
Securing your position as Princess Consort

747
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,240
is your top priority.

748
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,920
We're far from being deeply in love,

749
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,270
and having a kid is not even
on the horizon.

750
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,230
Tan,

751
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,550
don't blame my old man for being blunt.

752
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,610
Although I don't think

753
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,760
everything he says is right,

754
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,520
you should indeed plan for yourself

755
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,760
and think long-term.

756
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,450
I know

757
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,260
Uncle means well for me.

758
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,240
So,

759
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,150
you need to hurry up and have children.

760
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,000
If someone new really enters
the household in the future

761
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,320
and gives His Highness a son,

762
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,560
who knows who will be in charge of
this household

763
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,600
in the future?

764
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,480
Don't overthink it.

765
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,060
Xu is busy with countless affairs
of state.

766
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,840
He hardly has time to concern himself
with such things.

767
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,300
I don't think he has any interest in it
at all.

768
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,320
Besides,

769
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,080
even if the Empress Dowager wants to
arrange a marriage,

770
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,290
she still needs to see whether

771
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,250
Xu agrees.

772
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,660
True.

773
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,120
Your Highness,

774
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,450
Madam Yun, the concubine, is here to
pay her respects to you.

775
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,240
Yun what?

776
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,170
What concubine?

777
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,660
-Concubine?
-Concubine?

778
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,330
Madam... Madam Yun.

779
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,440
I am Yun Yi,

780
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,389
[Yun Yi, Concubine of the Prince of Dingbei]

781
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
greetings to Your Highness.

782
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,719
You...

783
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,000
are Concubine Yun?

784
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,449
Yes, Your Highness?

785
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,820
You...

786
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,750
A martial artist.

787
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,940
Could it be that...

788
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,840
she is the type of woman

789
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,480
Xu truly likes?

790
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,240
What are you staring at?

791
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,000
This Prince of Dingbei looks so proper,

792
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
but who would have thought

793
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,680
he's just another hypocrite?

794
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
The side consort hasn't even
officially come,

795
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
but the concubine has already
made herself at home.

796
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Indeed,

797
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
there are

798
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,320
no devoted men under heaven.

799
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,840
Birds of a feather flock together.

800
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,460
I suppose his buddies

801
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,090
are cut from the same cloth.

802
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,540
Well... well...

803
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,680
Wait...

804
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,190
What happened to Your Highness?

805
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
I am fine.

806
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,080
Sixty strokes of the cane.

807
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,450
The imperial physician has already
examined him.

808
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,400
It's just flesh wounds,

809
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,800
nothing serious for now.

810
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,350
Mr. Fu, please prepare some soft cushions.

811
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,820
He'll need to lie on his stomach
for the next few days

812
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,090
to avoid touching the wounds.

813
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,010
Alright, alright.

814
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,220
Let's quickly return to Your Highness's
chamber.

815
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,750
I'll go prepare right away.

816
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Not to Qi'an Hall.

817
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,020
To the study.

818
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,520
Don't tell the Princess Consort
about this matter,

819
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
lest she worry.

820
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,520
Your Highness,

821
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
you're injured so badly.

822
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,040
Surely, someone should be by your side!

823
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,900
Zhuiying is with me. I'll be fine.

824
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,680
Mr. Fu.

825
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,000
Understood! I won't say a word
to Her Highness!

826
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,040
Bad news!

827
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,480
Your Highness, something terrible
has happened!

828
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,160
Something terrible has happened!

829
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,120
What's causing such panic?

830
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
His Majesty had

831
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
Your Highness receive sixty strokes
of the cane!

832
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,100
Your Highness didn't return all night
yesterday

833
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,520
because he was being punished
in the palace!

834
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
Sixty strokes of the cane.

835
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,520
That could have killed His Highness!

836
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,440
Serves him right!

837
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,320
What...

838
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,200
Your Highness, Miss Bai, you don't know.

839
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,680
Just now, Second Young Master Shu
and Zhuiying

840
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,880
carried Your Highness back to the mansion.

841
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,520
Your Highness was covered in blood,

842
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,320
with not a single part unharmed.

843
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,800
Fortunately, his life is not in danger.

844
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,040
His Highness has been thinking of you,
Your Highness,

845
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,400
fearing you would worry about him.

846
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,240
He insisted that I shouldn't inform you
of this matter.

847
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,360
But Your Highness, please consider this—

848
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,600
His Highness's skin is torn,

849
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
and he's lost much blood.

850
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Yet, there's only one chaise lounge
in the study,

851
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,680
and no one to carefully attend to him!

852
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,320
Well...

853
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,880
How can his wounds heal properly
like that?

854
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,600
This is the medicine His Highness
often uses for injuries.

855
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,480
Far more effective than
ordinary wound medicine.

856
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,680
Your Highness can use this medicine

857
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
to treat His Highness's wounds.

858
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
Who is this?

859
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I am Yun Yi.

860
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,000
This lady is the concubine of
your household.

861
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
She just entered the household today.

862
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,600
What?

863
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,900
Concubine?

864
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,640
Even you were kept in the dark about this?

865
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,280
With Concubine Yun here,

866
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,680
Mr. Fu, you don't need to worry

867
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,640
that no one will take care of the Prince.

868
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,560
Concubine Yun knows the Prince so well

869
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,880
and is so attentive.

870
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,510
It's most fitting for her
to attend to him.

871
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,040
With Concubine Yun caring for him,

872
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm sure the Prince

873
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,300
will spring back to life,

874
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,300
recovering without medication.

875
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,560
The Prince is injured and urgently
needs medicine.

876
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,420
I'll trouble you, Concubine Yun,

877
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,660
to go and take care of him.

878
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,860
I humbly obey Your Highness's command.

879
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,190
Wait, wait, wait!

880
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Come back!

881
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,120
I've served in the household

882
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,520
for most of my life,

883
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,040
and I've never heard

884
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,040
of His Highness taking any concubine.

885
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,290
This concubine has appeared
out of nowhere.

886
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,860
There must be some misunderstanding here.

887
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,720
Your Highness,

888
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,000
His Highness didn't allow me

889
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,160
to disclose his injury

890
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,900
precisely because he feared you'd worry.

891
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,030
From this, we can see

892
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,920
that in His Highness's heart,

893
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,780
there is only you, Your Highness.

894
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,610
Moreover,

895
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
His Highness's injuries this time

896
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,240
were sustained for Your Highness's sake.

897
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,570
Though His Highness doesn't say it,

898
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,850
in his heart, he must be hoping

899
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,400
for Your Highness to go to him personally.

900
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,370
Who can truly fathom
the Prince's thoughts?

901
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,570
Today, the concubine has come here.

902
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,850
Perhaps the Prince

903
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,180
is actually hoping for her

904
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,580
to go and take care of him.

905
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,240
Previously, whenever His Highness
was injured,

906
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,060
it was always Zhuiying who applied
the medicine for him.

907
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,020
He won't tolerate anyone else.

908
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,250
Concubine Yun indeed knows the Prince

909
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,220
quite...

910
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
well.

911
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,040
I wonder,

912
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,280
when did you two first meet?

913
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,760
Your Highness,

914
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,760
I've been with His Highness
for several years.

915
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,410
Several years?

916
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,570
Could it be that he...

917
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,120
What misunderstandings could there be?

918
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,480
The Empress Dowager hasn't even had time
to arrange someone yet;

919
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,270
this woman has already arrived.

920
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,930
Your Highness, please don't worry.

921
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,000
I will go

922
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and ask His Highness for clarification!

923
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,930
Yes, we should get this cleared up.

924
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,200
If the Prince

925
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
is dissatisfied with me as his wife,

926
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,240
he should have informed me earlier.

927
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,240
So this marriage

928
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,510
could have been reconsidered.

929
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,100
Your Highness!

930
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,160
Your Highness, please wait for me!

931
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,820
Your Highness, you don't need to
go personally!

932
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,520
I can go on your behalf!

933
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,860
Your Highness!

934
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,660
Your Highness!

935
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,520
I've never seen you

936
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,250
lose your composure like this.

937
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,840
If it weren't for His Majesty's
deliberate protection,

938
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,680
even if the Marquis of Jiangyang

939
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,840
were to strike you himself,

940
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,100
I fear it'd hardly quell his resentment.

941
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,040
There is no need to overthink when taking

942
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,400
care of a beast in a man's clothing.

943
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,520
Sparing his miserable life

944
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,380
is already my greatest leniency.

945
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,230
You've delivered justice.

946
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,200
But that sword of yours

947
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,030
will equally dishearten
the Marquis of Jiangyang.

948
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,890
The Su family already had intentions
to win him over.

949
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,690
Hasn't your action played right into
their hands?

950
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,720
What his son is like,

951
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,450
he knows full well in his heart.

952
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Gao Chen brought this upon himself,

953
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,200
and it has nothing to do with
where the Marquis of Jiangyang's

954
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,320
loyalty lies.

955
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,060
If that's the case,

956
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,880
then the Marquis of Jiangyang is not worth
relying on either.

957
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,080
Well, Xu...

958
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,560
Enough.

959
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,680
Do you think

960
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,720
my injuries aren't severe enough right now

961
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,780
and that my current situation isn't
miserable enough?

962
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,950
I'll be gentle, Your Highness.

963
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,440
I heard

964
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,440
that the Empress Dowager is looking for
candidates

965
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,240
to select a side consort for you.

966
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,940
How did you come to know about this?

967
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,340
The Empress summoned Yu

968
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,520
to Changchun Palace a few days ago

969
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,050
and mentioned this matter.

970
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,800
Her Majesty wanted Yu to inform you
about this

971
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,860
so that you could prepare in advance.

972
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,380
How do you plan to handle this matter?
