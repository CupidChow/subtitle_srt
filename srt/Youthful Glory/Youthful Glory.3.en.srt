00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
How can you make sure

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
that she won't appear again

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,920
or cause trouble?

6
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,600
Well...

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,160
I...

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,060
She has to vanish.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Vanish! Vanish!

10
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,640
Miss Bai,

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
please let me go.

12
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,230
I beg you.

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,960
Hand her over.

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,840
I...

15
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,400
I've told you many times

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,890
that I don't know where she is.

17
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,650
I don't care.

18
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,640
She was last seen here.

19
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,120
You owe me an explanation.

are worried sick

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,280
since you're still not home.

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,079
The house is a complete mess now!

25

Please go home.

hearing what you will say

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
to the duke.

32
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,160
I believe Miss Bai

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,900

Miss, be quick.

38

There is still a long way to go.

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,220
We've been walking

40
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,750
non-stop for the whole day.

41
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,570
The sun is setting now.

42
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,140
Can't we take a rest

43
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,820
and spend the night here?

44
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,110
There's no meat at all.

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,480
Did my aunt ask you

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,680
to treat me like this?

47
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,020
It's the madam's order to rush.

48
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,990
You can get some rest

49

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,290
-I...
-Cut it out!

195
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,400
G-Get me a midwife now!

196
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,720
Go get a midwife!

197
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,360
Push! Harder!

198
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,220
Push!

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Hold your breath and push!

200
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Tell Yu to find a quiet place

201
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
in the capital city.

202
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
Keep pushing like this.

203
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,780
When Zhu'er's father arrives,

204
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,840
put him and his daughter

205
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,720
in confinement.

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
Push. Harder!

207
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,360
Got it.

208
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,640
Miss, don't just stand there.

209
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,120
Come on, help me with it.

210
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,520
Okay!

211
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,840
Look at you, so fussy.

212
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Go get me a cloth.

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Hurry up!

214
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
She is really in labor now.

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,920
Okay. I got it!

216
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,000
Relax. Just relax.

217
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,800
Here you are.

218
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,400
A waiter told me that lady

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,580
had gone into labor early,

220
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,420
so I brought this ginseng to her.

221
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,920
Push harder.

222
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
My mother and I

223
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
just came back from Yangxi Prefecture.

224
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,650
I don’t know much about

225
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,620
the local customs.

226
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,020
I acted rude before.

227
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,970
I must've made

228
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,710
a bad first impression.

229
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,570
I don't care.

230
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,760
Hold your breath.

231
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,720
Bear with the pain.

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't scream. Channel the energy elsewhere.

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,720
Take a deep breath.

234
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
Hold it and push.

235
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,730
She...

236
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,920
She has fainted.

237
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,140
Ma'am!

238
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,980
Ma'am!

239
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,120
-Ma'am!
-Look.

240
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,450
I came here just in time.

241
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,680
I can sell this ginseng to her

242
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,620
at the original price.

243
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,080
Ma'am!

244
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,750
I, Ming Chu, am always a kind

245
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,770
and charitable person.

246
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,440
Ma'am!

247
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Ming Chu?

248
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,900
Why is she here?

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,790
Miss,

250
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,290
is there ginseng?

251
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,430
Fetch it and feed it to this lady.

252
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,780
We must wake her up right away,

253
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
or the baby's life will be in danger!

254
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,210
Hurry!

255
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,980
I kindly brought the ginseng here.

256
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,920
It's only fair that I get

257
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,880
paid.

258
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,230
Sir, you should take my side.

259
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Sir, save your wife's life.

260
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,560
Pay for the ginseng now, please.

261
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,040
The woman in labor is your wife?

262
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,270
Sir,

263
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,580
your wife ran away from home

264
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,080
out of anger when she discovered

265
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,540
your mistress.

266
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,890
How are you going to explain to your father

267
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,040
if his grandchild dies?

268
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,840
I-Is it all?

269
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,710
This is how much the ginseng is worth.

270
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,680
How do you know it isn't

271
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,520
worth more?

272
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
It obviously isn't.

273
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,160
B-But I did

274
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,920
spend 100 taels...

275
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,960
The seller lied,

276
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,540
and you fell for his trick.

277
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,940
The blame is all yours.

278
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
The baby is born!

279
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Here is the baby!

280
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
The mother and son are both safe.

281
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,640
I know you and Liang Zixuan

282
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
are in love.

283
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,870
But why are you the only one

284
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,210
to make compromises every time?

285
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,520
I would gladly

286
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,850
do anything for him.

287
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,370
I've decided to cancel the engagement.

288
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,440
You should come back to the capital with me,

289
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,400
so you can fight

290
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,200
for what you deserve.

291
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,180
Are you sure of canceling the engagement?

292
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,580
I don't love him. Why should I marry him?

293
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,120
Men would make sacrifices

294
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
for their careers.

295
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,600
Why can't women

296
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,920
fight for

297
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,280
their happiness

298
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,000
and their beloved ones?

299
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Oh, ma'am.

300
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Look at the baby.

301
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,290
So peaceful.

302
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,470
What a sweet boy.

303
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Look.

304
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,320
What are you doing?

305
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,640
Give my baby back to me!

306
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,460
Ma'am!

307
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,030
That is a newborn baby

308
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,480
who needs his mother.

309
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,210
I know you want to take her back to the capital.

310
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,630
But that sort of violence was uncalled for!

311
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,860
Your father will arrive at the capital tomorrow.

312
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,060
You know best

313
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,170
about the baby's future

314
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,720
if he is with you.

315
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Zhu'er.

316
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,750
Get up.

317
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,810
Get up.

318
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,490
Don't listen to his nonsense.

319
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,610
Under any circumstances,

320
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,310
abducting a baby is a serious crime.

321
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,910
I'll report it to the police.

322
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,460
Don't.

323
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,370
Miss Ming,

324
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,460
he is right.

325
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,030
I'll go back to the capital.

326
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,630
What a ruthless woman.

327
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,600
Miss Bai!

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Suxin,

329
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,490
is Tan back?

330
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,370
Still, there's no news about her.

331
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,460
The marquis will be back to the capital soon.

332
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
I'm so worried.

333
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Has something really happened to Fourth Miss?

334
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,360
Will you tell the truth or not?

335
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,160
Spill it out now,

336
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,530
or I'll report to the police!

337
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,740
No one is stopping you.

338
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,430
I have nothing to do with this matter.

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,550
I'm a man of noble birth,

who you're falsely accusing

341
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,880
and confining in this room.

342
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Please go to the police now.

343
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,960
They'll conduct a thorough investigation,

344
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,890
and you'll have to apologize to me.

345
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,880
Keep hoping for it, lad.

346
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,770
Let's go.

[Qingfeng Inn]

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,240
Miss.

349
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,700
Where is the female guest of this room?

350
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,960
She was taken away at sunrise

351
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
by the man who had saved her life.

352
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,750
Have the girl with a whip

353

and her mother

354
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,010
left yet?

355
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,630
That girl left even earlier.

356
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,750
She looked furious.

357
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,830
Hey, miss,

358
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,460
that gentleman left a carriage for you.

359
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't want a thug's carriage.

360
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,220
Where is it?

361
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:27,440
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

362
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,250
What a boring

363
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,250
carriage ride.

364
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,760
Did I ask you to stop here?

365
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,040
Is it the main entrance to the mansion?

366
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,120
Are you blind?

367
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,790
Miss,

368
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,530
I told him to stop here.

369
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,000
You're asking me and my mom

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,720
to use the side door?

371
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,060
How dare you!

372
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Since when does a servant make

373
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,900
decisions for the marquis?

How can you be so rude?

I refuse all restraints.

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,570
on special occassions.

385
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,270
Ma'am, you've worked for the marquis for a long time.

386
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,260
I'm sure you've arranged

387
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,680
everything properly.

388
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,610
Greetings, Third Miss, Madam Liu.

389
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,580
It was a long journey.

390
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,450
You must be tired.

391
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,780
I hope you will get a good rest

392
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,900
in Yiyun House.

393
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,750
Thank you. Lead the way, please.

394
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,020
This is our first day here.

395
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,130
What's the rush?

396
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,800
Whose maid are you?

397
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
How dare you

398
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,320
stand in our way?

399
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,020
I'm Lyu'e. I work in Zhaoshui House.

400
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,660
Greetings, Madam Liu.

401
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,100
Greetings, Third Miss.

402
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,120
Lyu'e?

403
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,720
Oh, it's you.

404
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
You broke

405
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,480
my mother's favorite porcelain

406
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,560
years ago.

407
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,700
I made a huge mistake back then.

408
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,720
Fortunately, Madam Liu and Fourth Miss

409
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,020
kindly and mercifully

410
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,520
allowed me to stay

411
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,900
and work here

412
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,130
as a way to make amends.

413
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,060
If that hypocrite Ming Tan hadn't

414
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,080
pled for mercy for you,

415
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
you would've been

416
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,940
banished to a brothel.

417
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,700
Have you been working

418
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
in Zhaoshui House over these years?

419
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes.

420
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
After I was punished,

421
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,500
Fourth Miss transferred me

422
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,680
to Zhaoshui House,

423
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,040
so she could discipline me in person.

424
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,950
Bad examples corrupt good manners.

425
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,120
You're a maid in Zhaoshui House.

426
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
Given your terrible manners,

427
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,160
I assume Ming Tan

428
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,550
is as impertinent as you are.

429
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,330
It's no wonder

430
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,330
that she didn't come out to greet me.

431
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,240
What happened

432
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,680
was due to my negligence.

433
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
I should've noticed

434
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,560
your arrival.

435
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,800
Please don't blame Fourth Miss.

436
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
How dare you talk back!

437
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,760
Are you trying to

438
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
upset us?

439
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,400
No, I'm not.

440
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,250
Working in Zhaoshui House doesn't

441
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,910
mean you've become superior.

442
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,710
You'll always be a lowly maid.

443
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,660
Stop it now.

444
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,260
We just came back.

445
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,210
Why bicker with a lowly maid?

446
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,570
Off you go.

447
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,510
Yes.

448
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,970
You...

449
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,010
How is the preparation going?

450
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,340
Rest assured, Fourth Miss.

451
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,900
The kitchen has prepared

452
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,650
everything as you instructed.

453
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,080
Make sure all the dishes

454
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,880
in the banquet

455
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,460
are to Father's liking.

456
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Got it.

457
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm going to the kitchen now.

458
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,360
Fourth Miss,

459
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,560
Lyu'e somehow

460
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,130
irritated Third Miss and Madam Liu.

461
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,590
Now, she is being punished in the front hall.

462
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,440
You supervise the kitchen workers for me.

463
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,500
No mistake is allowed in the banquet.

464
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,040
Yes.

465
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
Isn't she Lyu'e,

466
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,290
Fourth Miss's maid?

467
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,170
Why is she being punished here?

468
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,240
It's said that she

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,170
offended Third Miss and Madam Liu.

470
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,760
It's like a giant slap on

471
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,680
Fourth Miss's face, isn't it?

472
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,690
With you being an example,

473
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,820
I believe all the servants here

474
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,380
won't dare to disrespect

475
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,680
their masters!

476
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,950
Go on with it!

477
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,880
Stop!

478
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,680
Chu, Madam Liu,

479
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,360
how are you?

480
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,280
What exactly happened?

481
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,210
Greetings, Fourth Miss.

482
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,320
You've really

483
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,520
blossomed

484
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,920
over these years.

485
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,360
Indeed,

486
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,180
what a livable city the capital is.

487
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,570
Tan,

488
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,540
we've been apart for years.

489
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,570
I nearly failed to

490
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,830
recognize you.

491
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,250
Glad to see you again, Chu.

492
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,880
Greetings, Madam Liu.

493
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,170
I wonder

494
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,280
what my maid

495
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,530
did wrong to deserve

496
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,130
such severe punishment?

497
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,860
I thought you came here

498
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,890
to welcome me and my mom.

499
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,380
Little did I know

500
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,880
you would try to

501
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,210
defend this lowly maid.

502
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,580
Watch your manners!

503
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
The Fourth Miss is busy managing

504
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,360
the mansion.

505
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,310
Would she have time to welcome you?

506
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,900
Besides, you're part of the family,

507
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,400
not a random guest.

508
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,040
Why bother your sister

509
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,960
with formalities?

510
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,240
This maid

511
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,480
offended Chu,

512
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
so Chu reprimanded her.

513
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,480
She harbored resentment

514
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,680
and disrespected us.

515
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,210
I became worried.

516
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,040
Given the way she acts,

517
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
I assume she must

518
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,000
often irritates you.

519
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,500
So, I decided to punish her

520
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
-as a warning.
-I didn't.

521
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,830
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

522
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,640
You take care of everything

523
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,920
in the mansion.

524
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,880
I appreciate your hard work.

525
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,880
You're worrying about nothing.

526
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,080
Lyu'e has always been

527
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,720
polite and rule-abiding.

528
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,950
She has never misbehaved.

529
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,220
Plus, she is my maid.

530
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,840
If she had made a mistake,

531
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,230
you should've

532
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,960
informed me and left her

533
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
at my disposal.

534
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,790
Here is what I thought.

535
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,660
There are strict rules here.

536
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
When a maid makes a mistake,

537
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,980
no matter who her master is,

538
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,040
she should be punished accordingly.

539
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,180
Otherwise, if word gets out,

540
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,880
people will criticize us

541
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,040
for allowing

542
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,770
our servants to disrespect us.

543
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,840
Go on with it.

544
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,080
Don't stop until 50 slaps are finished.

545
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,600
Fine. I will

546
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,320
slap you on my...

547
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,480
As I said,

548
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,850
she is my maid.

549
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,430
No one but I can punish her

550
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,540
for whatever mistakes she has made.

551
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,040
You...

552
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,600
Chu,

553
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,760
don't let a lowly maid

554
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,840
annoy you.

555
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,080
Fourth Miss, since she is your maid,

556
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,470
she should be dealt with

557
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,600
by you.

558
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,280
Let's go.

559
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,420
My Lady,

560
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,670
I'm sorry to put you

561
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,680
through humiliation.

562
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,770
You don't owe me any apologies.

563
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,180
Let's go and put some ointment on your face.

564
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,860
Yes.

565
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,860
Your father will be home soon.

566
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,090
What will he think

567
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,070
if he sees you get into a fight with Ming Tan,

568
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,630
your own sister,

569
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,930
on the first day after your return?

570
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,980
It's unworthy of being alienated

571
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,920
by your father for a trifle.

572
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,620
Your Majesty,

573
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,760
the investigation on corrupt officers

574
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,480
can't be done overnight.

575
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,900
Now, the border area is finally at peace.

576
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,830
Dingbei Army's moral is wavering.

577
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,230
In my opinion,

578
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,440
Prince of Dingbei should

579
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
return to the north as soon as possible.

580
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,410
Your Majesty,

581
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,800
this case should be handled by the Supreme Court.

582
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
If Prince of Dingbei interferes,

583
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,150
the result might not be fair,

584
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,110
and the people might have doubts.

585
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,540
Chancellors, you haven't said

586
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,670
a word since you came in.

587
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,670
I wonder what your

588
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,760
opinions are on this matter.

589
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,040
Your Majesty,

590
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,770
the truth of this case must be found out,

591
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,800
or Dingbei Army will have low morale.

592
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,460
Even the people in our country

593
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,840
will be disheartened.

594
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,360
I think

595
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,280
letting Prince of Dingbei stay here

596
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,840
to supervise the investigation

597
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,920
is the best way to relieve

598
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,350
the soldiers' worries.

599
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,680
Right Chancellor, what are the odds?

600
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,600
We're finally on the same page.

601
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,040
Your Majesty,

602
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,720
Prince of Dingbei's decisiveness

603
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,160
is exactly what we need

604
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,370
to work out this case.

605
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,270
The Supreme Court alone is not enough.

606
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,970
Your Majesty,

607
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
investigations must be

608
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,460
conducted in accordance to the law.

609
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,420
Officials can't do whatever they want.

610
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,990
Prince of Dingbei came to the capital without permission.

611
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,260
This is a serious crime.

612
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,220
Your Majesty, please be fair

613
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,650
and punish law breakers.

614
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,820
It is my imperial edict

615
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,320
that Prince of Dingbei will be beaten
20 times with a rod for coming

616
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,840
to the capital without my order.

617
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
He will receive

618
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,300
further punishment when the embezzlement

619
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,700
case is solved.

620
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
Yes.

621
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,490
Your Majesty...

622
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,410
[Capital Garrison]

623
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Eleven.

624
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,560
Twelve.

625
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
Thirteen.

626
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,360
Fourteen.

627
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,910
Fifteen.

628
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
Sixteen.

629
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Seventeen.

630
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Eighteen.

631
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,440
Nineteen.

632
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,320
Twenty!

633
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,680
You've made a scapegoat

634
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,950
out of a wooden dummy.

635
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,500
Your Highness.

636
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,010
The punishment is over.

637
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm leaving for the palace now.

638
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,040
Your Highness, do not forget this lesson,

639
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,570
and please work on the case.

640
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,780
Thank you, Eunuch Liu.

641
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Oh, right, Xu.

642
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
Yu complained to me,

643
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,880
saying that you took

644
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Miss Ming away for no reason.

645
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,480
As a result, he tortured

646
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
badly by Miss Bai.

647
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,840
You two...

648
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,080
Where did you

649
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,160
take Miss Ming to?

650
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,210
[Ledgers]

651
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
I went out of town

652
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,840
for this stuff.

653
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,170
The money that the Duke of Ling embezzled

654
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,970
was handled by Zhu'er's father.

655
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,400
Only a small portion of it was

656
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,320
in the secret chamber of the duke's house.

657
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,130
I've sent people to search Zhu'er's house.

658
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,250
She and her father have confessed.

659
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,340
[Ledgers]

660
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Solid evidence.

661
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,320
When will you write the Duke of Ling up?

662
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,060
Marquis of Jing'an will reach the capital today.

663
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,260
Without further ado,

664
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,970
I'll take action today.

665
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:03,840
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

666
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,030
[Ming Tingyuan]
[Marquis of Jing'an]

667
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,320
Father!

668
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,400
[Rising Sun]

669
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,810
Father, you're finally back.

670
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,400
You were away for only one day.

671
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,360
Chu has been

672
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,640
missing you the entire time.

673
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,880
After you were summoned to the palace,

674
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,090
no one could practice whipping with me.

675
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,190
Later on,

676
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,040
let's have a friendly fight

677
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
as practice.

678
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,980
How are you adapting to the new environment?

679
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,850
I'm cozy at home now, don't you see?

680
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
However, no one welcomed me and Mom

681
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,680
as we came back here.

682
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,720
The servants are rude

683
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,810
and disrespectful.

684
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,760
Father,

685
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,480
are Mom and I

686
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,070
not part of the Ming family?

687
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
Welcome back, My Lord.

688
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,750
I beg for your forgiveness.

689
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,350
Fourth Miss is busy

690
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,640
managing the mansion.

691
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,590
That is why

692
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
she couldn't welcome the arrival

693
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
of Third Miss and Madam Liu.

694
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,190
But she told me

695
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,330
to take good care of them.

696
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,860
Fourth Miss has had Yiyun House

697
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,740
redecorated

698
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,500
and arranged competent servants

699
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,300
for Third Miss and Madam Liu

700
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,370
to ensure their comfort.

701
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,600
See,

702
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,560
things have been well prepared.

703
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Where is Tan?

704
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,960
My Lord,

705
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
Fourth Miss was thrilled to know

706
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,820
about your return.

707
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,220
She said she would make

708
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,170
your favorite dishes on her own.

709
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,800
I've sent someone

710
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,360
to invite Mr. Bai over.

711
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,490
He'll be there soon.

712
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,080
After my long stay in the palace,

713
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
I'm feeling hungry.

714
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,680
[Rising Sun]

715
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,800
Let's go.

716
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,040
Father,

717
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,890
why not wash

718
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,700
our hands before eating?

719
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,990
[Rising Sun]

720
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,150
Okay.

721
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,180
The plating is not good enough.

722
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,290
Have it replated.

723
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,360
Yes.

724
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,200
Tan, you seem mysterious.

725
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,180
Where did you go?

726
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,450
Did something happen?

727
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,010
Don't hide secrets from me.

728
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,250
Actually,

729
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,560
I went after Zhu'er.

730
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,280
Alone?

731
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,380
How bold of you!

732
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,890
It's a long story.

733
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,520
Let's have

734
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,680
a gathering feast first.

735
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll tell you

736
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,160
the details later.

737
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,270
Let's go.

738
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,560
Come with me

739
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
to check if the stew is ready.

740
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Do we have to?

741
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,070
Just come with me.

742
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,300
Ms. Zhang,

743
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,620
are the rest of the issues taken care of?

744
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,820
Yes, My Lady.

745
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,340
Father...

746
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,750
Father....

747
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,610
Greetings, Father.

748
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,310
What's going on, Tan?

749
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,260
Shouldn't you be more excited?

750
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,470
Fourth Miss is actually ecstatic.

751
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,960
During the five years of your absence,

752
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,130
Fourth Miss never stopped missing you.

753
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,360
She was pleased to hear

754
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,660
that you would come back.

755
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,290
She started

756
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,990
preparing for a feast 15 days ago.

757
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,400
You've really grown up

758
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,430
in the past five years, Tan.

759
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,280
I left you alone here in the capital

760
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,540
managing the mansion.

761
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,120
That must be hard.

762
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,700
Sorry to put you through that.

763
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,600
I was just fulfilling my duty.

764
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,280
Uncle, your focus

765
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,240
is entirely on Tan.

766
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,040
You must've forgotten about me.

767
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,840
If it isn't Minmin!

768
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,090
Young lady,

769
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,340
you haven't changed a bit.

770
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,540
Like father,

771
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,730
like daughter.

772
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,570
Of course. She's my daughter after all!

773
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,550
[Duke of Chang]
[Bai Jingyuan]

774
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,210
Old sport,

775
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,480
long time no see.

776
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,270
You're not aging well.

777
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,940
You're leading a comfortable life in the capital.

778
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,160
How can I be compared with you?

779
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,880
Oh, you.

780
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,600
How arrogant of you now.

781
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,070
[Pretty Blossoms]

782
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,000
My dear brother-in-law.

783
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,240
Greetings, Uncle, Auntie.

784
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,430
Tan.

785
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,570
Greetings, Mr. Bai.

786
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,180
My Lord, all the guests have arrived.

787
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,880
Why not go to the dining hall now?

788
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,720
Fourth Miss specifically asked

789
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,840
the kitchen to make a stew for you.

790
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,810
Yes.

791
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,560
Tan didn't sleep well for nights

792
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,160
in order to prepare the stew.

793
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,800
You must try it, Uncle.

794
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,550
It's thoughtful of you, Tan.

795
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,260
Let’s go.

796
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,950
After you, Father.

797
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,710
[Pretty Blossoms]

798
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,480
-Please.
-Let's go!

799
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,780
Didn't sleep well for nights to make a dish?

800
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,140
How ridiculous.

801
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,250
Alright, let's go.

802
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,560
Dig in, guys.

803
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,730
Help yourselves to it.

804
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,560
Father,

805
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,060
try the stew.

806
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,490
Okay.

807
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,770
Find out how it tastes.

808
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,290
Let me try it.

809
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,100
How does it taste?

810
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,540
Tender and delicious.

811
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,840
Very tasty.

812
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,449
I'm glad you like it.

813
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,639
I sure do.

814
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
Where are the meat soup

815
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,540
and bamboo shoots I asked for?

816
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,760
I told the kitchen to make those

817
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,699
for me in particular.

818
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,370
Yinxing, tell the kitchen

819
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
to make those dishes

820
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,520
right now.

821
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,889
Don't bother.

822
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,550
What do you mean, Tan?

823
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,190
Chu...

824
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,409
Don't I get to eat

825
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,840
and do what I want

826
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,510
at my own home?

827
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:33,570
Father,

828
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,679
isn't this

829
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,440
supposed to be my home?

830
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,760
She and I are both your daughters.

831
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,120
Do I have to subject myself

832
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
to her and be bullied by her?

833
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Alright. Stop it.

834
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,440
Tan, Chu is your sister.

835
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
Besides, she is not asking

836
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,679
too much.

837
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,960
Why not...

838
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
My Lord, here are the dishes.

839
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,560
The kitchen had already stopped working

840
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,900
when Chu asked for these.

841
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,060
The cooking took

842
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,290
some time.

843
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
This is

844
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,220
a welcome feast for

845
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,140
Father, Chu,

846
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,040
and Madam Liu.

847
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,510
Immature though I might be,

848
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,660
I would never treat my family harshly.

849
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,940
Meat soup tastes best when it's warm.

850
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,930
Chu, try some.

851
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,160
Ms. Zhang.

852
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,600
Did I not tell you

853
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,200
to prepare extra tabelware?

854
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,760
Fourth Miss,

855
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,830
I did prepare

856
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,960
some extra.

857
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,850
What a joyous reunion.

858
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,290
But my mother couldn't join us.

859
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,120
So, I found out the tableware

860
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,650
that my mother used before,

861
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,120
and put it on the table

862
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,630
in memory of her.

863
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,650
I shouldn't sit here.

864
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,870
Father, over these years, Mom...

865
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,590
Madam Liu

866
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,760
kept you company in the barren

867
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,730
Yangxi Prefecture.

868
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,850
She suffered a lot.

869
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,880
Why can't she eat

870
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,480
at the same table as us now?

871
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,080
The customs in the capital

872
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,840
are different from those in the army.

873
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,640
I believe

874
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,760
Madam Liu

875
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
is a sensible person.

876
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,600
But we're home now.

877
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,130
Why talk about rigid rules?

878
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,520
Chu and Madam Liu

879
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,350
spent years with you in the border area.

880
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,350
I could only imagine how hard it was.

881
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,300
These customs are often ignored in the army.

882
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,670
Father must have been very tolerant of

883
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,300
Madam Liu and Chu in the past.

884
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,800
But now we're in the capital.

885
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,480
Both nobles and commoners

886
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,140
observe certain traditions.

887
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
As Madam Liu said to me just now,

888
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,970
there are strict rules in the mansion.

889
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,850
If word gets out about our bad manners,

890
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,080
people will criticize us

891
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,380
for being uncivilized.

892
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,300
It will tarnish

893
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,970
Father's good reputation.

894
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:18,970
How...

895
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,960
How am I tarnishing

896
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,490
Father's good reputation?

897
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,970
Shortly after your return,

898
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,120
you punished my maid.

899
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,560
I heard that you even argued

900
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,460
with Ms. Zhang

901
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,190
and nearly assaulted her.

902
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,300
I was disciplining those servants,

903
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,280
so they would remember

904
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,640
their roles here.

905
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,320
Ms. Zhang refused to open the main entrance.

906
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,790
She insisted that we use the side door.

907
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,790
She was purposefully demeaning...

908
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,930
me and Madam Liu.

909
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,180
Then, that maid Lyu'e

910
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,400
provoked me.

911
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,920
She deserved punishment.

912
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,740
Lyu'e is my personal maid.

913
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,520
She always behaves properly.

914
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,290
Ms. Zhang abides by the rules all the time.

915
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
She's an important housekeeper

916
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,320
who has worked here for most of her life.

917
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,050
But you lashed out at her

918
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,610
and shoved her outside the mansion.

919
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,930
Our family reputation and Father's good name

920
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,730
would possibly be compromised.

921
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,690
Father's return to the capital

922
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,480
must have attracted much attention.

923
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,680
We're being watched.

924
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,950
As females,

925
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,360
though we can't help Father

926
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,760
with political affairs,

927
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,270
we should be reasonable

928
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,840
and think twice

929
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,970
before we say or do anything.

930
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,000
Tan is right.

931
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,760
Father!

932
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,680
Enough.

933
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,120
You're acting like a child now.

934
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
What Tan said is correct.

935
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,240
You should learn

936
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,480
from your sister.

937
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,960
Aren't we here to welcome

938
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,040
your return?

939
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,520
Why are we

940
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,680
talking about raising children?

941
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,120
Save it for later.

942
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,720
Your uncle is right.

943
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,280
This is a reunion.

944
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,360
Let's have

945
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,840
a gathering feast as a family.

946
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,640
My Lady,

947
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,440
this letter just arrived.

948
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
It is said to be important to you.

949
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,960
Who sent it to me?

950
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,530
[For Ming Tan]

951
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,640
The owner of Wentao Pavilion.

952
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,520
Wentao?

953
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,680
The guard working for the Liang family,

954
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,160
Chen Si, who pushed you into water

955
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,480
in the Lantern Festival is hiding in the west room of Wentao Pavilion now.

956
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,350
[Wentao Pavilion]

957
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,580
Why did you give the letter

958
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,050
to Miss Ming instead of

959
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,390
Marquis of Jing'an?

960
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,860
Just to avoid trouble.

961
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,520
If you had sent the letter

962
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,720
to the marquis,

963
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,560
He would get suspicious

964
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,400
and start a investigation.

965
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,020
It could save you much trouble

966
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,980
when Miss Ming received the letter instead.

967
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,840
If it weren't for the Ming family,

968
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,740
I would've put the Duke of Ling into prison.

969
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,250
Marquis of Jing'an's is a rarely seen talent.

970
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,310
If he became in-laws

971
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,750
with the Duke of Ling,

972
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,030
things would be tough for us.

973
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,830
Fortunately, Miss Ming is smart

974
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,850
and decisive.

975
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,160
Otherwise, it would take us more time to solve the problem.

976
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,280
What on earth

977
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,210
happened in the Lantern Festival?

978
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,560
Father,

979
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,710
I went out for fun that night.

980
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,500
Someone from the Liang family bumped into me.

981
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,160
I ended up falling into water.

982
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,620
The Liang family did it

983
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,020
to make me marry Liang Zixuan quickly.

984
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,350
Luckily, I can swim.

985
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,880
So, Liang Zixuan didn't get what he wanted.

986
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,460
How absurd and despicable!

987
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,580
Shame on them.

988
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,600
Does your godfather know about this?

989
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
I thought

990
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,770
we should find out the truth first,

991
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,300
so I didn't tell Godfather.

992
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,880
I only knew that Minmin came

993
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,530
home late in the Lantern Festival.

994
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,460
I didn't know you got in danger.

995
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,360
How could you two hide

996
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,830
something so important from us?

997
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,790
We didn't want to worry you.

998
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,780
This matter is only known to a few people.

999
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,200
The less it's heard, the better.

1000
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,690
Tan, don’t worry.

1001
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
I will seek justice

1002
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,820
for you.

1003
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,240
D-Don't kill me!

1004
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,700
Tell me!

1005
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,080
What did you do?

1006
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,440
I-I didn't do anything.

1007
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,000
Then what about the incident

1008
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
in the Lantern Festival?

1009
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,600
Say it!

1010
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,230
I...

1011
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,960
I pushed Miss Ming into water

1012
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,440
at my master's request.

1013
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,790
I have nothing to do with the rest!

1014
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,520
Liang Qiwei...

1015
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,940
What a punk!

1016
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,480
Have the Liang family

1017
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,530
gone crazy?

1018
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,200
Tan was engaged to Zixuan.

1019
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,460
When you came back,

1020
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,200
they could get married soon.

1021
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,820
Why must they pull a trick?

1022
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,230
Liang Zixuan and his cousin

1023
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,830
were in relationship.

1024
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:56,800
Now,

1025
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,280
they have a son.

1026
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,080
W-What?

1027
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,680
The Liang family was afraid that you'd hear about it

1028
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,930
and cancel the engagement.

1029
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,320
They planned to let Zixuan

1030
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,280
save me from drowning,

1031
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,840
so I had to marry him.

1032
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,080
Why didn't you tell me

1033
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,760
about this serious matter?

1034
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,240
I heard that the Liang family had connections

1035
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,260
with the Ministry of Personnel.

1036
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,520
I know little about politics.

1037
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,920
I was afraid that your career

1038
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,840
and transfer back to the capital

1039
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
would be affected if I canceled the engagement.

1040
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,080
Therefore...

1041
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,140
The Liang family means nothing to me.

1042
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,920
They can't affect my career!

1043
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,800
Guards!

1044
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,600
I'll cancel the engagement now.

1045
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,400
No, no.

1046
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
I'm not going there!

1047
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm not!

1048
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,210
It went as you expected.

1049
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,000
The Liang family resorted to devious means

1050
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,520
to secure the engagement.

1051
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,330
How could they just give up?

1052
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,840
Perhaps even the marquis

1053
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,520
can't cancel the engagement.

1054
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,390
[Profound Virtue and Boundless Grace]

1055
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Say something!

1056
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,720
It was Zixuan who

1057
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,120
fell into water that day.

1058
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
Everyone in the capital knows it.

1059
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,360
Exactly.

1060
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,840
The fact that we came here

1061
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,590
means we have found out

1062
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,590
the whole truth.

1063
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,600
Love can't be forced.

1064
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,120
It'll be the best if you could

1065
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,360
just let us cancel

1066
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,840
the engagement.

1067
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,080
If people know Ming Tan fell into water,

1068
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,620
her reputation will be damaged.

1069
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,320
You see,

1070
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,880
our kids

1071
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,280
are getting married.

1072
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,840
Why are so mad

1073
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,000
about something that hasn't

1074
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,880
been proven?

1075
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,640
Yeah.

1076
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,440
Someone must be jealous of

1077
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,760
our bond,

1078
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,900
so this person decided

1079
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,570
to set us up.

1080
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,820
The entire Liang family

1081
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,120
thinks highly of Ming Tan.

1082
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,110
When she marries our son,

1083
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,170
I will treat her like my own daughter,

1084
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,610
and not upset her in any way.

1085
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,280
I have a witness here.

1086
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,790
How dare you deny it?

1087
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,940
It's bold of you two!

1088
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
I know that your niece

1089
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,840
stayed a long time

1090
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,280
in your house.

1091
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,680
She was involved with your son

1092
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,600
and got pregnant!
