00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,280
It's all because they have something to hide.

190
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,240
Young Master Liang has done

191
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,760
such a disgraceful thing,

192
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,400
yet his family not only hides it

193
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,799
but also comes here as if nothing happened.

194
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,919
They truly have no shame.

195
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,840
Anyway,

196
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,100
our Ming and Liang families are not of the same kind.

197
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,340
I'll definitely...

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,260
break off this engagement.

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,360
My Lady!

200
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,170
My Lady.

201
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
There's news from the Liang household.

202
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,720
[Lyu'e, Maid of the Zhaoshui House]

203
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Young Master Liang is taking his cousin

204
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,800
to Hanyan Temple to pray for blessings.

205
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,860
Get the carriage ready.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,580
A curved knife for slaughter,

207
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,390
aimed at the throat.

208
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,390
You're from the Haiyou Sect.

209
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,000
In all of Xian, very few would dare to

210
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,790
rob my army's supplies

211
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,870
[Jiang Xu, Prince of Dingbei in Xian]

212
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,080
and try to stop me from returning to the capital.

213
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,320
The Liang family sent you?

214
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,470
Go ask the King of Hell yourself!

215
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,750
Kill him!

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,150
It appears that you were badly wounded

217
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,800
in the battle at Dongzhou, Prince of Dingbei.

218
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,650
He's escaped toward Hanyan Temple!

219
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,090
The Chief has ordered

220
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,040
that he must not be allowed to enter the capital alive!

221
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

222
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,090
Be careful.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,980
I've heard

224
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,880
that wishes made at Huiji Hall

225
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,400
often come true.

226
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
Many women in the capital

227
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,820
come here

228
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,450
to pray for their children.

229
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,100
I've been wanting to come here for a long time.

230
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,230
[Liang Zixuan, Heir of the Duke of Ling]

231
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
It's all because Mother has watched me too closely.

232
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,370
[Zhu'er, Liang Zixuan's Cousin]

233
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,160
Mother's gone to the Ming family to offer betrothal gifts today.

234
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,720
As long as we return before she does,

235
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,520
we'll be fine.

236
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Zixuan.

237
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Choose a name

238
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,160
for our child.

239
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,160
[Wish our child, Liang Wenting, peace and safety, blessed with
both happiness and wisdom; Liang Zixuan, Zhu'er]

240
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,070
I've heard

241
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,170
that the Fourth Miss Ming is picky about everything

242
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,440
and especially harsh to the servants in her household.

243
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,080
She must be difficult to get along with.

244
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,450
I truly dread to imagine

245
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
what life will be like

246
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,320
for our child and me

247
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,510
once she enters your household.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
Zhu'er, you're worrying too much.

249
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't worry.

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,870
After the wedding,

251
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,080
I will properly bring you into the household

252
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,010
as my concubine.

253
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,080
With me there,

254
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
no one will ever hurt

255
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
you and our child.

256
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,280
How dare she

257
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,680
speak ill of you, My Lady?

258
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,960
She's slandering

259
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,440
Liang Zixuan's future wife,

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
not me.

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,980
Once I break off this engagement,

262
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,000
she can slander whoever she wants.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,260
It'll have nothing to do with me anymore.

264
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,600
They must have left their names

265
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
on the wooden plaque.

266
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
When I get the evidence,

267
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,120
I won't fear them denying everything

268
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,200
when I break off the engagement.

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,560
G...

270
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,200
Great.

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,800
It's worth it that you've been keeping

272
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,660
an eye on them for such a long time.

273
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,120
Come on, come on.

274
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,650
Hurry up.

275
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,460
Be careful.

276
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,600
Suxin,

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
keep a good watch outside.

278
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,430
[Wish our child, Liang Wenting, peace and safety, blessed with
both happiness and wisdom; Liang Zixuan, Zhu'er]

279
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,080
[Wish our child, Liang Wenting, peace and safety, blessed with
both happiness and wisdom; Liang Zixuan, Zhu'er]

280
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,710
Why is my sock broken?

281
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,440
How embarrassing.

282
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,550
Thank you, sir...

283
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,030
for earlier.

284
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,260
No need.

285
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,030
Hurry! Search over here too!

286
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,150
Everyone, move! Hurry up!

287
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,920
Yes, sir.

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,760
My Lord!

289
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
May I ask what urgent matter brings you here?

290
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,110
Does a mere servant girl like you

291
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,720
deserve an explanation from me, the Sheriff?

292
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,320
My Lord!

293
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
My lady is praying inside!

294
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
She doesn't want anyone to disturb her!

295
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,880
So what if she is praying?

296
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,240
Is that more important than my official investigation?

297
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,600
He brought them here.

298
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,270
If I open the door now,

299
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,260
with a man and a woman alone together,

300
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,720
how will I explain myself?

301
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,800
My Lord!

302
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,420
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

303
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,100
My Lord, do you recognize this token?

304
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,660
A thief broke into the temple.

305
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,440
As the Sheriff

306
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
responsible for patrolling this area,

307
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,030
[Wu You, Sheriff of Capital Prefecture]

308
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
it is my duty to conduct a search

309
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
and bring the thief to justice!

310
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,370
My Lord, do you have an official warrant

311
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,160
from the Capital Prefecture
for such a large-scale search?

312
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,280
If not,

313
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
are you not in violation

314
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,840
of our Xian laws?

315
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,520
The situation arose suddenly,

316
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,210
so I didn't have time to request a warrant.

317
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,780
Whether the thief is here or not

318
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,330
will be clear after the search.

319
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,320
Most of the worshippers here

320
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,119
are noblewomen from the capital's elite.

321
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,550
If you interrupt our prayers

322
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,480
for no reason,

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,530
what good would that do you?

324
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,440
My lady

325
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
came here today especially

326
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,079
to pray for the Marquis of Jing'an.

327
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,730
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

328
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
Since she entered,

329
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,010
I've been guarding the door.

330
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,339
Not to mention thieves,

331
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,700
I haven't seen a single shadow of anyone.

332
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,440
My Lord,

333
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,030
this task

334
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,490
should remain discreet.

335
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,320
We can't afford to offend

336
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,300
any of these nobles in the temple.

337
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,080
When capturing the Prince of Dingbei,

338
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,630
remember to act covertly.

339
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,130
Do not expose yourselves.

340
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,130
If spotted,

341
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,640
he is to be handed over to
the Haiyou Sect for disposal.

342
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,960
I didn't know that inside was

343
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,480
the daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an.

344
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,700
My sincere apologies.

345
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,980
Since we haven't

346
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,040
found any suspicious individuals here,

347
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,720
you all follow me

348
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
to search elsewhere.

349
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,040
-Yes, My Lord.
-Yes, My Lord.

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,600
Let's go.

351
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,230
My Lady, are you alright?

352
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,800
My Lady!

353
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,090
Let's go.

354
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,190
Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion...

355
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
My Lady,

356
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,080
it seems someone

357
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
has fallen off our carriage!

358
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,860
Why is it you?

359
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,410
You...

360
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,190
you're injured.

361
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,820
May I ride in your carriage

362
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,950
to the capital together?

363
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,530
I...

364
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,710
My Lady.

365
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,430
My Lady.

366
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,370
Don't move.

367
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,790
Who are you really?

368
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,150
Leave now if you don't want to die.

369
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,800
My Lady.

370
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,480
Suxin.

371
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,540
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

372
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,540
Where is the coachman?

373
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,600
Coachman.

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
Coachman.

375
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,600
I've deployed men all along the way.

376
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,920
You can't escape.

377
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,750
You vermin,

378
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,210
you even dare to... collude with the corrupt official.

379
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,320
Kill him!

380
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,060
Why has it gone quiet?

381
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,480
May I ride in Miss's carriage to the capital?

382
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Are you...

383
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,160
in mortal danger?

384
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,080
I won't die.

385
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,450
That's good.

386
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,280
In Xian, we value reputation and propriety.

387
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
If a man and an unmarried woman
ride in a carriage together,

388
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
it will ruin our reputation.

389
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,490
Besides,

390
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,080
we are complete strangers.

391
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,720
Who you are, where you come from,

392
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,200
whether you're good or bad, or what you intend to do—

393
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,080
I know nothing about any of this.

394
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,340
-Speak plainly.
-I...

395
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,340
No.

396
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,420
I look like a villain?

397
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,480
Yes...

398
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,530
N-No, not at all.

399
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Coachman!

400
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,370
It's alright now, come out!

401
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,480
Take Miss home!

402
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey.

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,360
Okay.

404
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Suxin,

405
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,340
give the water pouch and wound medicine

406
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,140
to that gentleman from earlier.

407
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,980
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

408
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,960
Such a lovely fragrance.

409
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,760
Did you light the Lanpo incense?

410
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes, My Lady.

411
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,240
You were frightened today.

412
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
The Lanpo incense is calming and refreshing,

413
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
soothing to the nerves.

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,120
Tan!

415
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,020
[Bai Minmin, Daughter of the Duke of Chang]

416
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,530
Are you alright?

417
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,680
How did a simple visit to Hanyan Temple

418
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,720
end with you running into assassins?

419
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,920
I must have forgotten to check the almanac

420
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,250
before going out today.

421
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,340
Fortunately, I returned safely.

422
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,440
I think

423
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,080
you and Liang Zixuan are a bad match by fate.

424
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,960
If it weren't for him,

425
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,040
you wouldn't have gone there in the first place,

426
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,600
and you wouldn't have encountered such danger!

427
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,880
Although I've encountered danger today,

428
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,440
I found something.

429
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,950
Wait, where is the wish plaque?

430
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,560
What wish plaque?

431
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,760
My Wuheng Jade Pendant is also missing.

432
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,120
I must have lost them

433
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,880
while evading those assassins.

434
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
I went to such great lengths

435
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,640
to get that evidence.

436
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,840
Uncle is returning to the capital soon?

437
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,760
Father will definitely return

438
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,420
on the 18th of the first month.

439
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
Then, that's just a few days away.

440
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm afraid that before then,

441
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,880
we won't see Liang Zixuan

442
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
and Zhu'er leaving the residence together again.

443
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
No.

444
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,480
I have to find the wish plaque.

445
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,280
Tan!

446
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
That place is remote,

447
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,280
and it's getting dark.

448
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
Where can you find it?

449
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
Besides, even if you go,

450
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,970
you might not find it at all.

451
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,320
But without

452
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,960
concrete evidence of their affair,

453
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
even if Father believes

454
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,060
my one-sided account,

455
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,800
the Liang family would never admit it,

456
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,260
let alone agree to break off the engagement.

457
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,680
I have an idea.

458
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,280
Since they won't come out of the residence,

459
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,600
we'll go in.

460
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,960
I don't believe

461
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,400
that in the vast Duke of Ling's mansion,

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,880
we can't find even a speck of evidence.

463
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,640
But...

464
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,210
how can I get into the Duke of Ling's Mansion?

465
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,640
[Wentao Pavilion]

466
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:29,080
By riverside a pair of

467
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,760
turtledoves are cooing.

468
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,350
[Su Wenchun, Left Chancellor of Great Xian]

469
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,600
There is a maiden fair...

470
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,730
Greetings, Godfather and Godmother.

471
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,960
Tan, you're here.

472
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,030
[Zhang Yunru, Su Wenchun's wife]

473
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,760
Tan, you're here.

474
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,040
Come on, have a seat.

475
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,970
Have a seat. Sit.

476
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
These are the seasonal pastries

477
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,440
newly made here.

478
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Try them.

479
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,640
If you like them,

480
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll have more sent to your home later.

481
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
You're so thoughtful, Godfather,

482
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
always remembering that I love sweets,

483
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,210
no matter where you are.

484
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
The Lantern Festival is coming.

485
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,980
I've prepared some gifts.

486
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
I hope you won't find them lacking.

487
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,620
Godmother.

488
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,470
Thank you, Tan.

489
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,080
Godfather.

490
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,810
This is mine.

491
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,560
This quality is excellent.

492
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm glad you like them.

493
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,360
You have all grown up.

494
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,200
You're already of marriageable age.

495
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,600
Speaking of marriage,

496
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,880
I heard there was a mishap when the Liang family

497
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,680
presented the betrothal gifts.

498
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,090
Godfather, Godmother,

499
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,920
I

500
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,580
was just hoping to discuss this matter with you.

501
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Very well.

502
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,080
The Duchess of Ling

503
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,800
did come with sincerity to present the betrothal gifts.

504
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,840
Unexpectedly,

505
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
first there were flaws in the gifts,

506
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,280
and then the betrothal goose flew away.

507
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
Thinking about it afterward,

508
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,500
I truly feel this incident

509
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,940
damaged the dignity of our family...

510
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,040
and diminished

511
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,400
the Duchess's goodwill.

512
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,300
I wanted to visit and apologize,

513
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,560
but I felt

514
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,480
it would be inappropriate

515
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
to go alone.

516
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
What's inappropriate about that?

517
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Since you have the heart to go,

518
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
I'll accompany you.

519
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,360
My Tan is considerate.

522
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,680
Concerned that the mishap during

523
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,330
the betrothal ceremony might have startled you,

524
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,990
she specially prepared gifts

525
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,740
and asked me to accompany her.

526
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,760
My dear sister,

527
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
don't say that.

528
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,520
The mishap during the betrothal gifts presentation

529
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,560
was due to our family's

530
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,600
oversight.

531
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,840
I've already hired

532
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
the best matchmaker in the capital

533
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,720
and am considering

534
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,400
whether to send the gift list first

535
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,860
for you to have a look

536
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,010
and determine if it's acceptable.

537
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
I'll review the list for you.

Yes.

Naturally, her marriage cannot be taken lightly.

545

I'll trouble you to pay extra attention.

546
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
Of course, of course.

I recently obtained a guqin score

550

Make sure to take good care of Miss Ming.

563
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,040
There mustn't be the slightest oversight.

564
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,520
Miss Ming, this way, please.

565
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,720
That over there is

566
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,200
Miss Rong'er's quarters.

567
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,530
And what about that eastern wing?

568
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,020
And what's this place?

569
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,720
The east side is His and Her Grace's quarters.

570
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,560
This place

571
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,320
is the Young Master's study.

572
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,120
What's your name?

573
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,380
How old are you?

574
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm Ling'er,

575
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
17 this year.

576
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,080
Ling'er...

577
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,450
Looking carefully,

578
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
you're quite a beauty in the making.

579
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,420
Your skin is soft and fair too.

580
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
Are you wearing rouge?

581
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,520
No, Miss, I'm not.

582
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Then why are your cheeks so rosy?

583
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,230
And your hands too.

584
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,520
They say that hands

585
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,400
are a woman's

586
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,160
second face.

587
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
I'm accustomed to daily chores,

588
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
so my hands are naturally rough.

589
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,920
They say that rosy hands indicate a prosperous fate

590
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,200
that will benefit one's husband and the household.

591
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,920
You and I are about the same age,

592
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,320
so I imagine Her Grace will soon

593
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,850
arrange a marriage for you.

594
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,160
This concerns

595
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,620
your lifelong happiness.

596
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
But I have to do chores every day.

597
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,520
My hands

598
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,080
naturally can't compare

599
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,680
to those of you young ladies.

600
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,540
That's not difficult.

601
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,160
I have a formula.

602
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,080
If you use it consistently morning and evening,

603
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,610
I guarantee that your hands

604
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,530
will become delicate and fair.

605
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,120
Is that true, Miss Ming?

606
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,920
Absolutely.

607
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,200
You just need to get motherwort,

608
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
atractylodes, cardamom,

609
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
and a bit of pearl powder.

610
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,660
I'll teach you how to prepare the formula right now.

611
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,320
B-But...

612
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,250
I'll be just in Rong'er's quarters.

613
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,040
After you bring the ingredients,

614
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,640
I can

615
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
prepare a batch

616
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,770
for Rong'er as well.

617
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,480
I'll be back soon.

618
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,460
Have you cleaned the study?

619
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,920
I'll be right there.

620
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,040
Hurry up, hurry up!

621
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,920
Hurry up, hurry up! Move faster!

622
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,000
It's you.

623
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,360
Sir, please show mercy.

624
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,120
I am a guest in the household.

625
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,200
I only entered this place

626
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,400
because I lost my way.

627
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,770
If I'm gone for too long,

628
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,040
the household will surely become suspicious.

629
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,520
At that time,

630
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
it would bring you

631
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,780
unnecessary trouble.

632
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
Why don't you let me go?

633
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,500
I promise to keep my lips sealed...

634
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,760
as if we never met today.

635
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,020
Only one kind of person

636
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,120
can truly keep their lips sealed.

637
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,580
I swear!

638
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,160
As long as you let me

639
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,120
go unharmed,

640
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
I'll go back now.

641
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
From then on, I won't leave the house

642
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,520
or speak a word.

643
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,920
I've never entered

644
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,800
Liang's study,

645
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,120
haven't seen any secret room,

646
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
and certainly haven't seen anyone!

647
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,620
Miss, your eloquent words...

648
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,330
are hardly convincing.

649
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,450
First, he was chased by the officials,

650
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,960
and now he's sneaked into Liang's secret room.

651
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,020
Looks like he's undoubtedly a thief.

652
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,090
I have to find another way to deal with him.

653
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,780
Your actions, I assume, are out of desperation.

654
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,440
You don't want the Liang family to discover you,

655
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,370
and neither do I.

656
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,360
I also have my reasons

657
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,400
for risking coming here.

658
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,280
Since we both came here with our own purposes,

659
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,340
why don't we each take what we need...

660
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,320
and stay out of each other's way?

661
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,270
Leave now.

662
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,200
Have you searched everywhere?

663
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes.

664
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,600
Both the eastern and western quarters.

665
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,120
But there's no sign of Miss Ming.

666
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,360
I don't know where she can go.

667
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
You can't even keep track of a person.

668
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,800
If the one in the main hall gets suspicious,

669
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,960
and we lose Chancellor Su's trust,

670
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,490
I'll hold you responsible!

671
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,540
This is government silver.

672
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,730
Could it be that the Duke of Ling

673
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,840
has been secretly embezzling official funds?

674
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,920
So you're trying to steal government silver?

675
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,250
This is a serious crime.

676
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,000
If you have difficulties in life,

677
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,640
taking some jewelry to pawn would be enough.

678
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,920
Don't risk your life for a bit more silver.

679
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,400
A court case is no trivial matter.

680
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,930
It's none of your business.

681
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,240
If I expose this first,

682
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
what would happen to the Liang family?

683
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,610
When things get out of hand,

684
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,520
Liang Zixuan will have no chance

685
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,320
of marrying me.

686
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,810
This matter...

687
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,580
is indeed none of my business.

688
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
Then I'll take my leave.

689
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,380
Take care, sir.

690
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Stop right there.

691
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,650
You...

692
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
What do you want?

693
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
What...

694
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,160
do you want?

695
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,680
Don't come any closer.

696
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,320
This is not what you should take.

697
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,280
Since we're each taking what we need,

698
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,010
you have no right to interfere.

699
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,080
Isn't all this silver

700
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,409
enough for you to steal?

701
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,760
The thing you want is not here.

702
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,780
If you don't leave now,

703
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,239
beware of bringing trouble upon yourself.

704
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,440
A thief,

705
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,080
yet so righteous?

706
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,159
I've never encountered anyone quite like you.

707
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,860
Aunt, why are you here?

708
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,330
Where are you going?

709
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,360
I've been sitting in the room for a long time

710
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,490
and wished to take a walk in the garden.

711
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,650
Where is Zixuan?

712
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,270
I've had no appetite lately

713
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,560
and wanted something sweet.

714
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,040
He insisted on going out to buy me some.

715
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,600
Don't go out today.

716
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,960
Go back to your room and rest.

717
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Has something happened?

718
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,600
Do not meddle

719
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,680
in household matters.

720
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,940
Just behave yourself.

721
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,510
Don't blame me for being strict.

722
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm doing this

723
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,440
for you and Zixuan.

724
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,970
Aunt, rest assured.

725
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,770
I know my place.

726
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,120
I will definitely not cause any trouble

727
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,720
for Zixuan or the household.

728
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,200
You stay here

729
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,370
and look after Miss Zhu'er.

730
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:36,760
Come.

731
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,610
Miss Zhu'er,

732
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,980
let me help you inside.

733
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,950
You plan to move all of this silver?

734
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,000
How will you manage

735
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,680
such a thing

736
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,290
in broad daylight

737
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,400
without alerting a single soul?

738
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Sir, if you need,

739
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,000
I can create a diversion

740
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,520
to make it convenient for you to act.

741
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,400
I only ask for one bar of government silver.

742
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,960
I won't fight for anything else.

743
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,520
No need.

744
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,690
Have you already come up with a plan?

745
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,320
No.

746
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,360
It's normal to cause alarm

747
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,280
during escape.

748
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
No one can guarantee absolute success.

749
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,500
If you don't leave now,

750
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,120
you'll be considered my accomplice.

751
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,650
The evidence and witnesses will be complete.

752
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,920
I just

753
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,720
want one silver bar as evidence!

754
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm not trying to split the loot with you!

755
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,760
With so much silver

756
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,560
easily within your grasp,

757
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,800
why are you so stingy?

758
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
Be it...

759
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,420
one bar

760
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
or just a tael,

761
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,720
you'll still be courting death.

762
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
If you want to stay

763
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,010
and bear the theft charge for me,

764
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
I don't mind.

765
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,700
Very well, I'll leave.

766
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,640
Tan.

767
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Tan.

768
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,600
Wake up.

769
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,240
Tan?

770
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,120
Tan?

771
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,960
Minmin.

772
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,220
You're finally awake.

773
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,360
If you hadn't woken up,

774
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
I was about to rush to Duke of Ling's mansion

775
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,560
and make them pay.

776
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
How did I get back?

777
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,840
Your godmother,

778
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
along with people from the Duke of Ling's household,

779
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
sent you back.

780
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,720
When Suxin and I saw

781
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
you being carried in,

782
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
we nearly fainted from fright.

783
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,120
Luckily, the doctor said

784
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,280
you only fainted

785
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,240
from shock.

786
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Where is my godmother?

787
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,440
Your godmother and the others watched over you

788
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
for several hours.

789
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,120
Seeing that you still hadn't awakened,

790
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,520
they had to return first.

791
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,400
Was there anything unusual in the Liang household?

792
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,640
I should be the one asking you!

793
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,440
How did you end up

794
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,760
fainting in Liang Zixuan's study?

795
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,520
Study?

796
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,760
Shouldn't I have been in the secret room?

797
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,400
Tan,

798
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,760
did you find something?

799
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,520
I did,

800
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,800
but I didn't get concrete evidence.

801
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,660
Might as well have found nothing.

802
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,440
It's all that troublemaker's fault.

803
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,280
He ruined my plan many times.

804
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,120
If it weren't for him,

805
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,800
I would have obtained the evidence long ago.

806
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,870
Troublemaker?

807
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Who is that?

808
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,650
Let's not talk about it now.

809
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,480
Suxin!

810
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,840
My Lady, you're awake.

811
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Are you all right?

812
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,840
Have our people keep a close watch on the Liang's Mansion.

813
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,440
The servants

814
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,600
have been watching

815
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,120
as you ordered.

816
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,040
Now we need to watch

817
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,840
not only Liang Zixuan and Zhu'er

818
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,920
but also everyone in that household.

819
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,750
If anything happens,

820
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,060
report to me promptly.

821
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
Yes, My Lady.

822
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,480
Tan.

823
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,570
Did something happen in the Liang family?

824
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
Nothing has happened yet,

825
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,040
but that doesn't mean

826
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,770
we won't be implicated by them.

827
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
If my marriage

828
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,510
isn't called off soon,

829
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,560
our family

830
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,090
might be implicated in trouble for no reason.

831
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,730
Wait...

832
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,760
Silver... where's my silver?

833
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,400
How... how could this happen?

834
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,180
Your Grace.

835
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,850
It's Prince of Dingbei.

836
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,600
The Dingbei Army is owed nearly a million taels
in unpaid military wages.

837
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,720
Today, I've recovered only a fraction

838
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,280
of the embezzled funds from your household.

839
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,480
The rest of the accounts

840
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,560
will be settled later.

841
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,070
[Liang Qiwei, Duke of Ling]

842
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,960
How is this possible?

843
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,360
Why would the Prince of Dingbei be in the capital?

844
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,240
Two years ago,

845
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,480
[Zhang Ji, Scribe of the Duke of Ling's Household]

846
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,720
when the former Vice Minister of Revenue
embezzled military funds,

847
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,000
the Prince of Dingbei returned to the capital

848
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,720
and beheaded him directly.

849
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,360
What...

850
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,040
should we do now?

851
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,600
I'm not the only one

852
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,330
who embezzled military funds.

853
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,520
This matter is so far-reaching

854
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,760
that even His Majesty might not dare to investigate.

855
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
How would he dare to act recklessly?

856
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,660
I'm afraid that the Prince of Dingbei...

857
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,280
has come fully prepared.

858
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,520
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

859
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,440
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

860
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,960
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

861
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,490
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

862
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,560
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

863
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,090
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

864
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,370
Greetings, Chancellor Su.

865
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,160
[Shu Wei, Right Chancellor of Xian]

866
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Tan!

867
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,070
Jiurou.

868
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,920
It's been a long time.

869
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,440
Mother.

870
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,520
Just now, Mrs. Li,

871
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,920
with so many watching,

872
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
was clearly trying to

873
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,000
bring up

874
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,730
her son's marriage to me.

875
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,160
I just pretended not to hear

876
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,220
and didn't give her the opportunity.

877
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,450
How shameless.

878
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,360
Even after such a scandal in her household,

879
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,480
she still acts like nothing happened.

880
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,040
She's truly composed.

881
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,320
Tan.

882
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,640
Looks like

883
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,510
[Zhai Nianci, Princess of Fengzhao]

884
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,760
that Princess of Fengzhao

885
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,960
is still holding a grudge against you

886
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,960
for the Chrysanthemum Banquet's Floral Queen title.

887
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,760
It was just a meaningless title

888
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,480
that people at the banquet

889
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,000
made a fuss about.

890
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,050
Is that really worth her spite?

891
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,760
Besides,

892
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,880
didn't she end up

893
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
winning the Floral Queen title in the end?

894
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,160
She pulled a long face in front of everyone,

895
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,560
so who would dare to compete with her?

896
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,080
Only she cares about such things.

897
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,520
His Majesty and Her Majesty have arrived!

898
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,430
[Lu Ting, Commander of the Imperial Guards]

899
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,320
-Long live Your Majesties.
-Long live Your Majesties.

900
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,720
You may rise.

901
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,390
[Jiang Heng, Chengkang Emperor of Xian]

902
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,090
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

903
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,840
The Lantern Festival

904
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,400
is a time for reunion.

905
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,240
Recently, we've achieved a great victory in Dongzhou.

906
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,960
The Prince of Dingbei dealt a major blow
to the Beihe invaders,

907
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,680
reclaimed our lost territory,

908
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,040
restored peace and tranquility to our Xian's borders,

909
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,100
[Zhang Huaiyuan, Empress of Xian]

910
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,720
and allowed our people to rejoice in reunion.

911
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Such joy

912
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,320
should be shared together.

913
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,000
Your Majesty's benevolence and love for the people

914
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,780
are truly Xian's fortune

915
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
and a blessing to all your subjects.

916
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,560
-Your Majesty is wise.
-Your Majesty is wise.

917
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,570
Come on.

918
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,610
Let us all drink to this joy.

919
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,300
At today's Lantern Festival banquet...

920
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,490
only one person is missing.

921
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
The Prince of Dingbei has fought

922
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
through blood and fire for our realm

923
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,560
and has guarded the border for many years.

924
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,200
If he

925
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,040
could return today,

926
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,880
that would truly complete our reunion.

927
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,120
Your Majesty.

928
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,200
In the recent victory in Dongzhou,

929
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,520
the Prince of Dingbei earned immense merit.

930
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,880
I humbly suggest

931
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,600
that we

932
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,360
raise a toast

933
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,800
to the Prince and the Dingbei Army,

934
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,840
who are still enduring hardship in the frozen north.

935
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,600
Okay.

936
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,800
The Prince of Dingbei has arrived!

937
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,640
Why did the Prince of Dingbei suddenly
return to the capital?

938
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,040
His Majesty doesn't seem

939
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,320
to have issued a summons.

940
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,440
Could something have happened at the northern border?

941
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,770
The victory at Dongzhou was only days ago.

942
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,970
It shouldn't be.
