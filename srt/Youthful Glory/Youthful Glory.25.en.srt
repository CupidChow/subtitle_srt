[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 25]

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,600
A wise man knows how to
adapt to circumstances.

4
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,759
If you're willing to hand over evidence
of the Su family's crimes

5
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,160
and demonstrate your loyalty to the court,

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,450
you can rest assured of keeping
your position at the bureau.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Lord Yin, you're currently

8
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,800
just acting as a temporary head
of the Maritime Trade Bureau.

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
If you report them,

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,770
the vacant position of
Maritime Trade Commissioner

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,330
will undoubtedly be yours.

12
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,140
But if you remain obstinate...

13
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,160
and continue to shield and harbor them...

14
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,540
then within three days...

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,560
these memorials

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,800
will be presented before the Emperor.

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,740
His Highness speaks bluntly

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,500
but with good intentions.

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,370
Otherwise,

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,840
why would His Highness have come
to the banquet today?

21
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,030
Lord Yin,

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,960
His Highness values you

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,710
and wants to give you an opportunity

24
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,510
to atone for your past mistakes.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,480
They say that the first one to report
receives the greatest credit.

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,510
You gentlemen have gained

27
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,320
a head start on promotions and titles.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,780
Would you really want to hand
that opportunity over to others?

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,820
This matter is urgent,

30
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
but we can't be hasty about it.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,740
Why don't we have the dishes served

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,500
and discuss this while we eat?

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Servants, serve the dishes.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,010
It's starting. It's starting.

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Distinguished guests fill the hall,
and treasures have been assembled.

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's see who will claim them as everyone
displays their abilities.

37
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
You are all valued patrons here.

38
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,640
Without further ado,

39
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,520
let's begin the auction.

40
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,430
-Okay!
-Good.

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
Item No. 1 for auction:

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,320
a pure gold reliquary box
featuring a flat lid

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,250
and a Wisdom Wheel–shaped finial.

44
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,120
This reliquary was used by the revered
monk Yinchuan, who returned from the West

45
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,050
to safeguard the Buddhist dharma.

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,170
After Yinchuan's passing,

47
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,590
his relics were enshrined within it.

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,830
The reliquary has been missing
for nearly 100 years

49
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,470
and has only recently come to light again.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
The starting price is 100 taels of gold.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,329
No matter how precious this reliquary is,

52
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,649
it's worth half that price at most.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,720
The Su family is setting such
an outrageously high starting price.

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,920
There must be something fishy going on.

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,200
The item from Yinchuan is one thing,

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,060
but the main point is that it once
contained relics!

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
More than half a year ago,

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,690
I acquired

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,230
a crown of Amitabha Buddha

60
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,600
for only 50 taels of gold.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
However, just three months later,

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,980
I sold it for triple what I paid for it.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Then this reliquary must also be
a lucrative investment.

64
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,000
Indeed.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,190
110 taels.

66
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,350
120 taels!

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,480
150 taels!

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,500
200 taels!

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
We have 200 taels.

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
400 taels!

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,530
400 taels?

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,250
-400 taels, going once!
-Ming Chu?

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
She received the imperial edict

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,480
to reflect on her actions at home
behind closed doors.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
So why is she here?

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,240
Congratulations, Young Madam Feng.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,910
Item No. 2 for auction:

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,260
a gilt floral and bird-patterned
incense holder.

79
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,310
This incense holder once belonged to
the Taoist nun Ruoxu

80
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,800
from the previous dynasty.

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,050
Taoist nun Ruoxu

82
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,440
personally drew the design
and crafted it herself.

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,680
The starting price is 600 taels of gold!

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,330
The starting price is already 600 taels.

85
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,920
The starting price is already 600.

86
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Lingzhou truly lives up to its reputation.

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
Each of these auction items

88
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,960
is of great value

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
and rare in the world.

90
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,500
No wonder

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,840
the invitations to the auctions

92
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,159
are so hard to come by,

93
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,570
and people are scrambling for them.

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,200
Those people went to great lengths
to get in here,

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,590
all for the purpose of buying

96
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,840
and reselling for profit.

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,600
But someone like you, Fourth Miss,

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,550
who knows how to appreciate

99
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,110
and cherish these items—

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,840
I have encountered very few

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,120
such people in my lifetime.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,640
Mr. Wen, you flatter me.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
I simply have

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,520
a bit of insight into the everyday items

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,380
favored by women, that's all.

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
800 taels.

107
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
We have 800 taels!

108
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
850 taels.

109
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
850 taels.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,120
900 taels!

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
900 taels!

112
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,840
1,000 taels!

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,820
1,000 taels!

114
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,800
Indeed, with deep pockets, it's easier
to win bids.

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,260
-There are always higher bidders.
-First call at 1,000 taels!

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,720
1,500 taels.

117
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,020
1,500 taels?

118
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,120
First call at 1,500 taels!

119
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,720
Second call at 1,500 taels!

120
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,290
Third call at 1,500 taels!

121
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,080
Sold!

122
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,480
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

123
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,000
How generous Mr. Wen is

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
with his bids.

125
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,880
The gilt incense holder with floral
and bird patterns.

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,409
Please take a look, Mr. Wen.

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,570
Fourth Miss, would you like to
take a look?

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
This item was not smuggled.

129
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,320
And what was just auctioned

130
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,280
is also genuine treasure.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Neither of them has anything to do
with smuggling.

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Could I have been mistaken?

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,530
Exquisitely crafted.

134
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
Elegant and grand.

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
It's worth spending a fortune on.

136
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,659
This incense holder is indeed delicate.

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,040
I just hadn't expected

138
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,640
that you would be interested

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
in incense items.

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,200
What it is exactly doesn't matter.

141
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
What matters is

142
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,290
that it's a relic of Ruoxu
from the previous dynasty.

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,000
Fourth Miss, am I correct?

144
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
Yes.

145
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Ruoxu was extremely skilled in
making incense.

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,530
It was said that her incense

147
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,480
could preserve one's youthful appearance
forever.

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,370
It's a pity

149
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,440
that her secret incense recipes
have been lost.

150
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,120
Only these relics remain

151
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,110
for people to remember her by.

152
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,580
This incense burner stand

153
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,570
is not something from our Xian.

154
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,640
Today has truly been
an eye-opening experience.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,780
Not only is each auctioned item

156
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,820
unique and priceless,

157
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,760
but even the accessories for these items

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,280
appear to be worth a fortune.

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,800
Miss He, you truly have a discerning eye.

160
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,380
So auctioning rare items is just a cover,

161
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,210
while peddling smuggled goods

162
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,430
is the real purpose

163
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,540
of this auction.

164
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,880
What a clever ruse.

165
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,820
These smuggled goods

166
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,610
are even more valuable

167
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
than the actual treasures being auctioned.

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,290
No wonder the starting prices are so high.

169
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,780
[Together through the cold,
reluctant to see the year unfold]

170
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,060
[Qiuyue, Musician]

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
I am Qiuyue.

172
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
At that time, I had just finished
verifying the tax records

173
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,150
and was about to send word to you

174
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,280
to discuss our next step.

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,390
Unexpectedly, a musician named Qiuyue

176
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,190
approached me

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,140
and told me that before Zhou Baoping died,

178
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,170
he had left behind

179
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,240
a list of officials who had accepted
bribes from the Su family.

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,050
However,

181
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
that very night,

182
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
we were both attacked by assassins.

183
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,560
And then...

184
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,760
I've been stuck here in frustration
ever since.

185
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,030
Where is the list?

186
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,560
It hasn't reached my hands yet, of course.

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Then how can we get in touch with her?

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,460
I don't know either.

189
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,240
Since I was attacked,

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,170
she must also be hunted by the Su family.

191
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,900
She won't show herself easily.

192
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,280
However,

193
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
since everyone knows you've come here,

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
she will definitely find a way

195
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
to contact you.

196
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,680
[Together through the cold,
reluctant to see the year unfold]

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,040
Your Highness, spare me.
Your Highness, spare me.

198
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Your Highness, spare me.

199
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,240
Get out of here now.

200
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,440
Yes.

201
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

202
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
Miss Qiuyue?

203
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,520
Not me.

204
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,390
Not me...

205
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,700
Your Highness.

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
My life, fortune,

207
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,070
and career

208
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,660
will all depend on Your Highness
from now on.

209
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,380
The Su family ordered Yu Bozhong

210
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,400
to control the entire
Maritime Trade Bureau.

211
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,040
For years, they've issued maritime trade
permits indiscriminately,

212
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,730
arbitrarily increased levies,

213
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,480
and protected smuggling merchants.

214
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
I've kept backup records

215
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
of every single illicit act

216
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,780
to protect myself!

217
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
-I too am
-I too am

218
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,230
-willing to follow Your Highness's lead.
-willing to follow Your Highness's lead.

219
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,360
I'll go back and organize the evidence
right away

220
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,160
and submit it to Your Highness
as soon as possible.

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,880
I'll take my leave now.

222
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
I'll go see the officials out.

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,590
Get me all documents

224
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,840
from the past ten years:

225
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
maritime trade permit records,

226
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,570
secret tax collection accounts,

227
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
and ledgers of merchant bribes

228
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
kept by the Maritime Supervision Office.

229
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,480
Be careful.

230
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,150
Do not draw any attention.

231
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
-Yes.
-Yes.

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,890
Lord Yin.

233
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,270
I should offer you my respects in advance,

234
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,740
Commissioner Yin of
the Maritime Trade Bureau.

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
A wise man chooses whom to serve.

236
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
The Su family is already a spent force.

237
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,180
They can't blame me

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,100
for choosing a new master.

239
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,190
When you rise to high rank someday,

240
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
My Lord, please don't forget

241
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,120
my role in facilitating this today.

242
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
Well, Miss Qingyu,

243
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,560
how would you like me to repay you?

244
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't be too hasty, My Lord.

245
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,600
My Lord, since you've gained
His Highness's favor,

246
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,460
your future is surely promising.

247
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,890
It's just

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,850
that I'm somewhat worried about you,
My Lord.

249
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,080
Although the Su family is on the verge
of collapse,

250
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,150
their roots run deep.

251
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,320
If they find out you've turned against
them, your old master,

252
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,580
they certainly won't let you off easily.

253
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,400
You know all too well

254
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,340
what the Su family is capable of, My Lord.

255
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,480
My old master?

256
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,250
I have always received

257
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,640
the imperial court's salary,

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,050
and my loyalty is to the Emperor of Xian.

259
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,890
What does that have to do
with the Su family?

260
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,400
In that case,

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
I've been overly concerned, then.

262
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,630
A night together is more precious
than gold.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,620
I must thank you today

264
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,100
for showing me the right way forward.

265
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Ma'am.

266
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
I have some matters

267
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,040
at my other shop

268
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,700
that I need to attend to first.

269
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,320
Mr. Wen, Miss He,

270
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,600
please enjoy yourselves.

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,860
I'll take my leave now.

272
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,560
Ms. Su, please go ahead
with your business.

273
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:11,090
[Shengyi Inn]

274
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,730
My Lord.

275
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,400
My Lady.

276
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,770
I have found Qiuyue here.

277
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,270
The musician who was romantically involved

278
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,330
with Zhou Baoping.

279
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,790
After Zhou Baoping stole the evidence,

280
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,620
he went into hiding at her place.

281
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,920
And now she appears here...

282
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,570
Could it be...

283
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
that Zhang Huaiyu hasn't

284
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
gotten his hands on that evidence?

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,130
She came here today,

286
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,520
certainly to take a risk

287
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,560
and meet the Prince of Dingbei directly.

288
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,000
Go quickly and finish her off

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
to prevent further complications.

290
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,890
[Zhang Daoyuan, Prefect of Lingzhou]

291
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,990
Your Highness, may I ask

292
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,160
what has happened here?

293
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,680
I...

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,030
don't know.

295
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
Prefect,

296
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,280
the deceased is

297
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
Lord Yin from the Maritime Trade Bureau.

298
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
The woman on the bed is only unconscious,

299
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,840
and her life is not in danger for now.

300
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,580
This woman is

301
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,160
Miss Qingyu from the Hui House.

302
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,320
Before coming here for the banquet,

303
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,360
she sought me out.

304
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,220
She said the Prince of Dingbei...

305
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,610
She said

306
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,120
she noticed that the Prince of Dingbei

307
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,370
was intentionally coercing Lord Yin
and other officials

308
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,440
to conspire with him,

309
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
with the intention
of framing the Su family

310
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
for controlling the Maritime Trade Bureau

311
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
and embezzling from
the maritime trade economy.

312
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,250
Qingyu also said

313
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,000
she felt the Prince of Dingbei had
a violent temperament

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
and was unpredictable in his moods.

315
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,800
She feared that if Lord Yin
and the other officials refused,

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,330
they would be killed by him.

317
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,610
So she came specifically to inform me.

318
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,500
Who would've thought that something
actually happened?

319
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,880
I've heard that after Your Highness
entered Lingzhou,

320
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,920
you've been targeting
the Su family all along,

321
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,880
yet no solid evidence

322
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,210
against the Su family has ever been found.

323
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,720
Targeting the Su family?

324
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you have any evidence, Prefect?

325
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,360
The Prince of Dingbei was sent here
by His Majesty himself.

326
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,640
How he conducts himself,

327
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,120
our Su family wouldn't dare to complain
in the slightest.

328
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,980
Your Highness,

329
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,100
during your stay in Lingzhou,

330
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,960
whatever you wanted or did,

331
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,810
our Su family

332
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,540
has complied with everything.

333
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,190
Seeing no way forward, Your Highness

334
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,640
was unwilling to return empty-handed,

335
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,240
so you attempted to coerce Lord Yin

336
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,160
to conspire with you

337
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
to frame the Su family.

338
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,260
But Lord Yin,

339
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,180
loyal and upright,

340
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,390
refused to comply.

341
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,120
As a result, in a fit of rage,

342
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,580
Your Highness killed him to
vent your anger.

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,090
Is that what happened, Your Highness?

344
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,640
Nonsense.

345
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,550
Prefect.

346
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,920
Now that we have caught the culprit
red-handed with evidence,

347
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,980
it is an established fact

348
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,240
that the Prince of Dingbei
privately executed

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,800
a high-ranking court official.

350
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,040
I urge you, My Lord,

351
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,120
to report to the capital
as soon as possible,

352
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,320
informing His Majesty
of the Prince of Dingbei's crimes.

353
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,120
It's been a good while,

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,240
yet your guard has not yet returned.

355
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,330
Do you need

356
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,890
me to send someone to check?

357
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,210
To be able to make this auction

358
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,950
so lively

359
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,300
and well-organized,

360
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,160
Mr. Luo is indeed talented.

361
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,800
I wonder,

362
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,390
is Mr. Luo

363
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,310
your man

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
or Ms. Su's?

365
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,840
Why do you ask this, Fourth Miss?

366
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,600
Actually, Mr. Wen,

367
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,760
you could see what's wrong

368
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,620
with Mr. Wu's batch of fabrics

369
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,020
at a glance.

370
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,420
I asked Mr. Wu about it afterward,

371
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,840
and he said you

372
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,720
must be well aware of this matter.

373
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,360
Moreover, in Lingzhou City,

374
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,610
the only one who can turn

375
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,470
worthless stock into profit

376
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
is you, Mr. Wen.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,330
Mr. Wu's fabric

378
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,400
was sourced from Mr. Luo.

379
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,860
But how would a gold store manager

380
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,240
know the source of the fabric?

381
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,740
The small vendor who sold me
the hairpin earlier

382
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,660
also said the source was Mr. Luo.

383
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,500
The common thread between

384
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,340
this hairpin and the fabric—

385
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
I suppose you

386
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
are well aware of it too.

387
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,730
Seems I was blind to the truth

388
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,480
and set up a maze for myself.

389
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,320
I suppose

390
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,380
your visit to Lingzhou City this time

391
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
is not for sightseeing

392
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,430
or broadening your horizons.

393
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
How is this not broadening my horizons?

394
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,940
I couldn't figure it out before.

395
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,970
You don't run any shops,

396
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,840
nor do you have any actual business,

397
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,480
so how do you make a profit?

398
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,840
No matter how clever a broker is,

399
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,520
their earnings are limited.

400
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,620
When you were at the Fu Lu Gold Store
that day,

401
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,500
I suppose you weren't there just to

402
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,430
patronize the business, were you?

403
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,170
If the source of Mr. Luo's goods

404
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,840
is you,

405
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,600
then this business becomes
quite interesting.

406
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,960
You first sell goods anonymously,

407
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,980
earning money from the Su family,

408
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,960
then use the Su family's auction business

409
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,640
to earn another commission.

410
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,920
Thus, you profit from both ends,

411
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,120
doubling your money.

412
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,920
Fourth Miss, you're the most brilliantly
intelligent woman

413
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,480
I have ever encountered in my lifetime.

414
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,230
However,

415
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,660
Fourth Miss, being so frank like this...

416
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,870
aren't you afraid I might harm you?

417
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,130
Mr. Wen, your identity is a mystery,

418
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,290
and your abilities are deeply hidden.

419
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,110
I, a mere woman,

420
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,200
am no match for you.

421
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,290
But what if your opponent

422
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,440
is the Prince of Dingbei?

423
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, what happened?

424
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,770
What's going on?

425
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,550
Who are you people?

426
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,920
Stop!

427
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,450
Who are you?

428
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,000
By what right are you detaining me?

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
General Xuanwei's third son

430
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,680
-is my...
-We are His Majesty's personal guards,

431
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,480
carrying out the imperial order!

432
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,720
Upon seeing this golden token,

433
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,280
it's as if you're in the presence
of the Emperor himself!

434
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,610
[Order]

435
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,680
My Lord,

436
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
all auction items in the back hall
are evidence

437
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,580
and must be taken without exception.

438
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
You two, go to the back hall quickly.

439
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,920
Count the items, make an inventory,

440
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,000
and leave nothing out!

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,530
Yes, sir!

442
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,440
By order of the Imperial Inspector,

443
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,760
this place will be designated as

444
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
his temporary office and court of inquiry.

445
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,720
Everyone present today

446
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
is not allowed to leave
without permission!

447
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,040
Anyone who disobeys

448
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,220
will be treated as enemy spies,

449
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,840
with their entire clan implicated

450
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
and executed without mercy!

451
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,770
Ming Tan. Ming Tan! Ming Tan!

452
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,120
Kneel down.

453
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,650
Ming Tan!

454
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Ming Tan!

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
Tan, it's me!

456
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,920
I'm your third sister, Ming Chu!

457
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,720
Shut up!

458
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,510
Ming Tan, Tan,

459
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,600
Father is gone.

460
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,610
I'm the only kin

461
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,600
you have left in this world!

462
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,340
No matter what,

463
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,680
you can't just leave me like this,
Ming Tan!

464
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,410
Another word, and you'll be charged
with defying imperial orders!

465
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,760
Ming Tan!

466
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Ming Tan?

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
You are the Princess of Dingbei?

468
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
We've only known each other
for a few days,

469
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,670
yet each day,

470
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,580
you seem to

471
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,080
surprise me anew.

472
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,080
However, today's surprise

473
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,260
is truly beyond all my expectations.

474
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
The Prince of Dingbei owns

475
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,600
many private properties in the capital.

476
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,300
I usually manage various shops,

477
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,580
so I do know

478
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,260
a thing or two about business.

479
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,120
Calling myself half a merchant

480
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,640
isn't really a deception, is it?

481
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,190
I have been foolish.

482
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,390
Mr. Wen, who are you really?

483
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,810
And how many secrets

484
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,720
are you hiding in the dark?

485
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,800
Your Highness, are you interrogating me?

486
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,370
Regarding the interrogation,

487
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,140
it'll certainly be handled by
the Imperial Inspector

488
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,580
and the Imperial Guards.

489
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,960
I wonder

490
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,060
if your delicate physique

491
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,040
can endure their methods.

492
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,120
Since the Imperial Inspector has
personally come to handle the case,

493
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,840
I will certainly cooperate

494
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,410
and tell everything I know.

495
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,410
However, this auction

496
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,120
was organized by the Su family,

497
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
and all the auction items

498
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,720
were purchased by the Su family as well.

499
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,360
As a mere broker,

500
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,000
I was never involved in it.

501
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,560
No matter how relentless
the Imperial Inspector may be,

502
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,470
they wouldn't subject a mere spectator
like me

503
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,110
to torture or forced confession,
would they?

504
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Go wait inside the hall.

505
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
Do not move around freely,

506
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,360
and do not speak carelessly!

507
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
Fourth Miss, regardless of
what your identity is,

508
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,400
meeting you...

509
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,520
has been an honor.

510
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,950
Sir knew that after the auction,

511
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,680
Your Highness's identity would surely
be revealed.

512
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,770
So he sent secret guards to protect you
in secret.

513
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,570
However,

514
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,920
there will be more incidents
in the city today.

515
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,600
Sir asks Your Highness

516
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,120
to avoid moving alone as much as possible.

517
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
With the Imperial Guards present,

518
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,680
the Su family won't dare make a move
against Your Highness.

519
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,600
Sir also said that he'll take care of
his side,

520
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,920
so Your Highness need not worry about him.

521
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,580
Why has my husband become
more and more nagging?

522
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,660
Your Highness.

523
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,640
This case involves a court official,

524
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,170
and the situation is grave.

525
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,260
I have no choice but to handle
this matter formally.

526
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,050
I must ask Your Highness

527
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,760
to come with me.

528
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
This is a crime scene.

529
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,560
Yet, Prefect,

530
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,120
rather than arranging personnel
to investigate

531
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,850
and gather evidence promptly,

532
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,440
you're in a rush to leave.

533
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
Isn't such an investigation

534
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,850
rather hasty?

535
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,610
You need not concern yourself with this,
Your Highness.

536
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,760
After Your Highness leaves,

537
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,840
I will send people to investigate

538
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,700
and find out the...

539
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,100
But I don't trust you.

540
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,050
Since this matter concerns my innocence,

541
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,860
I will remain here.

542
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,090
Please, Prefect, resolve the case
immediately.

543
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,920
Whatever questions or investigations
you have,

544
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,490
I will comply completely.

545
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,960
Well... what...

546
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,590
Prince of Dingbei,

547
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,790
don't try to stall for time

548
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,620
and look for a chance to escape!

549
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
If I wanted to leave,

550
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,800
none of you...

551
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,160
could stop me.

552
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,710
Guards!

553
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,100
Take the Prince of Dingbei into custody!

554
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
What are you standing there for?

555
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,810
Seize him now!

556
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,740
The Imperial Inspector, appointed
by His Majesty,

557
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,400
Lord Tan, Vice Minister of
the Central Secretariat, has arrived!

558
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,980
Well...

559
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,090
[Tan Lun, Imperial Inspector]

560
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,990
Seal off the inn and search thoroughly!

561
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,640
No one is allowed to leave
without permission!

562
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes, My Lord!

563
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,170
Chancellor.

564
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,420
I have found out that His Majesty

565
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,320
appointed Tan Lun, the Vice Minister
of the Central Secretariat,

566
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,640
as the Imperial Inspector,

567
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,880
who, several days after
the Prince of Dingbei left the capital,

568
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,610
secretly went to Lingzhou.

569
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,770
So what if the Imperial Inspector
went there?

570
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,310
Even if Errong's plan has a flaw,

571
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,980
the Prince of Dingbei will hardly

572
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,290
leave Lingzhou alive.

573
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,840
Chancellor, with your masterful planning,

574
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,670
I assume

575
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,050
you must have already prepared
a contingency plan.

576
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,400
Zhang Daoyuan, Prefect of Lingzhou,

577
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,640
greets Imperial Inspector Tan, My Lord.

578
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,900
I have been ordered to inspect Lingzhou,

579
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,560
eliminating long-standing malpractices
and supervising suspicious cases.

580
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,660
This case is of great importance.

581
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,590
I will personally preside over it.

582
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,080
My Lord, you have traveled day and night

583
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,250
to arrive here

584
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,200
and must be extremely exhausted.

585
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,480
Why don't you rest for a day,

586
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
and we can begin the trial tomorrow?

587
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,640
As for the Prince of Dingbei,

588
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
I will keep him under strict surveillance

589
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,300
and ensure he has no

590
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,640
opportunity to escape!

591
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,170
I have my own procedures
for handling matters

592
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,330
and need no interference from others.

593
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,360
My Lord.

594
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,730
The facts of this case
are actually quite clear

595
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,960
with solid evidence.

596
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,840
Perhaps it'd be better to
leave the trial to me.

597
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
That way, you may

598
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,220
spare yourself unnecessary toil.

599
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,560
Prefect Zhang, do you know

600
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,420
what an Imperial Inspector is?

601
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,440
To judge right from wrong,
uphold the great principles,

602
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,370
tour all provinces of the empire
by imperial decree,

603
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,160
and exercise authority over the promotion
and demotion of all officials—

604
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,440
that is what an Imperial Inspector does.

605
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,120
Lord Zhang, you should be clear

606
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
that this case is no small matter.

607
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,320
Should there be the slightest misstep,

608
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,580
your position as the prefect of Lingzhou

609
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
may be jeopardized.

610
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,280
I shall follow your lead in this, My Lord.

611
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,720
With you personally investigating,

612
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,320
the truth of the case will surely
come to light.

613
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
I will judge the case here and now!

614
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,140
Your Highness,

615
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,580
upon investigation,
among the auction items,

616
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,280
there were indeed smuggled goods hidden.

617
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,240
However, those merchants

618
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,890
all claim to be unaware of
the inside details,

619
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,630
believing them

620
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,760
to be ordinary treasures for auction.

621
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
This is not the first time they've
held an auction here.

622
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
They must have

623
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,460
rehearsed their statements long ago,

624
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,960
preparing for any eventuality.

625
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
According to my investigation,

626
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,770
Mr. Luo has been dealing in illicit goods

627
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,770
for some time now.

628
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,720
In this case, he certainly can't escape
responsibility.

629
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,800
As for whether there are

630
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,160
others behind him,

631
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,080
we need to investigate further.

632
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,360
Today, all those who attended the auction

633
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,560
must be detained and questioned
one by one.

634
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
Their residences and private estates
must be thoroughly searched,

635
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,310
as well as their relatives

636
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,910
and regular associates.

637
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
We must not overlook any

638
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,880
clues related to smuggling.

639
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,800
The smuggled goods are being inventoried.

640
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,050
All those in the auction hall

641
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,720
are being detained and questioned
in the back hall.

642
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,830
Among them is one called Wen Zong.

643
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,480
Commandant, I hope you will personally
interrogate him.

644
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,880
Earlier, I suspected

645
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,160
that Wen Zong and Mr. Luo
were closely associated

646
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,680
with deeper secrets involved.

647
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,110
However, Wen Zong is very discreet

648
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,560
and cautious in his actions,

649
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,360
seemingly on good terms with everyone,

650
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,490
yet appearing to have no connections.

651
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Therefore, I hope you, Commandant,
will investigate thoroughly,

652
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,690
neither wrongly releasing him

653
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,200
nor overlooking anything.

654
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,330
Very well, I'll see to it immediately.

655
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,480
Wait.

656
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,850
I have to trouble you, Commandant,

657
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,320
to send someone to General Xuanwei's
mansion

658
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,450
and summon Young General Feng here
immediately.

659
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,580
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,400
I am Feng Xulin,

661
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,740
paying my respects to Your Highness.

662
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,920
Bring her out.

663
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,000
It's all my fault for not keeping
Ming Chu in check,

664
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,800
allowing her to roam recklessly

665
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,090
and stir up trouble.

666
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,800
I know Chu's temperament

667
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,720
all too well.

668
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,780
Back then, Father and the Prince

669
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,880
knew that your Feng family was full of
loyal heroes

670
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,640
and had strict family discipline,

671
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,360
which is why they felt at ease
letting her marry you.

672
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,280
Chu has been willful and capricious
since childhood,

673
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,640
accustomed to being defiant

674
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
and unable to bear restraint.

675
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,970
However this matter turns out,

676
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
the blame does not lie with
your Feng family,

677
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
much less with you, Young General Feng.

678
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,960
Xulin!

679
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,720
Xulin!

680
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,840
What kind of sister are you?

681
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,620
Ming Chu.

682
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,640
Just now, when I was in trouble,

683
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,010
not only did she treat me like a stranger,

684
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,910
but she also stood by

685
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,350
and let me be bullied!

686
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,340
When I was in the capital,

687
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,220
she was always at odds with me!

688
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,110
Now that I'm living in here,
so far from her,

689
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,710
she still wants to step on me!

690
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,820
You just want me to be humiliated
in public

691
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,130
and shamed before all in Lingzhou too!

692
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:11,659
Enough.

693
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,190
Xulin!

694
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,330
She clearly bullied me first!

695
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,760
If you had listened to me

696
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,639
and stayed home to reflect on
your actions,

697
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,320
how would you

698
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,920
have gotten involved in
these troubles today?

699
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,770
Young General Feng, do you know

700
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,040
that the treasures Chu purchased today

701
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,420
at Xianquan Restaurant

702
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,150
all contain smuggled goods?

703
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,320
I didn't.

704
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,159
Chu,

705
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,960
Father was punished,

706
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,460
and our Ming family's property
was confiscated...

707
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,730
all because of the crime of smuggling.

708
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,080
As a daughter of our Ming family,

709
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,360
you should have detested
such matters deeply.

710
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,480
How could you stoop to the same level
as them?

711
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,679
I... I didn't know the inside story.

712
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,250
I thought they were
just ordinary treasures!

713
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,700
Young General Feng, you should understand

714
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,780
whether smuggling

715
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,180
is a major or minor crime.

716
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,110
The Imperial Inspector will

717
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,680
certainly investigate this case thoroughly

718
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,640
and will not let anyone off lightly.

719
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
These two

720
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
are the Imperial Guards I've discussed
with the Commandant

721
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,120
to send to search your place.

722
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,880
Our Feng family has been loyal
for generations

723
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,900
and would never be involved in smuggling.

724
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,760
Your Highness,

725
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,630
if Ming Chu really committed

726
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,720
such treasonous acts without the family's
knowledge,

727
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,180
neither my father nor I...

728
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
would show her any mercy.

729
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,950
Since you know how serious this matter is,

730
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,250
you should know that if I'm implicated,

731
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,280
I'll surely suffer the consequences!

732
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,730
Yet not only do you not help me escape,

733
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,200
but you also expose this
to the Feng family

734
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,620
and send the Imperial Guards
to search our mansion!

735
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,200
Ming Tan,

736
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,930
what exactly are you thinking?

737
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,650
Shut up.

738
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,590
Ming Chu,

739
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
things have come to this point,

740
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
and you still don't realize your mistake?

741
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,760
Smuggling is a serious offense.

742
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,560
All those involved in today's auction

743
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,920
must have been arrested by now,

744
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,250
awaiting property confiscation,
house searches, imprisonment, and trial.

745
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,880
Her Highness is considering
our Feng family's reputation,

746
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,100
and even more so for you, her sister,

747
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,960
to suffer less and be less criticized.

748
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,620
That's why she singled you out

749
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,810
and only sent two Imperial Guards
to search the mansion.

750
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,460
Your Highness,

751
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,090
thank you for today.

752
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Come back with me.

753
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,830
My Lord.

754
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,120
My Lady,

755
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,400
she escaped.

756
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
Lord Tan,

757
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,800
the witness has regained consciousness.

758
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
Whether the Prince of Dingbei killed
Lord Yin out of personal vengeance,

759
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
you'll know once you ask.

760
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,980
Witness,

761
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,650
step forward and speak.

762
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,430
I, Qingyu, pay my respects to you,
My Lord.

763
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,800
Qingyu,

764
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,660
was it under the command of

765
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,690
the Prince of Dingbei that you arranged

766
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,690
the banquet today
and extended the invitation?

767
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,440
My Lord,

768
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,080
yes.

769
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,760
Did the Prince of Dingbei

770
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,680
coerce Lord Yin

771
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,770
into accusing the Su family of crimes?

772
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,480
My Lord,

773
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
yes.

774
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,200
How did the Prince coerce him?

775
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,320
Tell me in detail.

776
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,280
The Prince of Dingbei

777
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,760
listed all the crimes committed by
Lord Yin

778
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,720
one by one,

779
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,330
and made him reveal the Su family
during the banquet.

780
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,680
His Highness said

781
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,320
that if Lord Yin knows what's good
for him,

782
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,380
he could ensure Lord Yin's
smooth career advancement.

783
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,280
Otherwise...

784
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,080
the consequences would be dire.

785
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,760
Did you personally witness

786
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,480
the Prince of Dingbei committing murder?

787
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,800
Then why were your clothes disheveled,

788
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,660
and why did you faint in this room?

789
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,610
Were you violated by someone?

790
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,680
What if you're the War God of Xian?

791
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,130
Daring to go against the Su family,

792
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,480
your fate will be the same as the others.

793
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,410
My Lord, you've misunderstood.

794
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,140
I never said

795
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,050
that Lord Yin was killed
by the Prince of Dingbei,

796
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,330
and I've also never been violated.

797
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,410
Don't try to be evasive in front of me.

798
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,150
Speak the truth.

799
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
My Lord,

800
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,330
today's banquet

801
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,360
was indeed arranged by the prince

802
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,900
to host Lord Yin
and three other officials

803
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,700
from the Maritime Trade Bureau.

804
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
During the banquet, though His Highness

805
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,060
pressured them with words,

806
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,200
he was only trying to help them

807
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,000
and pull them out of the Su family's mire

808
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,260
before it was too late.

809
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,920
Everything that happened today was,

810
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,740
in truth…

811
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,120
orchestrated by Su Errong,

812
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,520
the head of the Su family!

813
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,100
My Lady.

814
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,250
My Lady.

815
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,510
Utter nonsense!

816
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,770
A mere courtesan,

817
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,120
changing sides so easily,

818
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,840
shameless and without morals!

819
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
How can her words be trusted?

820
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,920
My Lord,

821
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,470
I dare not speak falsely.

822
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,770
The wine that the Prince of Dingbei

823
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,720
and Lord Yin drank

824
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,320
had been drugged in advance.

825
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,610
Ms. Su

826
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,290
instructed me to lure Lord Yin here

827
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,280
and kill him after he fell unconscious

828
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,000
in order to frame the Prince of Dingbei.

829
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,800
Come on.

830
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,440
I must thank you today

831
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,780
for showing me the right way forward.

832
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,550
Every word I've said is true.

833
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,930
The Prince of Dingbei is indeed innocent.

834
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,880
Qingyu,

835
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,820
why did you aid the Su family
in such a scheme?

836
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,850
My Lord,

837
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,260
I'm merely a lowborn courtesan
of Hui House.

838
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,840
My fate was never mine to choose.

839
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,380
Had I not obeyed orders
and played my part,

840
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,610
I would have been sold off at best,

841
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,260
or, at worst...

842
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,880
lost my life.

843
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,340
Lord Tan,

844
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,700
this wench must have

845
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,520
received favors from the Prince of Dingbei

846
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,440
and conspired with him
to frame our Su family!

847
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
That's why she's making
such wild accusations!

848
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,000
I didn't ask you!

849
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,720
Qingyu,

850
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,120
do you have any evidence
to accuse Su Errong?

851
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,460
Of course, there is evidence.

852
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
Bring the person in.

853
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,490
What...

854
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,520
Qiuyue pays her respects to My Lord,
the Imperial Inspector.

855
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,070
Qiuyue deeply thanks Your Highness
for saving my life.

856
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
If it weren't for Your Highness's help
today,

857
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,050
I would have already lost my life here.

858
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,280
Miss Qiuyue?

859
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,810
Not me, not me...

860
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,440
Witness, who are you,

861
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,120
and what is your connection to this case?

862
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,780
Tell us from the beginning.
Scribe, take notes.

863
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,920
I, Qiuyue, a humble citizen,

864
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,400
was originally a musician at Muchun House.

865
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,470
The late Associate Commissioner
Zhou Baoping

866
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,070
of the Maritime Trade Bureau

867
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,040
used to frequently visit

868
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,240
Muchun House to request performances.

869
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Due to our shared interest in music,

870
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,570
I gradually became acquainted
with Lord Zhou...

871
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,570
and we became kindred spirits.

872
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,050
Six months ago, one day,

873
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,040
Lord Zhou

874
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,080
gave me a list

875
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,500
and asked me to leave Lingzhou City
as soon as possible.

876
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,400
He said he had uncovered a list

877
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,130
of officials who had been bribed
by the Su family.

878
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,080
But the Su family had become
aware of this.

879
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,610
He knew his fate was sealed.

880
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,720
Following Lord Zhou's instructions,

881
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,650
I tried to flee the city that very night
with the list.

882
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,960
However, the Su family was well prepared

883
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,280
and strictly examined everyone
leaving the city.

884
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,010
I had no choice but to turn back.

885
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,720
But then I was shocked to learn
that Lord Zhou

886
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,600
had died suddenly from overindulgence

887
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,660
with courtesans at the Muchun House.

888
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,600
He was unwilling

889
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,280
to side with the Su family,

890
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,600
which is why he was silenced

891
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,500
and his lifelong reputation was destroyed!

892
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,720
I implore you, My Lord,

893
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,380
to bring justice for Lord Zhou

894
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,690
and restore his honor!

895
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,990
You claim that Zhou Baoping

896
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,400
was silenced by the Su family.

897
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,620
Do you have any evidence?
