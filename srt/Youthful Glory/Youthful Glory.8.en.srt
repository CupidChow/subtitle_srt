[Episode 8]

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,640
Jiang Xu.

4
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,780
If I knew it was so dangerous to marry you,

5
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,470
I might as well become a nun.

6
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,430
If you are really as wise and mighty

7
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,680
as Father said,

8
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,170
just show up.

9
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,759
I don't want to

10
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,789
die young.

11
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,210
His Majesty granted the marriage.

12
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,780
This is the highest honor and favor.

13
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,740
Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion
and Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

14
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,730
are becoming a marriage alliance.

15

[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

16
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,250
Today is the wedding.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
It's full of joy.

18
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,750
Anyone who congratulates

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,090
will be rewarded with money...

20
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,090
-Congratulations.
-For good luck.

21
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,950
Suxin.

22
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,680
My Lord.

23
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,900
Is there any news

24
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,270
from His Highness?

25
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,350
Madam of Auspicious Fortune
has been waiting in the backyard

26
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,140
for quite some time.

27
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,350
If this continues,

28
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,829
I'm afraid we won't
be able to keep it a secret.

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,420
Even if we can't, we must.

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,350
Today's wedding must
proceed without any mishap.

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,820
His Majesty personally
bestowed this marriage.

32
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,750
What kind of girl

33
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,230
could be so fortunate?

34
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,100
Indeed.

35
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,420
I heard that on the day of the betrothal,

36
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,530
the Prince of Dingbei made a special effort

37
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,579
to add many more gifts.

38
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,860
You should have seen

39
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,730
the betrothal gifts.

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,790
The Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
is truly exceptional.

41
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,260
It's different from

42
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,860
ordinary noble families.

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,660
Isn't it?

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,420
Ladies.

45
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,030
-Congratulations, My Lord.
-Please, stay your steps.

46
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,950
Here's the situation.

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,140
Tan caught a chill

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,600
before bed last night.

49
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,820
She's not feeling well.

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,720
Early this morning,

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,030
she complained of a severe headache

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,490
and can't stand any noise.

53
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,670
By the way,

54
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,420
the ladies are all in the backyard.

55
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Perhaps you could go there first

56
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,790
to have some tea and catch up.

57
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,660
-That sounds good.
-Okay.

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,310
Quickly,

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,860
attend to the ladies properly.

60
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,390
Ladies, take care as you go.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:30,900
My Lord,

62
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,930
Chancellor Su and his wife have arrived.

63
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,460
Guard the courtyard well.

64
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,520
No one is allowed to enter.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,250
Yes, My Lord.

Chancellor Su.

69
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,820
You've finally arrived.

70
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,700
Well,

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,820
as Tan's godparents,

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
you haven't been attentive enough.

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,420
You've come quite late.

74
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,680
When we arrive

75
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
isn't important.

76
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,010
Even the best godparents

77
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,310
are still guests.

78
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,030
No, no, no.

79
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,310
If you say that,

80
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,440
I won't be happy.

81
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,270
Think about all those years

82
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,850
when I wasn't in the capital.

83
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,900
You took care of Tan.

84
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,470
Though I often bicker with you,

85
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,800
I remember your kindness

86
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,570
to Tan.

87
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,310
If you stopped bickering with me,

88
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,110
that would truly be unsettling.

89
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,800
Indeed.

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,220
Alright, enough joking.

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
At our age,

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
we should be more dignified.

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,830
I'll go check on Tan

94
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,150
and have a private chat with her.

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,630
Madam.

96
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,490
I have a gift for her as well.

Madam, here's the situation.

98
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,930
Tan caught a chill

99
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,490
and is suffering from a severe headache.

100
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,020
When I went to see her earlier,

101
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,070
I was turned away.

102
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,020
Perhaps we should wait a bit.

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,580
You'll naturally see her

104
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,310
during the bridal procession.

105
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,830
Even though you're her biological father,

106
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,909
you're still a man.

107
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,390
Tan naturally wouldn't want to see you now.

108
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,220
I've been like a mother to Tan for years.

109
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,950
She wouldn't mind such things.

110
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,480
No.

On such a joyous day,

117
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,380
why are you so anxious?

118
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,130
Could there be something wrong?

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
What could be wrong?

120
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,670
Of course.

The joy of marrying off a daughter

is life's greatest happiness.

131
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Indeed.

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,310

I've come to see Tan

and have a private chat with her.

Please don't be offended, Your Grace.

Her Ladyship has a headache today

140
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,430
and instructed early on not to see anyone.

141
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,580
Tan is ill?

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,510
That makes it even more important
for me to see her.

Your Grace,

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,990
Her Ladyship is resting.

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Perhaps you could go to the backyard first.

146
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,260
Once Her Ladyship is dressed,

147
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,630
it won't be too late to see her.

148
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,670
What time is it now?

149
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,110
Tan is still resting?

150
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,670
If she misses the auspicious time
for departure,

151
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,780
it would be bad luck.

152
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,820
Yes, yes.

Please rest assured, Your Grace.

154
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,310
Her Ladyship is aware

155

Perhaps you could go to the backyard first

and rest for a while.

158
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,070

Your Grace.

161
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,770

to be ill to avoid people.

Please forgive me, My Lady.

and I couldn't stop her.

Is it a severe cough?

Fourth Miss,

176
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,810
the medicine is ready.

177
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,380
You should drink it while it's hot.

178
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,240
It'll help cure the cough faster.

179
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,200
Greetings, Your Grace.

180
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,670
Fourth Miss, be careful

181
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,530
not to pull off the veil.

182
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,220
Earlier, during the face-painting,

183
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,380
Madam of Auspicious Fortune
repeatedly reminded us

184
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,510
that the veil

185
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,310
must be removed by you

186
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,870
after bidding farewell to your parents.

187
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,600
Otherwise, it's considered
very inauspicious.

188
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,190
Your Grace,

189
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,580
wouldn't you agree?

190
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,020
Naturally.

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,480
is meant to bring good luck.

193
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,430
Tan,

194
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,110
this is a small token from me.

195
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,260
Come,

196
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,780
let me put it on for you.

197
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,380
The auspicious time is near.

198
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,850
You should prepare to depart.

199
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,430
I'll go wait in the front hall.

200
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,310
Tan.

201
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,390
Didn't we agree

202
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,860
I'd see your makeup first?

203
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,460
Why did you already

204
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,390
cover your face with the bridal veil?

205
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,260
Miss Minmin.

206
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,650
This...

207
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,320
Lyu'e?

208
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,640
Miss...

209
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,390
Miss Minmin.

210
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:12,890
What...

211
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,580
What's going on?

212
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,460
Where is Tan?

213
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
Thankfully, Madam of Auspicious Fortune
from the palace

214
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,820
has never seen Fourth Miss before,

215
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,480
Otherwise, this wouldn't
have held up till now.

216
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,430
What exactly happened?

217
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,360
Where did Tan go?

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,910
We don't know.

219
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,680
We can only keep it secret
for as long as we can.

220
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,500
What time is it?

221
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,310
My Lord.

222
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,970
It's now the auspicious hour.

223
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,620
Wasn't it said that Prince of Rui

224
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,700
would come to escort the bride?

225
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,900
Why isn't he here yet?

226
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,950
Yeah.

227
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,130
Could something have gone wrong?

228
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,310
The auspicious hour has arrived.

229
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,860
Why hasn't Tan come out yet

230
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,590
to bid farewell to her parents?

231
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,550
It's...

232
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,620
Could it be that you're reluctant
to part with your daughter

233
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,150
and decided to hide her?

234
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,950
How could that be?

235
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,860
Hard to say.

236
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,150
The auspicious hour is here.
Begin the bride's ritual.

237
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,310
Great!

238
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,270
Chancellor Su, please.

239
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,550
Alright.

240
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,340
Spring is the first of seasons,

241
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,340
and filial piety is the foremost of virtues.

242
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,500
The precious daughter marries today,

243
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,500
bidding farewell with tears to her parents.

244
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,790
Tan.

245
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,120
Today you are getting married,

246
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,520
As your father, my heart is full of comfort.

247
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,700
In the days ahead, with the prince,

248
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,820
you must treat each other with respect,

249
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,550
support one another to old age,

250
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,100
work as one in both

251
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,390
joy and hardship.

252
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,970
That's enough,

253
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,220
Don't delay the auspicious departure time.

254
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,270
Go quickly now.

255
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,390
Tan.

256
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,460
Tan.

257
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,390
I find it hard to part with you.

258
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,270
After you enter
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

259
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,470
do come back to visit our mansion often,

260
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,050
and spend time with me and your godfather.

261
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,220
Hurry and go,

262
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,150
the auspicious time is almost over.

263
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,950
Tan,

264
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
we didn't even get to meet earlier

265
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,030
at Zhaoshui House.

266
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,090
Now at your wedding farewell,

267
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,530
surely I

268
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,600
should at least have a proper look at you?

269
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,510
One glance, and I'll be at ease.

270
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,840
No.

271
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,980
How dare you!

272
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,620
Such behavior

273
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,970
shows no respect to your elders.

274
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Minmin, don't be rude.

275
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,890
Old man, you don't understand.

276
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,670
If the bridal veil of a new bride

277
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,250
is lifted by someone else,

278
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,020
it's considered unlucky for her marriage.

279
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,430
Isn't that right,
Madam of Auspicious Fortune?

280
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,790
It is indeed.

281
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,310
Your Grace's action is rather improper.

282
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
My wife and I

283
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,310
have treated Tan as our own.

284
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,980
To take one last look as we send her off,

285
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
what's wrong with that?

286
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,070
If there really is any bad luck,

287
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,670
let it all come to me instead.

288
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,500
Go on, then.

289
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Who dares to lift the bridal veil

290
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,270
and ruin my wedding's blessing?

291
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,100
The Prince of Dingbei
has personally come to escort the bride,

292
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,090
as a sign of his deep regard

293
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,100
and wish for good fortune.

294
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,480
Your Highness, why did you come in person?

295
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,910
My humble self and daughter

296
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,710
are truly honored beyond words.

297
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,340
Lady Su is my daughter's godmother.

298
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,860
Her reluctance to part is only natural.

299
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,000
She may have acted a bit out of line,

300
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,290
I hope Your Highness

301
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,170
will not take offense.

302
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,050
Since father-in-law has spoken,

303
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,150
I shall obey.

304
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

305
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,640
Princess consort, please lift your veil,

306
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,040
shield your face with the wedding fan,

307
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,510
and follow me to the carriage.

308
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,030
Princess consort, are you alright?

309
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,950
Your Highness...

310
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,860
Jiang Xu!

311
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,570
Help!

312
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,630
Help!

313
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,690
Since Lady Su

314
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,480
is so full of motherly love,

315
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,700
Let the princess consort
say goodbye to her in person.

316
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,540
So she won't

317
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,950
lose sleep

318
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,050
and skip meals from sorrow later.

319
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,910
Godparents, I have been cared for

320
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,109
by you for many years.

321
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,109
Such affection,

322
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,190
I will remember always.

323
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,060
Today, I must also bid farewell to you

324
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,070
and thank you for your love.

325
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,120
What godmother gave today,

326
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,580
I will

327
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,630
treasure dearly,

328
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,190
and regard it as a precious gift.

329
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,220
The bride is leaving home!

330
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,300
Father,

331
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,430
I bid farewell to you.

332
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,220

Your Highness,

377
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,430
I entrust her to you.

378
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:45,470
♪ Don't be afraid,
I'll go wherever you go ♪

379
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,510
He's finally a married man now.

380
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,020
I used to think

381
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,060
Xu's personality was so cold,

382
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,540
He'd be the last

383
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,060
among us to marry.

384
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,740
Who knew he'd be the first?

385
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,910
And not just first.

386
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,630
He married a refined, graceful,

387
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,110
and delightfully spirited lady.

388
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,350
Even I, a marriage-phobe,

389
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,500
felt a little moved.

390
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,350
Thankfully, the ladies in the capital

391
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,300
all have good taste

392
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,830
and wouldn't be interested
in someone like you.

393
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,260
I only seek one sincere heart.

394
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,060
Whether other ladies fancy me

395
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,110
matters not.

396
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,300
Without comparison,

397
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,260
you'd never know.

398
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,320
Look at my cousin-in-law's bearing,

399
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,590
then look at yourself...

400
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,520
Cousin-in-law?

401
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,350
Since the Prince of Dingbei married Tan,

402
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,810
that naturally makes him my cousin-in-law.

403
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,960
What are you staring at?

404
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,020
Why are you snatching my pearls?

405
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,380
This is wedding money,

406
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,870
prepared by my cousin-in-law.

407
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,390
Besides,

408
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,590
who ever heard of a bridal procession
without wedding money?

409
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,390
And you all.

410
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,500
As groomsmen, don't be stingy.

411
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,950
Here.

412
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,740
The more wedding money, the luckier it is!

413
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,630
Here.

414
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,920
All for you.

415
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,060
Is the money enough?

416
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,120
Is the luck enough?

417
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,640
Very lucky.

418
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,390
You're even more money-minded than me.

419
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,590
Truly, birds of a feather

420
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,060
flock together.

421
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,740
You two

422
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,610
do look quite compatible.

423
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,980
Even the way you fan yourselves

424
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,220
is perfectly in sync.

425
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,460
I...

426
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,350
Who's compatible with him?

427
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,780
Let's depart.

428
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,470
[Integrity and Honor]

429
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,060
Read the imperial decree.

430
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,310
[Integrity and Honor]

431
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,630
By imperial decree,

432
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,460
to Miss Ming,
legitimate daughter of Marquis of Jing'an,

433
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,300
graceful and intelligent,
raised in a noble family,

434
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,070
of complete virtue, gentle and kind,

435
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,980
is hereby conferred
the title of Princess of Dingbei,

436
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,880
to preside over the affairs
of the household.

437
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,950
So decreed.

438
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,840
I, your humble subject, thank Your Majesty
for your immense grace.

439
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,240
[Integrity and Honor]

440
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,700
Congratulations, Your Highness.
Congratulations, Your Grace.

441
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,110
I offer my congratulations here.

442
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,730
The auspicious hour has come.

443
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,920
Begin the ceremony.

444
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,250
[Integrity and Honor]

445
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,820
On this auspicious day,

446
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,940
the daughter of the Ming family
weds the son of the Jiang family.

447
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,650
We pray this union

448
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,540
brings lasting harmony and good fortune.

449
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,840
May they be blessed with five sons and two daughters,
attended by maids and servants.

450
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,060
May the sons become great ministers,

451
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,430
and the daughters marry into noble houses.

452
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,300
From this day forth,

453
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,110
may the couple
live a long and prosperous life.

454
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,860
[Late Father, Lord Jiang Lingchuan]
[Late Mother, Lady Xu Moru]

455
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,630
Now the fan-lifting ritual.

456
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,700
Let's skip these tedious formalities.

457
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,110
Let the princess consort rest early.

458
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,830
Your Highness, no matter how eager you are,

459
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,090
the proper rites must still be observed.

460
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,300
Your Highness, please compose a poem

461
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,630
to lift the bridal fan.

462
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,810
In youth and beauty this very night,

463
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,190
a flower blooms among crimson leaves.

464
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,220
Clearly a gem among mortals,

465
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,830
why hide her face with a jeweled fan?

466
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,950
Your Highness, the princess consort

467
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,810
feels your sincerity is lacking.

468
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,830
Yes.

469
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,590
If His Highness can't compose a better poem,

470
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,590
that fan simply

471
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,260
won't be lifted today.

472
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,390
A beauty like a shun flower in her boudoir,

473
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,860
now marries
with blessings into another home.

474
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,950
We first met through mountain mists,

475
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,030
your shy face reflected on the water,
more beautiful than flowers.

476
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,370
He actually remembers

477
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,150
that we first met at the Hanyan Temple.

478
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,450
Your Highness.

479
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,910
That poem

480
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,540
doesn't seem to move the princess.

481
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,670
Why not try another one?

482
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
Yes.

483
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,910
Yes, yes! One more!

484
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,300
With little adornment of silver or gold,

485
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,950
her noble grace shines through naturally.

486
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,250
Fear not the winds and snow ahead,

487
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,020
I vow to walk with you for life.

488
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,460

489
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,590

Come in.

528
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

529
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,740
Your Grace.

530
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,230
If you have any injuries,

531
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,360
be sure to apply medicine promptly.

532
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,770
Please rest well.

If you're hungry, just inform the kitchen.

534
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,780
The phoenix crown is too heavy.

535
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Why not remove it?

536
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,260
My Lady, are you hurt?

537
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,340
Do you feel unwell?

538
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm fine.

That's good to hear.

540
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,750
You truly frightened us.

541
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,500
Thank heavens

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,330
the wedding is finally over.

543
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,160
My Lady,

544
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,200
you don't even know

545
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,260
how dangerous this morning was.

546
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,150
We almost got caught...

547
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,530
Several times.

548
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,990
My Lady.

549
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,910
Let's take off the phoenix crown.

550
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,900
It's really heavy.

551
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,860
Come, please.

552
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,770
Your Highness.

553
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,300
Your Highness.

554
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,950
I offer my congratulations, Your Highness,

555
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,230
Wishing you

556
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,660
many sons and daughters.

557
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,240
Thank you, everyone.

558
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,160
Your Highness,

559
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,940
you know I'm not good with words,

560
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,450
And I don't have much learning.

561
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,810
Later I'll drink a few

562
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,900
more cups with you

563
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,860
to express everything I can't say.

564
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,140
Back in the army,

565
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
Your Highness never touched
a drop at victory banquets.

566
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,830
But today is your wedding,

567
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,210
you can't turn us down again!

568
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,930
Exactly!

569
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,830
Come on, Your Highness!

570
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,150
Here, Your Highness!

571
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,630
Alright, alright, alright.

572
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,950
Come.

573
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,950
I know Xu

574
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,790
is strict in the army and cold by nature.

575
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,590
Normally,

576
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,080
you wouldn't dare overstep.

577
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,810
But today, you've seized
the chance to have fun,

578
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,140
hoping to get him drunk.

579
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,350
In that case, while Xu

580
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,620
is still sober,

581
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,560
I'd better give him
a few proper words of advice.

582
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,220
Fine.

583
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,060
Can't deny it.

584
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,180
His Highness is quite thoughtful.

585
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,600
Of course a husband

586
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,230
should be considerate
and attentive to his wife.

587
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,400
Naturally.

588
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,450
Otherwise, how could His Highness

589
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,380
have gone personally
to the our mansion to fetch you?

590
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,330
He didn't

591
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,230
even tell me beforehand.

592
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,590
His Highness must have worried
you'd overexert yourself,

593
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,720
so he came on his own.

594
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,270
With him here, who would dare make trouble?

595
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,390
For His Highness to act this way...

596
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,650
He must truly care about me.

597
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,240
So attentive and considerate,

598
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,760
always paying attention.

599
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,830
If this isn't affection,

600
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,030
what else could it be?

601
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,260
Yu.

602
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,300
Are you really up to something,

603
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,490
or just being mysterious again?

604
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,090
You'll find out soon enough.

605
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,040
Lord Liu,

606
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,390
without you these past few years,
the Ministry of Revenue

607
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,880
wouldn't have made it.

608
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,190
You know it's true.

609
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,740
You go ahead first.

610
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,500
Thanks to you.

611
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,700
I'll be right behind.

612
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,330
Since Lord Liu took office,

613
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,830
the messy accounts
that had piled up for years

614
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,600
have mostly been cleared.

615
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,670
Lord Liu is truly experienced.

616
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,220
Just a few days ago,

617
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,880
His Majesty personally praised him by name.

618
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,300
Lord Liu has always been diligent,

619
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,480
conscientious and meticulous.

620
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,260
He hasn't missed
a single roll call all year.

621
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,300
With him around,

622
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,460
the Ministry of Revenue

623
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,210
has had no issues for years.

624
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,430
Indeed.

625
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,390
But,

626
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,980
Lord Liu, why weren't you

627
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,640
seen on night duty yesterday?

628
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,270
Were you perhaps meeting with

629
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,430
some young lady after sunset?

630
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,270
Congratulations, Your Highness.

631
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,870
Best wishes on your wedding.

632
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,030
Congratulations, Your Highness.

633
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,389
Your Highness, please.

634
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,590
I hope the hospitality wasn't lacking.

635
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,500
I shall toast you all with tea

636
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,429
in place of wine.

637
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,830
Your Highness honors us.

638
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,179
Lord Liu.

639
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,139
Please.

640
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

641
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,700
Please enjoy yourselves.

642
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

643
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

644
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,350
Since when do you have dealings

645
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,010
with the Ministry of Revenue?

646
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,910
It's a wedding day.
Let's not talk about anything else.

647
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,440
Drinking is the main event.

648
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,950
I've searched high and low

649
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,100
to get this fine bottle.

650
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,950
I've been saving it for today,

651
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,460
to drink heartily with all of you.

652
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,140
The banquet starts at the third quarter
of the hour of the Dog.

653
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,910
Lu, are you so eager for wine?

654
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,390
You can't wait?

655
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,710
If you want to drink, do it yourself.

656
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,020
Xu stayed up all night

657
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
to save the princess consort.

658
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,170
He hasn't slept a wink.

659
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,060
If he starts drinking now,

660
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,620
how will he perform...

661
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,110
When he enters the bridal chamber tonight?

662
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,210
I invited him here

663
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,690
not just for drinks.

664
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,180
I really have something important to say.

665
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,780
Xu,

666
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,950
I know

667
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,270
you've fought valiantly
on the northern frontier,

668
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,870
But when it comes to

669
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,540
the ways of husband and wife,

670
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,020
you might still be a novice.

671
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,230
Yu is right.

672
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,190
In this area, you really
ought to listen to us...

673
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,780
To them.

674
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,020
To him.

675
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,870
Right.

676
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,180
Xu.

677
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,710
Now that you're married,

678
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,870
On your wedding night,

679
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,830
you mustn't be too distant

680
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,750
with your wife.

681
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,000
Think about it.

682
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,580
You're sharing a bed now.

683
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,460
She's shy.

684
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,100
You can't treat her
like you do everyone else,

685
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,140
so silent and withdrawn.

686
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,530
That...

687
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,220
Exactly!

688
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Saying a few more words

689
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,830
won't kill you.

690
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,440
Bad luck.

691
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,100
What an unlucky word

692
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,790
to say on a wedding day!

693
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,460
In short,

694
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,790
just follow my advice.

695
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,230
Talk about things

696
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,620
she likes.

697
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,170
And absolutely
don't mention war or military matters.

698
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,610
You can speak to her about

699
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,080
poetry, music, art, and literature.

700
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,060
You're not clueless.

701
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,190
Exactly. You've got to say something.

702
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,710
You can't just

703
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,640
get straight to the point.

704
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,660
Listening to you two,

705
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,320
you sound like seasoned pros.

706
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,420
How many wives

707
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,620
and concubines have you had?

708
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,330
We haven't married,

709
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,470
but in this area,

710
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,600
we still understand more than you do.

711
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,910
The phoenix and the dragon,
with modest wine,

712
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,950
await your honorable presence.

713
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,660
Esteemed guests,
please proceed to the banquet hall.

714
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,470
My Lady.

715
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,220
My Lady.

716
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,970
His Highness is on his way.

717
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,220
His Highness is almost here.

718
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,190
Here.

719
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,850
-Your Highness.
-Princess Consort.

720
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,550
Please speak, Your Highness.

721
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,850
Your abduction last night

722
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,400
was due to my failure.

723
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,430
Thankfully, you were clever,

724
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,780
and left clues

725
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,060
along the way

726
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,650
that led me to you.

727
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,280
Otherwise, today's wedding

728
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,790
would not have happened.

729
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,720
Your Highness overstates it.

730
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,500
If not for your timely arrival,

731
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,900
how could I have escaped?

732
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,100
You've saved me time and again,

733
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,210
and I have no way to repay you,

734
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,470
except with myself...

735
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,480
You haven't slept all night

736
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,190
and was frightened.

737
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,530
You must be exhausted.

738
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,560
It's getting late.

739
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,910
You should rest.

740
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,770
Sleep now?

741
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,910
You won't?

742
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,910
You still have something to do?

743
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,620
I...

744
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,570
I...

745
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,230
I can have something to do.

746
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,240
But...

747
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,010
But I haven't thought it through.

748
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,570
Your Highness.

749
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,750
This...

750
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,750
This isn't mine!

751
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,210
I swear it's not mine.

752
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,970
Your Highness,
I really didn't put that there!

753
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,580
This...

754
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,400
There's no need to explain.

755
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,790
I understand.

756
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,070
What do you understand?

757
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,600
This booklet has nothing to do with me.

758
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,570
I have to make that clear.

759
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,290
Even if it was prepared by you,

760
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,930
it doesn't matter.

761
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,660
Why did I sign the contract?

762
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,610
Now look what's happened.

763
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,540
Not only did it push him away,

764
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
it made him think

765
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,230
I'm being two-faced,

766
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,260
saying no but meaning yes.

767
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Come, come, come!

768
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,100
On such a joyful day,

769
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
let's toast!

770
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,840
The last time we drank this freely

771
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,990
was years ago.

772
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,000
I still remember when we first

773
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,830
entered court service,

774
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,130
how full of spirit we were.

775
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,230
In a blink,

776
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,460
decades

777
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,030
have passed.

778
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,870
But today,

779
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,590
why are you so quiet?

780
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,980
Could it be

781
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,390
that you still can't bear to part with Tan?

782
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,270
Come, come.

783
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,060
Have a drink to ease your sorrow.

784
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,170
Let's drink together.

785
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:12,980
Here.

786
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,860
Pour the wine.

787
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:24,900
Okay.

788
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,230
Please.

789
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,390
Last night,

790
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,310
Tan was

791
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,980
taken by members of the Haiyou Sect...
