3
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
Unreasonable and overbearing,
arrogant and willful.

4
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,890
What decent young man
would dare to marry you?

5
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
Petty-minded and pretentious,
shallow and frivolous.

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,220
What family's daughter
would willingly marry you?

7
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,170
Someone as noble and dignified as I am,

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
wrongfully accused for no reason,

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,400
and even imprisoned here by you.

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
Go ahead, report this to the authorities.

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll wait for the officials
to get to the bottom of this.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,930
And for you to offer an apology.

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
If you insist

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,720
on applying medicine to my wounds,

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,200
I suppose I could allow it.

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,520
I prepared a banquet
to show my sincerity.

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,880
Now that we're parting ways,

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
I entrust you with everything I have.

19
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,200
I only hope you understand my heart.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
And what heart would that be?

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,680
What a cold and heartless woman,

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,200
clueless in love and blind to emotion.

23
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,200
I gave her all I had.

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,760
I wonder when

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,760
she'll finally see my sincere heart.

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you for the birthday gift.

27
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,070

Him?

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
He's just a big fool.

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,890
Can't he just say what he means?

has been killed in Lingzhou!

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,020
What did he say?

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,050
I didn't hear that wrong, did I?

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,860

It's impossible!

No.

could've cleared
themselves of involvement,

141
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
so why go to such lengths

142
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
to search for him?

143
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,920
I suspect Yu held evidence

146
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,520

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
now that Yun Yi is in their hands,

152
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,200
she's bound to suffer.

156
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
wouldn't they do?

157
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,140
With Yun Yi in their hands,

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
she must be enduring torment
worse than death.

159
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,440
We must rush to Lingzhou

160
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,040
and demand they return her.

161
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Calm down.

162
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,040
Treat your wounds first.

163
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
We need a careful plan.

164
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,290
What's the point of being calm?

165
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,720
I know she's suffering and being tortured,

166
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,780
her life in danger,

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,680
and yet I cower here,

168
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,540

to train in martial arts.

173
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,800
Now I can't even protect

In the end, it's all empty.

If you won't go,

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
I will!

If something happens to you,

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,340

182
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
What about Yun Yi?

Yun Yi's abduction

192
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,160
has worried both me and Xu.

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,560
But her life is at stake,

194
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
we cannot act rashly,

195
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,680
or we may endanger her further.

196
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,680
If we

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
charge into the Su family to rescue her,

198
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
we'll only alert the enemy.

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
We have no proof

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,300
that Yun Yi is even in their hands.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,520
They might also

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,800
kill her to silence her

203
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,180
and destroy the evidence.

204
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,700
I understand you're anxious to save her,

205
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
but the more urgent the situation,

206
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,660
the more we must stay calm.

207
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
What my husband said earlier
about a careful plan

208
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,440
was not abandoning Yun Yi,

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,720
but ensuring everything goes flawlessly.

210
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
Let's move.

211
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,450
We ride to Lingzhou overnight.

212
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,500
It's still a full night's journey away.

213
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,720
The road is rough.

214
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Can your injuries bear the journey?

215
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,480
You and Second Young Master Shu
are close friends.

216
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
Why hold a grudge

217
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,480
over just a few harsh words?

218
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,920
Besides,

219
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
you're not someone

220
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,740
to be petty or narrow-minded.

221
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,060
After all these years of friendship,

222
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,390
he still doesn't understand my thoughts,

223
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,460
and treat me like someone heartless.

224
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,530
Then I must have misjudged him.

225
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Second Young Master Shu only
lashed out because he cares too much.

226
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,740
He spoke harshly in a moment of panic,

227
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,080
but deep down,

228
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,440
he just wants
to save Yun Yi as soon as possible.

229
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
If it were me who had been taken today,

230
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
you would be even more anxious

231
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
than he is.

232
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,440
What are you waiting for?

233
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,820
Aren't you always so capable?

234
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,720
Saving Yun Yi is urgent.

235
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,470
You should be racing there at full speed.

236
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,470
Taking a carriage just wastes time.

237
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,079
His Highness is saying one thing
and feeling another.

238
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,940
Second Young Master Shu,
don't take it personally.

239
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,880
Are your injuries serious?

240
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,290
What happened
to all that bravado just now?

241
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,250
To die nobly
or sacrifice myself for a cause,

242
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,220

243
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,370
on me making it to Lingzhou alive first.

244
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,760
So now you want to live?

245
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,000
I lost my temper earlier

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,860
and didn't think things through.

247

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
it's not just my parents
who would be devastated.

you don't even
realize how childish you are.

It looks peaceful and prosperous,

385

willing to act as their pawns.
