00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,200
I appreciate your kindness, Xu.

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,650
However, as we are traveling far to Lingzhou,

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,580
official matters take priority.

6
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,280
There's no need to delay our journey

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,740
for such trivial matters.

8
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,080
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,580
Your Highness,

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,039
which carriage should I put the luggage in?

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Yun Yi,

12
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,979
I have something else to tell you.

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Mr. Fu,

14
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,320
I have some matters

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,360
to consult with you about.

16
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,120
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,140
Could I borrow you for a while?

18
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,200
Sure.

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
After you, Second Young Master Shu.

20
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,010
Tan, are you sure you only want to keep two carriages?

21
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,960
Once you depart from the capital,

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,079
it will be too late to add more.

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
Xu, your kindness is overwhelming.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,220
I do not deserve such generosity.

25
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,490
Chai Gui,

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,240
after simplifying the luggage,

27
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,970
put everything in one carriage

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,500
and keep another one for passengers.

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,360
Yes.

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,770
Don't worry. Every few days,

31
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,810
I will write back

32
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,200
to let you know I'm safe.

33
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,240
I will eagerly await your letters every day.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
You must keep your word.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
Also, Tan,

36
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,160
if you hear any news about Zhang Huaiyu,

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
you must let me know.

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
Madam Yun, on this journey,

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,920
you're the only one by Her Highness's side.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,120
You must take good care of Her Highness.

41
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Is Miss Yun

42
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,760
really Qizhi's concubine?

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Don't worry.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,640
Wherever I am, Her Highness is too.

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,790
Jingran, what's your opinion?

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,370
I wouldn't dare.

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,280
I've just never heard you mention her before.

48
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,920
It seems to me

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,270
she and Her Highness are quite close.

50
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,270
Her Highness doesn't seem to mind.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
Tan doesn't mind,

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,360
but I think you

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
seem quite concerned.

54
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,680
I...

55
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,480
Alright, you can all go back now.

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,320
With all of you waiting for me,

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
I'll surely return soon.

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,079
Let's go.

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
Depart!

60
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,360
After Ming Tingyuan's death,

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,320
the Haiyou Sect has been keeping a close watch

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,080
on the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion,

63
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,800
but they haven't noticed

64
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,060
any unusual activity.

65
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,680
As for Ming Tingyuan's death,

66
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,210
perhaps I'm overthinking,

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,750
but Prince of Dingbei's trip to Lingzhou

68
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,350
will surely stir up trouble.

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,760
He is tough

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,460
and doesn't play by the rules.

71
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,320
Even though the Su family is fully prepared,

72
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,850
they might still find it difficult to handle.

73
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,880
Therefore, the Chancellor's intention

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,010
is for the Prince of Dingbei's journey

75
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,920
to be a one-way trip.

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,500
Rest assured, My Lord.

77
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,880
I've already sent people to monitor along the way,

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,530
and we'll act when the time is right.

79
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,000
Prince of Dingbei is traveling with the Princess Consort,

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
so he won't be unguarded.

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,340
The assassination must not alert them in advance.

82
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,330
Have someone keep an eye on it.

83
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,520
Wait for the Chancellor's orders.

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Plan everything carefully before taking action.

85
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,220
Madam Yun, when did you enter the Prince's mansion?

86
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,640
Two months ago.

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,480
What do you usually do

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
in the Prince's mansion?

89
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,610
Protect the Princess Consort.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,880
Is it so difficult to be a concubine these days?

91
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,560
So you only protect the Princess Consort

92
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,000
and don't need to take care of the Prince?

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,260
The Prince has Zhuiying take care of him.

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
So your role in the Prince's mansion

95
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,320
is actually the same as Zhuiying's,

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,800
only needing to ensure the Princess Consort's safety,

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,680
nothing more?

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,300
Are you a member of the Jinyun Guards?

99
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,760
Then,

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
what's your rank among the Jinyun Guards?

101
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,420
Is your martial skill top-notch?

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm sure your skills

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,660
must be extraordinary.

104
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,860
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Her Highness mentioned that you

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,200
are the most handsome man in the capital,

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
but she didn't mention that your questions

108
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,030
are also the most numerous in the capital.

109
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,760
It's the height of summer.

110
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,420
Sour plum soup can relieve the heat and fatigue.

111
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,990
It's so refreshingly cool.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,440
The cheese pastries from Changping Market

113
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,880
and the candied fruits from Sanliu Restaurant

114
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,560
are all your usual favorites.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,890
Tan,

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,760
are you still blaming me

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,330
for your father's case?

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,159
Do you truly want to know?

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,919
The one who framed the Ming family and my father

120
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,320
wasn't you.

121
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,800
So why would I blame you?

122
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
It's just that I have some doubts

123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
that remain unresolved.

124
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
During this time,

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,660
I haven't received an explanation from you.

126
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,730
Since you've brought it up,

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,650
I'll speak frankly.

128
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,920
When news of my father's ineffective disaster relief

129
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
reached the capital,

130
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
why did you immediately

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,680
lead the Imperial Guards to seal off the Ming's Mansion?

132
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,350
I was merely following orders.

133
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
Did the orders come from His Majesty

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,280
or His Highness?

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,050
When Zixuan was escorting my father back to the capital,

136
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,200
why did you

137
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,920
have the Dingbei Army secretly release my father?

138
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Wouldn't this

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,040
confirm that my father was fleeing from guilt,

140
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
framing him as dishonorable?

141
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,280
It was the Prince of Dingbei who volunteered

142
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,610
to escort your father back to the capital.

143
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,920
Do you know

144
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,200
who truly wants your father dead?

145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,840
It's your husband, the Prince of Dingbei.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,450
Why are you keeping silent, Xu?

147
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,920
Is it that you can't say it, don't want to say it,

148
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
or don't dare to?

149
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
Lu Ting is one of us.

150
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,200
He led the Imperial Guards to seal off the place

151
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,840
because we didn't want

152
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,280
any villains to take advantage of the situation

153
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
and frame your father.

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,810
I just didn't expect

155
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,320
that they would plant the evidence

156
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,200
in the Ming family's ancestral home.

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
That soldier accepted a bribe

158
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,340
and was bought off.

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,160
I anticipated that the other party

160
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
would definitely make a move during the journey,

161
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
so I had Shen Yu take precautions in advance.

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,080
However, in the end, the one we caught

163
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,810
was a soldier from our own army.

164
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
I have one more question.

165
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,920
That day in prison,

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,520
why did you try so hard to prevent me

167
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
from seeing my father one last time?

168
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Father!

169
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
I know

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
there was no way to change the outcome of the case.

171
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,320
All I wanted

172
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,800
was to see my father

173
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,460
and send him off one last time.

174
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Open your eyes and take a look.

175
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,400
Father.

176
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,160
Father!

177
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,680
I came too late.

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
I understand that you were

179
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,320
too busy to arrange it.

180
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,380
But that day, I was already in prison.

181
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,920
If you hadn't interfered,

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
I would have been able to see my father

183
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
one last time.

184
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,210
After leaving the capital,

185
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
were we followed?

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,440
There are three people.

187
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
Don't worry, Sir.

188
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,280
The secret guards are watching them. They haven't been alerted.

189
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,340
Stop the carriage!

190
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Get off the horse.

191
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
Jiang Qizhi, you asked me to speak frankly.

192
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,800
But when I did, you ran away.

193
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,660
Is this how you show your willingness to reconcile?

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
We've only been out of the capital for half a day,

195
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,200
and this is how you treat me.

196
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,960
How can we talk about marital affection in the future?

197
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Get down.

198
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,100
Where are we going?

199
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
To find medicine that can cure your heartache.

200
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,280
I won't go.

201
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,380
You don't have a choice today.

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Jiang Qizhi, put me down!

203
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,610
You guys go ahead first.

204
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,140
Meet at Shaxi in Suicheng.

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:40,980
Well...

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Get off the horse.

207
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,860
Some people are following us.

208
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,920
Let's go.

209
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
There really are a few people.

210
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,810
Let's go.

211
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,660
Where are you taking me?

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,380
You'll know when we get there.

213
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Where are we?

214
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,560

it is not the end.

It just requires taking some risks.

239
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,460
Before 1 a.m. tonight,

240
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Yu's convoy must leave the capital.

241
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,260
Depart, right away!

242
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,920
I must return as soon as possible.

243
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,620
[Capital]

244
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,520
So that day in prison,

245
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,980
everything that happened

246
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,720
was all planned by Xu in advance.

247
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,520
Yes.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,840
Then why didn't he tell me?

249
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,680
He didn't mention a word even afterward.

250
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Tan,

251
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
this is a crime of deceiving the emperor.

252
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
If there's the slightest mistake,

253
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,420
all those who know about it

254
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
will be punished by death.

255
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,280
His Highness did this

256
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
for your sake as well.

257
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,970
Chancellor Su is very suspicious.

258
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Even if I die in front of him,

259
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,680
he'll still send people

260
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,050
to keep a close watch on the Prince's mansion.

261
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
This isn't over yet.

262
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,720
I swear I'll do everything in my power to find a way.

263
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,960
Don't worry, Tan.

264
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,540
I'll take care of everything.

265
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,839
I misunderstood my husband.

266
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,520
If I didn't bring her here soon

267
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,579
to meet her father,

268
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,079
I'm afraid she would be

269
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,940
unhappy throughout the journey.

270
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,240
What's more worrying is

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,839
she might

272
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,700
hold a grudge against me for life.

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,839
Xu.

274
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Alright.

275
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,840
Have a seat.

276
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,690
The soup will be ready soon.

277
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800
I know

278
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,320
you did this for my own good.

279
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,090
But we are husband and wife.

280
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,000
If you can bear such a heavy burden

281
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,130
for the Ming family,

282
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,360
why do you think

283
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
I can't be the one to stand by your side

284
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,450
through thick and thin, in life and death?

285
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,880
I promised

286
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,900
to protect you from harm for life.

287
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,040
If I had told you earlier,

288
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,730
you would've been in even more danger.

289
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,010
It's all because I was too heartbroken

290
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,930
that I failed to notice

291
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,280
your good intentions.

292
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,640
I misunderstood you.

293
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How do you want to punish me?

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
I'll accept any punishment.

295
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,560
Today, your punishment is to

296
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,090
eat every last bite, leaving nothing behind.

297
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
Xu.

298
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,560
It's been a long time

299
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,220
since you've eaten properly.

300
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,900
You've lost quite a bit of weight.

301
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Today,

302
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,320
I'm punishing you by making you finish your entire meal.

303
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,850
If you leave any food behind, the punishment will be even worse.

304
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I'll make you

305
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,980
eat half a bowl more at every meal, every single day.

306
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,150
Alright, the soup is here.

307
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,160
Come on.

308
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,640
Father.

309
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,300
Try my cooking.

310
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
It must be delicious.

311
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Let me serve it.

312
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,560
Alright.

313
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,320
Be careful. It's hot.

314
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,560
Zhuifeng,

315
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,820
have you seen Miss Yun?

316
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
-By the river.
-By the river?

317
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,560
Miss Yun.

318
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,300
What are you doing?

319
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,340
Grilling fish.

320
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,320
There are dried food and pastries in the carriage.

321
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,380
There's no need to rough it like this.

322
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,750
Come sit here.

323
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,930
Thank you, Miss Yun.

324
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,360
Miss Yun.

325
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
You have to fulfill your duty as a guard,

326
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,720
while also presenting yourself as a concubine.

327
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
Isn't it difficult for you on a daily basis?

328
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
What duty are you talking about?

329
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,540
There's no such thing as duty.

330
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,580
As a secret guard, I just need to carry out

331
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,380
the tasks assigned by my master.

332
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,720
However, the Prince's mansion is heavily guarded.

333
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,450
If Her Highness doesn't go out,

334
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,820
I'm not really needed.

335
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,850
The fish's tail is burning!

336
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,800
Flip it over.

337
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
My apologies.

338
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
Well,

339
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,600
do the Prince and Princess Consort

340
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,930
treat you well usually?

341
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,640
Her Highness treats me very well.

342
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,680
When she makes delicious food,

343
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
she always shares half with me.

344
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,040
She even voluntarily increased my monthly allowance,

345
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,440
allowing me to go out and buy roast chicken.

346
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,870
Her Highness also gives me

347
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,140
clothes and jewelry.

348
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,560
However, I'm not used to

349
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
wearing those clothes.

350
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,840
They don't look as good on me as they do on Her Highness.

351
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,500
Why do you keep asking about

352
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,900
Her Highness's affairs?

353
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,240
I...

354
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,000
You are good friends with His Highness,

355
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,760
and you're a well-read scholar.

356
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
You should know

357
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,480
that you shouldn't covet your friend's wife.

358
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
No.

359
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Miss Yun, you've misunderstood.

360
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,970
I have no improper intentions.

361
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,160
If it's just a misunderstanding,

362
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
then that's a relief.

363
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,040
But if you're using the title of His Highness's friend

364
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,000
to make a move on Her Highness,

365
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,720
you're not worthy of even touching this fish.

366
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
Miss Yun, you've really misunderstood.

367
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
I absolutely have no improper intentions.

368
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,100
-You really misunderstood.
-Zhuifeng.

369
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,760
That fish was grilled for me by Miss Yun.

370
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,280
Well...

371
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,560
What? Can't sleep?

372
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,800
This couch is way too hard.

373
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
It's bruising my bones.

374
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,480
I haven't bathed before bed

375
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,410
and haven't washed my hair either.

376
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
I feel uncomfortable all over.

377
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,960
I have trouble sleeping in unfamiliar beds.

378
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,360
Now I don't have my usual bedding.

379
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,020
And it's an unfamiliar place.

380
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,720
There's not even a single familiar object.

381
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,730
It's simply impossible to fall asleep.

382
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,010
Who says you didn't bring your bedding

383
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,600
or anything familiar?

384
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,860
Just consider me

385
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,560
your cushion

386
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,340
and pillow from home. You'll be able to fall asleep easily.

387
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,120
My dear husband,

388
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,720
do you have some misunderstanding about yourself?

389
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Your body full of muscles

390
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,450
isn't much better than this couch.

391
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,170
At least it's something familiar.

392
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,520
Just make do with it, Tan.

393
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,840
After all, on this journey,

394
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,240
this is the best we can do.

395
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,100
I never expected

396
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,480
that the Prince of Dingbei, who gallops across battlefields,

397
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,720
would be so adept

398
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,320
at serving others.

399
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,560
During military campaigns,

400
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,050
let alone washing hair,

401
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,840
going months without bathing

402
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,160
is quite common.

403
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
Sometimes, a single bucket of water

404
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,080
is shared among several people.

405
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,800
No matter how harsh the conditions are,

406
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,460
there are always more solutions than problems.

407
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,320
From now on,

408
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,320
you can't

409
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,850
share a bed with me anymore.

410
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,480
You're so particular about your sleeping setup.

411
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,720
Without familiar surroundings,

412
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,160
it's hard for you to fall asleep.

413
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm afraid that before we get back to the capital,

414
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,530
you won't want to be without me.

415
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,210
How come I never noticed before

416
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,460
that you were so silver-tongued?

417
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,010
I hadn't noticed it myself.

418
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,160
Perhaps spending time with you

419
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,570
has improved my skills.

420
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,910
♪ I vow again with raised hands ♪

421
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,760
♪ Let me hear your tender thoughts ♪

422
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,410

♪ When the mountains bloom,
I'll meet you again ♪

428
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,410
It is indeed the mark of the Jinyun Guards.

429
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
But there's no further trace beyond this point.

430
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
The whereabouts of Young Lord Zhang are currently unknown.

431
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,380
We can't get in touch with the secret guards either.

432
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,350
[Xian] [Hezhou] [Lingzhou]

433
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
This area belongs to Hezhou.

434
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,520
Wasn't Yu

435
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,560
missing in Lingzhou?

436
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,240
The information from the Jinyun Guards

437
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,320
is never wrong.

438
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,800
The Su family must be publicly

439
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,320
accusing Yu of wrongdoing before the court,

440
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,480
while secretly plotting to kill him.

441
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,320
Claiming Yu disappeared in Lingzhou

442
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,520
is just a cover story.

443
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,160
If anything happens

444
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,320
outside Lingzhou,

445
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,860
the Su family can keep their hands clean.

446
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,470
If that's the case, Yu must have

447
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,800
discovered something.

448
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,780
Since he's left Lingzhou,

449
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,000
he must be heading towards the capital.

450
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
We just need to search along the way.

451
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,160
The Jinyun Guards will surely leave clues.

452
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,000
No.

453
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,840
Yu would never be here.

454
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,360
If I were Yu,

455
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,820
I'd rather die in Lingzhou

456
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,490
to implicate the Su family.

457
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,320
If the Su family were to capture someone,

458
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,160
they wouldn't care if the person was dead or alive.

459
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,690
Now,

460
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,360
they haven't been able to find Yu.

461
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,640
It only means Yu is not here.

462
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,450
The Su family would never think

463
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,880
that Yu would sneak back to Lingzhou.

464
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,760
Lingzhou?

465
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
The darkest place is under the candlestick.

466
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,080
For Yu,

467
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,080
Lingzhou is the safest place right now.

468
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
His Highness was right.

469
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,880
Your best asset

470
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
is your brain.

471
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,050
If we can confirm that Young Lord Zhang

472
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,250
is still in Lingzhou,

473
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,380
we'll go ahead with the plan

474
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,560
to meet up with Zhuiying.

475
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,840
He went ahead to Lingzhou to check things out,

476
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,770
and surely discovered something.

477
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,560
Let's go.

478
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,000
Miss Yun!

479
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Miss Yun!

480
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,520
Miss Yun!

481
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,800
I'm used to traveling alone.

482
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,700
I forgot for a moment

483
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,760
that you were here.

484
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,930
Get on the horse.

485
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,600
It's alright.

486
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,040
Miss Yun, I...

487
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,100
I apologize if I'm being presumptuous.

488
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
This place is remote.

489
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,250
How could there be a carriage here?

490
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Your father must have worried you'd be tired from riding,

491
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,290
so he hired one from the market.

492
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Tan, Xu.

493
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,360
Father.

494
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,560
Xu and I can ride to the market

495
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,080
and hire a carriage there.

496
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,740
Why did you trouble yourself?

497
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,760
It's over ten miles from the market.

498
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,590
With a carriage,

499
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,720
won't you be more comfortable sooner?

500
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,400
I didn't realize

501
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,060
your good intentions before.

502
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,660
I can only blame

503
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,640
myself for being so inconsiderate before.

504
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
But don't worry, Father.

505
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
On this trip to Lingzhou,

506
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,240
I will thoroughly investigate the smuggling case,

507
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,560
clear your name,

508
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,940
and seek justice for the Ming family.

509
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,320
Tan.

510
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,400
The greatest pride of my life

511
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,840
is having you,

512
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,600
such a wonderful daughter.

513
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
Father-in-law, as you travel alone,

514
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,660
please be careful in everything you do,

515
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,460
and don't reveal your identity.

516
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,040
Don't worry.

517
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,050
I really wish

518
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,840
you could stay one more day.

519
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,880
Now that the life and death of Young Lord Zhang remain uncertain,

520
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,280
we need to hurry to Lingzhou

521
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
to investigate this matter.

522
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
But don't worry, Father.

523
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,320
We'll surely reunite soon.

524
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,320
We will.

525
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,640
We certainly will.

526
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,800
Xu,

527
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
Tan has been pampered since childhood

528
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,010
and has never traveled far.

529
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,260
On this journey ahead,

530
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,000
if she makes any mistakes,

531
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,980
please be understanding.

532
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,840
Rest assured, Father-in-law.

533
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,880
My consort,

534
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,720
of course, would never make a mistake.

535
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
If there are any mistakes,

536
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,010
they will be someone else's fault.

537
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,320
-Xu.
-Yeah.

538
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,320
Xu, you think so clearly.

539
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Alright.

540
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,930
Father-in-law,

541
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,130
take care.

542
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,480
Have a safe journey.

543
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,120
The scenery here

544
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,960
is very different from the capital.

545
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,520
The forests are lush and tranquil

546
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,120
The landscape is like a poem or painting.

547
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,760
It makes me feel wonderful.

548
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,360
If I had known, we should have brought

549
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,760
the ten carriages you prepared,

550
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
along with more food, drinks,

551
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,480
and some entertainment.

552
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
Where shall we rest later?

553
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,160
If it's convenient,

554
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,800
we should go

555
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,980
purchase some necessities.

556
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,040
No matter how difficult the journey is,

557
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
we shouldn't let ourselves suffer.

558
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

559
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
What are you thinking about?

560
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,090
I'm thinking that when we get to our lodging,

561
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,290
the first thing I want you to do

562
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,650
is draft a new contract.

563
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,520
This time, I have a few requirements

564
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,800
that must be included.

565
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,320
What are your requirements?

566
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,080
First,

567
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,380
no matter what happens in the future,

568
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,040
we must be honest with each other

569
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,320
and not hide anything.

570
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,040
Second,

571
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
no matter how mad you get,

572
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,090
you can't just ignore me

573
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,640
or treat me as if I don't exist.

574
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,880
Third...

575
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,530
Who goes around making contracts like that?

576
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
I know I was wrong.

577
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,240
Please be magnanimous

578
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,280
and forgive me this once.

579
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,520
Besides,

580
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,840
ignorance is no crime.

581
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,080
If you hadn't

582
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,160
kept everything from me,

583
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
how could I have misunderstood you?

584
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
After all,

585
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,760
it's still your fault.

586
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,020
Moreover, the contract is torn, so be it.

587
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't tell me you want to have

588
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,650
a lifelong contractual marriage with me.

589
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,800
Now that you're fond of me,

590
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,840
and I admire you,

591
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,900
what do we need a contract for?

592
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,160
You've got a point.

593
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,040
Eat more, get fatter.

594
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Get fatter, taste better.

595
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,760
Get fatter.

596
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,800
Get fatter, taste better.

597
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,840
Eat more.

598
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,159
Miss Yun.

599
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,650
It's been two days already.

600
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,520
Can Zhuiying find this place?

601
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,630
Questioning the Jinyun Guards

602
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,199
is the same as questioning the master.

603
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,860
You don't trust His Highness?

604
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,880
Miss Yun, I absolutely didn't mean that.

605
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,969
I just couldn't help asking

606
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,199
because I was a bit worried.

607
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,639
What's the use of worrying?

608
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,239
Will Zhuiying

609
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,900
come back earlier just because you're worried?

610
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,719
Well...

611
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,400
Miss,

612
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,940
I've already fed the chickens this morning.

613
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,639
They're still too skinny. Feed them a bit more.

614
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,880
Alright.

615
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,040
Madam,

616
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
may I buy one of your chickens?

617
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,080
Sure, I'm raising these chickens

618
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,840
to sell anyway.

619
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,400
However,

620
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,199
you'll have to do it yourselves.

621
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,400
Our...

622
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,000
Ourselves?

623
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Miss Yun!

624
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,360
It's alright. I'll do it.

625
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,000
Here.

626
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
What's the use of being educated

627
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,760
if I can't even deal with a chicken?

628
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,490
Isn't this what you always call

629
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,040
"as weak as a kitten"?

630
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,880
Miss Yun, you certainly make it look effortless.

631
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,480
This chicken's good at

632
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,560
reading the room.

633
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,600
Chickens don't understand human reasoning.

634
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,520
But it's not much different from facing an enemy.

635
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
When facing a tough opponent, keeping your presence is key.

636
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,600
If you lose your composure

637
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,800
in front of the enemy,

638
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,560
you naturally can't win.

639
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,280
Losing is fine, but don't lose your pride.

640
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,880
Miss Yun, you've got a point.

641
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,560
So, Miss Yun, are you suggesting that

642
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,720
my presence

643
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,680
is inferior to that of this chicken?

644
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,140
Indeed.

645
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
Smells really good, huh?

646
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,480
You couldn't even catch a chicken.

647
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,280
How could you have such skill in roasting chicken?

648
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,960
Every time

649
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,560
you eat roast chicken,

650
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,640
you look like you're loving it.

651
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,720
So I became interested

652
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,180
and specially learned from the chef at home.

653
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,080
But I don't know how it tastes.

654
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,760
I hope

655
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,040
it suits your taste.

656
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:49,960
It does.

657
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,360
It smells very good.

658
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,300
It's ready.

659
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,690
Here you are.

660
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,610
Here, there's another one.

661
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,720
You bought this chicken

662
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,050
and cooked it yourself.

663
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,410
You should eat some too.

664
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
No need to give me all the best parts.

665
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Miss Yun,

666
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,890
I specially made

667
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,160
this roast chicken for you.

668
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,280
I mean,

669
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,360
few people

670
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,460
can enjoy their food as much as you do.

671
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,420
It's like no delicacy in the world

672
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,340
can match the roast chicken you're holding.

673
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Honestly, nothing can compare.

674
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,560
Your roast chicken

675
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,120
could easily rank

676
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,800
second best in the world.

677
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,120
Miss Yun, then in your heart,

678
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,720
is the best roast chicken

679
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,520
made by His Highness?

680
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,680
When I was young, food was scarce.

681
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,080
I went hungry for days on end.

682
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,880
It was His Highness's roast chicken

683
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,940
that kept me alive.

684
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,490
By the way,

685
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,800
why did we come here?

686
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,440
Could it be

687
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,280
that your household chef's secret recipe

688
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,760
needs a special setting?

689
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,600

Hurry up!

709
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,180
We're running out of time!

710
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,840
No, I can't run anymore.

711
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,340
Hurry up, we're really running out of time.

712
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,520
Hey,

713
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,320
could it be Father and Mother

714
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,760
planning something special

715
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,120
to surprise me?

716
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,080
I wasn't aware of that.

717
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,320
Could it be that Her Highness arranged something special for you

718
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,920
before leaving the capital?

719
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,780
That can't be the case either.

720
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,600
Hey little one,

721
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,160
if you don't tell me clearly where we're going,

722
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,040
I won't go.

723
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,680
That person said if you don't go,

724
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,400
you'll regret it for life.

725
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,530
I don't even know

726
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,400
who that person is.

727
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,560
What if I encounter bad people?

728
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,490
Then I'll truly regret it for life.

729
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,640
What do you have that's worth

730
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,300
being targeted by bad people?

731
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,130
Let's go.

732
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,760
Don't go!

733
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,520
You're such a grown-up.

734
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,640
Why are you still acting like a child,

735
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,770
throwing a tantrum?

736
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,120
I act like a child?

737
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,280
Then what do you act like?

738
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,480
An old grandpa.

739
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,560
Let's go. We're almost there.

740
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,640
Here it is.

741
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,220
Little brat, where's the person you mentioned?

742
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,840
I...

743
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,000
Fireworks are being set off!

744
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,640
Look!
