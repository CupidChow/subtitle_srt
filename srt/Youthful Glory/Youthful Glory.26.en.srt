[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,880
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,710
You accuse Zhou Baoping

4
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,240
of being silenced by the Su family.

5
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,640
Do you have any evidence?

6
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,610
I have no hard proof,

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,200
but the list Lord Zhou gave me

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,860
is the best evidence there is.

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,030
The Su family, in search of that list,

10
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,490
killed innocent women without hesitation.

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Several girls Lord Zhou

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
frequently requested

13
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
have lost their lives because of it.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,479
Go on.

15
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,800
Unable to leave the city,

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
I took an alias

17
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,770
and found work as a maid

18
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,250
at the 180 Pavilion.

19
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,880
To avoid raising suspicion,

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
I remained quiet for six months.

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Until the day Young Lord Zhang

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,690
came to investigate the taxes.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
I finally got my chance

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
to meet with him.

25
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,180
I, Qiuyue,

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,590
humbly ask you to speak up for Lord Zhou

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,700
and restore his name.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,610
Miss Qiuyue,

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,800
I know you came for Commissioner Zhou.

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,920
I've heard of his case

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,050
even in the capital.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,760
But why seek me out?

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,040
I know you came to Lingzhou

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,920
to investigate the Su family's

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,360
tax extractions.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,990
That mission

37
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,120
aligns perfectly with Lord Zhou's goal.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,980
He was silenced

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,480
because he uncovered

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
the Su family's crimes.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
His injustice remains unresolved.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,200
What crimes did he uncover?

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
A list of officials bribed
by the Su family.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
That list is in my possession.

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,710
I stayed in Lingzhou

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,840
just to wait for the court

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
to send someone again,

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,780
so I could clear his name

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
and fulfill his unfinished mission

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,130
of restoring law and order.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
Qiuyue,

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
I came only

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
to audit the diverted taxes.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,320
If I can settle

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,079
all accounts,

56
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,600
I'd consider it a mission accomplished.

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,960
Such lofty tasks as restoring

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,760
discipline and justice...

59
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm not worthy to carry them out.

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,680
But with this list in hand,

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,140
the court can easily
take down the Su family.

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Yes,

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
but as you said,

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,320
only the court has that power.

65
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,500
I hold no office,

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
just an honorary title

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
as imperial tax inspector.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,380
Even if I know Commissioner Zhou's death

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,480
has hidden truths,

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,960
I have no authority to investigate

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,250
or reopen the case.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,070
It's the Su family!

73
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,270
My Lord, you go first!

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,550
Be careful!

75
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,900
Protect her.

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,160
What she knows is too important.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,770
She must not

78
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,760
fall back into the Su family's hands.

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,410
Yes.

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,050
Only by staying alive
can we hope for another chance.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Go!

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,540
Fall back!

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,130
-Your Lord!
-Your Lord!

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,620
It was I who brought
this trouble upon Young Lord Zhang.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,450
After this,

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,890
the Su family believed

87
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,640
the list fell into
Young Lord Zhang's hands,

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
so they eased off the hunt for Qiuyue

89
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,760
but placed a kill order on him instead,

90
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,980
tracking him in secret.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Where is the list now?

92
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,000
The Imperial Inspector
acts on behalf of the Emperor,

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,260
with the power to dismiss and punish,

94
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,590
to take life or spare it.

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,580
No matter how powerful the Su family is,

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
they cannot defy the throne.

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,330
Please hand over the evidence.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,730
As long as it's real,

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,640
the Imperial Inspector will
not tolerate corruption.

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,100
Zhou Baoping's injustice
will be set right.

101
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:54,640
[Fang Yiyan, Liu Yan, Zhang Daoyuan,
Cheng Xiu, Lin Shouren]

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,690
[Fang Yiyan, Liu Yan, Zhang Daoyuan,
Cheng Xiu, Lin Shouren]

103
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,730
After Lord Zhou's death,

104
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,770
I knew the Su family
would try to silence me

105
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,870
and destroy the list.

106
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,070
So I took precautions.

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
Even if one day

108
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,100
they succeed in killing me,

109
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I can at least

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,200
keep the list safe.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Only then

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
would I feel

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,420
I've honored Lord Zhou's

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,340
trust in me.

115
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,630
Su Errong, do you admit guilt?

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
Just a few names...

117
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,360
Just because she calls it a bribery list,
does that make it so?

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,090
How can you believe her easily?

119
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,810
Anyone can write names.

120
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
If I scribble a few,

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,790
would that count

122
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,410
as evidence of bribery too?

123
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
This is absurd!

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,770
It's not just a list.

125
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,990
There's a witness.

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
He

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,820
can prove this list is real.

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,960
A man who's already dead

129
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,510
can prove nothing.

130
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,420
Lord Yin.

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Lord Yin.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,450
What...

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,770
What...

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,610
What's happening here?

135
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
Lord Yin.

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,230
Today's incident

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,420
was a trap set by Su Errong.

138
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,870
He meant to frame His Highness

139
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,060
for your murder.

140
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,140
It was His Highness who saved you.

141
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Su Errong, you scoundrel.

142
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,530
We followed your

143
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,390
orders blindly,

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,650
yet you still wanted to silence us!

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,800
My Lord, you once said

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,640
you hid the evidence
at the Maritime Trade Bureau.

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,180
Why not present it now

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
while the Imperial Inspector is here?

149
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes! I have evidence!

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
My Lord,

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,440
I'll go retrieve it at once.

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,770
No need.

153
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,850
Please take a look, My Lord.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,680
-Wang Wang, from Maritime Trade Bureau.
-Pang You, from Maritime Trade Bureau.

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,540
Greetings, Imperial Inspector.

156
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,080
I was ordered by Lord Yin

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
to retrieve this evidence

158
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,720
to present it to Your Highness.

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,800
Who knew the Su family

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,800
would discard us like worn shoes

161
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,320
and try to kill us off?

162
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,900
Thankfully, Lord Shu

163
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,050
and this young lady

164
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,120
saved us.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Use and discard,

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,230
they truly see lives as worthless.

167
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm glad

168
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,350
I kept a backup plan.

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
Imperial Inspector,

170
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,590
these scrolls are
the Maritime Trade Bureau's

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,080
trade ledgers from the past ten years.

172
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,930
All merchants who bribed the Su family

173
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,880
are clearly marked.

174
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,420
[Name List]

175
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,490
Also included are the amounts

176
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,810
of bribes

177
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,630
the Maritime Trade Bureau took.

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,980
These scrolls show the secret accounts

179
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,950
of tax diversions
from the past five years.

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,150
The numbers

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,440
generally match those

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,340
seized earlier by Your Highness.

183
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,290
There are also records

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,600
of the Su family embezzling military funds

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,130
and disaster relief money.

186
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,360
Lord Tan,

187
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,540
just compare

188
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,490
these accounts

189
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,990
with Zhou Baoping's list.

190
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,580
Not only the Su family,

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,020
but every corrupt official involved

Though somewhat opportunistic,

244

it's still within reason.

I never wanted to betray the Su family.

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,980
I'm off to find mine.

567
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,830
All right then.

568
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
Come, both of you,

569
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,040
let's toast with tea.

570
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,810
I'll head back to the capital first,

571
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,490
prepare a feast,

572
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,670
and when you return,

573
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,400
we'll celebrate together.

574
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,940
Cheers.

575
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,270
[Tea]

576
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,560
Are you leaving, miss?

577
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,480
His Highness has
removed my servant status.

578
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,820
Now that I'm free,

579
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,650
I want to explore

580
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,720
a world beyond Lingzhou,

581
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
see different people and places,

582
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,180
live a life

583
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
unlike that of Hui House.

584
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,480
They say women
are like vines needing a tree to cling to,

585
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,200
but who says

586
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,950
a woman can't be a tree herself?

587
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
From now on, you'll live for yourself.

588
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,810
No more bowing or scraping.

589
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,820
You're right, Your Highness.

590
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,600
In truth,

591
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,340
I must thank you for aiding His Highness.

592
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,210
If it weren't for your decisive words

593
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,440
that turned the tide,

594
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,260
he might not

595
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,450
have quelled the crisis so easily.

596
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,430
I'm ashamed.

597
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
If not for His Highness's
wise and earnest words,

598
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,380
I might never have seen the light.

599
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,080
And today,

600
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
I'd be full of regret.

601
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,780
Gretings, Your Highness.

602
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,570
I wonder why

603
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Your Highness

604
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,570
summoned me today?

605
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,380
You are one of Su Errong's people.

606
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,760
From the day I entered the city,

607
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,720
she placed you by my side to serve.

608
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,400
Did she intend to use you

609
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,370
to get close and harm me?

610
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,240
N-No!

611
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,740
I would never dare!

612
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,760
You were born of a humble status.

613
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,120
No matter how hard
you serve the Su family,

614
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,440
your fate will always

615
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,370
be in others' hands.

616
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,850
Whether you're a courtesan

617
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,170
or the mistress of the pleasure house,

618
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,530
to you, there's no real difference.

619
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,920
In the end,

620
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,740
you're merely a pawn to the Su family.

621
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,610
They use you

622
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
so they want you blind and obedient.

623
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,580
I heard Su Errong planned to send you

624
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,160
to the Lingzhou Prefect's residence

625
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,700
as his seventh concubine.

626
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,600
Do you accept that fate?

627
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,210
I do not.

628
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,080
But

629
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,740
as a woman of base status,

630
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,410
I have no say.

631
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,120
Where I go, what I do,

632
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,140
it's never up to me.

633
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,680
When useful, they coax me;

634
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,460
when not,

635
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
they throw me away.

636
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,360
According to our empire's law,

637
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
anyone who renders service to the court

638
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,330
may shed their lowly status

639
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,340
if recommended

640
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
by a senior official.

641
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,880
I grant you this promise,

642
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,140
freedom

643
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,520
for the rest of your life.

644
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
With His Highness's capabilities,

645
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,280
even without me,

646
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,570
he could have taken down the Su family.

647
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
So truly,

648
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,510
it is not me helping His Highness,

649
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,540
but His Highness who saved me.

650
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,150
His Highness is a noble soul,

651
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,190
a pillar of this land,
a bearer of its peace.

652
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,090
Your Highness is truly blessed

653
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,870
to have his love.

654
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,940
My blessing

655
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,960
is also his fortune.

656
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,760
Feelings

657
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,480
have never been
solely about status or looks,

658
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,520
power or rank.

659
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
His Highness sees me as the only one.

660
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,700
And my love for His Highness

661
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,810
is just as singular in this world.

662
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,760

I deeply admire Your Highness's resolve,

674

676
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,120

After the rain,

700
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
a rainbow shines across the clouds.

701
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,700
Indeed, after the storm,

702
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,290
comes the most beautiful view.

703
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,870
So, how's my taste?

704
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Not bad.

705
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,800
Would you like to look
at the wind chimes, miss?

706
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,310
You're not in the mood today.

707
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,320
Not really.

708
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,470
Usually you

709
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,980
enjoy shopping.

710
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,410
When I went shopping,

711
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,980
you've never joined me.

712
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
So how would you know what I was like?

713
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,530
Besides, these past few days in Lingzhou,

714
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,640
it was Miss Qingyu
who spent the most time with you.

715
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,520
Can you put less jealousy

716
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,500
in that head of yours?

717
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Qingyu and I only

718
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,720
teamed up for mutual gain.

719
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,040
Nothing more.

720
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
You may feel nothing,

721
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,420
but she may

722
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,840
have feelings for you.

723
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,200
How can I

724
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,840
control others' feelings?

725
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,430
I practically wrote “Stay Away”

726
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,280
on my forehead.

727
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,330
Then clearly,

728
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,990
“Stay Away” wasn't enough,

729
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,440
so she still had hope

730
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,640
and developed feelings she shouldn't.

731
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,870
Then next to

732
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,370
“Stay Away,”

733
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,280
shall I add:

734
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,410
“I'm already married”?

735
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,840
Not enough.

736
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,980
Far from it.

737
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,360
Then how about adding:

738
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,960
“My heart belongs to one, forever loyal”?

739
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,800
How is it?

740
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,320
Write whatever

741
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,280
you want on your face.

742
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,120
It's not like I know

743
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,000
what you're actually doing outside

744
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,730
and what words you would write.

745
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,360
Sir, how much are these clay figurines?

746
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,880
Pre-made ones are five wen each.

747
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,760
Pick whichever you like.

748
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,960
If you want a custom one, it's eight wen.

749
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,520
How do you make custom ones?

750
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,480
Just tell me who you want it to look like,

751
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,080
and I'll sculpt it right now.

752
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,080
Then can you make one

753
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,680
that looks like my wife?

754
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,790
Of course.

755
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,580
Such beauty.

756
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,090
Sir, you're truly lucky.

757
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,360
Sir,

758
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
would you like one of yourself too?

759
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,150
I'll give you a deal:

760
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,280
two for fifteen wen.

761
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,490
-Sure.
-No need.

762
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,840
Then let's each have one made

763
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,710
to look like us.

764
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,920
Alrighty.

765
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,340
A perfect pair, an auspicious match.

766
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,140
Sir, please stand still.

767
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,420
I'll sculpt you first.

768
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,220
When did you get interested

769
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,320
in clay figurines?

770
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,360
Since writing words
on my face wasn't enough,

771
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,700
I now need figurines.

772
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,720
Dough figurines?

773
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
How will you use them?

774
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,510
Wherever I go,

775
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,390
whoever I meet,

776
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,330
I'll bring along

777
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,530
a figurine of my wife.

778
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,210
Let's see who dares

779
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
have thoughts about your husband then.

780
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,130
Seeing you smile like this,

781
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,060
this figurine is worth every coin.

782
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,080
Then why make another one

783
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
looking like you?

784
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,480
When you go out,

785
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,260
you'll carry a figurine of me,

786
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,570
to block off any admirers

787
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,080
and crush false hopes.

788
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,300
I won't carry it.

789
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,580
Your Highness.

790
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,080
Is everything ready?

791
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,580
Your Highness can rest assured.

792
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,720
Bring it up.

793
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,550
Your Majesty,

794
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,640
On this southern inspection,

795
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,080
I've uncovered that
the Su family of Lingzhou

796
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
has committed large-scale smuggling,

797
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,480
trafficking, embezzlement, and bribery.

798
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,840
The amounts involved

799
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,250
are unprecedented in our empire.

800
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,500
This is the Su family's

801
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,280
record of embezzlement and smuggling.

802
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,850
I will hand it over
to the Court of Judicial Review

803
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,680
for a thorough investigation,

804
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,010
to ensure its accuracy.

805
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,970
In addition,

806
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,970
I have also uncovered evidence that
the Su family sold official positions,

807
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,160
bribed officials,
and formed illicit alliances.

808
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,350
This roster

809
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,200
is solid proof

810
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,100
of the Su family's
collusion with court officials.

811
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,360
Read it.

812
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

813
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,880
Prefect of Qingzhou, Zhao Zhaode.

814
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,660
[Roster of Officials Bribed by the Su Family]

815
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,680
Deputy Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, Han Yi.

816
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,800
Censorate, Chang Yunfu,

817
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,020
Yang Jingqi.

818
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,440
Palace Secretary, Han Shang.

819
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,970
Grand Academy Instructor, Guan Yunsi.

820
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,100
Ceremonial Officer, Xiang Tao.

821
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,520
Vice Supervisor of the Imperial Academy,
Lin Shouren.

822
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,090
Officer of Xuande Rank, Fang Kaiyan.

823
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,560
Deputy of the Court of Sacrifices,
Zhuo Ran.

824
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,550
Cavalry Captain, Xie Wei.

825
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,380
Palace Attendant, Tao Xiyan.

826
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,120
Supervisor of the National Academy,
Ye Liuyun.

827
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,800
General of Stalwart Might,
Wu Wendao.

828
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,240
I lost my judgment.

829
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,190
I am guilty.

830
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,280
[Palace Secretary Han Shang, Grand Academy Instructor Guan Yunsi, Ceremonial Officer Xiang Tao,
Vice Supervisor of the Imperial Academy Lin Shouren]

831
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,540
[Officer of Xuande Rank Fang Kaiyan, Deputy of the Court of Sacrifices Zhuo Ran,
Cavalry Captain Xie Wei, Palace Attendant Tao Xiyan]

832
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,890
The Su family's crimes

833
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,470
are countless and inexcusable.

834
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,920
With such solid proof,

835
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,190
why can they still not be convicted?

836
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,280
Your Majesty,

837
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,950
the Lingzhou maritime trade

838
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,200
has long been solely controlled

839
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,680
by Su Errong and her husband.

840
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,800
It has no connection
whatsoever to Chancellor Su.

841
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,960
All profits from the Su family's business

842
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,780
have never reached
the Chancellor's estate.

843
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,190
Su Errong is the daughter of Su Wenchun.

844
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,120
On that basis alone,

845
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,960
he cannot escape implication.

846
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
Your Majesty,

847
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,130
as I understand,

848
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,470
there is a legal complication

849
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,430
in this case.

850
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
According to imperial law,

851
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,480
any official
and their immediate family members,

852
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,880
if engaged in trade or commerce,

853
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,720
must relinquish all official aspirations.

854
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,790
When Chancellor Su passed the civil exams,

855
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,800
in order to be eligible for office,

856
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
he formally severed household ties

857
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,320
with the Su family in Lingzhou.

858
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,050
After Su Errong married,

859
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,650
he did the same,

860
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,920
transferred her household registration,

861
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,200
and recorded the change
in the Ministry of Revenue archives.

862
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,610
This, Your Majesty,
is the core of the complication.

863
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,220
I ask Your Majesty
to weigh it with utmost discernment.
