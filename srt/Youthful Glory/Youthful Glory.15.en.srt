00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,910
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,910
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,140
My son was perfectly fine.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,420
But he was chosen
when Marquis of Jing'an

5
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,200
recruited strong young men
to combat the flood,

6
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,900
which then swept my son away.

7
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,860
His body hasn't been found yet!

8
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,370
Give my son back to me!

9
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,340
Calm down!

10
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,170
Calm down!

11
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,900
-I want my son back!
-Calm down!

12
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,500
We became homeless

13
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,820
because of you!

14
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,259
How can you hurt him?

15
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,060
How dare you resort to violence?

16
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,520
What's wrong with you?

17
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,370
Yun Yi.

18
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,730
What do you think you're doing?

19
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,770
It is the Princess Consort

20
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,700
who funded and set up the relief hall.

21
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,380
How could she harm you?

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,050
It was Marquis of Jing'an

23
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,570
who tore our families apart

24
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,170
and made us homeless!

25
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,570
Give my son back to me!

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,540
Calm down! Stop this!

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,820
Give my son back to me!

28
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,450
Calm down.

29
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,420
Give my son back to me!

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,170
Out of my way!

31
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,050
Calm down!

32
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,050
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,010
The number of refugees in the capital

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,050
in the capital.

35
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,820
The Capital Prefecture has set up tents

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,730
and soup kitchens in the city.

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,820
But...

38
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,220
these measures

39
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,860
can't solve the problem.

40
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,260
The root cause of this crisis is in Lizhou.

41
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,380
If we don't address the issue quickly,

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,660
cries of complaints will rise all around,

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,220
and the people will lose faith in the court.

44
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,050
Your Majesty,

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,770
the Ministry of Revenue has already

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,030
calculated the losses

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,490
of farmlands, houses,
grains and livestock,

48
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,220
which amount to

49
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,880
over 930,000 taels of silver.

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,450
Marquis of Jing'an's acts in disaster relief

51
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,890
have resulted in over 100 casualties

52
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,940
in Lizhou.

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,380
This kind of loss

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,540
cannot be measured by money.

55
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,570
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,390
Marquis of Jing'an
not only failed his task,

57
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,110
but also destroyed many households

58
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,880
and worsened the flood situation.

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,600
In my opinion,

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,280
he should be immediately

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
brought to the capital

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
to receive severe punishment,

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,720
so as to comfort the people.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,329
Prince of Dingbei has arrived.

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,790
Your Majesty.

66
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,070
I've ordered a deputy commander, Shen Yu,

67
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,600
to go to Lizhou along with
the chief minister

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
of the Court of Review

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,920
to escort Marquis of Jing'an to the capital.

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
This matter should be...

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,460
Lizhou is in chaos now.

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,600
I've sent a Dingbei troop to go with them

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,260
to ensure nothing goes wrong.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,480
Any objections, officers?

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,730
If anything goes wrong,

76
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,230
if anything goes wrong.

77
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,880
Your Majesty.

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,870
the marquis's case must be
thoroughly investigated.

79
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,350
But the top priority now

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,960
is to tackle the flood problem.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
I implore Your Majesty to assign

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,750
officials to this mission.

83
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,960
The people's well-being is above everything else.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,110
Chancellor Shu is right.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,520
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,870
I suggest we immediately

87
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,040
let Guo Bingmao, the deputy commander

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,990
of Yangxi Prefecture take over Lizhou.

89
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,430
The commander of said area

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,640
has not been determined yet.

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm afraid the latest happenings would

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,530
waver the morale of the army there.

93
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,600
If Guo is transferred to Lizhou now,

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
the disaster relief affairs
will be taken care of,

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
and the refugees will be pacified.

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,430
The army there will also be stabilized,

97
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,310
which can solidify Your Majesty's sovereignty.

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,310
I agree.

99
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,910
If Deputy Commander Guo
completes the mission

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,640
of defusing the tension in Lizhou,

101
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,370
it'll prove his ability to shoulder
important responsibilities.

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,400
I order Guo Bingmao to go to Lizhou now.

103
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,620
Once the problem is solved,

104
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,310
he will be allowed back and report to me.

105
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,920
You specifically deployed Shen Yu.

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,040
Are you worried about
the safety of Marquis of Jing'an

107
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,700
on his way back to the capital?

108
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,710
What happened in Lizhou does look suspicious.

109
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,080
Perhaps

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,230
the whole thing is a conspiracy.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,190
If so,

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,750
then the mastermind will

113
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,480
surely try to kill the marquis.

114
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Your Lordship...

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,340
Your Lordship.

116
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,430
Who are you?

117
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm here at Prince of Dingbei's request

118
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,280
to save you.

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,340
Prince of Dingbei?

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,430
What did he say?

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,430
His Highness said,

122
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,400
the enemy is lying low somewhere.

123
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,640
Danger awaits Your Lordship in the capital.

124
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,600
Your Lordship's life will be endangered,

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
and justice won't be served.

126
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,990
You will die

127
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,590
if you go back to the capital.

128
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,360
Do your really work for the prince?

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,870
I came here with a Dingbei troop.

130
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,920
You've seen how I behaved on the road.

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,180
Do you think I'm lying?

132
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,600
I'll get Your Lordship out of here now.

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,640
The prince has instructed

134
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,870
me to hide Your Lordship

135
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
in a safe place.

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Does General Shen

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,790
know about this?

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,430
This is

139
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,840
an expedient move.

140
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
It's General Shen's duty to escort you.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,110
If he knows about this plan,

142
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,720
he'll inevitably be held accountable.

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,250
Keeping him in the dark is
a way to protect him.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,480
As the prince said,

145
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,430
where there is life,

146
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,600
there is hope.

147
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,870
Your Lordship must stay alive,

148
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,470
if you are to clear your name.

149
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,170
Your Lordship.

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,610
Come on, Your Lordship.

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,980
Where are we going?

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,400
That way.

153
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,430
Where are you taking me?

154
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,720
After meeting up with a contact,
Your Lordship

155
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,870
will leave the mountain
through a small path.

156
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,360
Wait!

157
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,450
Your Lordship.

158
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,470
The prince always strategizes
before taking action.

159
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,590
I believe he has

160
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,429
planned everything out.

161
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,120
If I leave now,

162
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,130
I'll be charged with
one more crime for fleeing.

163
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,340
How will the prince

164
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,590
be able to dispel doubts

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,580
and reveal the truth then?

166
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,430
I'm just following orders.

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,920
Your Lordship.

168
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,950
Tan, don't fret.

169
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,240
Maybe the story told by

170
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,300
the refugees out of anger isn't true.

171
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
Any word from my husband?

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,950
Chai Gui inquired in the Capital Garrison.

173
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,610
People said the prince hadn't been there today.

174
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,040
This thoughtful lad Chai Gui

175
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,360
then asked a few more questions.

176
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,550
It turns out that the prince got
to know the matter yesterday

177
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,880
and instantly sent Mr. Shen Yu

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,710
to Lizhou to escort

179
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,510
the marquis back to the capital.

180
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,310
It is very considerate of the prince.

181
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,040
He knows this matter has turned

182
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,020
my father into an easy target.

183
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,550
Now with Shen Yu's protection,

184
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,400
I believe Father will return safely.

185
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Uncle sometimes acts rashly, but he would

186
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
never get out of the line.

187
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,880
There must be a misunderstanding.

188
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,710
When Uncle comes back

189
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,520
and receives interviews,
the truth will be out,

190
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,550
and his good name will be restored.

191
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,950
Everything will be fine.

192
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,240
There has to be a misunderstanding.

193
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,520
Father will be fine.

194
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,810
Your Highness.

195
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,430
The refugees have

196
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,670
surrounded Marquis of Jing'an's mansion,

197
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,670
demanding to put the marquis in prison.

198
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,710
On my way back,

199
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,190
I saw some imperial guards heading there,

200
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,710
planning to raid the mansion.

201
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,240
My father is not convicted yet.

202
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
Why are they after his property so soon?

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What about Ms. Zhang and the others

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,860
in the mansion?

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Are they okay?

206
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,830
I didn't see them.

207
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,040
This is bad.

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,360
I must go to the mansion now.

209
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,830
Tan.

210
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,760
the refugees' judgement is clouded now.

211
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
They'll vent their anger on you.

212
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,550
The situation yesterday
was already dangerous.

213
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,310
I'm afraid it'll escalate today.

214
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,360
To be on the safe side,

215
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,760
you'd better not go out.

216
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,880
Due to the lack of leadership,

217
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,710
Ms. Zhang and the others must be panicked.

218
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,710
I'm worried about them.

219
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,590
I have to go to the mansion.

220
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,160
Tan!

221
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,190
All confiscated items will be

222
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,710
handed over to the Court of Review.

223
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,040
Before that happens,

224
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,670
you must guard them

225
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,950
and not let anyone approach.

226
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,470
Yes!

227
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,560
Commander Lu.

228
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

229
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,670
Has the truth of

230
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,430
the Lizhou case been found out yet?

231
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,230
What crime did my father commit?

232
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,920
Has His Majesty issued an edict?

233
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,070
His Majesty hasn't declared the marquis to be guilty.

234
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,670
The Lizhou case is still under investigation.

235
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,470
Then why did the imperial guards raid the mansion?

236
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,710
It was an order I had to follow.

237
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,670
Your Highness, stop.

238
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,070
We're not supposed to

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,550
let anyone in.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
You're just doing

241
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,120
the Emperor's bidding.

242
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,790
I won't give you a hard time.

243
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,120
Could you

244
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
do me a favor

245
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
and pass on a message?

246
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,960
Yes, Your Highness.

247
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,640
Please tell the servants

248
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,280
that

249
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,280
my father hasn't been proven guilty,

250
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,950
and that they shouldn't panic.

251
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,680
Just live their lives as usual.

252
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,790
If...

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,310
If the worst happens,

254
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,950
all the servants'

255
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,330
labor contracts will be returned.

256
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,280
They'll each receive two months' salary

257
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,360
before dismissal.

258
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,950
They won't become collateral damage.

259
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,950
Consider it done,

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
Your Highness.

261
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,870
Thank you, Commander Lu.

262
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,560
You're free to go now.

263
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,640
Let's go.

264
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
Hurry. Let's go.

265
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,280
Let's go.

266
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,790
Catch them!

267
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,300
What are you doing?

268
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,360
Shut up.

269
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,470
The three of you stay put!

270
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,430
Prince of Dingbei is said to be a tyrant

271
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,640
and a brutal killer.

272
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,980
Your Highness,

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
are you going to

274
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,120
hurt us, a group of

275
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,550
innocent civilians?

276
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,170
You caused a disturbance
in front of the marquis's mansion.

277
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
Who told you to do that?

278
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,120
Marquis of Jing'an's lousy measures

279
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,040
worsened the situation

280
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,790
in Lizhou.

281
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,880
Does justice

282
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,550
not exist

283
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,590
in the world now?

284
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,790
We are all witnesses!

285
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,070
Yes. We are all witnesses!

286
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,710
No investigation is needed!

287
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,360
We demand an explanation now!

288
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,430
Marquis of Jing'an's son-in-law

289
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,630
is Prince of Dingbei.

290
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,640
No official

291
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,950
dares to mess with him.

292
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,280
They two are covering for each other.

293
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,710
Exactly.

294
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,040
They're defending each other.

295
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,120
Give us an explanation.

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,950
We want justice!

297
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,310
Give us an explanation.

298
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,830
No one is behind us.

299
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,040
We are all citizens of Lizhou.

300
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,280
Marquis of Jing'an caused harm to us.

301
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,120
We became homeless because of him.

302
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
That's why we gathered

303
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,970
outside his mansion,
asking for an explanation.

304
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,470
You stirred up trouble
in the disguise of refugees

305
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,360
and pressured the court
with public opinion.

306
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,240
What are you up to?

307
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,710
It's enough that the court is

308
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,240
refusing to seek justice for us.

309
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,470
How can it be falsely

310
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,590
accusing us now?

311
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,920
We are innocent.

312
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,400
We are really innocent!

313
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,920
How could you frame us?

314
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,450
Every refugee's identity was registered

315
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,790
earlier by the Capital Prefecture.

316
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,710
After a night of examination,

317
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,790
the Court of Review found

318
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,290
zero registration record

319
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,070
about the three of you.

320
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,240
I'll give you one last chance.

321
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
Who is behind you?

322
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,950
I don't know what
Your Highness are saying.

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,620
Are you going to torture us
until we confess?

324
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,280
I doubt if you could

325
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,550
live to confess.

326
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,550
Tell me the truth,

327
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,670
or you'll be silenced forever.

328
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,360
I'll ask you one last time.

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,040
Will you spill

330
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,160
the truth or not?

331
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,070
I-I'll tell you.

332
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,670
Don't!

333
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,670
That's betrayal!

334
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,110
I'll tell you.

335
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,120
I will.

336
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,950
We are all from Haiyou Sect.

337
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,310
We were just following orders.

338
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,280
The Chief makes all the decisions.

339
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,830
As for who devised this plan,

340
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
we really

341
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,640
don't know anything!

342
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,550
Sir,

343
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,880
a message just came from General Shen.

344
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,410
As Your Highness expected,

345
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,470
during the trip,

346
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,750
someone attempted to kill the marquis.

347
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
The bad news is...

348
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,190
Say it.

349
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,760
The assailant

350
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,130
was a soldier from Dingbei Army.

351
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,160
Who told you to do this?

352
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,000
Why did you try to kill the marquis?

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
I am a soldier from Dingbei Army.

354
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,160
Of course, what I did was
Prince of Dingbei's order.

355
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,590
I didn't mean to kill the marquis.

356
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,040
I was trying to take him away

357
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,280
at the prince's request.

358
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,310
Nonsense!

359
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,190
The prince would never break the law

360
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,190
or commit crimes.

361
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,240
Take him down!

362
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,880
He'll be interrogated
in the Capital Garrison.

363
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,670
-Yes!
-Yes!

364
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,620
He's committing suicide!

365
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,160
Your Majesty.

366
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,510
according to the Court of Review's report,

367
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,990
the cause of trouble in Lizhou

368
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,670
is plain to see.

369
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,319
Marquis of Jing'an was eager
to contain the situation,

370
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,800
so he enlisted young men unscrupulously.

371
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,670
His inappropriate measures resulted

372
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,880
in the deaths of innocent civilians.

373
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,230
He deserves punishment.

374
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,510
Your Majesty, please make a decision now

375
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,230
to quell people's rage and concerns.

376
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
Your Majesty,

377
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,670
Marquis of Jing'an should be punished

378
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,070
for his recent failures.

379
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,710
Nonetheless, when he
guarded Yangxi Prefecture,

380
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,160
he won several battles
against Nanlyu invaders.

381
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
For over a decade,

382
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,230
the southern borders
have remained peaceful.

383
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,400
The credit goes to Marquis of Jing'an.

384
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,430
Your Majesty,

385
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,510
please show leniency to the marquis,

386
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,800
given his contributions.

387
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Please don't sentence him to death.

388
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,320
I agree with Chancellor Shu.

389
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,840
Marquis of Jing'an's intention to contain

390
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,500
the disaster can't be denied.

391
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,600
He made mistakes for a reason.

392
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,990
Chancellor Su, in your opinion,

393
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,360
how should Marquis of Jing'an be punished?

394
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,670
Your Majesty,

395
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,510
the marquis does deserve severe punishment

396
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,920
for his misconduct.

397
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,360
However,

398
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,470
if a meritorious official is executed

399
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,670
just to keep the citizens' anger at bay,

400
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,400
the court will appear too cruel,

401
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,190
and the border-defending
soldiers will be disheartened.

402
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,710
My advice is, instead of

403
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,040
executing the marquis,

404
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,560
he should be demoted to be a commoner

405
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,840
after being removed from his job and rank.

406
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,360
His property should be confiscated

407
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,320
and used for the disaster relief in Lizhou.

408
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,990
In this way,

409
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,600
Lizhou citizens

410
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
will be content.

411
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,390
Your Majesty will also be
recognized as a merciful ruler.

412
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,600
Chancellor Su's advice is
reasonable and appropriate.

413
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,990
I have no objection.

414
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,030
Chancellor Su's

415
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,920
advice is so adopted.

416
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Marquis of Jing'an must be punished for

417
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,670
his failures in the disaster relief.

418
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,530
Given his former contributions,

419
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,830
I'll kindly absolve him from capital punishment.

420
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,120
It is my decision

421
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,800
[Harmony and Abundance]

422
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,890
that Marquis of Jing'an will
be dismissed from

423
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,660
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

424
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,280
his job and noble title.

425
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,360
His property will be

426
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
confiscated.

427
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,940
[Sealed on May 11th in the 9th year of Chengkang Emperor reign]

428
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,580
[Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion]

429
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,800
Lizhou is far from the capital.

430
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,120
When will Father arrive?

431
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,160
Your Highness, Ms. Zhang is here.

432
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,700
Your Highness.

433
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,570
We've received the Emperor's edict.

434
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,840
The marquis has lost his job and noble title.

435
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,800
His property has also been confiscated.

436
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,160
As Your Highness instructed,

437
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,130
I've dismissed all the servants.

438
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,400
But...

439
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,160
After spending most of my life

440
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,670
working in the mansion,

441
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,270
I've seen it as my home.

442
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,750
I have nowhere to go now.

443
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,840
I'm humbly asking Your Highness for help.

444
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,270
Get up now.

445
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,190
I think of you as family.

446
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,920
You can stay here from now on.

447
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,320
Thanks, Your Highness.

448
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,600
Word has it

449
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,570
that the marquis's misconduct

450
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,190
caused many deaths in Lizhou,

451
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,510
and that the marquis has admitted to it.

452
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,930
But I would never believe it.

453
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,880
His Lordship would

454
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,880
never trifle with human life

455
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,040
or harm the people.

456
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,650
Has the prince come back yet?

457
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,320
His Highness has been away for three days.

458
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,800
Prepare a carriage for me.

459
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,470
Yes.

460
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:58,880
Your Majesty...

461
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,340
I know what you want to ask.

462
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,330
You wonder why I convicted Marquis

463
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,020
of Jing'an before his return.

464
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,840
The Court of Review

465
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,640
has combed through the details.

466
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,250
Marquis of Jing'an has also admitted

467
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,290
that he recruited strong young men

468
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,570
to contain the flood.

469
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,710
I convicted him so soon

470
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,640
to effectively manage public sentiment

471
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,670
and give an explanation to Lizhou people.

472
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,670
In fact, the marquis should've been

473
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,050
sentenced to death.

474
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,800
He is lucky to

475
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,750
escape that fate.

476
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,790
Your Majesty,

477
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,160
Shen Yu told me

478
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,960
the marquis had personally inspected the dam

479
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,560
and confirmed there was no risk of breaking

480
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,840
before he started

481
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,320
recruiting volunteers

482
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,530
to reinforce the dam

483
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,320
and to block holes on it.

484
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,370
But the dam still breached.

485
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Did someone

486
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,300
purposefully make it happen?

487
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,730
Before the breach,

488
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,600
Marquis of Jing'an heard

489
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,930
some explosive sounds.

490
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,990
I visited many refugees today.

491
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,400
Some of them also

492
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
heard strange noises at that time.

493
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,560
But after the dam broke,

494
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,230
the flood washed all the trails away.

495
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,610
It's impossible to find a clue.

496
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,750
Xu.

497
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,640
As you said,

498
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,560
the truth of this case is

499
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,200
impossible to be found out.

500
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,360
Nothing can reverse Marquis of Jing'an's conviction.

501
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,670
If only the whole thing could end with it.

502
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,190
What do you mean?

503
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,750
I've found out

504
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,300
that the refugees' unrest

505
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,290
was orchestrated by Haiyou Sect.

506
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,420
The mastermind went to great lengths

507
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,190
to set a trap in Lizhou

508
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,160
and to instigate riots in the capital.

509
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,510
Is his goal

510
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,810
only to remove Marquis of Jing'an

511
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,650
from his job and noble status?

512
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,810
The conspiracy is not over yet.

513
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,750
Commander Lu, this is the place.

514
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,510
The Ming family owns

515
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,670
two mansions in the capital.

516
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,230
This is their ancestral home.

517
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,710
No one lives in this remote house.

518
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,430
It must've been deserted years ago.

519
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,510
Go inside and check around.

520
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,120
Seal it off if you find nothing wrong.

521
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,510
Yes.

522
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,720
Come with me!

523
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,910
Commander Lu, we have a finding.

524
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,360
Sir, I've figured it out.

525
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,230
The Dingbei soldier who attempted

526
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,290
to kill the marquis

527
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,990
joined the army not long ago.

528
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,470
He volunteered to accompany

529
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,800
General Shen to Lizhou.

530
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
I've checked his

531
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,640
enlistment files carefully,

532
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,670
and found nothing unusual.

533
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,870
His identity and household
registration also seem fine.

534
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,340
This man took his own life.

535
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,000
He was either very brave,

536
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
or under someone's control.

537
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,920
Whoever could do that is no ordinary man.

538
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,380
I guess he did it for money.

539
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,510
According to my findings,

540
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,470
his son is seriously ill

541
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,530
and in need of money

542
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,320
to pay for medical help.

543
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,240
By the way,

544
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Your wife is waiting for you in the camp.

545
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,710
Tan.

546
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,510
Do you know why my father pleaded guilty?

547
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,840
He only admitted

548
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,120
his guilt for the disaster

549
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
relief measures.

550
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,920
It doesn't mean he's the culprit

551
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,090
of the Lizhou case.

552
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,880
Why did the Emperor convict him so hastily?

553
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,850
Why not wait till my father returns

554
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,340
and the truth is revealed?

555
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,360
All the evidence

556
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,560
was destroyed in the flood.

557
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,150
Lizhou citizens have all
testified against the marquis.

558
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,880
If the investigation continues,

559
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,140
it will only provoke public resentment.

560
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,450
It'll get your father in bigger trouble.

561
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,920
But my father is innocent.

562
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,350
♪ It's a journey full of ups and downs ♪

563
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,470
This must be a set-up.

564
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,800
The court should help my father

This is just a routine investigation.

The results

702
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,360

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,420
that no one here has offended the law,

707
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
or engaged in unlawful acts.

708
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,160
Why should there be a search?

709
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,030

Don't try to intimidate me.

The document just now

717
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,070
is not a search warrant.

718
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,590
How can you say we're not cooperating?

719
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,679
It's the court's order to
conduct an investigation.

720
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,679
As to how to proceed,

721
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
the Capital Prefecture has the final say.

722
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm saying the mansion must be searched.

723
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,590
It means the search is necessary.

724
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,790
Any attempt to stop us

725
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,040
will be interpreted as
contempt for the law

726
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,030
and defiance of the court!

727
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,360

It's rightful for the Capital Prefecture

to carry out its duties.

733
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,610
But what the Princess Consort said also makes sense.

734
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,880
I have a question.

735
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,920
Who ordered you

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,400

the Imperial Guards discovered
incriminating items

743

in the Ming family's ancestral home.

744
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,920
His Majesty was furious

745
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,110
and ordered the Capital Prefecture
to assist the Court of Review

746
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,840
in conducting a thorough investigation.

747
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,990
Since the Princess Consort

748
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,470
is from the Ming family,

749
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,360
Your Highnesses should
be investigated as well.

750
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Whether my father should be

751
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,110

752
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,370
is not determined yet.

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,800
disaster relief.

755
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,550
What do you mean by "incriminating items"?

756
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,950
There is solid evidence.

757
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,840
I am not making up stories.

758
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm going to meet the Emperor now

759
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,060
for more information.

760
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,920
Listen,

761
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,110
Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

762
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,240
is not a place anyone can just barge in.

763
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,950
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

764
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,760
Officer, just report to the Emperor

765
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,290
about what happened today.

766
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,360
I will bear

767
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,950
any consequences.

768
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,110
Zhuiying!

769
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,400
Here I am!

770
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,950
Tell Shen Yu to

771
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,840
guard the mansion with a troop now.

772
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,760
If anyone breaks in,

773
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,680
take this person down right away.

774
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,810
No need to notify me.

775
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,510
Yes!

776
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,600
Let's go!

777
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,290
[Prince of Dingbei's Mansion]

778
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,630
Is the Lizhou case

779
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,800
related to my godfather?

780
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,950
My people are investigating it.

781
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,360
But there's no evidence at the moment.

782
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,970
Does the Vice Minister of Revenue Liu Mo

783
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,990
work for my godfather?

784
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,550
Why do you ask?

785
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,840
Do you remember?

786
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,510
That day, when I was taking a stroll

787
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,710
in South Yuhe Street,

788
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,480
I ran into Vice Minister Liu.

789
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,280
He smelled the same

790
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,510
as the man

791
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,510
I met on my way

792
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,070
to rescue Jiurou.

793
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,840
On the eve of our wedding,

794
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,090
a mysterious man tried to
take me away from the capital.

795
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,800
So many coincidences.

796
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,030
I think they are connected.

797
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,350
[Flower Brook]

798
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,590
Greetings, Godfather.

799
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,070
Oh, Tan.

800
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,510
Sit down.

801
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,800
Try them. They're your favorites.

802
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,330
Thank you, Godfather.

803
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,680
My stomach hasn't been

804
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,110
feeling well these days.

805
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,360
I'm afraid I can't eat these now.

806
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,810
You seem to have lost some weight.

807
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,320
When you felt

808
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,400
reluctant to study or upset about

809
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,360
something in childhood,

810
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,100
a plate of sweet snakes

811
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,770
was all it took to comfort you.

812
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,540
You care a lot about me.

813
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,240
I've never forgotten it.

814
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,640
Well...

815
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,840
I asked to meet with you today

816
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,620
because I have a favor to ask.

817
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,270
Godfather, please help

818
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,990
my father out of danger.

819
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,880
You two have been friends for decades.

820
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,990
You know my father well.

821
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,470
There's no way he'd

822
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,550
harm the people

823
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,990
or disrupt the society.

824
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,510
What are you doing?

825
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,550
Get up now.

826
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,550
His failure in disaster relief was unexpected.

827
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,030
No one would like it to happen.

828
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,950
Your father

829
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,150
stands a chance of surviving this case.

830
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,950
But...

831
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,960
Colluding with the enemy

832
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,150
and smuggling are capital crimes.

833
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,630
Nobody

834
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,680
can save your father's life.

835
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,290
What are you talking about?

836
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,420
Marquis of Jing'an

837
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,400
would never collude with
the enemy or smuggle.

838
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,060
I also find it hard to believe.

839
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
But with such conclusive evidence,

840
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,240
I can't defend him anymore.

841
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,950
This is just

842
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,360
Nanlyu's side of the story.

843
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,150
All it proves is that they

844
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,590
attempted to bribe Marquis of Jing'an.

845
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,400
We haven't seen the marquis's reply yet.

846
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
How can this letter prove

847
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,470
him guilty of colluding with the enemy?

848
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,510
A few letters from Nanlyu can't be

849
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,720
solid evidence.

850
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,550
The Imperial Guards have discovered

851
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,680
a large number of smuggled valuables.

852
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,150
Those are irrefutable proof.

853
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,070
The marquis must be guilty.

854
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,110
The Imperial Guards have
found the smuggled items,

855
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,910
which are conclusive evidence.

856
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,360
Given your bond with your father,

857
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,290
I understand that you can't accept

858
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,800
the reality right away.

859
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,560
That's impossible.

860
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,760
My father would never

861
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,090
collude with the enemy.

862
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,280
Godfather,

863
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,590
my father joined the military
when he was young.

864
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,920
He has always zealously

865
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,630
protected the country

866
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,990
and the people.

867
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,890
No matter what position he holds,

868
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,840
his ambition has never changed.

869
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,240
Now,

870
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,510
he is no longer in charge

871
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,990
of Yangxi Prefecture.

872
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,110
He asserts no influence

873
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,360
on the court's affairs.

874
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,550
I beg you, Godfather.

875
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,650
Please save my father's life.

876
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,760
Ridiculous.

877
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,610
Can you prove what you said is true?

878
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:11,920
Do you know

879
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,840
the person plotting against your father

880
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,400
is actually your husband, Prince of Dingbei?

881
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,110
It was he who offered to

882
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,110
send a troop of Dingbei Army to

883
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,400
escort your father back

884
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,880
from Lizhou.

885
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,360
Do you know what happened on the way?

886
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,150
A soldier from Dingbei Army

887
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,950
released your father at night,

888
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,550
insisting that it was the prince's order

889
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,990
to set the marquis free.

890
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,800
Doubtlessly, the prince did it

891
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,070
only to prove

892
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,280
your father guilty

893
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,270
without implicating himself!

894
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,530
That can't be true.

895
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,360
Before your father was convicted,

896
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,030
Prince of Dingbei led the Imperial Guards

897
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,070
to confiscate his property.

898
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,240
Why would he do that?

899
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,950
He was apparently severing ties

900
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,110
with your father.

901
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,240
Tan’er,

902
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,470
think about it.

903
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,360
Since your father got in trouble,

904
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,080
what exactly has Jiang Xu done

905
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,400
for the Ming family?

906
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,590
Godfather,

907
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,240
I don't care about political struggles,

908
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,700
stances or conspiracies.

909
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,920
Power, status and wealth

910
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,510
mean nothing to me.

911
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,090
All I ask is that my father can live.

912
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,400
Marquis of Jing'an is an official.

913
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,330
He is inevitably involved
in political struggles.

914
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,530
He chose Prince
of Beiding to be your husband

915
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,190
simply because the prince

916
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,590
could bring more power

917
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,680
to the Ming family. Don't you know?
