1
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,030
(Youthful Glory)

2
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,900
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,780
It's just a royal marriage.

4
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,420
I understand if those outside the mansion
want to flatter her.

5
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,880
But now even a maid from her courtyard

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,210
dares to talk back to me!

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
Everyone in the mansion now

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
is focusing on the Zhaoshui House.

9
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,120
They're not worried about too much work.

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,340
They're only worried they can't do things

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,270
well enough to show their loyalty.

12
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,440
What's so great about it?

13
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,100
I think Prince of Dingbei is as blinded

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,860
as any ordinary man.

15
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,830
He's been bewitched by that vixen,

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,940
and he hasn't even realized it.

17
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,550
Chu, you mustn't let

18
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,240
your father hear such words.

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,380
He's spent so much effort these days

20
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,080
trying to find you a good match.

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't anger him

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,199
at a time like this.

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,870
No matter how much effort he puts in,

24
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,330
it can't compare to the glory
of being the Princess of Dingbei.

25
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,550
Of course you are no match

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,320
for Ming Tan.

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,150
Her marriage was bestowed by His Majesty,

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,060
and her future husband
is the Prince of Dingbei.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
He's not someone an ordinary girl

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
can marry.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,890
I know.

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,980
But how am I worse than her?

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,200
You're certainly not worse than her.

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,170
It's all my fault.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,290
If your birth mother were Her Grace,

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,360
it would be you who'll marry

37
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,840
the Prince of Dingbei.

38
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,730
Mother.

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,800
You can call me Mother

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,700
in private,

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
but you can't do that in public.

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Otherwise,

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
if Ming Tan hears it,

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
she'll cause trouble for you again.

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,880
But honestly,

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,500
if you could really become the princess,

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,780
everyone who sees you

48
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,240
would have to respect

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
and obey you.

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,630
Even Ming Tan

51
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,900
would have to bow and greet you.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Alright, let's not talk about this.

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,200
Let's go. Don't be late
for the blind date.

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm not going!

55
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,790
Just because I'm her elder sister,

56
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,880
I have to rush into marriage

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,700
before her.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,880
How is that fair?

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,260
The blind date
was arranged by your father.

60
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
How can you disobey?

61
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,170
I can go to the blind date,

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,780
but why does Ming Tan have to go with me?

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,480
Clearly she's just going

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,560
to laugh at me.

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,200
It was my idea.

66
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,410
Ming Tan is
the future Princess of Dingbei.

67
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,730
If she goes with you,

68
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,190
it will bring you honor.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,750
And the family you're meeting

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,410
won't dare to look down on you.

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Listen to me.

72
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,700
Just go out as usual.

73
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,850
Be careful on the way.

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
No matter what happens,

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
just protect yourself.

76
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:21,829
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

77
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,090
Be careful.
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

78
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,210
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

79
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,230
Fourth Miss's outing
must be taken seriously.
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

80
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,710
Yes.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Third Miss.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,780
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,300
Legitimacy and hierarchy must be observed.

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,150
Fourth Miss hasn't boarded the carriage.

85
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,280
It's improper for you
to board the carriage first.

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,700
Seniority must be observed.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,770
I am her elder sister.

88
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,620
I should board the carriage first.

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,500
Third Miss,

90
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,350
Fourth Miss is specially going

91
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,880
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)
Fourth Miss is specially going

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:04:59,920
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,800
with you to the meeting today
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

94
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:01,840
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,480
out of your sisterhood,
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,910
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

97
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,270
yet you're still so arrogant
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

98
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,400
yet you're still so arrogant

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,530
and disrespectful.

100
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,570
Then why should Fourth Miss

101
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,190
go through all this trouble?

102
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,100
You...

103
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,730
Third Miss, please get off the carriage.

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,500
This is our Third Miss.

105
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,550
Thank you.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,280
No problem.

107
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,130
Young Master Lu has been waiting

108
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,430
at the Huiji Hall.

109
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,470
Third Miss Ming, please.

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,420
Greetings, Fourth Miss.

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,610
Where's Minmin?

112
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,530
She said

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,660
everything's been going poorly,

114
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,930
and she's been targeted everywhere.

115
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,120
She thinks she must have offended someone.

116
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,060
So she went to the hall to draw
a divination lot to ask about her fortune.

117
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,290
She said once she's done,

118
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,350
she'll go to you in the back mountain.

119
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,870
You go ahead for the meeting.

120
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,130
I'll wait for you here.

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Why don't you

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
go in with me?

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,060
It's not proper to have someone

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,550
accompany you on a blind date.

125
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,670
Go alone.

126
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,159
I'm worried I might say something improper

127
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,610
to scare her.

128
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,860
It won't be that bad.

129
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,340
You are Commander Lu,

130
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,100
deeply favored by His Majesty.

131
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,070
Don't worry too much.

132
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,000
Just handle it with a calm heart.

133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,500
I...

134
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,430
You just need to remember

135
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,210
the purpose of a blind date

136
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,580
is to find someone you like

137
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,820
and get married.

138
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,150
So what's the most important?

139
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,130
What?

140
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,070
Your feelings for her.

141
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,470
Whether you like her or not,

142
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,820
you'll know at a glance.

143
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,990
If you like her,

144
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,830
you'll naturally ask questions

145
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,230
to get to know her better.

146
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,830
But if you don't like her,

147
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,150
you'll want to leave.

148
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:20,890
Then

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,540
just make an excuse to leave.

150
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,390
This is an important life event.

151
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,340
It's normal even if
you don't like each other.

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,470
You'll get used to it after a few times.

153
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,530
No need to be nervous.

154
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,390
Have you ever been on a blind date?

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,500
No.

156
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,890
Alright.

157
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,670
Wait for me here.

158
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,190
Go.

159
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,620
Commander Lu.

160
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,659
Commander Lu.

161
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,360
This is Third Miss Ming.

162
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,470
Third Miss,

163
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,660
this is Commander Lu.

164
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,000
You two talk.

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,670
I'll wait outside.

166
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,830
Please, Third Miss Ming.

167
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,650
(Salvation with Compassion)

168
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,450
Please sit.
(Salvation with Compassion)

169
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,340
(Salvation with Compassion)

170
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,700
I...

171
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,140
Lu Ting...

172
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm Lu Ting. Greetings, Third Miss Ming.

173
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,210
Nice to meet you, Third Miss Ming.

174
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,910
Young Master Lu, are you really

175
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,310
the Deputy Commander of the Palace Guards?

176
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,490
Of course.

177
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,100
Why do you ask, Third Miss Ming?

178
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,590
Young Master Lu, you look ordinary,

179
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,140
and your words are shallow.

180
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,610
You're favored by His Majesty,

181
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,540
but at most,

182
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,470
you'll only be promoted to the Commander.

183
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,050
The Lu family has no noble lineage

184
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,120
or hereditary titles.

185
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,180
Your career prospects seem limited.

186
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,490
Compared to other young masters
from noble families,

187
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,300
Young Master Lu, your background

188
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,820
is indeed not good enough.

189
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,550
I wonder how large your mansion is

190
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,310
and how many servants you have.

191
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,610
I haven't bought a mansion,

192
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,290
and I don't have any servants.

193
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,250
Most of the time,

194
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,730
I'm on duty in the palace.

195
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,940
I'm used to simple meals

196
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
and frugal living.

197
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,350
Of course the Ming family is much better.

198
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
Commander Lu,

199
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,350
you have a bad reputation

200
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,400
for stopping kids from crying at night.

201
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,970
Everyone in the capital

202
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,230
would avoid you.

203
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
With such a bad reputation, no mansion,

204
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,140
and no career prospects,

205
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,230
what gives you the confidence
to come to the blind date?

206
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,840
Not having a mansion

207
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,340
doesn't mean I can't afford it.

208
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,980
I just want

209
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,240
to let my future wife decide everything.

210
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
Moreover,

211
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,990
His Majesty once granted me
a three-courtyard mansion.

212
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,950
But I suppose,

213
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,200
in Third Miss Ming's eyes,

214
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,130
it's surely not worth mentioning.

215
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,460
(Salvation with Compassion)

216
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

217
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,410
It's just a blind date.

218
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,830
Material things are not worth mentioning.

219
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,900
Since it's a blind date,

220
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,140
we should get to know each other

221
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,450
and know each other's background.

222
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,190
Why can't we mention

223
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,350
material things?

224
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,030
You have a point.

225
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,980
Commander Lu...

226
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,700
But...

227
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
it's understandable that you have

228
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,970
your own considerations.

229
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
I also have my own considerations.

230
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,370
Perhaps you and I don't see eye to eye,

231
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,930
and we are not like-minded.

232
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I prefer frugal living.

233
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,350
I don't like mansions.

234
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,280
And I don't want anyone to serve me.

235
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm leaving.

236
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,940
(Huiji Hall)

237
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,020
Young Master Lu.
(Huiji Hall)

238
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,980
(Huiji Hall)

239
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,140
You're leaving?
(Huiji Hall)

240
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,220
(Huiji Hall)

241
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,140
Third Miss.
(Huiji Hall)

242
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,020
(Salvation with Compassion)

243
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,940
My younger sister will marry into
(Salvation with Compassion)

244
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,460
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
as the princess!
(Salvation with Compassion)

245
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,100
the Prince of Dingbei's Mansion
as the princess!

246
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,580
How could such an ill-mannered person

247
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,620
from a humble background

248
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,820
be a good match for me?

249
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,980
You claim to be

250
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,340
the capital's top matchmaker!

251
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,300
What kind of person did you find?

252
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,940
I...

253
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,060
Fourth Miss is virtuous and accomplished.

254
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,340
She's the best
among the capital's noble ladies.

255
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,980
She deserves to be the princess.

256
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,660
What does it have to do with you?

257
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,790
-You...
-If it weren't for his humble background

258
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,630
and having no parents
to arrange his marriage,

259
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,370
the Commander of the Imperial Guards

260
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,540
(Salvation with Compassion)
the Commander of the Imperial Guards

261
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:30,660
(Salvation with Compassion)

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,860
wouldn't have come to meet you.
(Salvation with Compassion)

263
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,400
Second Young Master Shu.

264
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,280
Let's go.

265
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,300
-Second Young Master Shu.
-Second Young Master Shu.

266
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,040
-Se-Second Young Master Shu.
-Second Young Master Shu.

267
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,660
Second Young Master Shu.

268
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,860
Keep it as a souvenir.

269
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,720
No, no.

270
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,950
Take mine.

271
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,580
-Take mine.
-And mine.

272
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,940
-And mine.
-Take mine.

273
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,260
Second Young Master Shu, take mine.

274
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,940
Second Young Master Shu.

275
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,870
-Second Young Master Shu.
-Second Young Master Shu.

276
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,580
Second Young Master Shu, take mine.

277
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,260
-Second Young Master Shu.
-Second Young Master Shu.

278
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,710
Lu! Lu!

279
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,590
I'm here! Save me!

280
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,930
Everyone, go away!

281
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,290
-Second Young Master Shu.
-Second Young Master Shu.

282
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,220
I am Lu Ting, Commander of the Imperial Guards.

283
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,700
What are your names?

284
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
Why were you surrounding Second Young Master Shu?

285
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,660
What do you want?

286
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,180
Tell me one by one!

287
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,440
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,940
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

289
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,050
When it comes to authority
and commanding presence,

290
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,250
it's got to be you, Lu.

291
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,470
Luckily, you're here.

292
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,530
Otherwise, today,

293
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,880
I wouldn't have been able to move an inch.

294
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,730
What were they doing?

295
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,590
Giving me gifts.

296
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,420
Giving gifts?

297
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,790
Why did it look like
they were fighting over someone?

298
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,250
With so many accessories,

299
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,940
you could set up a stall on the street

300
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,820
tomorrow.

301
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,890
Given how popular you are,

302
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,490
business would surely boom.

303
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,990
Great idea.

304
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,630
Then Commander Lu, please go

305
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,940
to South Yuhe Street tomorrow

306
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,820
to set up a stall.

307
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,620
It'll be your side business

308
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,350
outside your official duties.

309
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,260
Miss, anything else?

310
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
My hairpin.

311
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,420
When we were making wishes earlier,

312
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,300
the candle flame on the altar
flickered twice.

313
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,900
That means our business

314
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,460
will surely flourish.

315
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,300
Sincerity brings results, after all.

316
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,860
Xu,

317
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,780
in the future, we should

318
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,820
come to offer incense often,

319
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,940
so our business may continue to prosper.

320
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,470
I'll come to offer incense.

321
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,780
You handle the military affairs for me.

322
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,800
Forget what I said.

323
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,780
It's him.

324
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,190
(Fear and anxiety are before your eyes.
Guidance from the wise dispels confusion.)

325
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
Master.

326
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,660
Fear and anxiety are before your eyes.

327
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,780
Guidance from the wise dispels confusion.

328
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,580
Miss,

329
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,920
you may encounter petty troublemakers.

330
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,500
You may be easily agitated,

331
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,060
causing disputes.

332
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
Exactly.

333
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,980
Master, please grant me a talisman

334
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,820
to ward off vile people

335
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,150
and dispel misfortune.

336
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,280
Thank you, Master.

337
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

339
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,820
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,820
My Lady,

341
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,340
your zither skills have greatly improved.

342
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,900
But I feel in the final part,

343
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,630
if a few notes were changed,

344
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,700
the mood would align
more closely with the moment.

345
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,300
Listen.

346
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,560
The melody flows smoothly,
graceful and full of emotion.

347
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,980
In the capital, only Fourth Miss Ming

348
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,540
has such skills.

349
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,860
Her?

350
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,100
This...

351
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,380
is strange.

352
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,020
With Fourth Miss Ming's skills,

353
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,380
how could she make a mistake

354
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,580
in the final part?

355
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,670
I get it, Xu.

356
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,030
Fourth Miss Ming did it intentionally.

357
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
Why?

358
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,010
A flawed tune draws Zhou Yu's gaze.

359
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,190
Go, Zhou Yu.

360
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,880
Go meet your future princess.

361
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,490
Troublemaker Zhang?

362
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,970
Why is he here?

363
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,660
How...

364
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,980
You really can't talk about people
behind their backs.

365
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,099
Speak of the devil.

366
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,220
But this talisman

367
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,099
must be given no matter what.

368
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,819
Young Lord Zhang.

369
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,780
You're also here with your friend

370
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,040
to pray for blessings?

371
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,430
What's wrong with her?

372
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,579
Yes.

373
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,900
Miss Bai, you too?

374
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,150
Yes.

375
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,780
Minmin.

376
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,860
Tan.

377
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,670
Greetings, Prince of Dingbei.

378
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,950
He... He...

379
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,910
He is the Prince of Dingbei?

380
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,780
Greetings, Prince of Dingbei.

381
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,070
No need for such formalities.

382
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,830
We'll be family soon.

383
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,120
So there's no need for such formalities.

384
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
I was wondering who

385
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,120
was playing the zither here.

386
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,610
It turns out it was you, Tan.

387
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,470
Tan, you were in quite a good mood.

388
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,730
I guess you and I are destined to meet.

389
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,140
After meeting once before,

390
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,440
we meet again here.

391
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,380
Who are you?

392
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,380
You don't remember me?

393
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,660
We met at an inn

394
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,350
on the outskirts of the city.

395
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
I don't remember.

396
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Chu, I thought you were

397
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,260
on a blind date at the Huiji Hall.

398
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,540
It ended so quickly?

399
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,260
Though he came from a good family,

400
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,820
with a promising career and decent looks,

401
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,490
after talking with him for a while,

402
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,780
I felt we didn't see eye to eye.

403
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,300
It's hard to have mutual understanding.

404
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,360
So I had to decline.

405
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,580
Actually, a blind date
is all about the first impression.

406
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,100
Family background and career prospects

407
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,630
are not the most important.

408
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,300
Xu.

409
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,300
Third Miss Ming, we meet again.

410
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,920
I'd rather we hadn't.

411
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't tell me

412
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,750
today's blind date was for you two.

413
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
So?

414
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,830
Commander Lu, are you interested?

415
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,390
I'm afraid it's impossible

416
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,630
between Third Miss Ming and me.

417
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,410
Third Miss Ming thinks I look ordinary

418
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,810
and come from a humble background.

419
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,140
And I have a bad reputation.

420
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,660
I...

421
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Also, my career is not promising,

422
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,830
and I don't have my own mansion.

423
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,070
It's understandable.

424
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,190
I hope Third Miss Ming

425
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,580
can find someone she likes

426
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
soon.

427
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,620
What do you mean?

428
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,940
I... mean nothing.

429
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,350
Did I say anything wrong?

430
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,420
Commander Lu,

431
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,980
you really are straightforward.

432
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,650
Alright, alright.

433
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,900
Fate has brought us together.

434
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,780
Since we've all met here,

435
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,140
why don't you join us

436
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,580
for tea and music?

437
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,970
Fourth Miss Ming.

438
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,420
Please.

439
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,220
Tan, you've always cared
about your reputation.

440
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,340
You fell into the Xian River that day,

441
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,950
and it has been kept a secret.

442
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,620
Now you're engaged,

443
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,300
but you're out here flaunting yourself.

444
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,420
If word gets out,

445
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,220
aren't you worried
the Prince of Dingbei would blame you?

446
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

447
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
You weren't even in the capital
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

448
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,900
Which eye of yours

449
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
saw Tan fall into the river?

450
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
I think you're just slandering Tan because

451
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,140
your blind date didn't go well.

452
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm slandering her?

453
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,960
Don't think I don't know

454
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,020
that day, the two of you

455
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,580
specially disguised yourselves

456
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,980
just to sneak into the Capital Garrison

457
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,240
to see what Prince of Dingbei looks like.

458
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,770
What?

459
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,900
Tan, you're the one who always cares

460
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,340
so much about reputation.

461
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,100
Shut up!

462
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,660
I think you're deliberately

463
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
trying to ruin Tan's reputation!

464
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,500
-Stop! Stop!
-Stop talking nonsense!

465
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,660
We're all on the same side.

466
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,480
Don't ruin the harmony.

467
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,450
Go away!

468
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,940
Everything I said is true.

469
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,820
What?

470
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
You could sneak
into the Capital Garrison for a peek,

471
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,580
but I can't talk about it?

472
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,360
I'm not wrongly accusing you.

473
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,660
My gentle elegance

474
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,010
and grace

475
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,060
have been totally ruined today.

476
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,660
And it was right in front of him.

477
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,500
Ming Tan, you tell them yourself.

478
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,850
Is everything I said...

479
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,220
My Lady!

480
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,500
My Lady! What's wrong?

481
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
-My Lady!
-Tan!

482
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,500
Pretending to faint again.

483
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,180
You've used this trick since childhood.

484
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,620
Can you come up with something new?

485
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,390
Listen, Tan...

486
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,260
Finally, the one being treated this way

487
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
is not me.

488
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,860
Looks like your future husband

489
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,360
did something to Ming Chu.

490
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,830
He struck her acupoint?

491
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,550
Tan, what's wrong?

492
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,420
Leave me alone.

493
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,220
Then just calm down.

494
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,900
But how can I calm down?

495
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,980
My embarrassing moments
were exposed in front of everyone.

496
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
After they go back,

497
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,580
who knows

498
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,890
how they will mock me?

499
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,380
I think you're overthinking it.

500
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,020
I believe those people

501
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,780
are friends of the Prince of Dingbei's.

502
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,900
They surely won't gossip behind his back.

503
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,520
Even if they won't gossip,

504
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
the image I spent so many years

505
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,700
building

506
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,980
has been ruined.

507
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,980
And it happened
right in front of the Prince of Dingbei.

508
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,180
It was truly embarrassing.

509
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,540
I wonder

510
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,100
what he will think of me.

511
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,550
It sounds like

512
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,900
you want to marry him?

513
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,020
I also think

514
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,950
your future husband is quite good.

515
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
What's good about him?

516
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,880
Earlier, I already thought

517
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,300
the Prince of Dingbei is a good match

518
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,710
in every aspect given his good background.

519
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,860
But you refused him due to

520
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,980
his rumored appearance.

521
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,340
But after seeing him today,

522
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,220
I think he is tall and imposing,

523
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,260
with extraordinary demeanor.

524
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,220
He completely meets
your criteria for your future husband.

525
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,630
In my opinion,

526
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,860
the Prince of Dingbei

527
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,130
doesn't seem as cold as they say.

528
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Just now, when you pretended to faint,

529
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,780
he didn't expose you in front of everyone,

530
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,630
and he protected your dignity.

531
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,820
My Lady, you often talked about

532
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,250
how your future husband should be.

533
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,530
After seeing him,

534
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,980
I think the Prince of Dingbei is exactly

535
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,350
what you described.

536
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you really think

537
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,970
the Prince of Dingbei is a good match?

538
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,840
How embarrassing!

539
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,850
This is strange. Where's the talisman?

540
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,810
Miss Bai.

541
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,870
Young Lord Zhang.

542
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,160
Miss Bai, when you were fighting earlier,

543
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,080
you dropped something.

544
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,020
Shut up!

545
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,820
-Stop! Stop!
-You're trying to ruin Tan's reputation!

546
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,400
Stop talking nonsense!

547
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,210
Young Lord Zhang, I specially asked

548
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,920
for this amulet for you.

549
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,300
It must be fate

550
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,750
that you found it.

551
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,730
You mean

552
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,180
this amulet was

553
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,840
specially asked for me?

554
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,260
Specially.

555
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,880
Specially?

556
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
Miss Bai.

557
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,140
I truly appreciate

558
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,820
your kindness.

559
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,820
But now,

560
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,500
I don't have anything good

561
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
to give you

562
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,220
in return.

563
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,180
I will

564
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,850
carefully select a gift

565
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,730
to thank you some other day.

566
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,710
No need for that.

567
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,470
I should.

568
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
The master at the temple said

569
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,620
the amulet

570
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,980
must be carried every day.

571
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,260
And it's best to place it

572
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,620
under your pillow at night.

573
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,760
Only then will it

574
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,380
give you the strongest protection.

575
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,140
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

576
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,760
I'll carry it every day.

577
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,200
If there's nothing else,

578
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,260
I'll take my leave.

579
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,260
My Lady, you're still

580
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
upset about what happened earlier?

581
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,070
I wonder what the Prince of Dingbei

582
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,070
truly thinks.

583
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,680
In my opinion,

584
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,570
you're overthinking it.

585
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,650
He is your future husband.

586
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,980
In his heart,

587
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,580
he naturally sides with you.

588
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,820
Otherwise, when he saw you
pretend to faint,

589
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,020
he wouldn't have struck

590
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,700
Third Miss's mute acupoint.

591
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,810
He looks cold,

592
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,150
but he's thoughtful.

593
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,540
With such a

594
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,090
considerate husband,

595
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,180
My Lady, you'll surely live comfortably

596
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,510
after getting married.

597
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,870
What husband?

598
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,460
If others hear this,

599
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,070
they'd think I'm desperate to marry him.

600
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,990
So what if others hear it?

601
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,580
The marriage has been decreed.

602
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,380
The Prince of Dingbei

603
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,440
will be your husband sooner or later.

604
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,550
Surround them!

605
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,050
What's going on?

606
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,400
I... I think they're bandits.

607
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,980
Bandits?

608
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,110
How dare you!

609
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,820
Do you know whose convoy this is?

610
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
You're utterly lawless!

611
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,590
We only want your valuables,
not your lives!

612
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,820
If you're smart, give us

613
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,240
all your gold and silver!

614
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,660
If the bandits only want valuables,

615
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,820
why are they targeting
an official's carriages?

616
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,860
They ambushed us here.

617
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,520
Clearly, they came prepared!

618
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,120
Be careful on the way.

619
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,700
No matter what happens,

620
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,010
just protect yourself.

621
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,100
You've got the wrong person.

622
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,620
The person you want

623
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,340
is in the carriage ahead.

624
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,120
Go now!

625
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,740
These two maids are good too!

626
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,380
Take them too!

627
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,210
Come out!

628
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,140
Let go!

629
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,760
-My Lady!
-My Lady!

630
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,900
Suxin!

631
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,760
Move!

632
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,420
Let go! Let go!

633
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,180
Move!

634
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,990
Let me go!

635
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,620
Release me!

636
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,740
Help!

637
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,220
Put me down!

638
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,640
Let go of me!

639
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,040
Let go!

640
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
Let go!

641
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,940
H-Honey?

642
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,790
That's... That's not what I mean.

643
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,280
Fourth Miss!

644
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,540
Fourth Miss, this...

645
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,780
This...

646
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,720
-My Lady.
-My Lady.

647
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,060
Th-Thank you for saving us.

648
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,420
I told you Xu

649
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,620
and Fourth Miss Ming were fated to meet.

650
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,860
After coming to Hanyan Temple,

651
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,390
they already met twice.

652
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
This is fate.

653
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,180
Take them away. Keep them alive.

654
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,780
Yes.

655
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,760
Take them away!

656
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,200
Take them away!

657
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,630
Since we met each other,

658
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,180
he has saved me many times.

659
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,820
Even though we are engaged,

660
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,140
he has never sought credit

661
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,790
or overstepped the bounds.

662
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,180
It seems Father was right.

663
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,460
He is indeed

664
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,800
a trustworthy person.

665
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,900
-Miss Ming.
-Miss Ming.

666
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,860
Thank you for saving my life.

667
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,580
About the bandits incident today,

668
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,020
young masters, please don't tell anyone

669
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,080
for the sake of

670
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,280
the reputation of the two young ladies.

671
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,580
The authorities won't know about this.

672
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,740
Hurry. Let's go back.

673
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,400
Yes.

674
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
Sir, save your wife's life.

675
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,070
Pay for the ginseng now, please.

676
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,700
Not bad.

677
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,900
Come here.

678
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,580
Look.

679
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,780
Master.

680
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,180
Be careful.

681
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,620
Look. And here.

682
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,610
Okay.

683
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,630
Master, you feel hot?

684
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,250
That is not the point.

685
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,180
Master, please don't stand in the way.

686
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,140
Haven't you noticed

687
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,740
anything different about my fan today?

688
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,140
What's different about it?

689
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,620
You're so unobservant.

690
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,060
Haven't you noticed

691
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,870
there's a talisman on the fan?

692
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,940
It's just a talisman.

693
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,440
Who hasn't asked for a few?

694
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,580
The talisman is not the point either.

695
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,240
Then what is the point?

696
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,740
In old times, a beauty twirled her ring,

697
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,140
remembering her love when seeing the ring.

698
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,540
Now, a beauty gave me an amulet as a gift

699
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,140
to express her affection silently.

700
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
What does that mean?

701
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,650
It means a beauty likes Master.

702
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,980
She gave him the talisman
to express her feelings.

703
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,840
Shuiying, you're so perceptive.

704
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,790
Young Lord, you're handsome.

705
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,120
It's natural that a beauty likes you.

706
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,800
What's important is

707
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,140
Young Lord, you also have

708
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,140
feelings for the beauty.

709
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,750
Keep it low-key.

710
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,460
Things like this should stay hidden,

711
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,000
not spoken loud.

712
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,840
Peach blossom talismans from Hanyan Temple

713
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,139
are the most effective.

714
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,230
Looks like the beauty

715
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,460
has liked you for a long time.

716
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,280
Peach blossom talismans?

717
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,340
This is a peach blossom talisman?

718
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,199
Peach blossom.

719
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,560
The girls here often ask for this talisman

720
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,460
to give to the ones they like.

721
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,139
But she told me

722
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,239
this was an amulet.

723
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,139
She was just shy to tell you directly.

724
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,780
Young Lord, you just said it shouldn't

725
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,350
be spoken loud, right?

726
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,900
From now on, this altar

727
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,110
needs to be cleaned every day.

728
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,940
Change the fresh flowers every three days.

729
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,780
The incense must never go out.

730
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,660
Yes.

731
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,500
Also,

732
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
never touch this talisman,

733
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,380
so that it won't
be contaminated by worldliness.

734
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,500
I'll tell them right away.

735
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
You handle this personally.

736
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,980
I don't trust anyone else.

737
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,780
Master,

738
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,750
I'm working two jobs,

739
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,900
Wentao Pavilion by day

740
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,940
and Bieyu House by night.

741
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm really very busy.

742
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,430
I don't have time

743
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,430
to take care of this little talisman.

744
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,520
Little talisman?

745
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Do you know how important

746
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,470
this talisman is?

747
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,180
Why didn't you complain about being tired

748
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
when you received double salaries?

749
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
Master,

750
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,220
since you value it so much,

751
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,150
you should clean it yourself
to show your sincerity.

752
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,870
How could you ask someone else to do it?

753
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,660
You have a point.

754
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,820
Go tell them now.

755
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,990
From now on, no one

756
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,860
is allowed to touch anything here.

757
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,610
Okay.

758
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,980
No.

759
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,140
No one is allowed
to enter this room from now on.

760
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,540
Leave. Hurry.

761
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,350
(Spring Blossoms, Autumn Fruits)

762
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,300
Chu,

763
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,120
your martial skills are good.

764
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Dealing with a few bandits

765
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,620
should be easy for you.

766
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,220
In such danger today,

767
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,510
why didn't you protect your sister?

768
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,100
I didn't protect her?

769
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,740
Those bandits weren't pushovers.

770
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,300
What could I do if I couldn't beat them?

771
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Besides,

772
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,660
Tan had guards with her.

773
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,110
I had no obligation to protect her.

774
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,820
I failed

775
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,420
to discipline Chu properly.

776
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,780
But, My lord,

777
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,110
although Chu knows some martial skills,

778
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,530
she is a girl after all.

779
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,640
How could she stand against bandits?

780
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,180
Fortunately, Fourth Miss is unharmed.

781
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,940
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able

782
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,620
to make up for it even if I die.

783
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,320
Enough.

784
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,380
Luckily, you're all safe.

785
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,280
This was, after all, an act of banditry.

786
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,380
But Chu failed to protect her sister.

787
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,660
She should be punished.

788
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,860
Go kneel in the ancestral hall for one day.

789
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,900
Liu failed to teach her daughter well.

790
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,340
She'll be confined
to Yiyun House for three days.

791
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,180
That's all.

792
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,620
Father, you're so biased!

793
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,760
Why should I be punished

794
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,700
for not protecting her?

795
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,740
She's a daughter of the Ming family.

796
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,500
Am I not a daughter of the Ming family?

797
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,340
Father, to you

798
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,560
and Tan,

799
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,580
am I just a guard

800
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,640
of the Ming family?

801
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,380
Chu.

802
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,700
Don't be disrespectful to your father.

803
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,200
Today, there's something

804
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
I don't understand.

805
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,580
Chu, I wanted to ask you privately,

806
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,180
but I guess

807
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,330
I have to ask you now.

808
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,520
Today, when the bandits took me,

809
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,700
Chu, why did you

810
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,530
deliberately stop the guards,

811
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,210
wink at the bandits,

812
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,460
and let them go?

813
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,540
What exactly did you want to do?

814
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,400
Chu.

815
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,130
Is what Tan said true?

816
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,180
That's right.

817
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,180
I asked the bandits

818
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,980
to kidnap her!

819
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,820
Then she won't be an eyesore!

820
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,440
You...

821
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,860
I can't believe I have raised

822
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,100
a daughter like you!

823
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,070
I've tolerated your arrogance

824
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,480
and willfulness all this time.

825
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,100
But how could you

826
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,660
be so cruel to your own sister?

827
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,820
No, no, My lord.

828
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,860
She... She just didn't think straight

829
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,580
and said it out of anger.

830
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,340
Shut up!

831
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,980
Just because of your excessive indulgence,

832
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,500
she has become

833
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,160
so arrogant and domineering.

834
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,660
Guards!

835
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,540
Take them to the ancestral hall!

836
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,680
Let go of me!

837
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,980
Father, you want to punish me.

838
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,380
I dare not defy you.

839
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,260
But Ming Tan disregarded her reputation

840
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,660
and secretly met with a man.

841
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,000
How will you punish her?

842
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,850
Secretly meeting with a man?

843
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,700
When my mother and I
were on our way back to the capital,

844
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
we took a break at Yinma Town.

845
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,620
We caught her meeting secretly with a man.

846
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,940
They acted intimately!

847
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,820
Sir, your wife left

848
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,300
out of anger when she discovered

849
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,500
your mistress.

850
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,970
How are you going to explain to your father

851
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,230
if his grandchild dies?

852
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,660
I did hear Chu mention this.

853
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,980
That man is already married.

854
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,540
And his wife is pregnant.

855
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,470
Could it be that Fourth Miss

856
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,740
is really involved

857
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,780
with that married man?

858
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,180
Madam Liu, mind your words!

859
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Without evidence,

860
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
how could you and Third Miss

861
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,820
slander Fourth Miss like this?

862
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,820
Father, I swear to God

863
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,220
that every word I said is true.

864
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,180
The person who rescued her

865
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,980
from the bandits today

866
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,740
is the same man

867
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,380
she met secretly at Yinma Town.

868
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,860
Actually, today at Hanyan Temple,

869
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,500
I caught them

870
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,650
meeting secretly.

871
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,120
To protect her, that man

872
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,040
even struck my mute acupoint!

873
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,420
Can you guys

874
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,580
spare me a moment's peace?

875
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,420
Father.

876
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,100
Ming Tan met with a man in secret.

877
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Even after being granted a royal marriage,

878
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,220
she's still involved

879
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,450
with him.

880
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,980
If His Majesty knows this,

881
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,900
it would be a serious crime
of deceiving the emperor!

882
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,660
By that time,

883
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,180
it'd ruin the Ming family's reputation,

884
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,240
and even your official career

885
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,300
would be affected.

886
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,140
Tan, is that true?

887
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,510
Um...

888
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,210
Who is that man?

889
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,260
Tell me!

890
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,420
Father, I...

891
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,280
Tell me!

892
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,900
Who is that man exactly?

893
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,340
I...

894
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,140
Tell me!

895
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,380
The man who met with Miss Ming in secret

896
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,360
was me.

897
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,480
Your Highness?

898
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,660
No need for formalities.

899
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,940
If I hadn't come,

900
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,420
my future princess
would have been wrongly accused,

901
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,080
with no way to defend herself.

902
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,270
You... You are the Prince of Dingbei?

903
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,420
I've thoroughly interrogated the bandits.

904
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,340
That was not an accident.

905
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,780
Someone bribed the bandits

906
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,720
to do it deliberately.

907
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,700
What?

908
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,580
But why would Liu do that?

909
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,890
If Tan lost her virginity,

910
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,120
it would benefit neither Chu

911
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,280
nor the Ming family!

912
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,020
The imperial decree of marriage
has been issued.

913
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,680
A union between our two families
is inevitable.

914
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,470
If Fourth Miss lost her virginity,

915
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,910
do you think there's

916
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,300
anyone more suitable than Third Miss

917
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,960
to take her place as the bride?

918
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,290
She... She is so foolish!

919
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,100
I came here in the middle of the night

920
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,500
because I didn't want you

921
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
to be deceived.

922
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
If you keep such vile people around,

923
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,400
I'm afraid your family
will face endless problems.

924
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,710
Ming Chu is not kind.

925
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
She has caused trouble repeatedly.

926
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,130
You need to come up with

927
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,260
a proper solution as soon as possible.

928
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,620
Your Highness, you're straightforward.

929
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,480
I won't beat around the bush then.

930
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,180
Ming Chu indeed made

931
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,700
an unforgivable mistake.

932
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,140
The match I originally arranged for her

933
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,740
is no longer suitable.

934
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,220
Her future husband's family

935
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,430
will have to be of lower status.

936
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,230
Preferably not in the capital.

937
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,420
So she won't

938
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,320
cause more trouble in the future.

939
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,800
Do you have anyone in mind?

940
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:20,980
Well...

941
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,760
I...

942
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,630
haven't had the chance to look for one.

943
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,380
How about the third son

944
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,340
of General Xuanwei from Lingzhou?

945
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,760
General Xuanwei?

946
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,030
I remember now.

947
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:41,660
General Xuanwei

948
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,260
is a fifth-rank military official.

949
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,260
His rank is not high,

950
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,340
and Lingzhou
is far enough from the capital.

951
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,150
Good, that's perfect!

952
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,380
Back then, I

953
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,080
had dealings with General Feng.

954
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,810
I have a good impression of him.

955
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,980
His third son

956
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,720
has much of his father's demeanor.

957
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,420
Since you're satisfied,

958
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,330
it's settled.

959
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
It's settled.

960
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,280
And Liu...
