00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,759
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,320
If all men are so nagging after marriage,

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,680
I'd rather stay single.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
You can't say that.

6
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,550
Everyone is different.

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
Xu and I are different.

8
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,940
Xu has never been a romantic guy.

9
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,400
How could you compare him to me?

10
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,009
You... I... This...

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Are you a ghost?
I didn't hear your footsteps.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
Go away.

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
Even if I were a ghost,
I'd haunt no one but you.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,039
You've got the nerve

15
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,320
to gossip about Xu,

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
yet you're afraid of a ghost?

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,840
I...

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,480
Minmin is beautiful and kind-hearted.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,320
She'd never bicker with a ghost.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,199
I'm pregnant.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Really?

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm going to be an aunt!

23
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,060
Sit down.

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,940
Sit.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
It's nothing serious. Don't make a fuss.

26
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320
So Prince of Dingbei's Mansion

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
is going to have an heir.

28
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,329
Congratulations, Xu, Tan.

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
Get up.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I didn't expect

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,079
that I'm going to be an uncle.

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,250
Uncle...

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Whose uncle are you?

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
There isn't even an official engagement.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,579
What does this have to do with you?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
The empress,

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,720
my elder sister,
personally arranged the marriage.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course it's set in stone.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,060
How come it's not official?

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,720
What does it take to make it official?

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,460
It's not official

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,790
as long as I say it's not.

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,310
I've been thinking carefully lately.

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,920
I feel I don't have to get married at all.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
I have Tan now.

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
And in the future,
I'll have nieces and nephews.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,380
Why would I need a husband?

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,720
A husband serves a very important purpose.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,600
Without a husband,
how can you have children?

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,060
You like children so much.

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,200
It's only a matter of time
for us to have children.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,100
I do like children.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
But there are lots of good men

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,920
in this world.

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
Why would it have to be you?

56
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,030
You're just daydreaming.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,280
Are you serious?

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,970
Wait, say it clearly.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,040
How am I daydreaming?

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Where are the good men?

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Where? Where?

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll go talk to them.

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,180
I don't want to waste words on you.

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Tan, I'm going to buy something

65
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,620
for my nephew.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Go away.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
Cousin, I appreciate

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
that.

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,460
Lyu'e, walk her out.

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,040
Hurry.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
In my opinion,

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,350
she might change her mind
even in three days,

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,820
let alone three years.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Go chase her.

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,910
No.

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,970
Look at how spoiled she is.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,410
Is my dignity worthless?

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,400
Did he ever have any?

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,610
I guess never.

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Is this cute?

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Everything you like is good.

83
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,760
Why don't we buy one of each?

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,250
Perfunctory and insincere.

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,760
Then what gift do you want to give

86
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,840
to your nephew?

87
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,220
Just say the word,

88
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,000
and I'll get it done perfectly.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,520
Why don't we hire a skilled carpenter

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,940
to make a small bed?

91
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,080
But everything from the design and wood

92
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,140
to the color and pattern—

93
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll personally oversee it all.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
Excellent idea.

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,620
Who else could be clever enough
to think of that?

96
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,330
A bed designed by you personally

97
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,690
will surely be unique.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
It'll be one of its kind in the capital.

99
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,630
When your little nephew sleeps in it,

100
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,340
he'll definitely
feel the love from his aunt

101
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,070
and sleep soundly and sweetly.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,300
Minmin,

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
you just mentioned persimmon desserts.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Do you want some?

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
Okay. Your future husband

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,270
will take you there now.

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't you think Xu

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,320
is too nervous?

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,370
Everyone in the mansion

110
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,770
is on edge because of him.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,990
Since childhood,

112
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,000
I've never seen

113
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,560
Xu so worried about anyone.

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,080
But haven't you noticed

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
that Tan is quite pleased with it

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,790
and enjoys it a lot?

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Really?

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,820
Yes.

119
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,920
This is... a peach blossom talisman?

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,280
Of course.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,080
It's that peach blossom talisman.

122
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,610
I heard in Lingzhou,

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
there is the 180 Pavilion.

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,650
The women there are graceful and pretty,

125
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,670
full of elegance.

126
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,560
It's a paradise

127
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,160
that every man desires.

128
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,030
Have you ever been there?

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,540
They're all lovely in their own way.

130
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,540
Then...

131
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,620
compared to the women in the capital?

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,940
In terms of elegance,

133
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,450
the women in the capital

134
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,400
are better.

135
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,910
But when it comes to charm,

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,350
the women in Lingzhou

137
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,520
are better.

138
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,910
Then why didn't you bring the woman

139
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,910
who gave you the peach blossom talisman

140
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,040
back to the capital?

141
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,670
What woman are you talking about?

142
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,230
It hurts!

143
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,150
It really hurts!

144
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,300
Minmin. Minmin.

145
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,230
What's wrong?

146
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,990
Why did you suddenly get angry?

147
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,790
Let me ask you.

148
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,990
Do you cherish it very much

149
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,750
and carry it with you every day?

150
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,550
Of course. Moreover,

151
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,310
I worship it every day,

152
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,510
worrying it might get dirty or damaged.

153
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,760
Shameless!

154
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,550
Then spend

155
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,720
the rest of your life

156
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,990
with that woman!

157
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,990
I am going to marry

158
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,790
the woman who gave me this talisman.

159
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,670
Is there a problem with that?

160
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,430
No!

161
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,350
Minmin.

162
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,470
You went to the Hanyan Temple

163
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,430
to specially pray

164
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,110
for the talisman for me.

165
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,500
Shouldn't I treasure it?

166
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,450
Me?

167
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,670
Back then, I only wanted

168
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,310
to avoid you.

169
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,440
Why would I pray for a talisman for you?

170
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,770
I...

171
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,710
I was praying for a talisman
to ward off mean people.

172
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,140
Perhaps I took the wrong one?

173
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,480
You made such a mistake?

174
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,790
Minmin, look. You took the wrong talisman.

175
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,470
Doesn't that prove

176
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,270
that we're fated to be together?

177
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,670
And

178
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,290
we're fated to grow old together.

179
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:58,710
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,060
What talisman did you say
you went to pray for

181
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,310
at the Hanyan Temple?

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,410
A talisman to ward off mean people.

183
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,820
Why did I hear you say something

184
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,130
about a talisman to ward off mean people?

185
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,670
Explain yourself.

186
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,910
What does that mean?

187
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,580
I didn't say that.

188
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,840
You thought I was mean?

189
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,000
You wanted to get rid of me?

still stand without leaders,

192
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,010
with no one to fill the vacancies.

193
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,429
Especially the position in Lingzhou.

194
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,360
Although the Su family has fallen,

195
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,429
they've left behind a mess

196
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,070
for the court to clear up.

197
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,190
Do you have anyone in mind
for recommendation?

198
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,190
No.

199
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,430
Transfer Zhang Shu, Prefect of Jianzhou,

200
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,860
to take up the post.

201
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,190
What do you think?

202
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,910
That works.

203
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,640
Jiang Xu!

204
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,650
Your Majesty.

205
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
I understand.

206
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,070
You were absent-minded
when your wife was not here.

207
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,310
But she has returned to the capital.

208
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,840
Why are you still like that?

209
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,830
You don't intend to stay in the capital

210
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,230
to accompany her, do you?

211
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,230
Yangxi Prefecture is already leaderless.

212
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,570
The Dingbei Army
can't go a single day without a commander.

213
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,590
Your Majesty, please rest assured.
With Shen Yu there,

214
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,310
the Dingbei Army will be fine.

215
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,270
Shen Yu is seasoned and capable.

216
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,030
He can handle things on his own.

217
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,190
As for Yangxi Prefecture's position,

218
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,590
I do have someone in mind.

219
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,960
It depends on you whether you approve.

220
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,390
Who?

221
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,310
Feng Xulin from Lingzhou.

222
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,750
Feng Xulin?

223
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,830
With the important matters settled,

224
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,910
can I have a few days off

225
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,280
to accompany my wife?

226
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,350
Jiang Xu.

227
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,770
Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,710
Your Majesty.

229
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,590
What's the matter?

230
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,670
Editor Shu Jingran from the Hanlin Academy
requests an audience.

231
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,510
Jingran?

232
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,550
Let him in.

233
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,910
Yes.

234
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,950
Editor

235
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,550
Shu Jingran from the Hanlin Academy,
you may come in!

236
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,950
Greetings, Your Majesty.

237
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,510
What brings you here, Editor Shu?

238
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,070
Your Majesty, are you troubled because you

239
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,430
don't have a proper man
to take over Lingzhou?

240
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,190
Lingzhou's maritime trade
is a key artery of Xian.

241
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,070
It is

242
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,040
the most crucial
to the court's reorganization.

243
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,950
I have been pondering day and night,

244
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,080
but still can't find the right person.

245
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,730
Prince of Dingbei
now prioritizes his wife.

246
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,150
He can no longer share my burdens.

247
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,310
Your Majesty, I recommend myself.

248
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,310
I'm willing to go to Lingzhou
to ease your worries.

249
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,950
Managing Lingzhou
is no short-term endeavor.

250
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,510
You may be stationed there for years.

251
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,030
I am aware of that.

252
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,650
Does Chancellor Shu know about this?

253
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,070
Your Majesty,

254
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,510
I didn't study all those years

255
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,070
merely to seek a rank

256
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,600
or waste the rest of my life.

257
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,550
I have thought this through.

258
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,880
To serve as an official,

259
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,030
to benefit the people,

260
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,290
to discipline myself,

261
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,270
and to seek no reward.

262
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,880
Your Majesty, please approve.

263
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,160
Rise, Minister Shu.

264
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,830
The court is in need of capable men.

265
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,430
If you can go,

266
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,390
it will ease my most pressing concerns.

267
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,070
But I want to know

268
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,510
what made you make this decision.

269
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,370
I'm in love with a woman,

270
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,150
but the gap between our status

271
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,310
has kept us apart.

272
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,550
For the one I love,

273
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,550
I no longer want to be trapped
by worldly chains.

274
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,080
I just want to build a future

275
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,480
with my own abilities

276
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,550
and offer it to her with my own hands.

277
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,910
Your Majesty!

278
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,310
Liu Yiding!

279
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,930
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,310
Approved.

281
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

282
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,330
His Majesty

283
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,190
looks somber today.

284
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,030
Perhaps joy has turned to sorrow.

285
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,380
[Wentao Pavilion]

286
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,910
Miss Yun.

287
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,430
Please, come in.

288
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,080
These are all your favorites.

289
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,070
And this.

290
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,030
Look.

291
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,950
This is

292
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,550
today's last roast chicken.

293
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,550
Take it back.

294
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,920
You can eat it when you're hungry tonight.

295
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,280
Second Young Master Shu,
you specially invited me here.

296
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,030
Do you have something to say?

297
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,430
Miss Yun,

298
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,790
we've been
spending time together these days.

299
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,280
I believe you must have noticed

300
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,310
my feelings for you.

301
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,510
I haven't promised you

302
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,030
a future

303
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,030
because I

304
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,490
had many concerns before.

305
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,590
I...

306
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,050
Second Young Master Shu,
no need to say more.

307
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,590
I'm not well-educated,

308
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,070
and I don't understand great philosophies,

309
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,030
but I do know

310
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,440
for a good man like you,

311
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,830
your career and marriage

312
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,190
must have been arranged properly

313
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,390
by your family.

314
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,070
I...

315
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,910
Being able to be friends with you,

316
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,930
share weal and woe,
and go through thick and thin together—

317
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,070
it's truly my honor.

318
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,190
No matter what you feel,

319
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,550
in my heart,

320
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,670
I only see you as a good friend.

321
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,910
Nothing more

322
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,030
than friendship.

323
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,550
I appreciate your kindness.

324
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,670

325
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,070

go back to Qi'an Hall first?

I'll have the kitchen
prepare them right away.

571
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,530
Tan, go back to your room and wait.

574
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,070
keep trying to send me away tonight?

575
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,590
Are you hiding someone here?

576
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,520
And you're worried I might see her?
