00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,930
(Youthful Glory)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,870
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Don't think I don't know

4
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,759
that your niece

5
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,729
has been staying at the residence for quite some time.

6
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,640
She is not only involved with your son

7
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,370
but is even carrying his child.

8
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,280
Is that right?

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,000
Well...

10
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,259
My lord, what are you saying?

11
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,880
There are countless rumors

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,410
swirling around the capital.

13
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,940
You can't possibly believe them all, can you?

14
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,930
It's true that my niece from my maternal family

15
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,670
stayed at the residence for a short while,

16
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,110
but there was never

17
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,420
anything improper.

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,440
Every family has visiting relatives.

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,460
You can't assume hidden agendas

20
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,790
just because kin come calling.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,540
All that talk about an affair or a child

22
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,810
are just baseless rumors.

23
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,840
Are they just rumors?

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,389
Yes.

25
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,340
Say it again, are they just rumors?

26
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,740
Yes.

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,670
Well,

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,500
just a few days ago,

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,430
I arranged a good match for her

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,710
back in our hometown.

31
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,420
She has

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
returned delighted,

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
saying she won't

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,900
be coming back to the capital ever again.

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,579
My lord,

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,140
Zixuan was personally chosen by Chancellor Su

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,540
as Ming Tan's husband.

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,420
How could there be any mistake?

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,660
If you're still uneasy,

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,380
I give you my word here and now:

41
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,600
Zixuan will never take a concubine

42
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,970
nor keep any mistress outside marriage.

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,650
Ming Tan alone will be his wife, all his life.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,040
Your Grace!

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,200
Outside the mansion!

46
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,300
Aunt!

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,040
(Graceful Springtime)
Aunt!

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,810
(Graceful Springtime)

49
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:45,840
Aunt!
(Graceful Springtime)

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
Aunt!

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,170
Zixuan!

52
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,329
What wrong have I done?

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,380
How could you treat me like this?

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,140
Was it not promised that

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,310
once Miss Ming entered this household,

56
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,420
Zixuan would take me as his concubine

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,380
and legitimize our child in the family registry?

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,940
(Graceful Springtime)
and legitimize our child in the family registry?

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,730
(Duke of Ling's Mansion)

60
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,320
Exiling me wasn't enough?

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,290
Why must you marry me off to some estate steward

62
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,740
as his replacement wife?

63
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,440
How cruel you are!

64
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:14,800
Sir,

65
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,740
as per your instructions,

66
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,720
Zhu'er has already started making a scene

67
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
outside the Duke of Ling's Mansion.

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,960
So you had a backup plan,

69
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,370
stoking the flames for Marquis of Jing'an's scheme?

70
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,579
The Liang family wants to use this marriage to protect themselves.

71
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,340
I certainly can't give them

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,660
a way out.

73
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,140
How should we handle

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Zhu'er and her child?

75
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,600
Your instructions.

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,980
The innocent shouldn't suffer for others' crimes.

77
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,750
Send them away,

78
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,120
and find them a proper place to live.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Hear that?

80
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,820
What else do you have to say?

81
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,370
Speak up!

82
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,300
I...

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,230
Well...

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,920
Say!

85
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,180
Well...

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,170
Your character is despicable!

87
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,300
He dares to covet my Ming family's daughter?

88
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,180
Dream on!

89
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,820
Whether willing or not,

90
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,410
-Well…
-this betrothal shall be broken.

91
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,160
(Profound Virtue and Boundless Grace)

92
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,710
My lord!
(Profound Virtue and Boundless Grace)

93
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,740
(Profound Virtue and Boundless Grace)

94
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,340
My lord!
(Profound Virtue and Boundless Grace)

95
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,880
My Lord!

96
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,130
It's over.

97
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,970
It's all over.

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,399

(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

100
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,980
I've come to talk to you.
(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

102
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,409
Years

103
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,659
have flown by,

104
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,900
and Tan has blossomed into

105
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,220
a graceful young girl.

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
Your Grace,

107
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,930
your spirit in heaven

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,150
must find solace,

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,540
though I, stationed at the frontier,

110
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,900
have failed in my duty towards Tan.

111
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,980
(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,440
My negligence in overseeing this betrothal

(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

114
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,850
nearly doomed Tant to a lifetime of misery!
(Memorial Tablet of Bai Feiyuan of the Ming Family)

115
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,900
I've failed

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
the most basic duty

117
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,500
of a father.

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Your Grace, rest assured.

119
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,140
Now that I've returned to the capital,

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
I will personally

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,870
arrange Tan's marriage

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,100
and find her a perfect husband

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
who meets every standard.

124
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,920
Though the Ming and Liang families' betrothal is broken,

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,070
this matter isn't over.

126
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,960
With control of the Yangxi Prefecture,

127
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,060
Marquis of Jing'an's power is at its zenith.

128
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,340
Once this marriage is settled,

129
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,400
certain parties won't be able to restrain themselves.

130
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
You may have ruined one engagement,

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,130
but can you sabotage every single one?

132
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,640
Or have you already arranged a better match

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
for Miss Ming?

134
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,700
Jiang Qizhi, what do you mean?

135
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,820
As for Yu's marriage,

136
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,540
the Empress surely has her own plans.

137
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,140
It's not for us to interfere.

138
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,090
Lu Ting

139
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,100
is too sentimental.

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,800
Am I some heartless scoundrel?

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,260
If you won't marry her, should I take her instead?

142
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,720
Not an unacceptable idea.

143
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,020
After Zhu'er's public scene today,

144
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,370
what reputation do I have left

145
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,270
in the capital?

146
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,120
No, no, no.

147
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,410
Tan, reputation

148
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,680
is just an illusion!

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,820
You mustn't let

150
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,250
this "purity" nonsense

151
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,730
drive you to desperation!

152
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,990
Minmin,

153
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,930
in this vast capital,

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
what respectable family

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
would now consider me as a match?

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

157
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
These are the eligible noble sons
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

158
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,080
Empress has shortlisted—

159
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,270
originally reserved for

160
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,409
the princess' consort selection.

161
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,360
This time, I must

162
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,870
arrange the Ming family's marriage

163
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,480
before the Empress Dowager intervenes.

164
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,340
The Ming family's marriage affair is complicated.

165
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,680
With the faction purge imminent,

166
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,580
you can't cancel Ming Tan's engagements

167
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,640
every time you investigate a family.

168
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,130
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

169
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,560
What about Wen Hao,
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
What about Wen Hao,

171
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,110
the second son of Duke of An?

172
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,620
Not suitable.

173
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,870
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)
Not suitable.

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,120
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

175
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,180
What about Cui Wei?
(Wen Hao, Second Son of the Duke of An(by the Primary Wife))(Lin Wusi, Heir Apparent to the Duke of Rong)(Cui Wei, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices)

176
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,320
Not quite appropriate.

177
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,460
The Vice Censor-in-Chief's third son?

178
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,260
Not fitting.

179
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,330
Your Majesty, forgive my bluntness,

180
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,800
but Miss Ming is clever and cunning,

181
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,540
skilled in social maneuvering

182
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,050
with formidable finesse.

183
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,930
These scholarly types

184
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,680
couldn't possibly keep her in check.

185
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,340
What about descendants of military officials?

186
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,420
Does the other registry have better candidates?

187
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,230
This is Her Majesty's curated list

188
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,360
of noble daughters.

189
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,090
It's for you to choose a consort.

190
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,370
The Ming family's marriage is urgent,

191
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,590
and yours is no less pressing.

192
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,870
I'm not forcing you to marry,

193
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,520
but if you delay any longer,

194
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,360
the Empress Dowager will surely

195
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,059
arrange a match between you and Fengzhao.

196
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,200
The Su family has no authority over my decisions.

197
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,100
You and Marquis of Jing'an

198
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,630
both command heavy armies.

199
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,830
Do you truly think the Su family would let such opportunities slip?

200
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
I'll marry

201
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Miss Ming.

202
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,020
What?

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,660
I'll marry her.

204
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
It is indeed a win-win solution

205
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,440
and the best choice.

206
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,390
Xu,

207
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
do you fancy Miss Ming?

208
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,730
It's not about fancying or not.

209
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,810
Then why...

210
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,190
If not me to bear this for the country, then who?

211
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I will marry

212
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,860
Miss Ming.

213
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,450
(Gardening House)

214
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,540
Chancellor.

215
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,030
(Vice Minister of Revenue, Liu Mo)

216
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,580
the confiscation of Duke of Ling's Mansion
(Vice Minister of Revenue, Liu Mo)

217
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,560
the confiscation of Duke of Ling's Mansion

218
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,440
is complete.

219
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,520
All sensitive records uncovered

220
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,970
during the investigation

221
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,520
have been thoroughly altered

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,870
and reclassified under neutral categories,

223
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,870
ensuring no further implications for other parties.

224
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,990
Liang Qiwei's entire family was exiled three thousand li.

225
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,590
The Emperor sparing his life

226
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,790
was mercy enough.

227
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,010
The hijacked military supplies case is closed,

228
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,480
but Prince of Dingbei has sworn to

229
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,650
uncover who intercepted his convoy to the capital

230
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,710
and to fully investigate years of

231
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,310
embezzled army provisions.

232
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,470
Prince of Dingbei always keeps his word.

233
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,600
He will never relent

234
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,850
until his goal is achieved.

235
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,100
That Sheriff Wu is one of Gu Jinzhong's men.

236
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,040
No matter how much he denies it,

237
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
suspicion will inevitably fall on him.

238
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,690
Find a discreet opportunity to warn him.

239
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,690
Liang Qiwei's fate should serve as

240
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,410
a stark lesson.

241
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,320
Those messy accounts of his

242
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,780
must be thoroughly cleaned up.

243
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,850
Leave no handles for others to grab.

244
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,030
Yes.

245
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,570
As for Gu Jinzhong's past embezzlement records,

246
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,980
I have long covered the gaps and smoothed them over.

247
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,640
Even Prince of Dingbei won't uncover anything.

248
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,390
Just as you predicted,

249
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,440
the families less entangled with

250
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,630
Duke of Ling's faction

251
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,390
are scrambling to cut ties.

252
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,860
These past two days,

253
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,430
the Empress Dowager even summoned Chancellor Su

254
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,030
for prolonged discussions.

255
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,450
Keep close watch on

256
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,100
what paths those families are taking.

257
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,900
Yes.

258
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,290
Is there anything unusual at Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion?

259
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,420
All appears normal.

260
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Recently,

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,400
many calling cards have been delivered there.

262
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,280
However,

263
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,430
Marquis of Jing'an seems to dislike such formalities.

264
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,290
He hasn't received any visitors.

265
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,940
However, today Chancellor Su and his wife

266
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,030
paid a visit and had a rather lively gathering with Marquis of Jing'an and his daughter.

267
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,500
The two families seemed quite cordial

268
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,540
upon meeting.

269
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,110
Regarding the matter of Marquis of Jing'an,

270
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,820
Chancellor Su will undoubtedly pursue it relentlessly.

271
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,230
His visit

272
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,310
was undoubtedly about arranging a marriage alliance.

273
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,290
This is truly unexpected.

274
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,310
Fortunately, we withdrew from the betrothal in time

275
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,150
to avoid a scandal.

276
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,950
Tan is exceptional in

277
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,120
both beauty and virtue.

278
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
In time, she'll surely find

279
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,430
a perfectly suited match.

280
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,940
Wait,

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
your previous letters sang praises!

282
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,530
You said that generations of the Liang family are scholars,

283
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,610
noble and refined;

284
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Liang Zixuan's

285
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,020
literary brilliance

286
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,970
and boundless prospects—

287
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,750
what happened to all that?

288
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,110
It was all pretense.

289
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,260
Your judgment as her godfather

290
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,900
is truly lacking.

291
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,280
I...

292
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,810
Do you even know about the Lantern Festival...

293
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,570
Father,

294
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm fine now.

295
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,710
Let's leave the past in the past.

296
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,260
Moreover,

297
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,020
during all those years you were away from the capital,

298
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,510
it was Godfather and Godmother

299
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,030
who cared for me.

300
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,000
This time, Godfather

301
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,870
was simply deceived by the Liang family.

302
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,510
He?

303
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,690
Godfather, please don't take it to heart.

304
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,250
Father just worries too much,

305
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,430
speaking a bit impulsively.

306
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,590
Do you think

307
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
I don't know how he is?

308
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,110
Would I stoop to his level?

309
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,860
You're just too considerate.

310
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,500
Had you told me earlier

311
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,800
about that ‘accidental drowning' incident,

312
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,860
I'd have skinned Liang Zixuan alive.

313
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,150
That's easy for you to say.

314
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,850
Where were you when it mattered?

315
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,350
Quite the expert at hindsight, aren't you?

316
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,190
Father!

317
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Today the kitchen

318
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,460
prepared special Yangzhou dishes.

319
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,320
Godfather, Godmother, please enjoy them while they're hot.

320
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,960
Alright.

321
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,730
I was personally made

322
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,210
this pigeon soup.

323
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,150
Okay.

324
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,700
Come on.

325
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,600
I picked up my bowl first.

326
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,720
Everyone saw it, I raised it first.

327
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,080
I was the first to raise it.

328
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,910
How could you... You...

329
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,270
She's my daughter.

330
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Tan is my daughter too.

331
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,530
How can you be so unreasonable?

332
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,580
When have you ever been reasonable?

333
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,140
Let's settle this outside!

334
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,020
Look how capable he thinks he is.

335
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,680
You're a military officer, I'm a civil official.

336
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,630
I won't fall for your tricks.

337
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,350
You just don't dare.

338
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,850
Tan is thoughtful enough

339
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,950
to know I've been suffering from palpitations.

340
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,810
Pigeon soup is just what I needed.

341
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,430
Be careful, it's hot.

342
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,440
Good girl.

343
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,330
Tan,

344
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,610
in a few days, your godfather will go to the palace

345
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,410
to ask the Empress Dowager to help

346
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,360
find some good matches among the noble families.

347
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,900
I'll accompany you to meet them properly.

348
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,570
Thank you for your care, Godfather, Godmother.

349
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,290
But

350
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
I've decided to retreat to Hanyan Temple

351
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
for 49 days of prayer—

352
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,390
to calm my mind and reflect.

353
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,740
-Good.
-Good.

354
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,130
You speak.

355
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,660
Tan, even though

356
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,190
your engagement was called off,

357
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,340
staying in the capital

358
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,100
will only invite gossip for Tanting.

359
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,760
You're leaving to avoid the gossip—seeking some peace and quiet.

360
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,130
Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion has prepared five carriages

361
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,250
to take Miss Ming

362
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,540
to Hanyan Temple to pray.

363
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,380
Five?

364
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200
I have checked.

365
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,560
Every carriage is filled with

366
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,210
her clothes, shoes,

367
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,270
jewelry, hairpins,

368
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,840
bed curtains, incense burners,

369
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,680
and full tea sets.

370
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,790
She plans to settle in at Hanyan Temple—

371
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,060
a dramatic display of chaste defiance?

372
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,390
My Lady,

373
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,410
His Lordship said he'd see you off tomorrow morning.

374
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,610
Why are you leaving tonight?

375
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,680
If you leave tomorrow,

376
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,920
that one at Yiyun House

377
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
will surely seize the chance to mock and humiliate me.

378
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,320
Rather than suffer that,

379
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,260
I'd rather leave now.

380
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,710
That makes sense.

381
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,980
(Hanyan Temple)

382
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
(Monk Zhiyu of Hanyan Temple)

383
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
I, Zhiyu,
(Monk Zhiyu of Hanyan Temple)

384
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,890
greet the benefactors.

385
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
For monastic devotion,

386
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,810
only essential belongings are needed.

387
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
These are my essentials.

388
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,140
Honored benefactors,

389
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,780
during your retreat,

390
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,770
you may seek me

391
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,510
for any needs.

392
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,430
What is this?

393
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,280
All short-term guests

394
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,829
must wear these garments.

395
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,560
Don't worry.

396
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,619
They're freshly laundered.

397
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,770
You must be tired from the journey.

398
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,250
Do rest.

399
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,190
I won't disturb you further.

400
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,780
This isn't about cleanliness at all.

401
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,790
Look,

402
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,530
broad shoulders, long sleeves,

403
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,930
no shape at the waist,

404
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,970
and the color, the fabric..

405
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,910
Even the third-rank maids in our household

406
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,920
dress better than this.

407
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
How is my lady supposed to wear this?

408
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,010
If it weren't for that Zhu'er,

409
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,140
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

410
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,970
Enough, enough.

411
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,850
Everyone knows that life in the monastery is austere.

412
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,200
Besides, it was my own choice

413
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,680
to come here.

414
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,170
Who else is there to blame?

415
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,800
If anything, blame

416
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,190
my own poor luck,

417
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,670
always running into Jiang Xu.

418
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,310
Come to think of it,

419
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,200
every time things go wrong lately,

420
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,620
it somehow involves him.

421
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,220
Last time we ran into danger at Hanyan Temple,

422
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,830
it was because of him.

423
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,600
And those times we were so close to

424
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,410
getting the evidence,

425
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,730
he ruined that too.

426
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,220
My Lady,

427
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,090
could it be you've offended a petty villain?

428
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,490
That makes sense.

429
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,500
We'll dine here.

430
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,390
We'll keep watch outside.

431
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,460
Once you're done, we'll come back in.

432
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,760
The dining hall makes no distinction—

433
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,280
all eat together.

434
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
Rules are rules.

435
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,650
You eat first.

436
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,220
Lyu'e and I aren't hungry yet.

437
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,170
Have a seat.

438
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,160
Thank you.

439
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,890
It's said that the vegetarian meals at Hanyan Temple

440
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,250
are exceptionally delicious.

441
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,260
That's why I chose this retreat.

442
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,150
Try it!

443
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,430
How is it?

444
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,600
My Lady,

445
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,600
I think those rumors are misguided.

446
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,540
This bears

447
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,700
little resemblance

448
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,230
to exquisite.

449
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,210
My Lady, there are plenty of local farms nearby

450
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,560
with fresh fish and vegetables.

451
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,240
Shall I

452
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,890
prepare something else for you instead?

453
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,550
No, how can it be called a proper retreat

454
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,140
if we indulge in special meals?

455
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,210
Though this temple meal

456
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,790
may not compare to our home chefs,

457
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,630
the presentation is quite lovely.

458
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,900
The greens glisten with oil,

459
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,030
and the rice has a delicate fragrance.

460
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,730
The Buddhist path

461
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,740
is profound in its wisdom.

462
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,020
Perhaps this simple, unadorned meal

463
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,360
is meant to remind us of hardship and gratitude—

464
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,820
to never forget our roots.

465
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Since we're here, we might as well embrace it.

466
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Let's treat this as part of our enlightenment.

467
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,470
But if it's truly unpalatable,

468
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,490
don't force yourself.

469
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,560
Amitabha.

470
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Benefactor,

471
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,850
you must not waste any food during the meal.

472
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,520
Miss Ming is...

473
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,570
You two have disrupted the temple's peace

474
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,890
with your chatter.

475
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,060
As a small lesson,

476
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,640
please stay and clean the dining hall.

477
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,920
Young monk,

478
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
I have a small appetite.

479
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,270
May I skip this meal?

480
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,250
Then

481
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,340
you may reflect in the side chapel.

482
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,200
Punished for eating.

483
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,720
Where did I go wrong?

484
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,060
With so many chapels,

485
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,240
which one did

486
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,700
the young monk refer to?

487
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,230
But reflection is about sincerity.

488
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,250
Surely any of them would suffice?

489
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,880
I didn't expect you to remember this place.

490
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,240
This was where Your Majesty and I

491
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,690
used to steal moments of leisure in our youth.

492
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,350
I certainly wouldn't forget.

493
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,520
After enduring twenty lashes from the military baton,

494
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,580
you at least pretended for a few days.

495
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,400
How come you so swiftly and decisively

496
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
dealt with Liang Qiwei?

497
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,560
I am not skilled at acting.

498
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,430
Liang Qiwei was merely the beginning.

499
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,430
With your aid,

500
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,520
I'll purge corruption

501
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,760
and restore order to the court.

502
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,710
This time I returned to the capital

503
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,440
only to reclaim the army's pay.

504
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,090
I have no intention of

505
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,570
getting involved in court affairs.

506
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,570
But now that you've stepped onto the board,

507
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,740
you must see the game through

508
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,580
with me.

509
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,600
How can you throw down your pieces

510
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,000
just as the match begins?

511
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,840
I have sat the throne for nearly ten years,

512
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,280
yet the Su family's influence

513
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,340
still pervades both court and harem.

514
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,240
Their ambition is boundless,

515
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
their greed insatiable.

516
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
It is nothing more than a disunited rabble

517
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,180
with a hollow facade of strength.

518
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,850
The only one who has ever truly held sway over Your Majesty

519
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,570
is Chancellor Su.

520
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
What I want is simple:

521
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,740
a court that is clean,

522
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,220
with power in balance.

523
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,930
This case of embezzled military funds runs deep, involving many.

524
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,530
If we can uproot it entirely,

525
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,070
your will shall be fulfilled.

526
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,700
However,

527
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,760
if we pursue this matter the way I intend,

528
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,170
I fear that your imperial desk

529
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,500
will soon be buried beneath

530
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,960
memorials impeaching me.

531
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,760
Today, I grant you

532
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,630
the power to act first and report later.

533
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,420
No matter how great the trouble you stir up

534
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,080
in the future,

535
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,860
I shall bear it for you.

536
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,460
In observing this situation,

537
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
I have come to understand one truth:

538
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,810
the way of the sovereign is to remain uninvolved;

539
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,210
the way of the minister is to take action.

540
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,910
The one who truly knows me

541
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,490
is you, Xu.

542
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,630
Buddha above,

543
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,530
I, Tan of the Ming family, offer this prayer.

544
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm accustomed to fine fare

545
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,780
and modest portions in daily life.

546
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,320
Today, upon partaking in the temple's vegetarian meal,

547
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,920
I found myself unaccustomed

548
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,360
and, regrettably, left food uneaten.

549
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,720
May the Buddha forgive this waste

550
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,880
and spare me from karmic retribution.

551
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,260
Buddha above,

552
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,310
beyond this repentance,

553
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,200
I have another sincere prayer:

554
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
This broken engagement

555
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,920
was due to my betrothed's unworthy character,

556
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
making him unfit as a spouse.

557
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,200
Now that this matter is settled and I return to the capital,

558
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
I pray the Buddha grants me

559
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,830
a suitable husband—

560
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,770
one of equal family standing,

561
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,530
with no need for royal or noble lineage

562
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,810
princely houses, or scholarly elites.

563
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,300
What I truly value is talent and comeliness.

564
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,590
In terms of talent,

565
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,690
one who can rank among the top scholars in the imperial examinations would suffice.

566
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,040
As for appearance, he must be undeniably handsome—

567
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,200
only then would he be a worthy match for me.

568
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Of course,

569
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,990
ample wealth would be ideal,

570
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,660
ensuring our married life

571
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,340
is comfortable and carefree.

572
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,050
But even without the fortune of a marquis' household,

573
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,430
he must at least provide me

574
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,590
with bird's nest porridge whenever I desire,

575
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,190
afford seasonal wardrobes

576
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,080
from Brocade Splendor Workshop,

577
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,040
and ensure I can acquire the latest jewelry

578
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,650
as soon as it appears.

579
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,460
I also pray that my future mother-in-law

580
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,310
be kind and amiable—

581
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,370
one who does not burden me with endless rules

582
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,640
and nitpicking.

583
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,850
As for family ties, the simpler the better.

584
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,120
Above all, there must be no childhood sweethearts

585
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
or overly intimate cousin-sisters lingering about.

586
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,880
In stature, may he stand over

587
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,030
seven feet tall,

588
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,280
robust and vigorous.

589
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
If he practices martial arts,

590
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
may it be the sword—

591
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,650
his movements graceful and refined—

592
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,730
so that

593
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,200
when he wields his blade,

594
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,310
I may accompany him with the zither, creating a scene of perfect harmony.

595
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,640
These are my humble requests.

596
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,370
May the Buddha grant my wishes.

597
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,400
This humble devotee

598
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420
is the first-born daughter of the Marquis of Jing'an.

599
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,580
I fear my lengthy prattle

600
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,640
may have wearied your divine ears.

601
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,060
Perhaps I failed to make my wishes clear.

602
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,080
Tomorrow, I shall return

603
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,020
and transcribe these marital criteria

604
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,180
on paper,

605
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,970
burning it as an offering before your altar.

606
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,090
Should you grant me

607
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,100
such an ideal husband,

608
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,510
I vow to gild your sacred statue anew

609
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,130
and keep your incense burning for ages untold.

610
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,820
This girl

611
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,850
is truly beyond cure.

612
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,700
Her standards for a spouse

613
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,100
are absurdly high.

614
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,400
Where in this vast world

615
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,320
could one find

616
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,050
such a flawlessly perfect man?

617
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,230
As predicted,

618
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,160
this girl

619
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,950
would indeed

620
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,020
overpower the sons of scholarly officials.

621
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,950
Fortunately, you've taken her in.

622
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,170
That was not what I meant.

623
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,770
My thoughts align precisely

624
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,910
with Your Majesty's

625
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,310
I shall seek your counsel another day.

626
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,930
Why have you stopped playing?

627
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,110
The winner has yet to be decided.

628
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,550
Though Sheriff Wu was silenced

629
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,950
before he could confess,

630
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,920
his ties to the Marquis of Cheng'en

631
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,160
are indisputable.

632
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,420
As you previously ordered surveillance on the Gu family,

633
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,990
we've uncovered something suspicious.

634
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,770
Gu Jinzhong's son, Gu Wenyan,

635
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,950
is most certainly involved.

636
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,480
Does Gu Jinzhong

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,360
have only this one son?

638
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,790
Yes.

639
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,750
The young man is notoriously extravagant

640
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,680
and idle,

641
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,610
utterly lacking in scholarly merit.

642
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,220
Yet somehow, he not only entered the Imperial Examinations,

643
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,100
but secured

644
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,260
fourth place in the second-tier rankings.

645
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,140
Recently, he's been flaunting his success everywhere,

646
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,360
drawing flocks of sycophantic scholars

647
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
eager to curry favor.

648
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,080
Send Shen Yu to deal with this young man.

649
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
He

650
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,450
is escorting Zhu'er and her child back to their hometown under orders.

651
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,690
A message this morning stated

652
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,180
he won't return to the city until late tonight.

653
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,000
Zhu'er's hometown isn't far from the capital.

654
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,080
A lone rider could make the round trip

655
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,120
in two days at most.

656
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
Why would he only return tonight?

657
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,740
I don't know.

658
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,640
Tan!

659
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,810
Shen Yu?

660
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,670
What brings you here?

661
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:06,590
I was passing through the teahouse

662
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,620
(Vice General of the Dingbei Army, Shen Yu)
I was passing through the teahouse

663
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:07,650
(Vice General of the Dingbei Army, Shen Yu)

664
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,120
on my way back to the capital
(Vice General of the Dingbei Army, Shen Yu)

665
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,000
when I heard
(Vice General of the Dingbei Army, Shen Yu)

666
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,720
you'd broken off the engagement with the Liang family

667
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,360
and come to Hanyan Temple to avoid gossip.

668
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,690
So I came straight away.

669
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,130
You went out of your way to find me;

670
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,660
is there something urgent?

671
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,510
I came to tell you that

672
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,520
I've admired you for a long time.

673
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,040
Before,

674
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
you were betrothed to the Liang family,

675
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,420
and our statuses differed.

676
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,750
But now that you're free,

677
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,070
and finding another match may take time.

678
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,260
Why not marry me instead?

679
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,470
After the great victory in Dongzhou,

680
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,600
His Highness has petitioned

681
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,720
for my promotion to Fourth-Rank Valiant General.

682
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
Though there's still a gap

683
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,340
between my status and yours as the primary daughter of a marquis' household,

684
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,290
I swear to earn more military merits in the future—

685
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,820
enough to secure a noble title for you as well.

686
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,190
Young General Shen

687
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,580
is renowned for his battlefield prowess

688
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
and integrity—

689
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
a perfect match for the Miss Ming...

690
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,990
Shen Yu, do you even realize what you're saying

691
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,250
and what you're doing?

692
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,400
I...

693
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,020
I‘m proposing marriage to you.

694
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,570
You're not here to propose,

695
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,600
but you're here

696
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,640
to ruin me.

697
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
A proper proposal requires parental approval

698
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
and a matchmaker's words.

699
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,560
These rules you should know.

700
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,510
If I were to accept

701
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,630
your words and gifts today,

702
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,750
at best,

703
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,920
it might be called a mutual affection, a meeting of hearts.

704
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,010
At worst?

705
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,580
An illicit exchange,

706
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,050
a shameless scandal.

707
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,480
Tan, I...

708
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,720
Since you know I came to the temple

709
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
to avoid gossip,

710
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,350
you'd know

711
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,480
my every word and step

712
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,020
must be measured as if treading on thin ice.

713
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,150
Had you even an ounce of respect for me,

714
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,810
you would never have recklessly

715
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,340
bared your heart like this.

716
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,470
Foolish man.

717
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,960
I was reckless.

718
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,010
-But I…
-Since you know it's reckless,

719
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,430
please leave immediately.

720
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,890
Today, we never met

721
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,640
and no proposal

722
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,750
was ever spoken.

723
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,440
Shen Yu, I have no feeling for you.

724
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I will never marry you.

725
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,720
Abandon this delusion.

726
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,410
My Lady!

727
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,450
My Lady, why are you here?

728
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,640
We searched the prayer hall three times,

729
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,280
but couldn't find you.

730
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,700
You gave us such a fright!

731
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Young Master?

732
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,820
Let's return to my quarters to transcribe sutras.

733
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,420
Tell him to return to camp and come see me immediately.

734
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,180
Yes!

735
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,560
(Lilies of the River and Fragrant Angelicas of the Marsh)

736
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,880
Chuchu,

737
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,490
where are you going?

738
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm going to practice my whip.

739
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Might even challenge Father

740
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
to a spar later.

741
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
How can a young lady

742
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,910
spend her days swinging swords and whips?

743
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,150
How do you expect to secure a marriage match like this?

744
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,280
You may not have the delicate grace

745
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,000
of those noble maidens,

746
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,560
but my daughter has her own brilliance—

747
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,780
a face like blooming peonies and a spirit fiercer than spring wind.

748
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,020
You're one of a kind in the capital!

749
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,220
I've told your father

750
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,410
to start vetting

751
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,710
worthy suitors.

752
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,590
But you must learn some decorum.

753
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,720
Start acting like a proper young lady.

754
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,120
With Ming Tan's broken engagement

755
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,450
causing such a scandal,

756
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,450
who would dare

757
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,550
arrange a marriage with our household now?

758
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:14,960
You...

759
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,760
My Lady.

760
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,230
Seriously?

761
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,880
Where are you going now?

762
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
I haven't finished talking yet.

763
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,100
Shen Yu!

764
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,320
When we were children, Ming Tan and I

765
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,580
often played with you.

766
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,990
Have you forgotten?

767
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,360
Oh, it's Cousin Ming Chu.

768
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,840
Why are you still as stiff as the day

769
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,160
you first arrived at

770
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,100
our estate?

771
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,500
I'm not some vengeful spirit.

772
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,100
What are you recoiling from?

773
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,870
You're here to see Ming Tan, aren't you?

774
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,740
It's a pity though.

775
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,890
She's just retreated to the temple

776
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,480
after breaking off her engagement.

777
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,230
I came to pay respects to His Lordship.

778
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,100
He took me in years ago

779
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,240
and recommended me to the Dingbei Army.

780
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,780
Now that he's returned to the capital,

781
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,440
it's only proper that I visit.

782
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,890
Why the pretense?

783
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,140
Even when we played together as children,

784
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
I knew

785
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,950
you adored Ming Tan.

786
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,910
Now that she's free of her betrothal,

787
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,770
isn't this your

788
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,330
perfect chance to confess?

789
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,130
Mind your words.

790
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,170
It's just affection.

791
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
It's

792
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,530
no disgrace.

793
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
With your military merits

794
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,590
at such a young age

795
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,810
and the favor of the Prince of Dingbei,

796
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,310
you'd actually make a fine match for Tan.

797
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,970
She has no

798
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,660
such inclination toward me.

799
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,470
When a maiden says "I don't like it" or "I'm unwilling,"

800
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,310
it's often mere coyness.

801
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,580
Besides,

802
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,850
true affection

803
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,950
takes time to grow.

804
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,720
How could there be mutual love

805
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
at first sight?

806
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,320
If you're truly serious about

807
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,800
marrying Tan,

808
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,570
why not speak to the Prince of Dingbei?

809
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,370
He cares deeply for his subordinates.

810
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,730
He would surely petition the Emperor for an imperial marriage decree on your behalf.

811
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,140
Shen Yu, think carefully,

812
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,060
don't wait until the pearl falls into another's hands

813
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,630
to regret your inaction.

814
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,290
Your Highness,

815
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,600
I have properly settled

816
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Zhu'er and her child.

817
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,030
All the silver Liang Qiwei hid through her father

818
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,090
has been recovered and brought back.

819
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,550
Liang Qiwei has reaped what he sowed

820
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,840
for his corruption and abuse of power.

821
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,160
Tan nearly

822
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,900
married into the Liang family.

823
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,590
Thanks to Your Highness' decisive actions,

824
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,250
she was spared this calamity.

825
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,620
I delayed the return

826
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
while inventorying the confiscated assets.

827
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,250
It was my failure to complete the task efficiently.

828
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,310
I request Your Highness to punish me.

829
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,239
Go sweep the training grounds clean.

830
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,860
Then shovel all the manure

831
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,750
from the stables.

832
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,389
Yes!

833
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,480
Come back.

834
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,500
The Marquis of Cheng'en has a son

835
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
named Gu Wenyan.

836
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,870
Send someone to keep a close eye on him.

837
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,840
Yes!

838
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
Then,

839
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,639
the horse manure...

840
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,380
Go after you've finished cleaning it.

841
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,960
Yes!

842
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,929
Your Highness,

843
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,570
if one day

844
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,090
I have someone I love,

845
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,770
would Your Highness

846
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,659
request a marriage decree for me?

847
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,710
As long as it's not the fourth young lady of the Ming family,

848
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,840
for any other woman,

849
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,010
I can try my best for you.

850
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,910
Why?

851
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,290
I don't need subordinates

852
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,280
who are constantly preoccupied with personal affairs.

853
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,630
I have never...

854
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,210
You lied to me

855
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,020
just because you wanted to see her.

856
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,040
Given time,

857
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
how do I know you won't

858
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,040
draw your sword against me because of her?

859
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,600
I...

860
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,040
Go!

861
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,610
Starting from today, clean horse manure

862
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,640
for a month.

863
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,530
Yes, Your Highness.

864
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,200
I pay my respects to the Empress Dowager.

865
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,400
(All blessings arrive in full measure)
I pay my respects to the Empress Dowager.

866
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,250
(All blessings arrive in full measure)

867
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,780
Elder Brother, you come to the palace at dawn.
(All blessings arrive in full measure)

868
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,160
(All blessings arrive in full measure)

869
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Could it be for
(All blessings arrive in full measure)

870
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,810
that Miss Ming's marriage matter?
(All blessings arrive in full measure)

871
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,570
In recent years,

872
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,370
the Su family's businesses

873
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,520
and connections across the realm

874
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,480
have been quietly

875
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,860
eroded.

876
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,420
We lack reliable allies in the military,

877
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:02,810
(Empress Dowager, Su Xvjin)

878
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,040
and without intervention,
(Empress Dowager, Su Xvjin)

879
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,080
our influence at court will wane further.
(Empress Dowager, Su Xvjin)

880
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,920
our influence at court will wane further.

881
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,980
When I adopted Ming Tan as my goddaughter years ago,

882
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,380
it was all planned for this day.

883
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,790
Since your last visit,

884
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,820
I've been carefully considering candidates.

885
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,530
A single nod from you,

886
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,650
and I'll draft the imperial marriage decree at once.

887
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,280
As for the Prince of Dingbei,

888
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,740
long before his departure for the northern territories,

889
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,660
I had considered betrothing Nianci to him.

890
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,030
Now is the time.

891
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,490
It would be great if the Princess could marry him,

892
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,530
but given her temperament..

893
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,520
The bigger picture is more important.

894
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,980
She doesn't have a choice.

895
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,500
Yes, with the Empress Dowager's decree for marriage,

896
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,010
even if the Prince of Dingbei is unwilling,

897
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,100
he wouldn't dare to defy the imperial order.

898
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,120
But the imperial decree must be issued swiftly,

899
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,040
before the Emperor intervenes.

900
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,400
Especially regarding the Ming family's marriage affairs.

901
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,150
As for the Liang family, not a single member was spared.

902
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,360
They were sent into exile days ago.

903
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
We've finally

904
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,760
settled that score.

905
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,390
I've also heard that

906
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,640
this time it was the Prince of Dingbei

907
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,940
who personally uncovered the embezzled funds,

908
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,540
which led to the Liang family's downfall.

909
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,740
In my opinion,

910
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,080
he doesn't seem as worthless

911
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
as you claimed—

912
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,940
at least he's both brave and resourceful.

913
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
Tan, you've been craving

914
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,520
these pastries for days.

915
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
How can you not eat them now?

916
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,160
I think you're right.

917
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,050
Godfather and Father

918
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,640
will certainly arrange another marriage for me.

919
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,000
With Liang Zixuan gone,

920
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,700
there'll be someone else.

921
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,640
A woman must marry.

922
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,800
Sooner or later you'll have to choose someone.

923
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,560
Unless

924
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,940
I can select a husband

925
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,440
before they intervene.

926
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,470
Have you taken a liking to some young master?

927
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,560
We daughters of inner chambers,

928
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,400
without parental permission,

929
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,050
when would we ever have the chance to meet eligible men,

930
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,050
let alone carefully evaluate them?

931
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,260
If opportunity won't come to us,

932
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,450
we'll go find it ourselves.

933
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,210
Second Young Master Shu placed third in the imperial exams.

934
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,430
Tomorrow he'll parade through the streets on horseback.

935
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,540
I've already scouted locations.

936
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,560
The Wentao Pavilion is the prime vantage point,

937
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,340
though we'll need to arrive at dawn to secure seats.

938
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,860
Tan,

939
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,930
would you care to

940
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,780
join me tomorrow

941
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,410
to see Second Young Master Shu's grand procession?

942
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,920
Second Young Master Shu?

943
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,390
Even you've taken an interest in him?

944
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,480
Don't misunderstand.

945
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
My appreciation for him

946
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,210
is purely academic.

947
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,840
My enthusiasm

948
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
is entirely for your sake.

949
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,140
The top three scholars

950
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,600
will all parade tomorrow.

951
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,650
Who knows, your future husband

952
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,830
might be among them.

953
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm not going.

954
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,830
Truly?

955
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,570
Such public display

956
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,340
would be beneath my standing.

957
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,550
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

958
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,520
Become a nun?
(Marquis of Jing'an's Mansion)

959
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,420
You...

960
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,050
How could you wish such misfortune upon Tan!

961
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,390
You...

962
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,510
Brother-in-law,

963
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,990
I was merely speculating.

964
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,780
Why such an intense reaction?

965
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,520
Think about it, the broken engagement

966
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,680
was hardly honorable,

967
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,120
and Tan has been immersed in Buddhist practice for days now.

968
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,380
Aren't you concerned she might take drastic measures?

969
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,930
Well, well...

970
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,760
She wouldn't go so far as to become a nun, would she?

971
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,580
The capital is full of noble young men.

972
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,240
We'll simply find another.

973
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,380
With Tan's beauty and talents,

974
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,730
how could she possibly remain unmarried?

975
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,080
Wait a minute.

976
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,480
Weren't you two supposed to be accompanying

977
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,620
Tan in Buddhist devotions at Hanyan Temple?

978
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,460
Where is Tan?

979
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,770
My lord,

980
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,480
Fourth Miss and Miss Minmin went to see...

981
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,900
Fourth Miss and Miss Minmin,

982
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,930
having not seen each other for days,

983
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,740
arranged to meet at Wentao Pavilion for sisterly conversation.

984
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,140
Sisterly conversation.

985
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,990
(Wentao Pavilion)

986
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,670
You arrived somewhat late.
(Wentao Pavilion)

987
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,590
This is the only remaining private booth

988
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,990
overlooking the street.

989
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
No matter. This spot will do nicely.

990
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,320
Tan, please sit down.

991
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,430
See? I told you

992
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,580
Tan wouldn't

993
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,400
become a nun

994
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,930
over such trivial matters.

995
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,590
Come on now!

996
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,370
Brother-in-law, come here.

997
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,970
What is it?

998
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,290
Then let me ask you,

999
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,830
is Tan's marriage arrangement

1000
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,680
something

1001
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
you alone can decide?

1002
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,860
How could I not understand your concerns?

1003
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,420
Do you know that recently

1004
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,360
the Empress Dowager and His Majesty have frequently summoned me to the palace?

1005
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
It seems like casual conversation,

1006
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,270
but in reality, they intend to arrange a marriage.

1007
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,280
The Empress Dowager even dangled titles like Princess Consort

1008
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,550
and Imperial Prince's Primary Wife

1009
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,750
for me to choose from!

1010
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,910
Laughably, these two

1011
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,090
are inferior to Liang Zixuan in both looks and talent.

1012
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,730
Let alone Tan,

1013
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,360
even I don't approve of them.

1014
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,870
The Empress Dowager's will

1015
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,930
is ultimately Chancellor Su's will.

1016
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,440
Her matchmaking

1017
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,930
serves only to co-opt you for Chancellor Su.

1018
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,390
With the Liang family fallen,

1019
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,390
they've simply produced new pawns.

1020
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,000
After all, she's not his biological daughter.

1021
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,640
No matter how much he considers Tan's interests,

1022
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
isn't it still putting his own interests first?

1023
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,220
My Yangxi Prefecture defends Xian

1024
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,790
and answers only to His Majesty.

1025
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,760
Shall the Marquis of Jing'an

1026
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,160
pledge allegiance to in-laws

1027
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,860
through a mere marriage?

1028
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,390
Brother-in-law, you're making it sound too easy.

1029
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,170
You may think that way,

1030
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,440
but others certainly don't—

1031
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,800
least of all His Majesty.

1032
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,180
I don't care what others think.

1033
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,050
I walk the path of righteousness

1034
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,450
with a clear conscience!

1035
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,270
An imperial decree it may be,

1036
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,410
but if Tan is unwilling,

1037
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,830
be it the Empress Dowager or His Majesty himself,

1038
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,590
I won't consent!

1039
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,420
That's right.

1040
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,230
My lord, the palace sent word.

1041
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,280
His Majesty summons you

1042
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
with utmost urgency.

1043
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,180
Please enjoy your meal at leisure.

1044
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:42,730
Thank you.

1045
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,490
Thank you.

1046
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,320
Tan,

1047
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,930
How does my makeup look today?

1048
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,510
Rouged lips with powdered jade, brows like distant mountains—

1049
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,560
perfect.

1050
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,370
That's good then.

1051
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,360
He's coming, he's coming!

1052
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Tan,

1053
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,160
look!

1054
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,030
That's Second Young Master Shu.

1055
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,590
Young Master Shu!

1056
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,570
Young Master Shu!

1057
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,220
Look at his bearing, his noble demeanor...

1058
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,210
Graceful as jade carved and polished—

1059
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,640
a gentleman refined.

1060
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,830
That's the verse!

1061
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,610
Second Young Master Shu's talent and looks are truly top-tier.

1062
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,480
He indeed embodies those words.

1063
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,080
Young Master Shu!

1064
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,270
Only a man

1065
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,270
like Second Young Master Shu

1066
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,870
could catch your eyes.

1067
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,570
When he glanced this way

1068
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,600
just now,

1069
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,050
that spring-breeze smile

1070
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,470
must have been for you.

1071
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,380
Now that he's ranked third in the exams,

1072
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,790
suitors

1073
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,610
will swarm his doorstep.

1074
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,960
Since you and he share mutual affection,

1075
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,120
why not

1076
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,740
request the Empress Dowager's decree at once?

1077
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,940
My marriage affair

1078
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,790
is not yours to comment upon!

1079
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,990
Let's not talk about this.

1080
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,560
Don't you know the Empress Dowager intends to

1081
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,260
betroth the Princess of Fengzhao to the Prince of Dingbei?

1082
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,250
Why bring this up now?

1083
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,270
Prince of Dingbei?

1084
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,600
They say capital ladies

1085
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,390
prize composure,

1086
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,120
yet

1087
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,400
before Second Young Master Shu,

1088
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,120
they've all forgotten

1089
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,520
what restraint means.

1090
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
You always accuse me of being improper,

1091
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,900
yet I'm far more restrained than these ladies.

1092
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,300
I wonder

1093
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,890
what kind of wife

1094
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,860
such a radiant gentleman

1095
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,960
will eventually wed.

1096
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,240
Our Second Master Shu

1097
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,850
will certainly be most particular about

1098
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,330
family status, appearance, and character,

1099
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,440
especially

1100
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,720
seeking one who is cultivated,

1101
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,190
well-read, and knows her place.

1102
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,620
It's you again!
