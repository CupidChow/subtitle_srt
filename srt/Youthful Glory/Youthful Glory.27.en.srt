But I think

392
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,540
the present moment is the best.

393
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,750
What about you?

I haven't given it much thought.

everything in my life

399
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,700
seems to have been

400
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,940
well arranged.

401
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:47,040
[Grace]

402
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,240
I received education,

403
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,510
took exams and became an official.

404
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,140

406
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,000
All I have to do is
follow the steps and meet up

others' expectations.

408
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,230
This trip to Lingzhou

409
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,030
has given me much to ponder.

410
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,660
Life is unpredictable.

411
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Nobody knows

412
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,160

413
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,220
Miss Yun, you're right.

414
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,980
We should cherish the present moment

415
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
rather than dream about the future.

416
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
This very moment

417
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,940

these holidays always went by quietly.

431
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,860
Nonetheless, Ms. Zhang

432
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,980

I'd like to make these festivals

436
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,140
more enjoyable and pleasant for you.

437
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,410
Even I miss

438
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,160
my parents so much,

439
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,860
let alone you...

440
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,220
You must often think about

441
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,620
your parents too, right?

442
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,380
This is a festival for family reunions.

443
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,580
I can only imagine how sorrowful

444
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,460
and lonely you used to feel

445
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,740
at these times.

446
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,020
Although your parents

447
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,950
and my mother already passed away,

448
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm sure they would wish us

449
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
to live our lives well.

450
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,260
If we can be more cheerful

451
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,260
when we think about them,

452
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,620
they would rest in peace.

453
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
I hope

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,340

Come back soon.

Sleep well.

513
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,460
Your Majesty,

514
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,540
after being interrogated
by the Court of Review,

515
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,420
over half of the officials

516
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,260
on the name list have confessed.

517
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,460
The funds they embezzled and the bribes

518
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,820
are all related to
the Su family in Lingzhou.

519
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,280
Their confessions reveal

520
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,720
that the one responsible for the case

521
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,020
is the Vice Minister of Revenue,

522
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,970
Liu Mo.

523
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,010
Oh, Liu Mo.

524
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,140
Will you plead guilty?

525
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,730
I'm guilty

526
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,900
as charged.

527
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,390
The Vice Minister of Revenue Liu Mo

528
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,540
colluded with the Su family in Lingzhou

529
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,580
to deceive the sovereignty,

530
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,420
manipulate officials,

531
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,940
disrupt social order

532
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,180
and cause severe harm to the country.

533
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,940
Strip him of his uniform now.

534
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,390
His property will be confiscated.

535
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,230
Imprison him till the trial day comes.

536
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,720
As Your Majesty

537
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,930
commands.

538
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,740
Your Majesty,

539
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,200
before Prince of Dingbei left the capital,

540
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,280
he asked me to find

541
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,120
out about Liu Mo's origins.

542
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,700
After an extensive investigation,

543
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,860
I've confirmed that Liu Mo

544
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,590
is from Cen Village,
Fang County, Qingzhou City.

545
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,740
People surnamed Liu are omitted from

546
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,260
the local household registration records.

547
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,460
Therefore, in Jia Archive,

548
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,660
there is zero record about his origins.

549
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,910
What's his background?

550
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,950
Your Majesty, do you remember?

551
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,140
Years ago, Prince of Mincong
and Dingbei Army died

552
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,900
on the battlefield at the northern borders

553
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,760
before reinforcements arrived.

554
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,980
How is Liu Mo related to that?

555
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,380
The then Emperor ordered to

556
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,260
extend support to Dingbei Army.

557
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,900
However, the scout didn't
deliver the message in time.

558
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,540
That's why the prince and Dingbei Army

559
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
were outnumbered

560
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,870
and killed by the enemy.

561
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Before

562
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,460
the truth of this case was revealed,

563
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,660
the scout committed

564
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,740
suicide in prison
out of fear of punishment.

565
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,700
Liu Mo is the son

566
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,860
of that scout.

567
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,980
After the scout's death,

568
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,050
his wife, Ms. Liu, passed away soon.

569
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,770
Their son left Cen Village

570
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,200
and fled to the capital.

571
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,700
Upon his arrival,

572
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,300
he took his mother's surname

573
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,940
and faked his household information

574
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,670
before taking imperial exams.

575
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,840
Since this matter

576
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,080
involves Prince of Mincong's death,

577
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,800
I planned

578
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,660
to probe deeper after discussing

579
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,990
with Prince of Dingbei.

580
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,020
Now, Liu Mo is found
to be relevant to this case,

581
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,180
so I must report it to Your Majesty.

582
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,800
Greetings,

583
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,790
Your Majesty.

584
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Returning favors

585
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,300
is a common practice.

586
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,040
But is it worthwhile to

587
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,540
take all the blame and die for

588
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,670
someone else?

589
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,110
I don't get it, Your Majesty.

590
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,860
I did all the crimes myself.

591
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,780
I deserve

592
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,300
to be punished.

593
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,580
I checked the financial records

594
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
you handled for the Ministry of Revenue

595
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,700
and the property

596
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,630
under your name.

597
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,780
Other than

598
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,460
your salary as an official,

599
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,220
you own nothing.

600
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,460
You don't even have a proper

601
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:55,900
house.

602
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,980
Tell me.

603
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,940
You didn't pursue

604
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,620
wealth or fame.

605
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Then why did you

606
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,180
commit those crimes?

607
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,500
Actually, I'm here

608
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,720
to tell you something.

609
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,540
There's a fact you don't know

610
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,510
about your father's case.

611
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,500
15 years ago, your father Yan Changrong

612
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,220
was bound to be executed
for delaying the delivery

613
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,620
of an important message.

614
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,050
He said that he fell asleep

615
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,360
for unknown reasons and wasted half a day

616
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,360
after reaching a postillion.

617
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,750
The then Emperor

618
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,180
ordered a thorough investigation.

619
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,060
But before the truth came out,

620
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,320
Yan Changrong hanged himself in prison.

621
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,680
The coroner found out

622
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,080
that he had been drugged.

623
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,280
The murderer

624
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,000
faked your father's hanging.

625
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,470
The case went into a dead end afterwards.

626
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,260
The court had to drop it at last.

627
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,860
Are Your Majesty

628
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,820
saying that my father was set up

629
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,730
and killed?

630
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,620
Someone else intentionally

631
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
caused the delay.

632
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,860
Your father

633
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,860
was just

634
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,020
a scapegoat.

635
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,140
Delaying the delivery of messages wouldn't

636
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,500
do any good to the country!

637
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,300
But it was closely related to the then

638
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,760
military power struggle.

639
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,420
Su Wenchun just became
a chancellor at that time.

640
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,840
He had few aides,

641
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,030
and no supporter in the army.

642
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,260
After Prince of Mincong died,

643
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,300
he tried every possible means

644
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,100
to take control of Dingbei Army,

645
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,410
but he failed in the end.

646
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Over these years,

647
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,000
Prince of Dingbei and I

648
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,040
have always found it suspicious.

649
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,540
However, since we didn't have any proof,

650
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,100
we couldn't do anything.

651
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,350
Does Chancellor Su know about my origins?

652
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,260
You've worked for him for years.

653
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,420
Don't you

654
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,699
know him best?

655
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,060
There's no way he'd keep someone around

656
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,120
and entrust him with important tasks

657
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,820
before conducting

658
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,360
a thorough background check.

659
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,020
In my opinion,

660
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,699
he must know about your origins.

661
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,659
He deliberately recruited you,

662
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,500
so you could

663
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,540
be his scapegoat and die

664
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,199
for him just like your father.

665
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,060
At this point,

666
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,240
do you still insist on defending him?

667
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,740
I see him as my family.

668
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,700
But he killed my real father.

669
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,780
He gave me a new life.

670
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,640
I can only repay him with my blood.

671
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,490
I want to see him.

672
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,800
Chancellor,

673
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,430
it's all done.

674
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,620
Do not take action

675
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,720
unless it's necessary.

676
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,780
Yes.

677
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,260
What if the situation goes to the extreme?

678
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,540
Then I'll take it as a signal

679
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,460
from the universe.

680
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,260
I'll do what destiny has planned for me.

681
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,540
Success will

682
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
await me.

683
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,140
Got it.

684
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,470
There's one more thing.

685
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,820
A message came from prison.

686
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,580
Liu Mo asked for a meeting with you.

687
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
As long as he is convicted,

688
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,980
I'll be safe and relieved.

689
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,780
Plus, I won't have to make

690
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,220
that risky move in the end.

691
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,670
Go meet him on my behalf.

692
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,820
He respects you.

693
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,850
Try to persuade him

694
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,060
not to cause any trouble.

695
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,930
You haven't seen him for years.

696
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,440
It's time for a proper farewell.

697
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,580
Be with him for
the last moments of his life.

698
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,440
Yes.

699
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,860
Make it short.

700
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,480
Mr. Si?

701
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,710
Come here, kids.

702
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,180
Come over here.

703
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,500
You can have one.

704
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,230
Thank you.

705
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,220
-There's food for you.
-Thanks.

706
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,860
Thank you.

707
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,860
Alright.

708
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,740
Share it, you three.

709
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,460
Thank you.

710
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,100
-Go.
-Thanks.

711
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,860
Sit down.

712
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,140
It's food. Come on.

713
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,860
From now on,

714
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,500
I'll bring you food every other day.

715
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,900
Just focus on your study.

716
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,580
If you get admitted to the academy,

717
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,180
Chancellor Su will pay for

718
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,780
all your expenses at school.

719
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,980
Why is he treating me so well?

720
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,660
Just now, you bravely

721
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,060
argued with the officers

722
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,660
who accused you of stealing.

723
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,920
You defended yourself and your fellows.

724
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,150
You even cited the law.

725
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,860
Seeing the potential in you,
the chancellor decided

726
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,990
to give you a chance.

727
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,860
But how far you can go

728
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,090
depends on yourself.

729
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,800
I'm grateful for the chancellor's help.

730
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,470
Pause.

731
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,760
Point it up.

732
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,600
Keep this token.

733
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,260
If you're desperate for help,

734
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,340
go to the chancellor's mansion

735
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,540
and show this token.

736
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,260
I just hope

737
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,400
you'll never get to use it.

738
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,680
Thank you, sir.

739
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,740
Call me Mr. Su.

740
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,860
Mr. Si?

741
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,860
S-Shouldn't you be...

742
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,480
You thought I was dead.

743
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,240
You're safe and sound.

744
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,370
Why did you suddenly disappear?

745
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,470
I haven't heard from you for years.

746
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,430
I was ordered to lie low.

747
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,740
It's water under the bridge now.

748
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,900
Why would you resurface then?

749
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,160
At the chancellor's request,

750
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,460
I'm here to bid you farewell.

751
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,590
I know you like stuffed pastry,

752
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,430
so I brought you some.

753
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,040
15 years ago, when I first
arrived in the capital,

754
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,100
it was also you

755
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,590
who often brought me food.

756
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,560
And I'm doing it for one last time.

757
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,120
Don't worry.

758
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,110
There's no poison in it.

759
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,760
I've already pleaded guilty.

760
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,760
The chancellor wouldn't
make an unnecessary move.

761
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,260
If I die right now,

762
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
it'll arouse suspicion.

763
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,940
Maybe years ago,

764
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,200
just like me, my father

765
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
became the chancellor's scapegoat

766
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,380
and was at his mercy.

767
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,140
Mr. Si, thank you so much for

768
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,840
taking care of me 15 years ago,

769
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
and for bidding me

770
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,900
farewell today.

771
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,940
You brought me

772
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,540
the two most important meals

773
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,180
in my life.

774
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,060
I was asked to do all that.

775
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,960
No need to thank me.

776
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
I wonder what the chancellor

777
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,160
saw in me back then.

778
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,150
There were so many orphans in the capital.

779
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,660
Why did he choose

780
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,220
to help and sponsor me?

781
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,630
It was his plan.

782
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,000
He must have a good reason.

783
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,320
What about you, Mr. Si?

784
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,340
When were you chosen by him?

785
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Why would you work for him?

786
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,530
15 years ago,

787
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,400
I committed a capital offense
by deserting my post.

788
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,340
The chancellor helped absolve me of blame.

789
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,560
Thereafter, I concealed my identity

790
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,540
and started working for him.

791
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,100
Did you kill a scout

792
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,180
named Yan Changrong 15 years ago?

793
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,590
My guess is correct.

794
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,700
Except me, all those

795
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,980
involved in

796
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,220
this matter died.

797
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,260
How did you get to know the inside story?

798
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,500
What on earth did

799
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,380
Su Wenchun promise

800
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,420
to give you?

801
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,100
Why would you spend

802
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,900
your whole life working for him?

803
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,980
If it hadn't been for him,

804
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,950
I would've been executed long ago.

805
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,500
Besides,

806
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,510
once I stepped on this path,

807
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,500
I knew there was no turning back.

808
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,300
This is a one-way trip.

809
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,620
You and I are the same.

810
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,440
We do things against our will.

811
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,300
We can't decide our fate.

812
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,820
No.

813
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,060
We're different.
