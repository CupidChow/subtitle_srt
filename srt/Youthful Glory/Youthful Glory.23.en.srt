00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:30,020
[Youthful Glory]

2
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,820
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Your daily misconduct

4
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,200
is one thing,

5
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,680
[General Xuanwei in Lingzhou Feng Yongchang]

6
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,160
but today you've
provoked the Prince of Dingbei

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,509
to issue a special decree

8
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,729
[Feng Xulin, son of General Xuanwei in Lingzhou]

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,360
to reprimand us.

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,280
I didn't even leave the house today.

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,440
How could I have offended
the Prince of Dingbei?

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,800
He is known for his ruthlessness.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I wouldn't dare provoke him.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,880
The Prince of Dingbei accuses you of

15
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,160
abusing the power of the royal household,

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
acting tyrannically,

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
and lacking personal virtue.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,960
He says you shouldn't
be flaunting yourself in public.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Even my mansion

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,680
has been labeled as

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,610
failing to discipline the family.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,480
I've spent my entire life
on the battlefield

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
without a single defeat.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,440
Now in my old age,

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm being rebuked like this.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,160
It's truly humiliating.

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,400
The Prince of Dingbei
has just arrived in Lingzhou.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
How could he know how I conduct myself?

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
He and Ming Tan are husband and wife,

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,280
naturally in cahoots with her.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,440
They're targeting me at every turn.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
My marriage to Lingzhou in the first place...

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
Was his doing.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,260
Now that I'm far from the capital,

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,240
the two of them

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,280
still won't leave me alone.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
They're determined
to humiliate me in every way possible,

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
and by extension, humiliate the Feng family.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
What happened
at the Fu Lu Gold Store today?

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Do you think you can still hide it?

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm only asking you this:

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,560
Is the Prince of Dingbei's decree

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
justified or not?

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,640
-Father, calm down.
-I...

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
It's all my fault,

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,090
for failing to control my wife.

47
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,120
All of you, go to the ancestral hall

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
and kneel as punishment
to reflect on your actions.

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't let this foolish woman

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,210
go out and cause trouble again.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
Also,

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
that one called Lingzhi
who's always with her...

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
Stirring up trouble,

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
taking advantage of others.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,920
Get her out immediately!

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,650
Yes, Father.

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,560
How dare you treat me like this!

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,680
If my father were still alive,

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,080
I...

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,410
You have the nerve to mention your father?

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,390
With your behavior and attitude,

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,160
you're nothing like him.

63
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
The day you married into the Feng family,

64
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,900
His Lordship sent a letter saying

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,600
you are a daughter-in-law
of our Feng family.

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,920
How to discipline you

67
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,340
is entirely up to our Feng family.

68
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,920
You're just bullying me

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
because I have no family to rely on,

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,760
taking advantage of me being all alone!

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,280
Ming Chu, shut up!

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,240
If you cause any more trouble

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
and refuse to repent,

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
I...

75
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,960
I... I will divorce you immediately!

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,970
Come with me now!

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,560
Let's go.

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Master,

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,079
the girls have all arrived.

80
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,840
Where is she?

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,840
Greetings, Ms. Su.

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,600
Serve him well later.

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,240
The Prince of Dingbei
is not averse to women.

84
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,700
It depends on
whether you have what it takes.

85
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,990
If you prove useful,

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,630
all the brothel business in Lingzhou

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
could all be entrusted to you

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,640
in the future.

89
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm deeply grateful
for your support.

90
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,040
Miss Qingyu,

91
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:33,920
please.

92
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
My Lady.

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
Your Highness, please forgive us.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
Miss He, Mr. Wen, please excuse us.

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
The master suddenly has urgent matters

96
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,280
and needs to step away for a moment.

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
She instructed me

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,800
to take good care
of all the distinguished guests.

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
I have invited
the best girl from Hui Mansion

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,160
to come

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
and play the guqin

102
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
to entertain the guests.

103
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Greetings, distinguished guests.

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,680
Last time, I failed to serve
Your Highness properly.

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,280
It was my fault.

106
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
I hope Your Highness will be generous

107
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,400
and give me a chance

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
to make amends.

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
Last time?

110
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,480
You eat whatever she serves you?

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,920
Jiang Qizhi,

112
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,060
do you have any principles

113
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,400
as a married man?

114
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
It's truly a blessing
to meet the Fourth Miss.

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,950
It must be fate.

116
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,159
If you don't mind,

117
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,040
I'd be willing to be

118
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
your guide in Lingzhou.

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,680
I guarantee you'll enjoy it so much here
that you won't want to leave.

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,100
Mr. Wen, I wouldn't
dare ask you to be a guide.

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,440
However, I have

122
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,430
a business proposition

123
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,080
that I'd like to discuss with you.

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,930
I've acquired Mr. Wu's

125
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,260
batch of tie-dyed silk.

126
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,800
I'd like to ask for
your help in selling it.

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,930
My only requirement

128
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,280
is that the price be fair

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,210
and not deceive the common people.

130
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,330
Fourth Miss, this action

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,280
will surely result in a total loss.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,300
Why bother getting
involved in such a mess?

133
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,100
It's alright.

134
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,970
The fabric is of
no use to me if I keep it.

135
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,400
It's better to sell it
and stimulate the fabric market.

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,520
I think

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
money should be made,

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
and business should be done.

139
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,310
But we must still
adhere to the principles of commerce.

140
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,440
The market rules cannot be disrupted.

141
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,860
Fourth Miss, your generosity

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,760
puts me to shame.

143
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,470
I'll punish myself with a drink.

144
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,330
Please, Fourth Miss, as you wish.

145
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Your Highness, please forgive us.

146
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,960
Your Highness, please spare our lives.

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,060
The Prince of Dingbei is a war god,

148
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,410
not the King of Hell.

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,030
He only kills enemies,

150
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
not the innocent.

151
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,120
Ladies,

152
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
you may leave.

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,400
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
We'll take our leave.

156
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Mr. Wen, you also understand the guqin?

157
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
I know a little.

158
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
From what you say,

159
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,440
you're also a lover of the guqin.

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,919
Then allow me to guess

161
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,659
your favorite piece.

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,180
How did you know
this was my favorite piece, Mr. Wen?

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
Our hearts are in sync,

164
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
it goes without saying.

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
The string broke.

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,490
It's inauspicious.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
What does Your Highness
think we should do?

168
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,140
Wine can drive away evil spirits.

169
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,720
Drink.

170
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,760
Mr. Wen,

171
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
please.

172
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,760
That piece just now was exquisite.

173
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,850
We should drink.

174
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,450
Thank you for your praise, Your Highness.

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
The listeners were thoroughly entertained.

176
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,080
I will drink with you, Mr. Wen.

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,890
When the wine comes around,

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,340
we shall drink.

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,240
Fourth Miss...

180
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,900
Miss He looks like
she can't handle her alcohol.

181
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,100
I'll drink on Miss He's behalf

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
and offer a toast to you, Mr. Wen.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Please.

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,700
Is this a drinking contest

185
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,960
or a fight to the death?

186
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,180
Tell someone to
bring five more jars of fine wine.

187
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,190
[Su's Mansion]

188
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,320
Ding Er.

189
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,040
My Lady,

190
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I saw the young master

191
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,680
moved quite a few boxes today.

192
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,670
But Ms. Wu said

193
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,200
you were aware of this matter.

194
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
Who would have thought that later,

195
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
Ms. Wu actually
tried to kill me to silence me.

196
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,260
Fortunately, Liuwu arrived in time.

197
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,220
How long have you been with me?

198
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
My Lady,

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,760
ever since the Chancellor
went to the capital to take office,

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
I have

201
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,480
been serving by your side.

202
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,450
Over these years,

203
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,130
have I ever mistreated you?

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,800
My Lady, your words are too kind

205
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
I have been well
provided for in the Su family.

206
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,040
There's no question of mistreatment.

207
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,440
So you do know
this is the Su family's house.

208
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
Now that things have come to this,

209
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,410
I have nothing to hide.

210
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,080
It was indeed
I who covered for the young master,

211
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,740
helping him empty the cellar.

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,760
Why would you do such a thing?

213
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,760
Over these years, the young master

214
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,810
has given me many favors.

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,280
When you take someone's money,

216
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,920
you must do their bidding.

217
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
Moreover,

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,040
My Lady, you've been
treating the young master

219
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,430
like a servant.

220
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,200
I simply couldn't bear to watch.

221
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,840
Good.

222
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
Very well.

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Serving two masters,

224
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,480
aren't you afraid you'll earn the money

225
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,700
but won't live to spend it?

226
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,360
A feast is not complete without wine.

227
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,040
Drink.

228
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,360
Mr. Wen.

229
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,460
Your Highness.

230
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,720
Your Highness has a great
capacity for alcohol.

231
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Drink.

232
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960
Are you alright, Your Highness?

233
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,570
Your Highness is drunk.

234
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,040
How about

235
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,890
I'll help you
to the side room to sit for a while

236
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
to sober up.

237
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,560
Let me help you.

238
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,640
Come.

239
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Had a few sips of wine

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,460
and his true colors are revealed.

241
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,360
Your Highness.

242
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
No need.

243
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,670
Since Your Highness and Mr. Wen

244
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,680
have hit it off so well,

245
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,840
and found a kindred spirit over drinks,

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,970
I won't disturb you two

247
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,040
as you drink to your heart's content.

248
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,100
I'll take my leave.

249
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,210
Fourth Miss.

250
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,780
Your Highness.

251
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,200
Useless.

252
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,260
My Lady,

253
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,200
Officer Shu says he has
urgent matters to tell you.

254
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,160
Ms. Su.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,880
Ms. Su,

256
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
have you encountered any trouble?

257
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,860
Officer Shu, what do you mean by that?

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,560
Outsiders are easy to guard against.
It's those inside you can't predict.

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Ms. Su's bedmate

260
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
is truly insatiable

261
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,020
and unwilling to be subordinate.

262
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,680
With his limited abilities,

263
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,300
I don't believe
he can escape from Lingzhou.

264
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
Within two days,

265
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,520
I'll make him kneel before me.

266
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,680
If he were just
a son-in-law of the Su family,

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
you could have your way.

268
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
But what if his daily behavior
is just a disguise,

269
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,800
and he actually has another identity?

270
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,050
His Highness and I agreed to meet here.

271
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,360
Why didn't he come himself?

272
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,050
Ms. Su is hosting a banquet.

273
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,840
His Highness couldn't decline.

274
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,040
So he sent me here.

275
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,930
What does this mean?

276
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,010
How did she find out so quickly?

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,920
Yu Bozhong.

278
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,240
You treacherous,

279
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,480
ungrateful creature.

280
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,340
Ms. Su trusted you so much in vain.

281
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,600
His Highness says

282
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,060
this is a Su family matter.

283
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,660
It's none of his business.

284
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,940
Jiang Xu went back on his word.

285
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,490
He deliberately played me.

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're using the name of Haiyou Sect

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,410
to make a deal with me.

288
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,630
You want to use my power

289
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,140
to turn against the Su family?

290
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,640
For so many years,

291
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
the court has been sending people here

292
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
intending to investigate
the Su family's secrets.

293
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,329
But in the end,
none of them ever returned.

294
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,490
But this time is different.

295
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,359
If Your Highness and I join forces,

296
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,890
we can each get what we want.

297
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,760
Wouldn't that be perfect for both of us?

298
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
You have a good plan?

299
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,160
As long as Your Highness

300
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,619
keeps Su Errong occupied,

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,599
I can

302
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,460
transfer the Su family's wealth.

303
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
When the time comes,

304
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,140
the portion Your Highness
needs to report back,

305
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
I will hand over with both hands.

306
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,000
What a clever scheme, Chief.

307
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I can't believe I fell for his trick.

308
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,140
From beginning to end,

309
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,740
he never intended to join forces with me.

310
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,520
The Haiyou Sect
has committed numerous crimes.

311
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,200
You are not tolerated by the court.

312
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,920
The Prince of Dingbei has ordered

313
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,850
to round up the entire Haiyou Sect.

314
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,040
If anyone resists,

315
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,140
they will be executed on the spot.

316
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,890
[Divorce Agreement]

317
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,250
Ms. Su doesn't tolerate any disloyalty.

318
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,680
Since you've betrayed us,

319
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
you're no longer worthy
to be part of the Su family.

320
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,930
[Divorce Agreement]

321
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Whoever wants to be

322
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
Su family's dog can go ahead.

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
As long as we can fight our way out,

324
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
all the money
will be shared among the survivors.

325
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
It will be divided equally.

326
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,880
You're dreaming.

327
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,370
Kill!

328
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,560
Charge!

329
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,120
Miss He.

330
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,080
Mr. Wen and His Highness
have both drunk too much.

331
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,280
Take two bowls of hangover soup to them.

332
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,730
Add more vinegar.

333
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,850
The two gentlemen like it that way.

334
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,020
I'll go prepare it right away.

335
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,120
It's me.

336
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Tan's husband.

337
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,450
Your Highness is drunk.

338
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,970
Being drunk is good.

339
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,930
Only when drunk do I realize

340
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,780
that you're wonderful
in countless ways.

341
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,350
No one can compare to you.

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,680
So when you're sober,
you don't think I'm good?

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,280
It's only when I'm drunk

344
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,410
that I can bare my heart.

345
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,020
If time could flow backwards,

346
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
I would devote my whole heart

347
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,130
to pursuing you.

348
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,240
Arranged marriage, contract,

349
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,500
all of it would be void.

350
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,830
Only if you willingly agree

351
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
would it count.

352
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,480
Your Highness has

353
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,610
Qingyu, Lvyu, and Hongyu by your side.

354
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,940
Where is there room for me?

355
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
Are you jealous?

356
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,000
So what if I am?

357
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,320
Jiang Qizhi.

358
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,010
Put me down.

359
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,940
Qingyu said she didn't
serve you well last time.

360
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,190
When was last time?

361
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,600
How did she serve you?

362
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,140
She clearly wanted to

363
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,030
help you to the side room just now.

364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,220
And you,

365
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,710
why did you
eat the food she picked for you

366
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,200
and drink the wine she poured?

367
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
You're obviously...

368
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
Weak-willed

369
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,970
and unable to resist temptation.

370
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,880
You...

371
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,760
Don't think that

372
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,220
I'll forgive you for this.

373
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,400
Tan,

374
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,310
if I were to court you again,

375
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,600
would you accept?

376
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,360
I won't.

377
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
We're already husband and wife.

378
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,400
What's there to accept or not?

379
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,710
You're really drunk.

380
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,480
Just tell me,

381
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,260
would you or wouldn't you?

382
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,840
Well, you would have to

383
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,570
court me first before I can say.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,680
You might sober up tomorrow

385
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,050
and forget what you said today.

386
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,240
I'll remember.

387
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,640
I promise.

389
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,680

Eight people from the Haiyou Sect died.

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
21 people were captured.

403
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
Yu Bozhong escaped in the chaos.

404
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,210
There's no trace of him for now.

405
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,200
I have distributed his portrait

406
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
to our people.

407
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
The secret guards throughout Lingzhou

408
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
have been instructed
to keep a close eye out.

409
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,240
All the money has been transported
back to the Su family's residence.

410
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Please advise, Sir.

411
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
Should I send someone to keep watch?

412
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,130
No need to watch.

413
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,610
This master of yours

414
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,490
never engages in losing deals.

415
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,920
This money has already been made official.

416
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,240
If the Su family tries to refuse again,

417
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,370
it would be openly opposing the court.

418
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,600
Before the day is out,

419
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,960
the Su family will surely

420
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,390
hand over this money willingly.

421
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,930
This box,

422
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
take it and distribute it among our men.

423
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,680
Consider it a reward
for last night's work.

424
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,920
On behalf of our brothers,

425
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,050
I thank you, My Lady.

426
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,480
Thank you, My Lady.

427
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,320
However,

428
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,320
we've worked hard to recover this money.

429
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,240
Why should we let the court
benefit from it for nothing?

430
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,120
The Prince of Dingbei is no pushover.

431
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,030
Do you really think

432
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,360
he only wants
the people and not the money?

433
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,900
This money has already come to light.

434
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,880
How else can the Su family dodge

435
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
the tax compensation issue?

436
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,340
The Prince of Dingbei's plan
for Yu Bozhong

437
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,040
was to kill two birds with one stone.

438
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,440
He not only crushed the Haiyou Sect,

439
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
but also secured our silver.

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,020
Whether it's him or that beast,

441
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll settle this score sooner or later.

442
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,360
It's my incompetence

443
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,360
that allowed Yu Bozhong
to escape in the chaos.

444
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,280
However, he was
severely injured last night.

445
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,480
I suspect his days are numbered.

446
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,410
Keep searching.

447
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,890
Even if he's dead,

448
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,820
I must see his corpse.

449
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,360
Yes.

450
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,090
Anyone who dares

451
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,700
betray the Su family

452
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
will have to answer for it.

453
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
After the Su family delivers the mace,

454
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
you take it to Prefect Zhang.

455
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,090
Once Prefect Zhang takes over,

456
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
order all secret guards
to withdraw immediately.

457
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,530
Sir, do you mean

458
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,560
to have Prefect Zhang

459
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,620
escort this mace back to the capital?

460
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
But Prefect Zhang
is one of the Su family's people.

461
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,760
On the way back to the capital,

462
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,090
the Su family's influence is widespread.

463
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
Precisely because of this,

464
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
the Su family will be cautious.

465
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,570
No matter where

466
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
this mace goes wrong,

467
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
Prefect Zhang

468
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,000
and the officials along the route

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,660
will all be held accountable.

470
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,840
To avoid harming their subordinates,

471
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,500
the Su family wouldn't
dare to act rashly again.

472
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,160
Your master

473
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,120
wants Lingzhou
and the officials along the way

474
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,080
to willingly

475
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,090
and wholeheartedly

476
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,220
complete this task.

477
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,670
But...

478
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
The officials
under the Su family's control

479
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
in handling cases

480
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,220
are truly disappointing.

481
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,290
This morning,

482
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
someone discovered a corpse

483
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
in a wasteland.

484
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,040
It was Ms. Su's

485
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
housekeeper.

486
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,200
But after receiving the report,

487
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,680
the officials didn't
investigate or inquire.

488
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,600
They hastily concluded it
as an accidental fall.

489
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,000
With such incompetence,

490
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,640
are you really at ease

491
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,560
letting them handle this matter, Sir?

492
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
It's not that
they don't investigate or inquire,

493
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,620
but that they can't
investigate or inquire.

494
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,840
They can only close the case as is.

495
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
When it's not their concern,

496
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,360
everyone can be
generous with others' interests.

497
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,090
But if it involves themselves,

498
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,710
how many would dare to take it lightly?

499
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,940
This is specially instructed by Miss He,

500
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,360
to prepare for Your Highness

501
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,560
a hangover and stomach-soothing soup.

502
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,520
Oh, right,

503
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,580
after sending you back last night,

504
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,800
Miss He said

505
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,860
that leaving Mr. Wen

506
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,080
drunk alone at the tavern

507
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,280
was not appropriate.

508
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
She decided to make another trip

509
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,410
to personally escort Mr. Wen home.

510
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Who exactly is this Wen Zong?

511
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,960
What's wrong?

512
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,250
Is the taste not to your liking?

513
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,640
About the matter of you meeting with Yu,

514
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,500
how is it going?

515
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,400
There's no progress yet.

516
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,960
No progress?

517
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,800
You still have time to chat idly here?

518
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't you know that every day delayed

519
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,330
puts him in more danger?

520
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,450
How could I not be worried

521
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,360
about Yu's safety?

522
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
But the Su family is watching closely.

523
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,610
How can I get away?

524
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,800
So early in the morning,

525
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,680
where does
this inexplicable anger come from?

526
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
We'll take action at 3-5 pm today.

527
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
At that time,

528
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,410
you and Yun Yi
will coordinate the operation.

529
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Xu's temper lately

530
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,090
has become increasingly strange.

531
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,550
[Fu Lu Gold Store]

532
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,520
It's already late in the morning,

533
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,850
why haven't they opened for business yet?

534
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,430
You...

535
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,040
Miss He,

536
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,720
what brings you here?

537
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,920
I thought you were closed today.

538
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,080
I was worried I'd come for nothing.

539
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
How could that be?

540
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
Even if it's just for you,

541
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,960
our shop must open.

542
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Please, come in, come in.

543
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
Miss He, feel free to browse.

544
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Whatever you like,

545
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
please try it on.

546
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,770
No need, no need.

547
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,320
I actually have something to ask about.

548
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,700
Mr. Luo, could you take a look at this.

549
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,640
Did this hairpin

550
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,070
come from your shop?

551
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,600
I've never seen this hairpin before.

552
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,380
Our shop

553
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,280
has never sold this style either.

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,740
I didn't ask

555
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,320
if it was sold from the shop.

556
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,060
What I'm asking is

557
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,190
whether it was sold by you personally.

558
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,740
I have been working at Fu Lu Gold Store

559
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,200
as a manager for many years.

560
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,940
All sold items are recorded.

561
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,880
Perhaps some merchants

562
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,920
are using the Su family's name

563
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,600
to deceive people outside.

564
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,840
It doesn't count.

565
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,760
I see.

566
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Mr. Luo, your reputation precedes you.

567
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,100
Is it common for people

568
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,320
to use your name to attract business?

569
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,260
There's a Mr. Wu in Lingzhou city.

570
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
I just bought

571
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,160
a batch of tie-dyed silk from him.

572
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,500
Mr. Wu also told me

573
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,480
that the batch of fabric

574
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,780
was sourced from you.

575
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
If this Mr. Wu

576
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
is indeed using your name

577
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,800
to deceive merchants,

578
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,990
then I must return

579
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,620
this batch of tie-dyed silk.

580
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,600
At that time, I'll have to ask you

581
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,800
to be a witness for me,

582
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
to prevent people from saying

583
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,540
that I wronged him.

584
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,360
Well...

585
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,400
Fourth Miss, why trouble Mr. Luo?

586
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
Whether it's the gold store
or the fabric shop,

587
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,780
they are all properties of the Su family.

588
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,840
Mr. Luo is just

589
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
a salaried employee.

590
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,480
He can't make any decisions.

591
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,130
How to stock or sell goods

592
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,370
all depends on the Su family's orders.

593
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,080
Mr. Wen, why are you here?

594
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,240
I was just thinking of
selecting a piece of jewelry

595
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,500
to give to you in return

596
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,290
to thank you

597
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,280
for your kindness
in seeing me off last night.

598
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,080
Fortunately, I've met you here.

599
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,800
Otherwise, if it fails

600
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,200
to reach your heart,

601
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
it would seem
that my sincerity is lacking.

602
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,920
Mr. Wen, there's no need to be so polite.

603
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,260
However, Mr. Wen, your visit here

604
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
has made Mr. Luo close the doors

605
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,400
to entertain you privately.

606
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,280
This treatment

607
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,040
is something
we ordinary customers can't compare to.

608
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,480
Mr. Wen's esteemed presence

609
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,440
naturally requires special treatment
from our humble store.

610
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,100
This is specifically
instructed by the Master.

611
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,080
I wonder, Fourth Miss, what's so special

612
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,400
about this hairpin

613
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,180
that you must find the person who sold it?

614
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Well, I

615
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
just want to find some sources

616
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,010
to select more rare jewelry.

617
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,440
This hairpin has a unique style,

618
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,850
and the pattern on it is also distinctive.

619
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,320
I happened to buy it by chance

620
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,640
from a small vendor.

621
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,480
It cost me quite
a bit of silver at the time

622
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,610
to find out the origin of this hairpin.

623
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,080
It was from Mr. Luo
at this Fu Lu Gold Store

624
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
in Lingzhou City.

625
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,650
I came to Lingzhou

626
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,280
specifically to purchase rare items.

627
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,720
After meeting Mr. Wu,

628
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160
I realized even more that Mr. Luo

629
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
is involved in
quite a wide range of businesses

630
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
and must have many supply channels.

631
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
That's why I came to inquire.

632
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,410
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

633
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,640
But unexpectedly,

634
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,800
that small vendor,

635
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,800
he actually deceived me.

636
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Fourth Miss, you have a discerning eye.

637
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
I am quite familiar with

638
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
the various shops, big and small,

639
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,260
in this Lingzhou City.

640
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
Why don't I

641
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,640
recommend a few to you?

642
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,440
Really?

643
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Then I'll humbly accept your offer.

644
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Thank you for your trouble, Mr. Wen.

645
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
Fourth Miss, you wouldn't

646
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,840
have come all the way to Lingzhou

647
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,700
just for this hairpin, would you?

648
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,740
They say Lingzhou

649
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
is the wealthiest place in our Xian.

650
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,980
I did come here specifically.

651
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,320
Knowing that Mr. Luo's place

652
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,450
has some rare items,

653
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I naturally didn't want to miss out.

654
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,130
It's just a pity that

655
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,560
I came with high hopes,

656
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
but it turned out to be a wasted trip.

657
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,960
Fourth Miss, you couldn't find

658
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,120
what you were looking for.

659
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,250
Won't you be returning disappointed?

660
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,520
I've loved accessories since I was young.

661
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,250
If I could buy something novel,

662
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,560
that would be ideal.

663
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,270
But if there isn't anything,

664
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,740
I'll just consider it as traveling

665
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,680
and broadening my horizons.

666
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Fourth Miss, you're so
elegant and refined.

667
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,470
You must have been raised in luxury,

668
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,470
pampered at home.

669
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,560
I never thought

670
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,760
you would have such lofty aspirations.

671
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,010
Mr. Wen, you flatter me.

672
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,680
It's just that

673
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
apart from being wealthy and prosperous,

674
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,170
Lingzhou doesn't have anything special.

675
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,190
When I first arrived
in this precious place,

676
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,160
the first pot of tea I drank

677
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,620
was barely satisfactory.

678
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
That was from Dingsheng Tea House,

679
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,320
supposedly high-quality, expensive tea.

680
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,000
But in that tea,

681
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
there was a distinct moldy taste.

682
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
Poor quality at a high price,

683
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,840
it doesn't live up to its reputation.

684
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,270
I wonder if this trip

685
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,990
was worth it or not.

686
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,640
Fourth Miss, saying that

687
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,610
is a bit of an overgeneralization.

688
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,130
These past two days,

689
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,120
I've also visited quite a few shops.

690
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,840
Although each one claims
to have top quality,

691
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,160
and exquisite craftsmanship,

692
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,420
the styles are all rather conventional.

693
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,640
Apart from being luxurious and expensive,

694
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,120
there's really nothing unique about them.

695
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,840
Earlier, when I offered my services

696
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,480
to be your guide,

697
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,000
it was because I feared
you might not find your way.

698
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,260
Within Lingzhou city,

699
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,680
the truly good things are hidden deep.

700
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,890
If you truly want to experience

701
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,600
the unique local characteristics,

702
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,020
I would be willing to

703
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,240
offer some guidance.

704
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,460
With you as a guide,

705
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,640
this trip will surely not be in vain.

706
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Please.

707
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,900
We've arrived.

708
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,040
Smell it.

709
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,570
The fragrance of this tea is subtle.

710
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,830
Only when warmed in the palm for a moment,

711
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,719
can one faintly detect its aroma.

712
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,750
The scent is cool and refreshing,

713
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,480
like mountain dew in early spring.

714
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,770
I wonder how it will taste

715
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,730
after brewing.

716
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,880
If you want to drink, sit down.

717
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,980
If not, leave quickly.

718
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,780
We'll sit.

719
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,020
Fourth Miss, taste the tea first.

720
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,010
There's no rush to make a judgment.

721
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,100
Please, have some tea.

722
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,620
Please.

723
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,810
This is Xiangshan tea.

724
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,160
It's produced
in the great mountains of the southwest,

725
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
in a place rarely visited by people.

726
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
How is it that

727
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,520
such fine tea is available here?

728
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,650
Fourth Miss, you're indeed an expert.

729
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,220
The owner is from Anjun in the southwest.

730
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,000
His ancestors

731
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,120
were all tea pickers
in the deep mountains.

732
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,400
This tea is their family's
signature product.

733
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,350
If you want to drink good tea,

734
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,920
this is the only place in Lingzhou

735
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,360
that's unmatched.

736
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,080
Mr. Wen,

737
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
please stop bringing people here.

738
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,170
I fear crowds the most.

739
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,160
This shop of mine

740
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,890
only sells ten pots of tea a day.

743
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,700
you must let this lady

744

I'll take a few days off.

748

who does business like this.

Five mace of cardamom.

763
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,400

Miss Yun, if you want
to eat roast chicken,

00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,970
just tell me anytime.

768
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,000
Why bother learning it yourself?

769
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Actually, I've wanted to learn
how to make roast chicken for a long time.

770
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,960

that Xu's roast chicken
is the best in the world?

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,420
Why don't you ask him to teach you?

775
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,120
I wouldn't dare
ask His Highness for instruction.

776
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,130
