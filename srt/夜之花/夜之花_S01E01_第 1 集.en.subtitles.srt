1
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,376
PIL INN: AN INN WHICH IS RUN

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,462
BY UNJONG STREET'S
TOP MERCHANT GUILD

3
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,634
Did you bring enough money?

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,844
Of course I did.

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,390
Let's get started now.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,356
-It is my lucky day!
-Let's go!

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,196
Look who it is.
Are you back for more, Kim?

8
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,614
I brought my house deed this time.

9
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,075
Take this, and let me have
just one more game.

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,577
Sure thing!

11
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,662
Are you feeling lucky?

12
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,747
You bet I am!

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,959
Who the heck are you?

14
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,307
Your children are starving,
and your wife gets beaten.

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,892
Who the heck do you think you are?

16
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,562
-Do you have a death wish?
-No, not the house!

17
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,688
Time to win some money!

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,067
As if that was not enough,
I have had to follow you all the way here.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,820
If I ever see you here again,

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,239
I will not only take
the deed to your house

21
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,157
but your life as well.

22
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,284
Who goes there?

23
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,828
Get him!

24
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,668
I bet 100 yang.

25
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,336
Are you still in?

26
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,839
I shall call.

27
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,053
It appears that I have won this round.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,391
Oh, goodness. Two nines?

29
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,393
Who would have known?

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,394
TWO NINES:
SECOND HIGHEST HAND IN TUJEON

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,687
I mean,

32
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,149
who knew that making money could be
so effortless?

33
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,070
Is this not so much fun?

34
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,365
There he goes. Stop him!

35
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,493
Stop that thief!

36
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,456
Hurry up and catch him!

37
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,751
Hold it.

38
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,880
There is no such thing as easy money.

39
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,342
One must have hidden talents
and make an effort in tujeon as well.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,221
What?

41
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,890
Two tens?

42
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,226
TWO TENS: THE HIGHEST HAND
IN TUJEON

43
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,313
Are there not supposed to be

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,231
only two tens in the deck?

45
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,153
What?

46
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,112
How could this be?

47
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,781
This was my first game in Hanyang.

48
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,037
What are you trying to accuse me of?

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,121
Who are you?

50
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,295
-You dirty cheat!
-I should kill you right now!

51
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,380
You sneaky little swindler!

52
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,523
Oh, do not let me stop you.

53
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,234
Carry on as you were.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,160
You sneaky little rat.

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,623
Get back!

56
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,458
Or I will slash open his throat!

57
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,626
Calm down.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,127
Get a hold of yourself.

59
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,347
My money!

60
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,523
Wake up, my friend!

61
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,858
Let us not get overly excited now.

62
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,078
There is no need to be like this.

63
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,037
Get him!

64
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,886
You cheeky little…

65
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,865
-What are you doing?
-A woman?

66
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,991
Attack him!

67
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,169
What? The paru is ringing already?

68
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,880
PARU: A BELL RUNG AT DAWN
TO ANNOUNCE THE END OF CURFEW

69
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,298
I do not know this person.

70
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,466
Shut your mouth!

71
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,802
Let me borrow your fan.

72
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,716
What a brazen woman!

73
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:48,658
THE MAIN
AND THE ALTERNATIVE PERSONA

74
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,329
Yeo-hwa.

75
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,498
Yeo-hwa?

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,333
Has she gone to the shrine?

77
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,648
-My lady!
-I just saw Mother outside.

78
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,322
You must hurry.

79
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,077
Done.

80
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:44,088
Oh, my dear!

81
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
Mother!

82
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,720
Have you been here all night?

83
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,682
I dare not compare
my grief to yours, Mother.

84
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,268
But thinking
of my husband's sudden passing,

85
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,773
how could I rest
in the comfort of a warm bedroom?

86
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,910
It was said
that a calm and orderly demeanor

87
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,037
was the beginning of acquiring virtue.

88
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,830
I apologize, Mother.

89
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,708
Your mind has been disciplined
at the shrine for decades.

90
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,084
How have you still not changed?

91
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,338
I will devote myself
to disciplining my mind even more.

92
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,255
Very well.

93
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,720
Confucius's preliminary teachings

94
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:37,266
tells us to clear our distracted minds
and focus on developing virtue.

95
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,101
We must be in control of ourselves,

96
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,729
including our words,
expressions, and even how we walk--

97
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,315
Yes, I will transcribe
Instructions for Women again--

98
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,150
How dare you interrupt your mother-in-law?

99
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,485
I apologize, Mother.

100
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,073
You must limit the amount you eat

101
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,535
to fully dedicate yourself
to cultivating your character.

102
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,452
Pardon?

103
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,957
Starting today,
limit yourself to only one meal a day.

104
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,044
Refrain from eating meat
or anything that tastes sweet.

105
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,755
Not even…

106
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,300
Just a…

107
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,554
Yes, Mother.

108
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,944
I cannot relieve myself
on a meal of vegetables.

109
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,780
How could I be ladylike,
feeling bloated and constipated?

110
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,031
This is outrageous.

111
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,743
I am already feeling hungry.

112
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,204
What am I to do, Yeon-seon?

113
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,503
I get so scared
whenever you go quiet like that.

114
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,755
Are you not going to ask
how I got injured?

115
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,426
I would not dare
to ask you such a thing, my lady.

116
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,095
Who cares if you break curfew
or return at high noon?

117
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,888
Just do not get caught by Lady Yoo.

118
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,891
I feel like you are being sarcastic.

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,435
No, my lady.

120
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,397
It is not like I am worried sick
for your well-being or anything.

121
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,691
Please do not worry about me, my lady.

122
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
I am just a maid.

123
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,279
I only went out to check up
on Kkon-nim. That is all.

124
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,906
It has been days since she came
to do her seamstress work.

125
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,992
I am sure you were very concerned.

126
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,077
I also feel concerned
whenever I hear a thump,

127
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,871
hoping you did not get hurt
jumping over the wall.

128
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,249
When the dog next door barks,
I cannot help but worry

129
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,502
whether you were arrested
by the patrolling guardians or not.

130
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,920
At least you returned safely today--

131
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,967
That is right! Has your one and only lady
not returned safely once again today?

132
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,678
Please be careful, my lady.

133
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,598
What would you say
if you came back with a broken arm?

134
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,684
I only just managed to get away today.

135
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,853
Swords were flying all over the place,

136
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,397
and I was still
at Unjong Street while the paru--

137
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,776
Swords? Were you in a sword fight?

138
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,612
Did I just say "swords"?

139
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,865
No, Yeon-seon! I did not say that.

140
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,991
What are you talking about?

141
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,622
But I did learn something
about myself today.

142
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,417
I can take on 17 people in a fight.

143
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,045
Lady Cho!

144
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,048
You startled me, Yeon-seon.

145
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,259
CAPITAL GUARD:
A CENTRAL MILITARY UNIT

146
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,719
ASSEMBLED TO GUARD
THE KING AND CAPITAL

147
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,013
So, Superintendent Park Su-ho.

148
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,475
You come from a renowned family
and gained top marks in the state exam.

149
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:28,562
I had so much faith in you
after I heard you even resolved

150
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,816
the tax evasion incident
in Jeolla province.

151
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,819
I simply carried out my obligations.

152
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,571
That is right.

153
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,281
About your obligations!

154
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,702
I gave you your first mission
to apprehend a swindler.

155
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,329
What did you do?

156
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,791
As you commanded,
I caught the one disturbing the peace.

157
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,711
I handed him to the police as they are
responsible for criminal investigations.

158
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,548
Every local government office is
eager to capture him.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,134
We, the Capital Guard,
do all the hard work

160
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,221
and willingly surrender him
to whom, exactly? The police bureau?

161
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,224
Rest assured, they will deal with him
according to the law.

162
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,020
Perhaps even Confucius himself would want
to take notes from you!

163
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,273
So, just because it's someone else's job,

164
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,650
you would willingly give up
being praised for working hard?

165
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,069
How righteous of you.

166
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,904
I am so proud of you!

167
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,453
There was trouble at the inn.

168
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,498
Given the large scale of gambling
and the suspicious intruder,

169
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,626
an increase in the level of security
in the capital is needed.

170
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,462
Why are you telling me this?

171
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,505
Report it to the police bureau.

172
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,176
Better yet, why not capture
and surrender him to the police bureau?

173
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,722
I will report back to you if there is
any progress in the investigation.

174
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,396
I never have any luck with my recruits.

175
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
Did you get yelled at?

176
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
Sir, had you brought him here,

177
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,695
you could have been
the star of the Capital Guard.

178
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,616
First, the tax evasion in Jeolla province,
and then a swindler at the gambling den.

179
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,868
You could have become
Captain Hwang's favorite!

180
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,914
And there goes my future.

181
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,002
I have a task for you.

182
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,381
Last night, a person
in a black mask caused a scene at Pil Inn.

183
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,424
A mask, sir?

184
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,801
Was it an assassin? A thief?

185
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,387
Perhaps a hitman?

186
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,892
I am not sure,
but the individual was highly skilled.

187
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,229
He disturbed public order,
so find out who it was

188
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,105
and where they came from.

189
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,148
Find out all the details.

190
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes, sir!

191
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,366
Your Majesty.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,662
Everyone was worried about your absence
from today's council meeting.

193
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,374
You know how my illness always improves
once the council meeting is over.

194
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,668
That is right.

195
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,462
Did your brother not get promoted
to the Capital Guard?

196
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,341
He must be busy after the transfer.

197
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,218
I have not even seen him yet, sire.

198
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,764
Everyone says that your adopted sibling
has the potential to do great things.

199
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,017
That is actually what worries me.

200
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,645
What if he attracts attention--

201
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,355
It has been 15 years already.

202
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,109
Surely, no one would recognize
that he is Im Gang's son.

203
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,989
But his presence has
also piqued your interest.

204
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,492
I must never neglect
the son of my father's loyal subject

205
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
who served him faithfully until the end.

206
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,791
Besides, is he not
your younger brother now?

207
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,922
That was delicious.

208
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,596
Check!

209
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,014
It is your turn now.

210
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,641
If I win,

211
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,935
please attend tomorrow's council meeting.

212
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,273
I have earned another reason
not to attend the council meeting.

213
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,317
Do not let down your guard.

214
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,152
I will protect my king

215
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,988
to the very end.

216
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,084
I heard he had a fever all night.

217
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,088
But he is playing janggi
with the royal advisor.

218
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,884
He is at it again.
Did you not know he was feigning illness?

219
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,052
His Majesty is one thing.

220
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,804
But the royal advisor gets
to coast comfortably

221
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,890
all because he was
His Majesty's childhood shadow.

222
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,016
CHILDHOOD SHADOW: CHILD CHOSEN

223
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,601
TO AID
CROWN PRINCE'S SOCIAL SKILLS

224
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:39,021
You work hard day and night
on state affairs, Left Councilor.

225
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,106
How could His Majesty be this way?

226
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,699
Your Majesty's chariot is in danger.

227
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,748
Please command the royal advisor
to take back his last move, sire.

228
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,881
Left Councilor, what brings you here?

229
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,010
I came to see Your Majesty,
hearing you could not sleep last night.

230
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,348
I started feeling better this morning.

231
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,978
Are you troubled
by the three-month-long drought?

232
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,884
But how is the lack of rain
Your Majesty's fault?

233
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,388
It is all due to my lack of virtue.

234
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,932
Since Your Majesty was young,

235
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,186
you have often suffered
from fevers when your heart was heavy.

236
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,523
Please do not let the weight
of state affairs burden you too much.

237
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,445
The court officials and I are here
to always assist you, sire.

238
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,866
Thank you, Left Councilor.

239
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,122
However, I am relieved that His Majesty
has the royal advisor by his side.

240
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,875
Take good care of him
so he does not experience any discomfort.

241
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,127
Yes, Left Councilor.

242
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,462
I will do my best.

243
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,465
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

244
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,924
Very well.

245
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,648
It was said,
a loyal subject does not serve two kings,

246
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:51,195
and a virtuous woman does not serve
two husbands.

247
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,615
Lady Yoon from Suncheon,
after her husband passed away,

248
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,285
lived in a straw hut
by her husband's grave for seven years.

249
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,411
I am not scared.

250
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,246
I am not scared.

251
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,665
I am actually scared.

252
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,125
I am not scared.

253
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,043
I am scared.

254
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,294
No, I am not.

255
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,213
But I am!

256
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,964
What was that?

257
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,802
Lady Ko from Dayang

258
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,762
fasted for ten days

259
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,807
and followed her husband to the afterlife.

260
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,351
Just

261
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,186
one spoonful…

262
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,114
Lady Kwak from Haeju,

263
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,077
overcome by her grief
of losing her husband,

264
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,287
threw herself off a cliff.

265
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,052
No way. I am not doing this.

266
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,554
A virtuous woman…

267
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,763
-Jump now!
-Follow after your husband.

268
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,056
-Jump!
-Die now!

269
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,448
So then,

270
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,743
since you were in the arms of another man…

271
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,124
both of your arms will be sliced off,

272
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,626
and both of your eyes

273
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,754
will be gouged out.

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,969
VIRTUOUS WOMAN:
A WOMAN WHO WOULD EVEN DIE

275
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,139
TO STAY FAITHFUL TO HER HUSBAND

276
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,184
Oh, my arms…

277
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,021
I really could not feel my arms.

278
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,356
Was it your arms this time?

279
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,026
It was my eyes as well.

280
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,489
What would make you so anxious
for you to be having nightmares?

281
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,158
I am not anxious.

282
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,912
Yeon-seon.

283
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,624
This is definitely not about me.

284
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:13,378
But, this one widow was embraced
by a man purely by accident.

285
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,422
No, she was pushed into his arms.

286
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,465
Did she die?

287
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,133
That is right.

288
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,845
In most stories, the woman is overcome
by shame and dies in the end.

289
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,431
Or she cuts out the part the man touched.

290
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,349
It is either that

291
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,226
or die by fasting.

292
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,644
So, who is this widow, my lady?

293
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,439
Oh, it is just someone I know.

294
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,732
She is a friend of a friend.

295
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:39,780
If the widow who I know does not finish
the transcribing by today…

296
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,739
She will die.

297
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,119
Why is transcribing so difficult for me?

298
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,664
How could a brush be heavier than a sword?

299
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,083
But you are good at martial arts.

300
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,502
That is right.

301
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,048
My older brother told me this
when he taught me how to fight.

302
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,842
"How could a pretty girl
like you have such a talent?"

303
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,805
"It is quite a shame
I cannot let the world know about it."

304
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:11,270
And I am quite worried
that the whole world might find out.

305
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,813
How much more do I have left?

306
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,116
I knew this would happen,
so I did some too.

307
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,289
Yeon-seon…

308
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,874
You have ink on your cheek.

309
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,130
I will only ask for two yang this time.

310
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,842
-Two yang?
-You know that's a good deal.

311
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,594
You said you wanted to buy
a decent house in Hanyang.

312
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,722
Have you not already saved enough for it?

313
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,851
I still have a long way to go.

314
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:59,735
Oh, right! As Bongmal said earlier,
Lady Yoo is seeing her in-laws today.

315
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,986
Is that right?

316
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,448
Does that mean she has left the house?

317
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,996
If only your esteemed family was granted
the virtuous woman's gate,

318
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,583
it would be
the ultimate symbol of prestige

319
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,501
for the most perfect family in Joseon.

320
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,130
I cannot believe the interior minister's
daughter-in-law might get it.

321
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,841
Pardon?

322
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,135
What are you talking about?

323
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,932
It has become impossible for an average
chaste widow to receive it nowadays.

324
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,643
Oh, I am sure.

325
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,398
Even his daughter-in-law is being
talked about due to her ties

326
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:43,361
with the queen dowager's niece,
the finance minister's wife.

327
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,489
The virtuous woman's gate was believed

328
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,866
to be bestowed by the heavens
since the old days.

329
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,576
You are absolutely right!

330
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,496
One cannot receive
such an honor based on connections.

331
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:57,084
I do not mean to be boastful,
but it has been 100 days

332
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,796
since our eldest has left the shrine
while only eating one meal each day.

333
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,131
Sincerity might not even be enough.

334
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,510
Why would one use connections
to receive the virtuous woman's gate?

335
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,888
I pity
the interior minister's daughter-in-law.

336
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,974
Oh, you are absolutely right!

337
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:21,191
Look at you, snooping into the kitchen
in broad daylight!

338
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,696
Why on earth do I run
into my sister-in-law so often?

339
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,407
I just wanted to sneak out some sweets.

340
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,038
This is why I keep saying
that you seem so uneducated.

341
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,666
You cannot even skip one meal
and snoop around the kitchen.

342
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,085
One meal a day at the shrine for 100 days?

343
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,837
I am well-mannered.

344
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,588
Do not tarnish the family name!

345
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,340
Do not be upset
when she talks down to you.

346
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,634
I must be generous.

347
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,011
How could you go around with your head up?

348
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,681
I am so hungry.

349
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,307
I cannot stand you.

350
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,901
When my brother died,
you should have just died too!

351
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,278
You are so frustrating!

352
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,798
Lady Cho!

353
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,053
How have you been?

354
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,638
Hello, Kkon-nim.

355
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,266
I have been worried about you
for the last few days.

356
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,727
You have not had any trouble, have you?

357
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,688
I think my father has come to his senses.

358
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:46,610
He took the house deed to gamble
but brought it back and left it at home.

359
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,153
Is that right?

360
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,157
That is a relief.

361
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,083
Dried persimmons?

362
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,627
Thank you.

363
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,255
Lady Cho,
you are the prettiest when you smile.

364
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,467
I will get going then.

365
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,718
Take care.

366
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,970
I will head out now.

367
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,862
You fool!

368
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,740
-Who has turned my inn upside down?
-I apologize.

369
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,951
A masked man appeared out of nowhere.

370
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,202
A mask?

371
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,955
What did you do
while he made a mess of this place?

372
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,832
-He was so fast.
-So, you let him escape?

373
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,668
Could he be…

374
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,922
the same person from seven years ago?

375
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,799
I am not sure, sir.

376
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,759
Are you ever sure of anything?

377
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,303
There was a sharper
among the tujeon gamblers.

378
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,390
A Capital Guard superintendent was there
in disguise to catch him.

379
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,518
Do you know how I got here?

380
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,187
How could you let a swindler
and a superintendent be involved?

381
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,439
What if the rumors reach the higher-ups?

382
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,650
Are you trying to ruin all my hard work?

383
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,443
Please forgive me, sir!

384
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,577
A mere superintendent dares
to disrupt my inn?

385
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,511
A skilled martial artist…

386
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,680
What are you doing?

387
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,767
…who is a woman.

388
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:01,328
As expected, he tries to show weakness
at the last moment!

389
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,164
That is the virtue of humility!

390
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,832
How amazing!

391
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,296
I got my hopes up for nothing.

392
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,613
Welcome back, my lord.

393
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,408
I have been busy all day
and had to leave work late.

394
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,786
Welcome home, Father.

395
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,871
Father.

396
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,627
Earlier today, the in-laws
allowed Jae-i to come home

397
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,547
so she can rest here for a few days
as she is feeling under the weather.

398
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,929
You are a married woman.
Why do you visit us every other week?

399
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,557
You can spend the night here,

400
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,518
but return to your in-laws
when the sun rises.

401
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,269
Yes, Father.

402
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,945
Did you hurt yourself?

403
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,240
I was returning
from the shrine this morning…

404
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,659
-I apologize.
-How are you so careless?

405
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,913
Be careful so it does not get infected.

406
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,833
You must be tired. Go inside and rest.

407
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,126
Yes, Father.

408
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,003
Let us go, my lady.

409
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,229
How could you tell your child to go back

410
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,732
when she came home
to rest for a few days?

411
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:58,236
I would also like her
to stay here for a few days,

412
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,782
but Yeo-hwa has no place to call home,
so we must be considerate of her.

413
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,911
Would she not feel saddened
if Jae-i visits us too often?

414
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,166
Must I be considerate
when she just sits around all day?

415
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,044
All she must do is mourn her late husband.

416
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,382
All I ask is that you take
a little more care toward her.

417
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,551
She is all alone and must be lonely.

418
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,888
Let her get some fresh air
outside the house once in a while.

419
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,348
That is unacceptable.
She is a widow in mourning.

420
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,770
That will only make people start
to talk behind her back.

421
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:37,192
What is there to worry about
when you are teaching her so well?

422
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,791
THE MEMORIAL TABLET

423
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,418
OF SEOK JI-SEONG'S LATE SON
AND YEO-HWA'S HUSBAND

424
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,802
Come to think of it,
I have not had any food today.

425
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,231
3 YEARS AGO

426
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,899
Did you embroider this?

427
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,069
I thought you looked
like those pink flowers

428
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,195
because they looked like you.

429
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,241
What lovely carnations.

430
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,829
They grow around rocks,
and their stems look like bamboo.

431
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,081
I have seen them a long time ago.

432
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,416
I know a place where they grow in bunches.

433
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,835
Would you like to see them?

434
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,587
I would love to,

435
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,382
but I cannot go outside.

436
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,969
But the door is wide open.

437
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,137
You are right.

438
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,722
But I am not allowed

439
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,267
to leave the house.

440
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,311
Then, I will embroider
every handkerchief I give you

441
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,688
with flowers each time.

442
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,374
They say that a married couple must
share everything.

443
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,423
My dear husband, whom I've never even met.

444
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,968
Apparently, I look like pink carnations.

445
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,094
Did you know that?

446
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,555
Lady Jae-i visited today.

447
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,392
She told me I should have followed
you to the afterlife

448
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,935
and killed me with her words.

449
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,023
I suppose she said that
because she misses you.

450
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,032
I will accept it as her mourning heart
and do my best to endure it.

451
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,080
I hope you like it, my dear husband.

452
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,222
MYEONGDO INN:
A 200-YEAR-OLD ESTABLISHMENT

453
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,140
LIKE MODERN LUXURY GOODS STORES

454
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,559
Distinguished guests are visiting
us today.

455
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,186
Everything must be perfect.

456
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,520
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

457
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,887
Attend the Peony Society meeting?

458
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,640
That is right.

459
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,269
You should also get
some fresh air once in a while.

460
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,064
I think that today's meeting

461
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,817
will require your presence, Yeo-hwa.

462
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,819
Really?

463
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,953
How long has it been
since I've left the house during daylight?

464
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,124
How do they style
a lady's veil these days?

465
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,794
Should I wear it tightly?

466
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,046
Open faced?

467
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,590
The narrow slit?

468
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,968
Does it really matter now?

469
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,692
Lady Cho!

470
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,818
Yeon-seon!

471
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,195
What is going on? You are scaring me.

472
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,948
Did Lady Yoo scold you?

473
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,576
Mother is taking me
to the Peony Society meeting.

474
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,785
She is?

475
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,704
I am going out in daylight.

476
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,748
It has been at least six months.

477
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,041
Are you that excited?

478
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,167
Of course I am.

479
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,753
The night is so lonely and quiet
when everyone is asleep.

480
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,506
But in daylight, Unjong Street will be
bustling with people.

481
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,926
In that case,
have some snacks for the road.

482
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,308
These are tea cakes.

483
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,226
I thought you might get hungry.

484
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,394
Thank you.

485
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,275
Lady Cho, please come out
if you are ready!

486
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,443
I will be right out.

487
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,280
I will be on my way.

488
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,998
THE GREATER THE NATION,
THE SAFER THE CITIZENS

489
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,795
You left the inn in a total mess.

490
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,339
How could the Capital Guard do this to me?

491
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,550
On top of that, I have lost
my precious golden toad.

492
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,885
A golden toad!

493
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,137
How will you make up for it?

494
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,640
Did you look for it at the inn?

495
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,226
What? You want me to find it?

496
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,811
You caused all this trouble.

497
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,938
Are you telling me to pick up after you?

498
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,900
He is a very lonely man.

499
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,402
Just get him
another one that looks similar.

500
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,614
Why do we have to buy him a golden toad?

501
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,992
If we do not wrap this up quickly,

502
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,036
we will never hear the end of it.

503
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,039
In that case,

504
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,500
you could deal with Minister Yeom.

505
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,752
It is this way, sir.

506
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,216
Dried persimmons! Persimmons for sale.

507
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,385
Come and get some lovely dried persimmons!

508
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,556
What are those?

509
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,559
These are
Kkon-nim's famous dried persimmons, sir.

510
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,144
Dried persimmons?

511
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,646
They look delicious.

512
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,818
Kkon-nim's famous dried persimmons?

513
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,361
What a pretty name.

514
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,488
I will take one.

515
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,243
Thank you, sir!

516
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,372
What about mine, sir?

517
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,292
Sir!

518
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,631
Make way!

519
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,049
Palanquin. Coming through!

520
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,513
Dried persimmons!

521
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,641
Dried persimmons, as pretty as flowers!

522
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,643
Dried persimmons!

523
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,938
-Kkon-nim's famous dried persimmons!
-Oh, it is Kkon-nim.

524
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,982
-How much are they?
-Would you like two?

525
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,067
Thank you, sir!

526
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,828
-Catch that chicken!
-Grab it, will you?

527
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,457
HWAYEON: A 200-YEAR-OLD
MERCHANT GUILD

528
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,584
RUN BY HEAD GUILDMASTER
JANG SO-UN

529
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,267
They must not be open for business today.

530
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,269
What brings you here, sirs?

531
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,901
You are the new superintendent.

532
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,695
I heard that you transferred
to Hanyang recently.

533
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,406
I am Head Guildmaster Jang So-un.

534
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,826
I am Capital Guard
Superintendent Park Su-ho.

535
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,496
I am looking for something specific

536
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,040
but I guess you are not open today.

537
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,751
If you tell me what you are looking for,

538
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,879
I will send it
to your office at a later date.

539
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,715
We are hosting the Peony Society
at Myeongdo Inn today.

540
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,092
The Peony Society?

541
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,718
How have you been, Head Guildmaster?

542
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,971
Welcome, my lady.

543
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,181
Is this the flower vase you mentioned?

544
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,432
Yes, it is.

545
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,904
MYEONGDO INN

546
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,409
Welcome, my lady.

547
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,287
How have you been, Head Guildmaster?

548
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,706
It has been a while, Lady Yoo.

549
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,250
-Good to see you.
-And you, also.

550
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,793
You look very youthful today.

551
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,253
You are very kind.

552
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,214
But no one can fight against time.

553
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,135
You brought your daughter-in-law.

554
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,761
What is the special occasion today?

555
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,273
This is the new superintendent
who recently transferred

556
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,066
to the Capital Guard.

557
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,485
I am Capital Guard
Superintendent Park Su-ho.

558
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,826
You are the adopted son
of the chief scholar.

559
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,373
Well then.

560
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,250
It was nice to meet you.

561
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,380
Shall we head in now?

562
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,840
We have prepared some snacks.

563
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,883
Please come in.

564
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,760
After you, my lady.

565
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,483
It might be unfamiliar to you, sir.

566
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,236
The Peony Society is a gathering
of the upper-hall officials' wives

567
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,739
who hold influence
over women from noble families.

568
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,656
UPPER-HALL OFFICIALS:

569
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
OFFICIALS OF SENIOR 3RD RANK
AND ABOVE

570
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,666
This is lovely.

571
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,679
This way, please.

572
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,608
-How have you been?
-Very well.

573
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,572
I shall leave you ladies to it.

574
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,412
Today is a special day

575
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,997
because Lady Yoo,
the left state councilor's wife,

576
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,625
has brought her eldest daughter-in-law.

577
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,253
Introduce yourself, Yeo-hwa.

578
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,174
It is a pleasure to meet you all.

579
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,765
The child has many shortcomings,
but please look upon her kindly.

580
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,602
Oh, please, Lady Yoo.

581
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,106
You must have forgotten
what that word means.

582
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,067
She is so well-mannered and tidy.

583
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,986
What shortcomings do you mean?

584
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:02,793
You must have never seen someone
who is well-mannered and tidy, my lady.

585
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:07,298
Surely, having clean garments is
such a fundamental quality.

586
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,260
How could a widow's garments have
such dirty sleeves?

587
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,312
My second daughter-in-law has worn
her mourning garment for five years.

588
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:25,107
Yet, I have never seen
a single speck of dust on her garments.

589
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,902
I have heard many great things
about your second daughter-in-law.

590
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,571
You should invite her sometime.

591
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,285
It would only be a matter of time
before a widow would sin

592
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,786
with her mind and her gaze.

593
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,168
When one's mind is set in one place,

594
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,546
one does not have time
to be distracted by such trivial things.

595
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:53,177
What you keep in your heart is your will,
and what you say out loud are your words,

596
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,138
so we merely try to be cautious with them.

597
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,565
I miss being out
in the quiet night at Unjong Street.

598
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,902
The Peony Society?

599
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,072
I have only heard about them,
but they were quite impressive.

600
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,282
We have seen them with our own eyes.

601
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,535
You were in Jeolla Province with me.

602
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,620
How do you know about them?

603
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,206
Everyone in Hanyang knows
about the Peony Society.

604
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,500
You did not know
because you were uninterested.

605
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,086
The lady who dropped those cakes

606
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,547
must have been
the left councilor's daughter-in-law.

607
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,840
The left councilor's daughter-in-law?

608
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,927
Yes, I hear that she is
beautiful inside and out.

609
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,846
She is known for being elegant and classy.

610
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,354
A classy woman, you say?

611
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,744
Did you hear that he has taken
a courtesan as his concubine?

612
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,912
Do not get me started.

613
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,748
The finance minister's wife paid her off
to be sent away.

614
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,916
But word travels fast.

615
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,671
I would not put it past her to claim
a bunch of boys to be his sons.

616
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,799
She is a living example of a proper lady.

617
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,093
It must have been difficult to endure it.

618
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,639
Do you not think it would be better
to live as a widow instead?

619
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,642
If your husband is that messed up…

620
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,606
Would you not agree?

621
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,325
Would a woman's life be any different,
whether she is a widow or not?

622
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,079
Worldly circumstances are
not determined by an individual.

623
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,293
I just hope I can
further discipline my mind

624
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,962
so I do not become a burden to my family.

625
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,927
The finance minister's wife is here.

626
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,265
It is good to have you.

627
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,686
How have you been?

628
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,397
I am sorry for being late.

629
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,024
Please have a seat.

630
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:20,157
Now, what kind of
interesting conversations have I missed?

631
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,120
You have gotten even more beautiful
since we last saw you.

632
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:30,125
-She has always been beautiful.
-How could you always look so beautiful?

633
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,965
This is it, sir.

634
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,175
How nice!

635
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,888
I can feel the artist's spirit.

636
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,972
Imported goods are the best.

637
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,141
Look, it is on another level!

638
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,726
These are not imported goods.

639
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,187
They were made by artisans in Cheongsong.

640
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,149
People all the way from Qing are lining up
to buy this white porcelain.

641
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,318
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

642
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,155
I could tell there was
something different about these.

643
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,699
I paid a lot of money
and went through so much

644
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,868
to get my hands
on these white porcelain pots.

645
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,248
The Pil Merchant Guild
never ceases to amaze.

646
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,542
This is why I like you.

647
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,585
Please have a seat.

648
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,718
You were saying

649
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,305
that you want me to grant you
the sea passage to Qing again?

650
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:30,853
Yes, an item is to be shipped
to Beijing via Cheonjin in three days.

651
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,318
All it will take for me is
to stamp my seal of approval.

652
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,199
However,

653
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,745
you will have to give me
a bountiful cut this time as well.

654
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,122
Of course, sir.

655
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,960
I will also send this
to your home tomorrow.

656
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,722
This is great.

657
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,973
From what I hear,

658
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:13,145
your eldest daughter-in-law is
extremely well-skilled at drawing orchids.

659
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,105
What? Who?

660
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,023
Me?

661
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,322
She is only as good as everyone else.

662
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,868
I do not mean
to brag about my daughter-in-law,

663
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,787
but each leaf she draws is
sturdy and healthy,

664
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,874
and the flowers seem
to give off a fragrance.

665
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,210
It is quite dignified.

666
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,216
I would like to see your daughter-in-law's
orchid-drawing skills

667
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,593
since you are so proud of them.

668
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,552
No way…

669
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,721
It could not be.

670
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:55,771
If you insist, it would not be humble
not to show you her abilities.

671
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,858
Is that not right, Yeo-hwa?

672
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,486
But… Mother…

673
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,630
I hope she does not try to draw anything.

674
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,369
Such grace and elegance!

675
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:54,997
I never had a doubt.

676
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,167
-No wonder she was so proud.
-How could she be so skilled?

677
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,782
She smudged it.

678
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,411
It seems to be a bit abstract.

679
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,246
What was that?

680
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,331
Are those orchids?

681
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,007
Let us see what she does.

682
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,860
I apologize!

683
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,695
I made a mistake, and my hand slipped!

684
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,116
Oh, my, what should we do?

685
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,242
Her clothes…

686
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,747
I apologize, my lady.

687
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,418
I have prepared a small gift as a token

688
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,504
of my apology
for today's unpleasant incident.

689
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,548
Be careful so this does not happen again.

690
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,509
Yes, I will.

691
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,346
Please forgive me, Lady Yoo.

692
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,019
I apologize for the lack
of a proper change of garments.

693
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,689
We only have
colorful garments at our guild.

694
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,109
She can only wear plain white anyway.

695
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,318
Do not worry about it.

696
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:56,034
I will make sure to be prepared
when you visit again.

697
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,787
I will see you next time.

698
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,500
I will be leaving now.

699
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,085
-That looks great.
-Thank you.

700
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,753
Let us go.

701
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,928
I knew it.

702
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,514
How could she know
how to draw The Four Gentlemen?

703
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,559
It was strange that she was
only good at drawing orchids.

704
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,852
That is enough.

705
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,312
I wonder if she is hiding
something else from us.

706
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,522
Should I go and search?

707
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,773
What should we do?

708
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,317
Let me first think
about what they could find--

709
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:34,698
Well, I am sure there is not much else
other than embroidery and transcribing.

710
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,955
What could a widow do
when she cannot even jump over the fence?

711
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:42,998
Be quiet.

712
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,249
I feel nauseous.

713
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,210
I can probably jump much better than you.

714
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,630
Now is not the time
to say something like that, my lady.

715
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,633
Mom, this is all because you are too soft.

716
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,386
You should have cut her off
when we saw her keeping

717
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,637
that baseless girl by her side.

718
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,391
How dare she do such a thing?

719
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,144
Pretending to be noble
and drawing orchids?

720
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,104
Mom, you should not tolerate that.

721
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,815
I am sorry.

722
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,275
This is because of me.

723
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,485
No, my lady.

724
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,196
It is my fault
for being so good at drawing orchids.

725
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,282
That is far too heavy.

726
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,494
I must do something.

727
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,999
Mother, I deserve to be punished
for turning you into a laughingstock.

728
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:29,836
Instructions for Women says
even if the in-laws beat or scold you,

729
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,130
it should be
gladly accepted wholeheartedly.

730
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,008
As much as you love me,
I shall fast for five… no.

731
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:40,096
I shall fast for ten days
and offer my devotion at the shrine.

732
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,389
Do not do that, my lady.

733
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,391
That could really kill you!

734
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,101
Anything less will not do.

735
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,394
She is really angry this time.

736
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,819
Do not come out from the shrine
until I give you my order.

737
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,570
Yes, Mother.

738
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,460
That must have been heavy.

739
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,296
-Goodness…
-I am all right, my lady.

740
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,466
But are you really going to fast?

741
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,843
I must.

742
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,428
Oh, my legs.

743
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,266
Let us go.

744
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,770
I cannot feel my legs. Where are my legs?

745
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,665
You are late, sir.

746
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,125
I had to work late.

747
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,669
You must be tired.
Please go inside and rest.

748
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,296
Thank you.

749
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,799
What did you learn at school today?

750
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,398
Father.

751
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,191
I have returned.

752
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,990
Sir, it is me, Bi-chan.

753
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,661
What are you doing here?

754
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,121
What do you mean, sir?

755
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:31,124
I was running around town
doing the things you had asked me to do.

756
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:35,503
But I saw this tall and handsome creature
and realized it was you,

757
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:36,963
so here I am.

758
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,510
By the way, whose house is this?

759
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,765
So, what have you found out?

760
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,310
The rumors about that masked man.

761
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,312
They were quite remarkable.

762
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,234
On a night
when the moon is shining brightly!

763
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,820
Someone wearing a mask appears
out of nowhere…

764
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,324
Help us!

765
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,952
Delivering rice to a household
famished for three days!

766
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:07,994
Who is there?

767
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,164
-This is rice!
-Oh, yes!

768
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,167
-We can eat now!
-Thank you!

769
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,046
Giving medicine to a slave who was beaten
or taking him to a doctor.

770
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,465
He is like the wind, faster than light,

771
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:23,593
and runs like a flying squirrel
across the rooftops.

772
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,733
He is like a legendary altruist.

773
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,110
A legendary altruist?

774
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,987
That is a nickname I have given him.

775
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,365
When the people are in dire straits
and left hopeless,

776
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,325
he extends his warm hands to help.

777
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,160
The legendary altruist!

778
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,245
So, who is he?

779
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,291
They say no one has ever seen who he is.

780
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,877
"Do not let the left hand know
what the right is doing."

781
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,506
No one has seen his real identity?

782
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,536
Welcome back.

783
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,251
Do you even recognize
my footsteps now, Lady Jang?

784
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,919
It is not just your footsteps.

785
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:44,924
I can read the tone of your voice
as well as the nerves in your gaze.

786
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,803
I even know that you would have been
scolded by Lady Yoo today.

787
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,474
I have been waiting for you.

788
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,517
I am sorry.

789
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,102
I put you in a difficult spot.

790
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,565
That was nothing for a merchant
who deals with noblewomen.

791
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,484
You need not worry.

792
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:08,073
But I cannot allow you
to lose your hard-earned cash.

793
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,742
Please deduct the cost
of the hairpins from my cut.

794
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,204
I was planning on deducting it
from what I owe you this month anyway.

795
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,123
Goodness, it was not long ago

796
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,168
since you offered me the entire guild
for saving your life.

797
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,961
You definitely have a knack for business.

798
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,799
I run a business here.
Is that not expected of me?

799
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,469
However,

800
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,971
if it is your wish, my lady,

801
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,517
I can hand over
my guild to you at any time.

802
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,893
I do not want that.

803
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,605
But you cannot live forever
getting drenched by the night's dew.

804
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,568
Who can I live as if I left my home?

805
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,906
Would I have a face?

806
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,992
Would I even have a name?

807
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,577
Lady Cho…

808
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,788
Cho Yeo-hwa,
the left councilor's daughter-in-law,

809
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,374
will just be another dead person.

810
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,836
Would not it be a good idea
to go far away and start a new life?

811
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,420
And what if

812
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,550
my brother comes to look for me?

813
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,802
I apologize.

814
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,471
I could not even find your brother,

815
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,431
and I spoke such nonsense.

816
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,768
That is not your fault, Lady Jang.

817
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,397
I am sure I will find him someday.

818
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,817
There is no news of his death,
so I am sure

819
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,611
that he is alive.

820
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,087
RENTAL BOOKSTORE:
AN ESTABLISHMENT

821
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,173
THAT COPIES
AND RENTS BOOKS FOR A FEE

822
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,664
THE BIOGRAPHY OF HONG GIL-DONG

823
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,307
Are you hurt?

824
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,311
I am fine. Please do not worry.

825
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,147
I cannot do that.
Since you fell because of me,

826
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,440
I should take you to a doctor…

827
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,942
If you care so much,

828
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,028
I would rather take
the money for the doctor.

829
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,239
What?

830
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,783
That is why I said it is okay.

831
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,868
I am fine, so please go on.

832
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,329
Wait… What in the world?

833
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,717
"I Woke Up

834
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:18,346
as the Royal Advisor's Wife"?

835
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,487
What should I do? All has been wasted.

836
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,947
-Excuse me, Mister.
-Yes?

837
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,365
Where is Kkon-nim?

838
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,244
You would never believe what happened.

839
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,454
Some people just came and took her

840
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,457
for the price
of her father's gambling debt.

841
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,001
What?

842
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,049
Lady Cho!

843
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,011
My lady!

844
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,929
There is a big problem!

845
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:00,972
What is the matter?

846
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,640
Kkon-nim was taken away
by debt collectors!

847
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,183
What?

848
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,936
PIL INN

849
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,272
Let us see.

850
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,733
-Oh, no!
-There it is!

851
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,359
-That does not count.
-Did you see that hand?

852
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,570
-I cannot accept this!
-What an amazing draw!

853
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,080
Will you please excuse us?

854
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,835
It has been a while.

855
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,378
Have a seat.

856
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,130
Yes, Brother.

857
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,018
Your residence?

858
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,646
Where are you staying these days?

859
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,523
I will be staying
at the Capital Guard for now.

860
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,610
So, what are you doing here?

861
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,490
-I went to your house and was told you--
-That is not what I meant.

862
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,076
You were eager to go to Jeolla Province.

863
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,370
Why did you return to Hanyang?

864
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,290
I was in Jeolla Province for too long--

865
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,750
You should keep your head down.

866
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,337
The fact that you are the talk of others

867
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,923
can cause problems for the family.

868
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:20,927
Yes, Brother.

869
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,889
How have you been, Brother?

870
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,975
As you can see,

871
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,602
I have been very well.

872
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,398
Is there anything more to say?

873
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,402
No.

874
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,780
I am going to drink some more.

875
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,199
You should go.

876
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,326
I will.

877
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,364
Father…

878
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,199
Mother…

879
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,996
Father.

880
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,607
Girls who are sold to repay gambling debts
are made to work as servants at an inn

881
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,817
until they're sold
as a nobleman's concubine

882
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,527
or handed over to brothels.

883
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,197
That will not do.

884
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,782
I must go to Pil Inn.

885
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,951
PIL INN

886
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,715
Come and get some lovely dried persimmons!

887
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,092
These are
Kkon-nim's famous dried persimmons, sir.

888
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,444
Are you not Kkon-nim?

889
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,363
Sir…

890
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,282
What are you doing here?

891
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,829
Come with me for a second.

892
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,249
You cannot do this, sir!

893
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,876
I have something to tell you, so come.

894
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,464
Come with me.

895
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,218
What is going on?

896
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,970
Has she already been sold to him?

897
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,056
Let go of her hand.

898
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,559
I will buy the girl from you.

899
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,440
Who are you?

900
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,277
I do not know how much you paid for her,

901
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,654
but sell her on to me.

902
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,905
Wait a minute.

903
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,451
Have we not met before?

904
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,874
Where would we have ever…

905
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,336
What are you doing?

906
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:11,157
12 YEARS AGO,
3RD YEAR AS A WIDOW

907
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,924
That is Mother's favorite handkerchief.

908
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,676
I cannot just leave it hanging there.

909
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,859
I heard a man was chasing after you.

910
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,737
Was it someone you knew?

911
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,198
Never have I once been caught
over all these years.

912
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,741
And I plan to keep it that way.

913
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:40,621
The superintendent was curious
about the person who brought the child.

914
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:44,417
If I get the chance,
I would like to see them in person.

915
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,293
Do you know Kang Pil-jik well?

916
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:51,215
He is in all kinds of dirty business,
so I am sure you have seen him somewhere.

917
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,299
Who was it? Tell me!

918
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,969
Who dared to touch the property
of the nation's finance minister?

919
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,805
By any chance,
was he wearing a black mask?

920
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,683
Is this also the woman's doing?

921
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:05,771
