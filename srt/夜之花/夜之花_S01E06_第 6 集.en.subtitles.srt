1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,183
Lady Cho?

2
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,985
Yeo-hwa?

3
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,488
-Are you spending the night in there?
-You must hurry, my lady.

4
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,239
You must hurry!

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,122
Oh, no.

6
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,003
May I come in for a moment?

7
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
Oh, goodness!

8
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,308
What is the matter?

9
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,851
I apologize, Father.

10
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,561
There was a rat in the shrine.

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,313
I will relight the candle.

12
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,065
You must have been shocked.

13
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,025
Were you not hurt?

14
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,443
I am all right.

15
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,904
What brings you here at this hour?

16
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,658
I saw the light on in the shrine
and wanted to stop by briefly.

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,702
-Goodness, Father.
-Yeo-hwa!

18
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,579
I am all right.

19
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,957
I got dizzy for a moment.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,459
You have been sitting
in the shrine for too long.

21
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,504
How about we take a walk
and get some fresh air?

22
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,922
Yes, Father.

23
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,565
Are you not having a hard time?

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,567
I am all right.

25
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,778
How could I dare to complain?

26
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,198
You and Mother take good care of me,

27
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,242
so I am always grateful.

28
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,582
Thank you for thinking that way.

29
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,918
The weather may have got warmer,

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,338
but the floor still gets cold at night.

31
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,591
You should sleep comfortably in your room.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,178
I will always feel
remorseful toward you, Father.

33
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,974
You took me in when I had no family,

34
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,352
and you let me visit the temple
to pray for my brother.

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,691
When my brother returns one day,

36
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,987
it will all be
thanks to your goodwill, Father.

37
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,324
Do you still await your brother's return?

38
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,080
I hesitate to say this
as I do not wish to hurt you,

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,418
but how do you feel about moving on now?

40
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,087
It has already been 15 years.

41
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,257
I am sure

42
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,677
my brother is alive.

43
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,641
If something has happened to him,

44
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,601
I am sure I will hear about it,

45
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,020
whatever it may be.

46
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,358
I apologize, Father.

47
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,278
I have caused you discomfort
by needlessly talking about myself.

48
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,698
No.

49
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,953
I will not forget either
and find out what has happened to him.

50
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,759
Find the man named Cho Seong-hu

51
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,136
and get rid of him without a trace.

52
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:23,972
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,038
Superintendent Park!

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,001
Have you found anything out?

55
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,130
I checked all of the dispensaries
and the flower vendors on Unjong Street,

56
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,424
but I could not find the same flower.

57
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,883
I see.

58
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,305
Did the mouth of the corpse
really smell the same as those petals?

59
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,057
Yes, it was the same scent.

60
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,810
It was similar to the scent
of a wisteria tree flower.

61
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,440
Look, sir.

62
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,483
They are all dead.

63
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,032
Could this be…

64
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,868
This is poison.

65
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,538
But did they not say Minister Yeom died

66
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,498
from a blow to the head?

67
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,753
Now that we know this is poison,
we cannot rule it out as a cause of death.

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,047
Why was this deadly poison

69
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,467
inside of the wooden bar?

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,178
Then, that man named Yong-deok

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,056
really must have been innocent.

72
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,017
How could he have fed this
to Minister Yeom?

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,143
I told you.

74
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,854
This was a tale
that will move one to tears

75
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,733
about a man sacrificing himself
for the one he loves.

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,153
Was he not seen
meeting a lady in a mourning dress

77
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,405
at the town shrine?

78
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,532
I heard he fell in love with a widow.

79
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,077
That ring belongs to me.

80
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,996
Madam, please look at it closely.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,165
I doubt it was him.

82
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,417
Do you agree with me?

83
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,795
This is certainly love--

84
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
Bi-chan.

85
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,965
Find out when and how
Minister Yeom got the painting.

86
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,883
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,263
If that man is not the culprit…

88
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,683
then who could it be?

89
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
Was Lady Baek sent off well?

90
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,414
They said she refused to go.

91
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,708
-Why?
-Because of Yong-deok, the servant.

92
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,043
I was scolded by Mother,

93
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,087
lost sleep,
and was almost caught by Father.

94
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,840
I stayed up all night for her sake,
but now what?

95
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,801
You gave her a way to escape,
but she also wants to take her lover.

96
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,886
Her lover is at the police bureau,

97
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,514
so what on earth am I to do?

98
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,017
I am tired, Yeon-seon.

99
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,979
Please get some rest
until Lady Yoo summons you.

100
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
Lady Cho?

101
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,067
Lady Yoo summons you.

102
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,874
What do you plan on doing?

103
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,877
Pardon?

104
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,672
I heard Lady Baek is starving herself.

105
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,175
You cannot sit around and do nothing.

106
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,060
I thought of visiting Minister Yeom's wife
with some milk porridge.

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,687
Minister Yeom's wife?

108
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,442
"Good and bad deeds, no matter how small,
can always make an impact."

109
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,486
That was what you always told me.

110
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,988
Rather than dwell on personal gains,

111
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,991
it seems better to focus solely
on doing good deeds.

112
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,329
I wish to comfort the madam
who must feel sad due to her sudden loss.

113
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,333
It seems

114
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,253
I have not taught you in vain.

115
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,591
I will comfort her sincerely
and provide her with companionship.

116
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,516
I must visit Lady Baek after Madam Oh,

117
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,934
-so let us hurry.
-Yes, my lady.

118
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,862
Are all of these appeals to request

119
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,823
the immediate beheading of the servant
who killed Minister Yeom?

120
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,867
Since the founding of this nation,

121
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,871
has there ever been a case
of a court official killed by his servant?

122
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,041
If you do not sternly resolve this,

123
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,627
not only will the royal court
lose authority,

124
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,463
but the royal family may also face danger.

125
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,009
I heard it was a case
involving a small-time thief.

126
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,555
Surely, it would not bring danger
to the royal court and royal family.

127
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,849
A world where a child
disrespects their parents,

128
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,186
a subject disrespects their king,
and a servant disrespects their master.

129
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,189
Just what does Your Majesty fear,
if not even that?

130
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,194
I did not realize
this case was such a serious matter.

131
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,530
A chamhyeong is in order, as you said.

132
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,948
CHAMHYEONG: EXECUTION BY BEHEADING

133
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,201
However, must I not wait to sentence him?

134
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,122
Regardless of his social status,
I can only make my ruling

135
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,915
after he has had three trials.

136
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,626
Is Your Majesty referring
to the due process?

137
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,838
He is no different than a traitor, sire.

138
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,966
Yes, I suppose it will not be an issue.

139
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,968
It is only the beheading of a servant.

140
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,304
Do as you wish, Left Minister.

141
00:09:56,387 --> 00:10:00,391
Then, I will handle it as such, sire.

142
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
I do not deserve this.

143
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,361
Why would you trouble yourself
to bring me porridge?

144
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,864
I came because I was worried.

145
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,658
You must eat even if you have no appetite.

146
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,163
How could a sinner like me possibly eat

147
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,499
after letting my husband die before me?

148
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,209
I am grateful for the gesture,

149
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,879
but I do not wish to eat at the moment.

150
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,423
Then, please eat later on at least.

151
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,061
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN

152
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,356
Are you truly going
to guard the grave of your husband?

153
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,655
As there are many eyes on me, I must go.

154
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,449
But you have household affairs
and the Peony Society.

155
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,493
-If you go like this--
-Until now,

156
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,913
I have taken care of many things.

157
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,667
I am allowed to rest now, am I not?

158
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,127
Has it been difficult for you?

159
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,798
It was difficult,

160
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,592
sorrowful,

161
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,220
and also pitiful.

162
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,809
Despite that,

163
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,144
it was also occasionally fun.

164
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,564
May I dare to ask you a question?

165
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,983
You may.

166
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,780
Was the death of Minister Yeom

167
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,908
truly a misfortune to you, madam?

168
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,543
Please lower your voice.

169
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,877
What if someone hears you?

170
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,052
I always knew

171
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,932
that you were a straightforward person,

172
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,268
but I had no idea you would be

173
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,728
so direct about such a thing.

174
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,856
My apologies.

175
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,403
Should I consider this a misfortune,

176
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,239
or should I not?

177
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,953
What do you think, Lady Cho?

178
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,914
How could I dare to even think of it?

179
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,918
People talk about the two of us
as often as they eat sweet rice cakes.

180
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,962
Is that not true?

181
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,424
A widow who remains faithful
to her late husband

182
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,509
who she has never even met

183
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,389
and a madam who serves
her ill-tempered husband.

184
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,686
Who do you think is better off?

185
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,606
I will try

186
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,693
to live as myself as best as I can.

187
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,866
I wish that I had met you a little sooner.

188
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,329
I could have had you by my side all along.

189
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,790
I will visit you often from now on
and keep you company.

190
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,042
Do not come.

191
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
I will soon leave for my husband's grave,

192
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,051
so it will be difficult
to greet any guests.

193
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,345
According to custom,

194
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,681
that is the right thing to do.

195
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,684
Yes, madam.

196
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,121
You were so awkward just then, my lady.

197
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,374
I am aware.

198
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,763
I must go to Myeongdo Inn
after I visit Minister Yeom's home.

199
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,847
Myeongdo Inn? Why?

200
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,351
We must find solid evidence
that Yong-deok is not the culprit.

201
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,563
Evidence is not an accessory
you can buy at Myeongdo Inn.

202
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,648
Perhaps we may find proof
he did not do it.

203
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,899
Who are you talking to?

204
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,818
-Let us go.
-Yes, my lady.

205
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,280
I will go there,
so make sure to stay here.

206
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,408
Where, sir?

207
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,619
MYEONGDO INN

208
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,090
I will try to persuade her.

209
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,341
Where is she right now?

210
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,427
In the last room on the left.

211
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,847
If she is doing this because of her lover,

212
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,683
you should not mention
that he was arrested.

213
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,441
I heard he has already been sentenced
to be beheaded.

214
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,609
Already?

215
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,945
His crime of killing Minister Yeom
is very serious,

216
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,489
so he could be executed
as soon as tomorrow.

217
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,868
I do not think we can save him.

218
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,290
Yeon-seon,

219
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,334
buy the sticky rice cakes
that Mother likes.

220
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,752
Yes, my lady.

221
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,345
Why did you send her away?

222
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,847
Do you wish to tell me something?

223
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,933
It is not that.

224
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,226
The superintendent is coming here.

225
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,813
I wish to meet with him,
so please prepare a space for us.

226
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,399
Very well.

227
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,203
I offered you a path to a new life,

228
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,789
but I heard you have refused to go.

229
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,084
Do you know me?

230
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,920
No, I do not.

231
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,427
Then why did you save me?

232
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,764
I only help with small acts
that are within my ability,

233
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,100
so do not think too deeply about it.

234
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,436
First,

235
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,356
you must find a way to live.

236
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,236
Is running away

237
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,030
the answer to a better life?

238
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,035
Can hiding somewhere all alone
and barely surviving

239
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
be considered truly living?

240
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,874
Who would I live as if I left my home?

241
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,003
Would I have a face?

242
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,131
Would I even have a name?

243
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,719
I understand how you feel.

244
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,597
So, are you saying
you will give up on life?

245
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,891
I was meant to die anyway.

246
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,729
I deluded myself into thinking
I could live like everybody else

247
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,106
and continued to live
after letting my husband die.

248
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,568
I will gladly pay the price for my sins.

249
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,404
No one is really destined to die.

250
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,365
Just what sin did we commit
to deserve death?

251
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,367
It is not like we killed our husbands.

252
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,120
Are you also a widow?

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,669
So, what will you do?

254
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,552
I have a favor to ask.

255
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,224
If you fulfill my request,
I can die with no regrets.

256
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,186
At Minister Yeom's home,

257
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,480
there is a man named Yong-deok.

258
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,862
Please give him this ring.

259
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,410
My mother-in-law already knows everything,

260
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,497
so he may end up in danger too.

261
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,416
Please tell him

262
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,418
that I will live a good life.

263
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,836
Tell him that I hope

264
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,591
he lives happily for the rest of his life.

265
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,138
If you show him the ring,
he will understand.

266
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:27,981
Are you sure the ring
that Yong-deok had was Lord Yeom's?

267
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,359
How could you come here unannounced

268
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,822
and ask me such a ridiculous question?

269
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,201
I only ask to find solid evidence
that can prove he is the culprit.

270
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,619
So, please tell me.

271
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,540
The police bureau has confirmed

272
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,835
that he was the culprit, have they not?

273
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,090
I am but a mere woman.

274
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,634
How can I say anything to refute that?

275
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,722
How could a house servant

276
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,475
do such an awful thing to his master?

277
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:10,107
I am furious and devastated
about what has happened, Superintendent.

278
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,026
Can you not understand that?

279
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,363
My apologies.

280
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,115
Superintendent Park.

281
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,661
I trust that you will resolve this matter.

282
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,956
The soul of my poor husband

283
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:31,587
deserves at least a little bit of peace,
do you not agree?

284
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,922
I will do so.

285
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,392
One last thing.

286
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,355
Could you tell me
what Minister Yeom last ate

287
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,025
on the night of his passing?

288
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,737
For example,

289
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,781
he may have had a cup of tea before bed.

290
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,036
I am not sure.

291
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,747
It was the same as any other day.

292
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,041
My lord.

293
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
I have brought water to your bedside.

294
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,058
Who brought the water to him?

295
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,812
I brought it to him myself.

296
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,525
I see.

297
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,361
I shall visit again.

298
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,620
I will not be able to see you out.

299
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,509
RENTAL BOOKSTORE

300
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,808
THE CLOUD DREAM OF THE NINE

301
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,200
I was just wondering…

302
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,413
Did Yeon-seon come here today?

303
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,415
No, she has not come yet.

304
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,583
-I see.
-May I ask

305
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,752
why you are looking for her?

306
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,255
It is nothing.

307
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,887
I just wanted to ask her
to transcribe something for me.

308
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,163
Why did I hide just now?

309
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,720
MYEONGDO INN

310
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,517
You startled me.

311
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,519
Where is the squire?

312
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,645
Is he inside?

313
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,523
No, I came alone.

314
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,775
Really?

315
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,443
Did you truly come alone?

316
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,654
I cannot tell you.

317
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,281
So please be on your way.

318
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:52,370
Look me in the eyes when you talk.
I hate men who lie the most in this world.

319
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,716
Catch me if you want to hit me back!

320
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,760
Hey!

321
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,531
I see you often these days, sir.

322
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,074
Yes, well--

323
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:33,286
Some may think you frequent Myeongdo Inn
to meet with a newfound lover.

324
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,038
A lover?

325
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,456
What an awful thing to say.

326
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,041
It is untrue.

327
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,793
I was only joking.

328
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,670
You took my joke so seriously.

329
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,548
One might believe it to be true.

330
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,342
Head Guildmaster.

331
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,469
I am a superintendent
of the Capital Guard.

332
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,720
You are out of line.

333
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,180
My apologies.

334
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,685
Anyway, may I ask what brings you here?

335
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,855
I came to see that person.

336
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,648
-Your lover?
-Head Guildmaster!

337
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,401
Please come in.

338
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,287
What on earth brings you here?

339
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,167
It seems you did not expect
to see me here.

340
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,503
I spend all day inside Myeongdo Inn.

341
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,630
How can I know where you go
and what you do?

342
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,802
Let us go with that.

343
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,098
Please state your business.

344
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,520
I should not be asking someone
who was here all day,

345
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,690
but I truly hope you give me an answer.

346
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,443
Why is he being so scary?

347
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,196
Did he come to ask who I am?

348
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,032
I thought he wanted
to talk about the culprit.

349
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,659
By any chance…

350
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,748
Are you Yong-deok's lover?

351
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,918
No, he cannot possibly know who I am.

352
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,503
I believe you know a man named Yong-deok.

353
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,260
Did you know

354
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,848
that he has a lover?

355
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,976
Have you already found out
about everything?

356
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,773
That means--

357
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,567
He was just trying to protect his lover.
He is not the perpetrator.

358
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,069
I can attest to that.

359
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,655
This is sacrilege!

360
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,907
How could you?

361
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,076
How could you do such a thing?

362
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,161
Although it does go against the customs,

363
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:42,165
must you react like this
as if a deadly sin has been committed?

364
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,834
You should have just worn your mask
even if it goes against customs.

365
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,044
Why the town shrine?

366
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,296
It was at the water mill.

367
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,510
What did you say?

368
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,470
The water mill?

369
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,139
I saw them together at the water mill,

370
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,683
not the town shrine.

371
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,686
"Them"?

372
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,772
On the night we saved the children,

373
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,732
I saw that man with his lover.

374
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,284
His lover cannot reveal her identity
due to personal reasons.

375
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,243
That is a relief.

376
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,581
Why would that be a relief to you?

377
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,670
I believe my business here is done,
so I shall go now.

378
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,172
You cannot just leave like this.

379
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,556
Instead of the lover
who cannot reveal her identity,

380
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,561
will you take off your mask
and stand as his witness?

381
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,985
As of this moment,
there is nothing you can do.

382
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,778
If the real culprit is still at large,

383
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,323
I will investigate this case
and find out who did this.

384
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,286
If you cannot find the true killer,

385
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,997
must the servant die a wrongful death?

386
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,876
Can you find the real culprit by tonight?

387
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,101
This is sacrilege!

388
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,311
How could you?

389
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,980
How could you do such a thing?

390
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,525
This is sacrilege…

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,578
Here is your monthly share.

392
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,336
Even while you are in mourning,
you do not forget the collection date.

393
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,421
I am simply amazed.

394
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,298
By any chance,

395
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,967
have you heard anything from the lord?

396
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,095
About what?

397
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,513
Well…

398
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,642
Are you afraid he might find out
how Minister Yeom died?

399
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,104
Then, why did you do such a thing?

400
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,732
I procured it to use
on my husband in the first place.

401
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,983
Have you forgotten?

402
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,863
What is so wrong
about using it for its original purpose?

403
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,826
You used it for a much greater purpose
than killing Minister Yeom,

404
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,080
which is why you live in such luxury now.

405
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,344
A Capital Guard superintendent
is showing interest in this matter.

406
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,304
Do not tell me.

407
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,850
Is it Superintendent Park Su-ho?

408
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,147
Do you know him as well?

409
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,648
If he gets involved,

410
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,485
things could become quite bothersome.

411
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,197
A mere superintendent
cannot bring me down.

412
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,703
Even the dead fool does not know
that what he ate killed him.

413
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,039
However,

414
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,668
he must not pry and meddle too much

415
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,088
and cause the lord to get upset.

416
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,966
I will take care of everything.

417
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,967
However,

418
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,554
you should be
more careful in the future, sister.

419
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,975
What did you just call me?

420
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,814
They say one cannot hide
their lowly roots.

421
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,736
I treated you with decency a few times.

422
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,616
Did that delude you
to think you were actually my sibling?

423
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,413
It will do you no good
to treat me this way.

424
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,707
If something were to happen to me,

425
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,043
do you think you would be safe?

426
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,882
I will make it
so you do not have a single worry

427
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,218
and take care of everything, Madam Oh.

428
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,423
Why were you so late?

429
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,884
It is nearly time for dinner.

430
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,970
Were you at Minister Yeom's home
until now?

431
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,179
I apologize, Mother.

432
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,807
On my way back from comforting Madam Oh…

433
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,985
I heard my husband would buy this for you
whenever he went to Unjong Street.

434
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,904
So, I could not simply pass it by.

435
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,782
How dare you roam Unjong Street
in broad daylight?

436
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,703
Go to the shrine
and kneel until I say to stop.

437
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,079
Yes, Mother.

438
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,097
My dear Jung always bought me
sticky rice cakes

439
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,185
because they were his favorite.

440
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,691
Sticky rice cakes!

441
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,614
How much is this?

442
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,658
Ten pieces for five bun.

443
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:52,869
Good.

444
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,204
I will take 20. Wait, no.

445
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,456
Give me 30 pieces.

446
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,790
Yes, sir.

447
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,001
I have not had sticky rice cakes
in a while.

448
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,552
Where do women gather most around here?

449
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,930
The place with the most women

450
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,724
is over there at the end of Unjong Street.

451
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,225
It is called Myeongdo Inn.

452
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,942
Myeongdo Inn?

453
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,331
Lady Yoo is so harsh.

454
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,582
You bought it for her.

455
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,629
How can I blame Mother for my mistake?

456
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,257
Why do you say that
when no one is even listening?

457
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,970
Yeon-seon.

458
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,768
At least my mother-in-law
does not lock me away to die.

459
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,563
And if you really think about it,

460
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,274
Mother does not say anything wrong.

461
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,236
At this rate,
you may get the virtuous woman's gate.

462
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,662
I will bring you something to eat.

463
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,799
After losing my husband,

464
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,844
I thought I had to take my own life.

465
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,096
I heard that it was only right,

466
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,598
and that is what my mother-in-law wanted.

467
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,226
Every morning,

468
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,437
I would be given a silver knife

469
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,314
or a piece of silk fabric.

470
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,151
However,

471
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,778
it was not easy to take my own life.

472
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,199
That is why you must find a way to live.

473
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,745
You should spare no effort
to try to find a way to live.

474
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,124
I will help you.

475
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,305
SEOK-JEONG

476
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,807
I ask because I am truly curious.

477
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,184
My husband,

478
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,353
do you not wish for me
to find a way to live?

479
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,108
Will you only be happy
if I follow you to the afterlife?

480
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,361
Is life not better

481
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,572
than just dying?

482
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,495
For now, I will save the lives of others.

483
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,016
Where on earth have you--

484
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,602
You should be grateful to me, sir.

485
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,439
I ran around the whole capital
for your sake.

486
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,277
How dare you be boastful
when you ran off while on duty?

487
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,197
What was I to do
when Lady I-gyeong was looking for you?

488
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,283
Good work.

489
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,285
Did you just

490
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,538
give me a compliment?

491
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,833
Bi-chan.

492
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,751
Yes, sir?

493
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,088
Who do you think killed Minister Yeom?

494
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,008
It would be faster
to find someone without a grudge.

495
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,096
Then, who had access
to Minister Yeom's painting

496
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,306
and could have poisoned him?

497
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,143
Madam Oh?

498
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,729
How dare I say that?

499
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,565
She is the queen dowager's niece.

500
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,194
In any case,
finding the real culprit will not be easy.

501
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,906
If you cannot find the true killer,

502
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,075
must the servant die a wrongful death?

503
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,203
Can you find the real culprit by tonight?

504
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,040
She really was impatient.

505
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,627
Bi-chan,

506
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,921
go to Myeongdo Inn
and see what they are up to.

507
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,799
You want me to go
to Myeongdo Inn and not Pil Inn?

508
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,050
There is no time to waste!

509
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:18,968
Yes, sir.

510
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,352
Will you be all right?

511
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,439
I am not breaking him out of prison,
so do not look so worried.

512
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,608
Still, it is the police bureau.

513
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,777
He is going to be beheaded.
We have no time to lose.

514
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,070
Do you have the medication?

515
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,955
Are you sure it will work?

516
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,332
Yes, I am certain.

517
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,210
I have also bribed a physician.

518
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,839
But will you go dressed like that?

519
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,801
Superintendent Park!

520
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,475
The head guildmaster and a masked lady
just left Myeongdo Inn

521
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,185
and headed to the police bureau.

522
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,311
Are you sure?

523
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
Yes, sir.

524
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,982
I will go to the police bureau,
so return to Myeongdo Inn.

525
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,902
-Pardon?
-Tell me if you see anything else.

526
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,828
POLICE BUREAU

527
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,133
Head Guildmaster?

528
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,510
Have you been well?

529
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,430
I have a small favor to ask.

530
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,057
What is it?

531
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,770
A man named Yong-deok was arrested today.

532
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,109
Please let us speak with him briefly.

533
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,153
His elderly mother is on her deathbed,

534
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,573
so he should
at least be allowed a final message.

535
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,703
It is suspicious
that she is covering her face.

536
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,080
It is because I have
an awful scar on my face.

537
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,039
Please understand.

538
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,250
I really must not allow it.

539
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,008
Keep it brief.

540
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,884
You have my word.

541
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,188
Who are you?

542
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,399
Why do you have this?

543
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,693
What about my lady?

544
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,614
She is safe.

545
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,783
From this moment,

546
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,828
you must do exactly as I say
if you are to see her again.

547
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,417
Drink this right now.

548
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,588
Also, no matter what happens,
do not be alarmed.

549
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,423
Pardon?

550
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,050
Are you still not done?

551
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,010
We are nearly finished.

552
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,220
You must drink it now.

553
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,430
Do you understand?

554
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,354
Hurry along and get going.

555
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,190
Who dared to allow
a visit to the criminal?

556
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,026
Well, sir.

557
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,196
I can explain everything.

558
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,199
Stay here, my lady.

559
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,042
-It has been a while.
-Head Guildmaster?

560
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,627
What brings you here?

561
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,588
Let us go outside, and I will tell you.

562
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,006
Please follow me.

563
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,949
Stop right there.

564
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,160
-Remove your mask.
-Pardon?

565
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,746
I must see your face
before an issue arises.

566
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,832
I have an awful scar--

567
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,542
Show me your face at once.

568
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,128
What?

569
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,297
Well, look at you.

570
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,343
Do not just stand by.

571
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,896
How dare you treat a lady like this?

572
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:43,858
Who are you?

573
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,535
I am a Capital Guard superintendent.

574
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,205
I am acquainted with her, so let her go.

575
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,292
But we must know her identity
for the record.

576
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,211
She came to ask for needlework
at the Capital Guard,

577
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,796
so do not mind her.

578
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,922
Yes, sir.

579
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,342
Get going now.

580
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,261
It is late,

581
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,972
so you must head straight home.

582
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,141
Yes, sir. Thank you.

583
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,067
Where is Commander Kim?

584
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,905
He had a matter to take care of,
so he went over there.

585
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,911
It seems like he will be a while.
Then I will get going.

586
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,579
Tell him that I came by.

587
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,872
Yes, sir.

588
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,598
POLICE BUREAU

589
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,792
What on earth are you up to?

590
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,946
What an awful smell.

591
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,907
What is going on?

592
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,493
Please save me.

593
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,453
I feel like

594
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,372
I may die.

595
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,127
He has been vomiting and having diarrhea
for four hours.

596
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,671
Could it be the plague?

597
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,091
-Commander!
-Commander!

598
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,677
-Commander!
-Goodness, Commander!

599
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,886
-Gosh.
-Where did he go?

600
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,805
-Commander.
-My goodness.

601
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,150
That was a close call.

602
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,819
Why did it have to be the plague?

603
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,007
Let us go.

604
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,560
Can you hear me?

605
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,896
Are you all right?

606
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,486
Over here, my lady.

607
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,490
He is alive, right?

608
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,492
Of course. People do not die so easily.

609
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,993
Come on, now.

610
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,453
Wake up.

611
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,038
Wake up!

612
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,667
See? He is alive.

613
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,221
Stop crossing the line.

614
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,817
I have come this far.

615
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,360
I cannot stop now.

616
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,787
I will distract them.

617
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,122
Take him to a safe place.

618
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,123
Yes, my lady.

619
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,463
Follow the body.

620
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,090
Is that not the legendary altruist?

621
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,883
Hurry up and follow them!

622
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,601
Have you all lost your minds?

623
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,980
He was to be beheaded.
Why would you take him away?

624
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,275
He vomited, had diarrhea all night,
and fainted, so we called a physician.

625
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,902
We were told he had already died
from the plague.

626
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,823
We feared other prisoners might get it,
so we had no choice.

627
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,285
You mean you all feared
catching it yourselves!

628
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:47,911
I apologize, sir.

629
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,623
How could you?
We could all lose our lives over this!

630
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,762
Stop now!

631
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,852
I told you to stop.

632
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,191
Stop your horse!

633
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,153
Stop immediately.

634
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,032
Stop, my lady!

635
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,503
What did you just say?

636
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,171
I told you to stop.

637
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,088
After that.

638
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,091
I have already given you many chances.

639
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:48,138
For someone so reckless,
how can you be so clueless?

640
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,683
This man knows exactly who I am.

641
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,733
I wield my sword better than a bow.

642
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,157
Whatever you think you know
is a misunderstanding, sir.

643
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,701
You are mistaken about everything.

644
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,455
Must I discuss this
with the left minister tomorrow?

645
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,419
What do you want?

646
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,214
Do you know the severity of your crime?

647
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,259
Have you ever thought
about what will happen if you are caught?

648
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,927
Two innocent lives are at stake.

649
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,970
And what of your own?

650
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,391
Are you

651
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,102
worrying about me right now?

652
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,649
It is because
things have gotten complicated.

653
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,318
I was trying to resolve it,
but you stole the body

654
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,861
and rendered my plan useless.

655
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,530
What if something goes wrong?

656
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,200
It is all because you acted rashly!

657
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,955
You have been
of great help to me thus far.

658
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,415
So I shall ask you

659
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,252
to use the law to resolve
this matter as well, Superintendent.

660
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,222
See you tomorrow night at Myeongdo Inn.

661
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,074
MYEONGDO INN

662
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,287
We are in so much trouble.

663
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,248
Hurry up and find it.

664
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,045
It is gone.

665
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,129
What do we do?

666
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,547
It is not here.

667
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,486
Brother.

668
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,404
May I come in?

669
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,033
Come in.

670
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,506
Why do you look so awful this morning?

671
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,680
I must discuss something
with you urgently.

672
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,848
Have a seat.

673
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,022
A man was arrested
as Minister Yeom's killer.

674
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,483
Yes, I heard. He was their servant.

675
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,404
I have heard a testimony
that says he is not the true culprit.

676
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,822
What do you mean?

677
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,074
If he is not the true culprit,

678
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,827
you can inform the police bureau
and reinvestigate the case.

679
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,953
You see,

680
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,248
the witness cannot reveal their identity
to the police bureau.

681
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,499
Who is it?

682
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,167
That is

683
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,171
not something I can tell you.

684
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,925
Could it be the person
you were dying to find out about?

685
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,680
So, have you come here to ask me

686
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:21,351
to pardon that servant
or help you find the true culprit?

687
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,728
That is not why I came.

688
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,938
While that man was being held
at the police bureau,

689
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,398
he suddenly died last night.

690
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,233
How?

691
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,154
The bigger issue is
that his body has disappeared.

692
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,489
What on earth are you saying right now?

693
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,783
And why are you telling me this?

694
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,785
I came to ask for your help

695
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,580
so that the missing body
does not become an issue.

696
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,664
What did you say?

697
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,418
My lord!

698
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,753
Lord Seok.

699
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,300
What is the matter?

700
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,552
I have urgent news to tell you.

701
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,388
It is about the servant
who killed Minister Yeom.

702
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,974
He suddenly died of the plague last night.

703
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:04,060
He suddenly caught the plague
before his execution?

704
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,273
There is something even more bizarre.

705
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,525
His body has disappeared.

706
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,944
The police bureau is in chaos over this.

707
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,158
Come inside.

708
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,201
Yes, my lord.

709
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,997
You work for the government.

710
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,459
Will you ignore the law
and interfere with state affairs

711
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,419
because of that one person?

712
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,213
That is not the only reason.

713
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,506
Although we are family,

714
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,550
do you have a worthy reason
to ask for such an absurd favor

715
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,677
from a royal court secretary?

716
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,556
Brother.
Minister Yeom's case feels strange.

717
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,433
What do you mean?

718
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,479
Look at this autopsy report.

719
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,279
The cause of death was a head injury,

720
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,825
but I saw purple spots
inside his mouth and on his gums.

721
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,203
Also, there was a sweet scent
coming from his mouth,

722
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,080
which I had never smelled before.

723
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,793
Did you just say, "a sweet scent"?

724
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,342
This was inside the bar
of Minister Yeom's painting.

725
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,970
When it is melted in water,
it gives off that scent.

726
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,347
The flower petals melted?

727
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,390
Yes.

728
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:27,310
And when the petals are mixed in water,
the water seems to become poisonous.

729
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,150
Do not tell anyone else
about this for now.

730
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,320
I will look for a solution,
so wait until then.

731
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,030
Yes, Brother.

732
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,200
They could not find it anywhere.

733
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:47,122
Someone took the body
of the man who killed Minister Yeom?

734
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,165
For what reason?

735
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,753
I will hold the police captain responsible
and resolve the matter at all costs.

736
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,007
No.

737
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,178
Reprimand the officers who were on duty
and settle the matter quickly.

738
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:03,805
Pardon?

739
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,558
He was going to be executed anyway.

740
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,852
It does not matter how he died.

741
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,647
Rather, if word gets out
that the police bureau lost a body,

742
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,192
unsettling rumors will spread
amongst the people.

743
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,362
On second thought, you are right.

744
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,407
Then, I will handle it as such.

745
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,585
Taking the body of a man
sentenced to be beheaded…

746
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,090
Who would be bold enough
to do such a thing?

747
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,643
At this rate, everyone will know but you.

748
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,770
I am aware I made a mistake.

749
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,480
He is a superintendent.

750
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,523
A Capital Guard superintendent
of all people.

751
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,108
Do not worry.

752
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,945
I will think of a way
to keep his mouth shut.

753
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,280
Will you get rid of him without a trace?

754
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,448
I failed at that already.

755
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,991
Did you find his weakness?

756
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,201
Could it be worse than mine?

757
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,079
Then how will you keep him from talking?

758
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,457
I plan to approach him
with honesty, trust,

759
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,293
and a pitiful image.

760
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,715
What makes you think
he will fall for that?

761
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:25,053
He does not seem to be
such an untrustworthy person.

762
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,263
But it is quite strange.

763
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,224
What do you mean?

764
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,981
If he knew the whole time,
why did he pretend not to?

765
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,654
He covered my face.

766
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,322
Stop!

767
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,371
He also helped me.

768
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,249
Are you really taking his side right now?

769
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,002
"Without a trace."

770
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,337
That seems like the best option.

771
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,256
So, what do you plan to do?

772
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,302
Does it look like I have a plan?

773
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,015
I was just trying to help Lady Baek.

774
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,811
I have a strange feeling
that something big is approaching.

775
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,397
Did I get involved

776
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,150
in something I should not have?

777
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,095
Your Majesty!

778
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,518
This is it.

779
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,855
This is the scent I smelled.

780
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,152
This was in the bar
of Minister Yeom's painting?

781
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,945
Yes, sire.

782
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,324
It seems that Minister Yeom
drank this and died.

783
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,330
No one believed me back then.

784
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,624
Not a single person believed what I said.

785
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,292
You must remain strong.

786
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,045
We have found a clue at last.

787
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,798
We will soon be able to find
those who were involved.

788
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,929
Since your brother is the one
who discovered all of this,

789
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,265
I have no choice
but to meet with him in person now.

790
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,563
Also, I have a request to ask.

791
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,981
What is it?

792
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,568
It seems that
the accused servant was innocent.

793
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,655
So it would be best
if the matter of his missing body is

794
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,865
settled without making too much commotion.

795
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,034
Yes, you are right.

796
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,829
They would also not want this matter
to draw any attention.

797
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,499
They will undoubtedly act first
to try and cover this up.

798
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,505
There will be

799
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,591
lots of work to do from now on.

800
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,553
For both you and I…

801
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,182
as well as your brother.

802
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,711
What is wrong now?

803
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,087
What happened to the altruist?

804
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,798
Where was the body taken?

805
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,758
I asked what happened to the altruist!

806
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,180
The altruist used
a cowardly move to run away.

807
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,850
There is no way
he would ever act cowardly.

808
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,810
Because of that darn altruist,

809
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,229
I lost my horse.

810
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,816
And do you know how exhausting it was

811
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,027
to walk all the way back from that place?

812
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,907
As long as the altruist is safe,
I feel relieved.

813
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,369
Was the body taken to Myeongdo Inn?

814
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,664
How did you know?

815
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,582
Bi-chan.

816
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,131
Whatever I do from this point onward,

817
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,551
as long as it is right,
are you willing to keep things secret

818
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,970
to follow me into all sorts of danger?

819
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,558
My mother always told me
not to get involved

820
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,269
in finances or dangerous situations,

821
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,522
not even with the closest of friends.

822
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,899
It is to help the legendary altru--

823
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,192
I, Bi-chan,

824
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,611
will follow you until the end.

825
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,116
Until I die.

826
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,452
Sir.

827
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,622
Are you yet to find the mask?

828
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,123
We are still looking.

829
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,251
Last night,

830
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,338
the killer of Minister Yeom died
in police custody

831
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,882
-and his body disappeared.
-What?

832
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,553
This incident has caused chaos
in the police bureau.

833
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,306
Fortunately, the royal court
has ordered that the case be closed

834
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,058
since he was to be executed anyway.

835
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,560
The body disappeared?

836
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,478
How outrageous.

837
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,440
I must find out who took the body.

838
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,652
Yes, sir. I will look into it.

839
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,744
The police captain
was summoned to the palace

840
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:45,540
and praised for solving
the murder of Minister Yeom.

841
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,626
He received extremely high commendations.

842
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:54,048
I simply cannot understand

843
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,175
why the police bureau was praised.

844
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:01,639
This was no different
than the culprit screaming, "Here I am!"

845
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,100
What did the police bureau do?

846
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,770
What did they even do to deserve
being praised at the palace?

847
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,984
Have you heard?

848
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,238
It is about the interior minister's
widowed daughter-in-law.

849
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,366
She ran away in the middle of the night.

850
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,330
Then, was she the one
who went to the water mill and…

851
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,083
Why is she clapping?

852
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:39,802
Anyway, I heard rumors that she was caught
by her mother-in-law.

853
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,805
How can you speak of such vulgar things?

854
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,100
It is only a rumor.

855
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,855
Anyway, the interior minister's residence
is in chaos over this.

856
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,483
For the time being,

857
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:57,111
I doubt the interior minister's wife
will attend the Peony Society.

858
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,530
My daughter-in-law is very modest,

859
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,949
yet you dare speak
of such indecency around her?

860
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,287
Do not listen to such things.

861
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,457
Go to the shrine and compose yourself.

862
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,501
Yes, Mother.

863
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,302
MYEONGDO INN

864
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:22,970
All right.

865
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,138
See you next time.

866
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,848
-You have worked hard.
-Thank you.

867
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,850
-Get going now.
-All right.

868
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,790
Is this what you want, sir?

869
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,169
I have no intention of letting you die.

870
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,923
But you do intend to report me.

871
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,636
What now? Did it not work?

872
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,223
I will die anyway,

873
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,184
so I will end my life in your presence…

874
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,103
Will he not stop me?

875
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,815
Really? Say something.

876
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,275
I will end my life and…

877
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,236
I shall excuse myself.

878
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,574
You are free to take your life,

879
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,368
but doing so in my presence
is a different matter.

880
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,291
Then how about this?

881
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,173
Do you think I will not be able to do it?

882
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,470
I did not plan on dying today,
but I seem to have no other choice.

883
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,141
Tell me why.

884
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,311
Why do you insist on going this far?

885
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:17,752
IN THE END, IT WAS HER

886
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,469
The only remaining family of Cho Seong-hu

887
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,971
was a sister who married
after he vanished.

888
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:32,183
She became the eldest daughter-in-law
of Left Minister Seok Ji-seong.

889
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,603
Her name is Cho Yeo-hwa.

890
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,834
I am the eldest daughter-in-law
of Lord Seok.

891
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,335
My name

892
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,128
is Cho Yeo-hwa.

893
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:26,279
EPILOGUE

894
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,738
Thank you.

895
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,948
Thank you.

896
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,951
I bid you farewell.

897
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,953
Let us go now.

898
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,163
-Let us go.
-Yes.

899
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,752
Your situation seems complicated too.

900
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,921
I hope you make it out

901
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,257
and live the life you want.

902
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,976
-Let us go now. This way.
-All right.

903
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,064
There was a man and a woman

904
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,817
who spent the entire night together
for the first time

905
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,652
in a cozy room.

906
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:10,197
I heard their warmth spread
through all of Myeongdo Inn.

907
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,409
Did you stoke them a fire in this weather?

908
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,119
Shall I give you the details?

909
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,623
When a man and a woman who are in love
come together in a moment of--

910
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,458
No! Please stop.

911
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,837
They were so loud all night
that I assumed they would be tired.

912
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,635
Just like you,

913
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,845
Lady Baek must be modest during the day

914
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,348
and an entirely different person at night.

915
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,934
A different person at night?

916
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,760
Recently, a decent-looking merchant

917
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,263
with great talking skills
showed up at Myeongdo Inn.

918
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,892
He said there would be big trouble
if we knew his identity.

919
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,603
I know that you have helped
every time, sir.

920
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,063
I only got involved by chance.

921
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,692
These are all of the people
you have helped.

922
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,652
My name is Joo Yo-seop.

923
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:33,364
To prevent any rash behavior,
you must not leave my sight.

924
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:35,116
How will he keep an eye on me?

925
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,159
He cannot simply barge in.

926
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,954
There you are.

927
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,206
I have been wanting to meet you as well.

928
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,541
Why on earth did he come here?

929
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:48,629
