1
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,333
Instructions for Women says,

2
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,211
"Men and women shall not sit
together in one place

3
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,298
or directly hand each other items."

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,467
This is true in our daily lives

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,385
and during ancestral rites
and funerals as well.

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,097
If you have to do so,
you must use tools such as baskets.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,140
Do you know why?

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,768
It is a preventative measure to avoid

9
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,312
any physical contact
between a man and a woman.

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,481
My dear sir!

11
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,149
I am in danger, so please save me first.

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,735
-Why are you doing this?
-Hold on tight.

13
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,653
Save me first!

14
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,699
My lady!

15
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,539
What on earth is going on?

16
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,877
There are too many people, my lady.

17
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,089
They seemed like a group of bandits.

18
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,801
Nothing really happened.

19
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,011
Were they someone
whom you have seen before?

20
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,098
-Well…
-I recognize you.

21
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,893
Didn't we meet
at the rental bookstore before?

22
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,729
Who is he?

23
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,815
I am a Capital Guard superintendent.

24
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,233
I have seen him here and there.

25
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,069
Wait, you are a superintendent?

26
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,575
Are you impressed by a superintendent?

27
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,369
I am the nation's royal advisor.

28
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,873
Brother!

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,546
I just wanted to help calm things down.

30
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,510
How is your injury from last time?

31
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,596
Were you hurt? Where?

32
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,058
I am fine. But my lady is shaken up,

33
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,643
so we will get going now.

34
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,520
Hold on.

35
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,815
I witnessed the incident
right before my eyes.

36
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,150
I cannot just let it pass.

37
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,528
I hope you will cooperate
with the Capital Guard's investigations.

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,113
That is unnecessary…

39
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,623
"We were on our way
to a nearby temple for prayer,

40
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,249
so we cannot turn back,"

41
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,629
is what my lady is trying to say.

42
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,094
Then, we will escort you to the temple.

43
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,680
The bandits might come back again.

44
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,853
Tell him, "How rude!"

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,814
Who, me?

46
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,608
Did you not hear who they were?

47
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,198
How could you be so rude?

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,367
Men and women are distinct.

49
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,286
How do you not know
that a faithful widow can feel uneasy

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,121
by just talking to a man?

51
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,039
Moreover,

52
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,583
do you not realize the repercussions

53
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,045
if rumors spread of an investigation
held by the Capital Guard?

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,800
Please pardon my impertinence.

55
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,763
I will ensure you are not affected
by today's incident.

56
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,556
I shall take my leave.

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,184
-Let us go now.
-Very well.

58
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,978
I bid you farewell.

59
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,950
Enemies really do meet on narrow bridges.

60
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,119
My lady.

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,831
Since when did you become
enemies with the superintendent?

62
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,041
I mean, I can tell at first glance

63
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,668
we are going to become enemies.

64
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,628
He seems like the type to arrest you

65
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,880
-if he ever found out about your secret.
-Right?

66
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
Did you see him roll me down the hill?

67
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,759
He lacks any ounce of empathy.

68
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,137
He is someone I should avoid at all costs.

69
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,474
You have met
that superintendent before, right?

70
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,893
Yeon-seon, it hurts right here.

71
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,021
And it hurts here too.

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,859
I have jumped over roofs
but have never been rolled down a hill.

73
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,946
You know you almost caused a bigger issue
by letting those bandits go, right?

74
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,409
He saved you
by rolling you down that hill.

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,662
You know it could have been worse
if you drew attention to yourself.

76
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,622
Oh, I did not think of that.

77
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,127
By the way,
what should we do with all these?

78
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,046
I cannot possibly carry them all.

79
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,506
-Let's just leave them here.
-All of them?

80
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,759
Making an offering is one thing.

81
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,886
It would be better
if they were taken by the hungry.

82
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,555
Let's get going.
We have wasted enough time.

83
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,068
That was a close call.

84
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,904
I am glad we were passing by.

85
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,572
That could have been dangerous.

86
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,450
My dear sir!

87
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,619
I am in danger, so please save me first.

88
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,246
-Save me first!
-Why are you doing this?

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,624
She did not appear
to be in any danger at all.

90
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,001
What do you mean?

91
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,922
Did it not seem like she was trying
to protect the bandits?

92
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,466
Are you saying they are
in league with the bandits?

93
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,510
No, that would be unlikely.

94
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,970
She is
the left councilor's daughter-in-law.

95
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
The left councilor?

96
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,642
But how did you know that?

97
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,437
I happened to meet her
at Myeongdo Inn recently.

98
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,858
So, she was the famous daughter-in-law
of the left councilor.

99
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,570
Why is she famous?

100
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,036
I do not know much about her,

101
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,747
but I heard
she comes from a military family

102
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,707
but lost her parents at a young age.

103
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,460
She also had an older brother…

104
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,340
but she had to get married

105
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,385
without any family
because he also disappeared.

106
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,054
To make things worse,

107
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,807
on the morning of her wedding day,

108
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,059
her husband died, so she became a widow,

109
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,644
never having met her husband-to-be.

110
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,521
She is a virgin widow?

111
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,440
VIRGIN WIDOW: A WOMAN WHO IS
WIDOWED BEFORE HER WEDDING NIGHT

112
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,983
Given the circumstances,

113
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,236
her life must not have been easy.

114
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,364
But what does that matter?

115
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,617
As the daughter-in-law
of the renowned Lord Seok,

116
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,413
if she were to be awarded
the virtuous woman's gate,

117
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,541
they would become
the most renowned family in the nation.

118
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,211
What is astonishing is
that both the deceased

119
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,089
and those alive are
of great use to the family.

120
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,849
The finance minister said
he had a rare painting stolen from him.

121
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,768
Left Councilor, do you know
what kind of painting it was?

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,690
I would have loved to see it.

123
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,651
It was a painting called
White Tiger in the Mountains.

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,779
I have also been curious about it.

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,281
However,

126
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,285
please do not say that
in front of the court officials.

127
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,537
As a king of the nation,

128
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,124
you must first be concerned
about the chaos that the nation is in.

129
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,502
How could someone dare
to break into the house

130
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,339
of the minister who is in charge
of this nation's finances?

131
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,050
Yes, of course.

132
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,762
I was too shortsighted again.

133
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,641
They say that when a tree falls,
it is because insects have eaten it away,

134
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,811
and when a fence falls,
it is because there is a crack in it.

135
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,524
The people must fear the royal court,

136
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,609
and the laws
of the upper class must be strong

137
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,570
in order to keep
the nation's foundation stable.

138
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
Please keep that in mind, Your Majesty.

139
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,827
I understand.

140
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,499
I will always keep the teachings
of the left councilor in my heart.

141
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,584
But please rest assured, sire.

142
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:08,548
The police bureau will catch the culprit
and relieve you of this burden soon.

143
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,719
ATELIER

144
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,265
Why are you doing this?

145
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,726
I have never even heard
of this White Tiger in the Mountains.

146
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,691
Let me know if you gain
any information about the tiger.

147
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,944
Yes, sir. I will make sure to do that.

148
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,240
Make sure you get a good look
at the seller of the painting.

149
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,658
Yes, I will.

150
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,828
If one steals someone else's belongings,

151
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,581
shouldn't they at least get
their hand sliced off?

152
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,457
Would that not fit the crime?

153
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,050
You must be discreet about this.

154
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,176
Yes, of course.

155
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,803
-What?
-Yes…

156
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,638
-What did you say?
-Yes, sir!

157
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,486
How does he expect to be discreet
when he is shouting like that?

158
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,489
Are you okay, sir?

159
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,950
I have never even heard
of this painting before.

160
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,785
But everyone expects me to have it.

161
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,662
You should leave now too.

162
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,331
I do not know anything about it.

163
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,498
Sir.

164
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,460
He is Kang Pil-jik's right-hand man,
is he not?

165
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,754
Why was he after the tiger painting?

166
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,423
How should I know that?

167
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,968
How many times must I tell you
I know nothing about this painting?

168
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,470
Will you please believe me?

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,930
Who in their right mind

170
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,558
would walk around
with the painting right now?

171
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,269
It has to be hidden in a place
where nobody knows.

172
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,927
MEMORIAL TABLET OF YEO-HWA'S
HUSBAND AND SEOK JI-SEONG'S SON

173
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,894
Lady Yoo, you have a guest.

174
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,481
A guest?

175
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,824
What brings you here, Madam?

176
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,370
I am sorry for visiting unannounced.

177
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,831
Oh, nonsense. Please, come inside.

178
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,877
You have decorated this space very nicely.

179
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
Is this your first time
visiting me at my home?

180
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,509
I have only seen you
at the Peony Society before,

181
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,344
but I finally got the chance to visit you.

182
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,347
On that note,

183
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,474
what brings you here today?

184
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,020
Actually,

185
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:15,276
I came to see you to ask
if the Peony Society could take part

186
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,446
-in the upcoming relief effort.
-Is that so?

187
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,034
It was something
I did on my own on a small scale,

188
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,663
but the queen dowager had been
so happy about it.

189
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,499
It made me think
that it could be a good idea

190
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,585
to do this together as a group.

191
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,713
Do you personally go out
to provide relief?

192
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,966
It is actually not that hard.

193
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,261
The servants handle all the cooking,

194
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,514
and I simply share it with the people.

195
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,141
So,

196
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:53,147
how would you feel about joining
the relief effort tomorrow, Lady Yoo?

197
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,690
Would you be willing?

198
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,817
But I must say,

199
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,738
I am not sure my presence would make
much of a difference.

200
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,866
The interior minister's wife
and her second daughter-in-law

201
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,869
have already participated a few times.

202
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,958
The interior minister's wife did?

203
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,753
On the upcoming birthday
of the queen dowager,

204
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,924
she will honor
filial sons, filial daughters,

205
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,301
and virtuous women
from all over the nation.

206
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,136
That could be why she joined us

207
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,891
with her second daughter-in-law,
who is showing her devotion as a widow.

208
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,477
Again, I am unsure if our presence

209
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,188
will change the lives
of the people that much,

210
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,650
but it is for a good cause,
so we will join.

211
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,529
It will also be a good experience
for my daughter-in-law,

212
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,489
who has only been
frequenting the shrine every day.

213
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,577
Absolutely, it will be
a good experience for her.

214
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,924
Sir!

215
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,093
Kang Pil-jik is looking
for White Tiger in the Mountains.

216
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,637
-What are you talking about?
-Earlier today,

217
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,557
the captain asked me to check
if the painting shows up for sale,

218
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,724
so I went to the atelier.

219
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,518
Can you guess who I ran into there?

220
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,769
It was none other

221
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,690
than Kang Pil-jik's right hand,
asking about the painting's whereabouts.

222
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,901
The Pil guild is looking for the painting?

223
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,320
That is right.
They were so eager to find it too.

224
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,994
Why would they be looking for the painting
when the Capital Guard is investigating?

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,038
They must have a hidden agenda.

226
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,665
I am sure that they do.

227
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,792
First, it is an expensive painting.

228
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,252
Second,

229
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,504
someone who wants
the painting commissioned them.

230
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,547
Third,

231
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,133
there is a secret to the painting
that no one can know about.

232
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,676
-A secret?
-Hold on.

233
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,012
Fourth, and this is the real kicker.

234
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,225
They are trying to capture
the legendary altruist for taking it.

235
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,771
I bet Kang Pil-jik is trying to catch him.

236
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,524
But that man looked absolutely terrifying!

237
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,611
This altruist of yours is not
exactly a pushover.

238
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,862
So do not worry.

239
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,071
You are right.

240
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,156
Thank goodness.

241
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,241
Wait, what?

242
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,376
Lady Cho.

243
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,841
A letter arrived from Myeongdo Inn.

244
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,884
A letter?

245
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,968
What is it about?

246
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:36,435
I know you have done quite a bit of work
with your face covered as a woman.

247
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,980
We are under strict national law.

248
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,609
Should you disturb the capital's peace
through indiscriminate actions,

249
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,029
I would like to inform you
that as a Capital Guard superintendent,

250
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,906
it is my duty to catch such people.

251
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,118
I will do whatever it takes to arrest you.

252
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,536
So, please.

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,664
Do not let me even catch a glimpse of you.

254
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,083
Let me take a look.

255
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,542
What on earth are you doing?

256
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,502
I have to check something.

257
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,670
No, you cannot!

258
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,296
And also,

259
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,132
I hope you will return
the painting as soon as possible.

260
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,346
Is it bad news, my lady?

261
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
This cannot be.

262
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,439
Was this sent by that superintendent?

263
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,736
No wonder!

264
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,782
So, the superintendent has already

265
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,742
seen you in your mask…

266
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,205
and also in your disguise, right?

267
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,628
Why would you hide

268
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,589
such vital information from me?

269
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,009
If something were to happen to you,

270
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,510
I wondered if I had to go to jail for you

271
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,429
or get beaten to death by Lady Yoo.

272
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,056
-But I only have one body.
-I can hear everything.

273
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,766
I will have to get some new ones.

274
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,853
Lady Cho!

275
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,312
Do not worry.

276
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,106
I will not get arrested. How can he?

277
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,524
He cannot unless I leave.

278
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,567
But you do leave.

279
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,611
As I always say, you are the worst.

280
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,243
Anyhow,

281
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,079
is he telling you to return the painting

282
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,289
or not?

283
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,544
Let me see that.

284
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,509
Who on earth painted this?

285
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,720
The brush strokes are full of energy.

286
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,348
It is like I am staring at a living tiger.

287
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,230
Are you reckless or just stupid?

288
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,321
Didn't I tell you to stay out of my sight?

289
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,740
You told me to return it, did you not?

290
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,454
I said I would not arrest you
unless you showed up.

291
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,082
Oh, is that what you meant by that?

292
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,214
If you have come here willingly,
you must be prepared for your arrest.

293
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,176
I am not the type of person
to be easily caught.

294
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
Then, let me catch you with difficulty.

295
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,605
Let's make this easy
by saying you never saw me.

296
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,911
Is that tiger
really worth all this effort?

297
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,730
Who goes there?

298
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,859
CAPITAL GUARD

299
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,657
Stop right there!

300
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,501
Hold it!

301
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,962
Excuse me.

302
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
Let me see who you are.

303
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,636
Sir!

304
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,304
I am over here. Please save me first!

305
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,936
Stop right there!

306
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,201
Who are you? Tell me who you are!

307
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,453
That is none of your business, sir.

308
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,925
Who is there?

309
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,553
It is me, sir!

310
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,388
What are you doing here unannounced?

311
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,684
What has happened to you recently?

312
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,561
I feel as if I have been tricked
by a ghost.

313
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,147
There is no way
they are all the same person,

314
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,732
but they all appear as if they were one.

315
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,110
They all appear
as if they were one person?

316
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,987
Who does?

317
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,197
It is nothing. Leave me be.

318
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,658
Do you feel like
you have met this person before,

319
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,493
or do they just seem familiar?

320
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,830
Have you also had
such a strange experience?

321
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,834
Of course, who has not had
such an experience when they were young?

322
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,628
Sir, your symptoms are completely normal.

323
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,673
It happens while reading a book
or even working.

324
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,508
-Did you not just have a dream about it?
-Yes.

325
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,596
If everyone in the world looked
like one person to you,

326
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,264
I am sure that this is

327
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,682
-love--
-Shut up!

328
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,144
You should not feel embarrassed
when you are with me.

329
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,938
It may be awkward
since it is your first time feeling this.

330
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,525
This is often referred to
as "a denial of your feelings."

331
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,777
What are you talking about?

332
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,904
It means to feel a strong emotion

333
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,739
that you have decided to deny.

334
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,452
You are trying to deny
the strong sense of affection you feel.

335
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,205
So, who is the girl?

336
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,540
Should I be your messenger of love?

337
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,583
You punk!

338
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,221
Sir, come out quickly.

339
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,139
The captain has already left
for Sugu Gate.

340
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
Sugu Gate?

341
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,103
The wives of the high-ranking officials
will visit Sugu Gate to donate grains.

342
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,314
So we must protect them
to prevent any trouble from happening.

343
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,327
PEACE AND FLOURISHING

344
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,150
The road was a bit rough, was it not?

345
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,820
Thank you all for coming all this way.

346
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,198
The ground around here is muddy,

347
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,201
so please watch your step.

348
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,541
Instructions for Women says to respond
quickly and politely to your in-laws.

349
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,835
No gagging, burping, sneezing, coughing,

350
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,879
or leaning on one leg allowed!

351
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,089
Come on, Cho Yeo-hwa. You can do this!

352
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,515
Welcome, my lady.

353
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,810
It is nice to have you.

354
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:44,357
I am sorry I could only contribute
800 kg of rice this time.

355
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,071
Oh, please do not say such a thing!

356
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,824
I am grateful for your generosity

357
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,659
every time there is a relief effort.

358
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
Lady Yoo, please do not tell me

359
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,045
that you and your daughter-in-law
came empty-handed?

360
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,717
I was too eager to think that far ahead
and could not prepare anything.

361
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,678
I will put in more effort next time.

362
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,430
Of course.

363
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,308
I did not know
that you and your daughter-in-law

364
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,686
were secretly doing such a good deed.

365
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,940
I understand your intentions, though.

366
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,401
Well, now you know
and still insisted on coming out.

367
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,278
Is that not enough?

368
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,323
Ladies!

369
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,701
My greetings to you!

370
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:41,081
I am Captain Hwang Chi-dal
of the Capital Guard,

371
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,375
and I am here
to safely escort you all today.

372
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,672
I am most grateful that the Capital Guard
is taking such good care of us.

373
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,383
It is our pleasure, my lady.

374
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,136
Yeo-hwa, you can come out now.

375
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,319
Oh, no.

376
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,196
My goodness.

377
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,538
There is no hesitation in her steps,

378
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,082
unafraid to soil
her snow-white dress shoes.

379
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,503
Her refusal to hold back is
truly virtuous.

380
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,675
We came here to work,

381
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,886
so why worry if our clothes get dirty?

382
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,723
My daughter.

383
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,870
How graceful.

384
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,291
She must be Lady Baek,
a faithful widow of five years.

385
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:11,087
Like a swan walking on calm water,

386
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,717
how graceful and dignified she is.

387
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,928
Well said.

388
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,808
Maintaining dignity is
also a virtue of a woman.

389
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,026
Mother.

390
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,945
The sunlight is so strong.
It must be blinding your eyes.

391
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,617
I have some preparations left to do,

392
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,285
so please excuse me.

393
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,912
Of course, my lady.

394
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,501
While the preparations are underway,

395
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,337
please go under the prepared awning.

396
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,880
-Very well.
-Yes, we shall.

397
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,633
Please be mindful of the steps.

398
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,093
Watch your step, please.

399
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,266
Do you have any interesting new releases?

400
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,351
Yes, sir.

401
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,230
Here are two new books
that we just received.

402
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,609
Let us see…

403
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,864
I am here, Mister.

404
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,282
Oh, you are here.

405
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,827
-Wait just a minute.
-All right.

406
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,713
You dropped this last time.

407
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,049
I was going to leave it at the bookstore.

408
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,551
But here we meet again.

409
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,761
Good day to you, Defense…

410
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,140
I WOKE UP AS
THE ROYAL ADVISOR'S WIFE

411
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,934
This is not what you think.

412
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,811
-Do not get the wrong idea.
-What idea?

413
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,856
I am not the kind of person
who misunderstands things,

414
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,482
but what do you mean?

415
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,444
I am not the one who borrowed this book.

416
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,237
Then why do I have that book,

417
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,990
and where did the person I bumped into go?

418
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,784
That I do not know.

419
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,456
I have finished transcribing these.

420
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,832
All right, then.

421
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,626
ARITHMETIC INSIGHTS

422
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,889
Did you transcribe
this arithmetic book as well?

423
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,515
Yes, I did.

424
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,520
This is something I wanted to read.

425
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,063
I will buy this copy.

426
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,442
It is a difficult book
that is well worth one yang.

427
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:44,949
Take two.

428
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,453
To help pay for your injury last time.

429
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,748
Medicine is not worth one yang.

430
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,126
You will be in trouble
if you keep splurging like this.

431
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,174
Wait…

432
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,976
Is she a regular here?

433
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,603
Do you mean Yeon-seon?

434
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,732
She makes a lot of copies
and earns a substantial income from us.

435
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,152
Her exceptional writing skills
might come from

436
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,613
living with
the left councilor's daughter-in-law.

437
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,869
Your sense of humor is impeccable.

438
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,957
You shine even in such a shabby place.

439
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,126
She is such an amazing person.

440
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,046
She is always willing
to give rice to the people

441
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,341
and sets an example
to get her hands dirty.

442
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,051
-Thank you.
-Please dig in.

443
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,971
Is she not an example to all women?

444
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,349
Every time she sees my daughter-in-law,

445
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,310
she praises her for embodying

446
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,355
all the basic virtues of a faithful woman.

447
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,108
I am so grateful for her kindness.

448
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,280
What is greater than basic values is
a passion for her husband,

449
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,116
for a faithful widow.

450
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,414
My daughter-in-law not only goes
to the shrine daily

451
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:19,544
but asks to tend to her husband's grave
for the rest of her life.

452
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,386
Instructions for Women says

453
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,015
it is best not to flatter
or talk back to your superiors,

454
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,183
get involved in any dirty work,

455
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,812
or speak in haste.

456
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,067
That is not an easy task.

457
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,486
What an incredible example of devotion.

458
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,827
I was thinking the same thing.

459
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,748
Is it not true
that a truly faithful woman…

460
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,170
takes her own life
to follow after her husband?

461
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,396
My goodness…

462
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,982
You should not have come.

463
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,525
I regret asking you to come.

464
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,652
What is happening?

465
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,905
An ice-cold blizzard is cutting
through this battlefield.

466
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,158
The wives of the left councilor

467
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,535
and the interior minister are going at it.

468
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,665
They whisper sweet words of affection
to their daughter-in-laws

469
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,208
while pushing them to their graves.

470
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,459
They are bold enough to kill…

471
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,714
as the people watch.

472
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,052
What is so great
about the virtuous woman's gate?

473
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,305
If anything goes wrong here,

474
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,267
the Grim Reaper will take our hands
and lead us into the underworld.

475
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,144
Remember to keep your wits about you.

476
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,522
Yes, I will.

477
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,275
Let us bid for our safe return!

478
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,280
You must go take my place quickly.

479
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,328
What did I say, sir?

480
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,123
It is because you handed over
the swindler to the police bureau.

481
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,257
Are you nervous, sir?

482
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,426
Bi-chan.

483
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,053
The woman in the mourning dress.

484
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,806
What do you think of her?

485
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,890
Who, her?

486
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,687
One should keep their distance from her.

487
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,773
She looks cold enough
to bleed drops of ice, does she not?

488
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,444
The thought alone makes me shiver.

489
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,406
Stop staring.
What if your gaze meets hers?

490
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,075
Our gaze would never meet.

491
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,497
Go over there
and help with the unloading, Bi-chan.

492
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,415
Yes, sir.

493
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,386
Please join us. Everything is ready.

494
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,263
Mother, it is ready.

495
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,848
Yes, let us go.

496
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,894
Please stay here, Mother.
You must be weary.

497
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,937
I will do your share as well.

498
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,731
Very well.

499
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,483
Mother!

500
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,071
Please do not get up.

501
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,699
It is ready, so I will go by myself.

502
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,327
Please do not move a single muscle.

503
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,458
Wait.

504
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,087
You must put on your lady's veil.

505
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,507
But, if I am to work--

506
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,135
How can you show your bare face
when there are so many people?

507
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,806
When you give out the porridge,
hand it to the servants first,

508
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,016
or put it on the ground.

509
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,935
Yes, Mother.

510
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,164
What? This man again?

511
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,719
Just as I thought.
There's no way he would recognize me.

512
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,533
How is everything going?

513
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,827
It is always the same.

514
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,288
Transcribing and looking after Lady Cho.

515
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,291
What about you, Lady Jang?

516
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,834
The same old for me too.

517
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,711
Taking care of the guild

518
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,421
and picking up after Lady Cho.

519
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,969
Your 900 yang has gained a 50-yang profit.

520
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,180
You do not need to tell me that.

521
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,437
Here are 20 more I saved this month.

522
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,148
Please keep making more profits for me.

523
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,027
You have enough money to buy
two tile-roofed houses in Hanyang.

524
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,072
A clever girl like you should be
in charge of our guild's finances.

525
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,828
Please do not tell Lady Cho yet.

526
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,499
Wouldn't it be better to tell her?

527
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,461
It is not like she treats you
as her slave.

528
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,838
You can come and go as you wish.

529
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,007
What use would I have with a house?

530
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,927
Lady Cho would not be able
to visit me at will.

531
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,854
Line up, everyone!

532
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,628
This is so uncomfortable!

533
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,004
How can I work dressed like this?

534
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,422
Give me the bowl.

535
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,220
She has the look of success about her.

536
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,103
-That should be more than enough.
-Give me a little more.

537
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,063
Think about the person behind you.

538
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,420
Can I have just a little more?

539
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,213
Next.

540
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,174
You had your share.

541
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,260
Come over here.

542
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,681
You must stick to the right portion.

543
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,518
All we can give is porridge.

544
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,186
Must we be so frugal?

545
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,356
At that rate,
some might not get their share.

546
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,991
Wait for your turn.

547
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,367
Is there enough?

548
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,119
Do not worry. Wait for your turn.

549
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,495
I am so hungry today.

550
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
Wait for your turn!

551
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,332
Where are you, Suk?

552
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,959
Please help me find Suk!

553
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,962
Oh, my dear Suk…

554
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,882
Have you seen my granddaughter?

555
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,759
My granddaughter is missing!

556
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,760
Your granddaughter?

557
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,138
What should I do?

558
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,350
Please help me find my granddaughter.

559
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,353
Where could she be?

560
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,355
Pay no attention to her.

561
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,232
It is quite common
to see death in this place.

562
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,986
Or she may have run away
because life was so difficult.

563
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,075
She was crying yesterday from hunger.

564
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,411
That old woman
probably has not eaten anything.

565
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,705
How terrible.

566
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,291
She even lost her baby.

567
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,087
-Eat slowly.
-I feel so bad for her.

568
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,237
Your Majesty.

569
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,241
How is your fever?

570
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,119
I still have a headache and feel nauseous,

571
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,622
but I took some medicine,
so it will go away soon.

572
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,291
It has already been 15 years.

573
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,419
Is it still troubling you that much?

574
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,547
It seems like I have forgotten everything,

575
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,509
but the nightmares
still keep me up at this time of year.

576
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,679
It must be so pitiful

577
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,890
to witness my weakness.

578
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,561
I also had to part

579
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,189
with my grown son
when he passed away before me.

580
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,401
How can I not understand that sadness?

581
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:50,364
I have needlessly made
your heart heavy, Left Councilor.

582
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,955
I know that Your Majesty has been
extremely filial since childhood.

583
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,583
However, if you prolong your absence,

584
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,627
people will start to spread
all sorts of rumors.

585
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,465
Even though I am knowledgeable
about the affairs of the court,

586
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:12,428
there are matters that you must attend to
personally, Your Majesty.

587
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,515
I have always been

588
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,019
such a burden to you, Left Councilor.

589
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,938
Please do not think like that, sire.

590
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:27,902
I will always do my best
to support Your Majesty,

591
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,446
so if you make persistent efforts,

592
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,866
you will ultimately become a great king.

593
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,996
I understand.

594
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,665
Then,

595
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,709
please rest up today

596
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,669
and come to the royal palace tomorrow.

597
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,173
Yes, I will.

598
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,134
I shall take my leave, Your Majesty.

599
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,557
Your Majesty.

600
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,769
Royal Advisor Park is here.

601
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,938
Tell him to come in.

602
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,335
You look very tired, Your Majesty.

603
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,342
Thanks to the left councilor's
extreme concern,

604
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,637
I have no energy left for today.

605
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,807
You have been dealing with this
every day for decades.

606
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,350
Why are you feeling so tired now--

607
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,269
Hey, it is not easy
to do this every day, you know.

608
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,191
I hear your brother is investigating

609
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,026
Minister Yeom's stolen painting.

610
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,530
I was not aware that he was, sire.

611
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,949
How did you know?

612
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,285
I am still the king.

613
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,745
You are not the only ears that I have.

614
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,164
But,

615
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,083
if he succeeds in finding the painting,

616
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,545
would he not be able to transfer
from the Capital Guard to the court?

617
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,005
Please, Your Majesty.

618
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,091
Do you really wish
to see me wither away and die?

619
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,720
Look, Yun-hak.

620
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:23,142
No matter how hard your concern tries
to keep your brother at a distance,

621
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,352
there are some things
that you cannot avoid forever.

622
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,313
Your Majesty!

623
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,023
If that is your fate,

624
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,026
you cannot go against it.

625
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,947
Just as I am my father's son,

626
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,450
it would be the same for him.

627
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,538
I wish what happened to my brother then

628
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,708
was nothing but just a passing dream.

629
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,545
A dream, you say?

630
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,840
Perhaps,

631
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,135
I have been dreaming too.

632
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:03,182
I have been chasing for 15 years
but have found absolutely no evidence.

633
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,476
Perhaps I was wrong

634
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,189
about my father's death
from the beginning.

635
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,902
Your Majesty, the whereabouts
of the ones who disappeared

636
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,071
have still not been found yet.

637
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,156
We will hear back from them soon,

638
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,369
so please stay strong
and wait a little longer.

639
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,953
Very well.

640
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,920
I am grateful that you are here.

641
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,255
I am greatly obliged.

642
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,765
We will eat well today.

643
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,600
Yes, it has been a long time.

644
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,186
Be careful!

645
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,021
Thank you so much.

646
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,606
Eat up, my son.

647
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,817
They say hunger is the best sauce.

648
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,527
I wolfed it down.

649
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,112
-Are you not hungry?
-Eat the rice…

650
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:02,241
It is quite common
to see death in this place.

651
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,787
Or she may have run away
because life was so difficult.

652
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,705
Oh, my dear Suk…

653
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,835
Where on earth did you go?

654
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,047
I heard you have not eaten
a single bite today, ma'am.

655
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:23,971
Ma'am!

656
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,183
Get out quickly. It is too dangerous.

657
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,102
Let's go!

658
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,257
Oh, my goodness!

659
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,218
The roof caved in!

660
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,181
How did that happen?

661
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,482
Thank goodness. She is alive.

662
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,109
No one expected that to happen.

663
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,570
What is going on?

664
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,701
What have you done?

665
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,747
Didn't I tell you
to keep your composure several times?

666
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,211
-Were you hurt?
-No, I am fine.

667
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,630
The roof collapsed so suddenly.

668
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,840
My goodness!

669
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,310
Your daughter-in-law is so brave.

670
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:41,233
She demonstrated
her willingness to risk her life

671
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,026
for the sake of that elderly woman.

672
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,990
That was such an excellent example
of what a noblewoman should be.

673
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,245
If the queen dowager finds out,

674
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,872
I am sure she will praise her greatly.

675
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,920
Are you all right?

676
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,255
I am.

677
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,426
Let's go now.

678
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,844
Yes, Mother.

679
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,889
Take care.

680
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,315
-How is the old lady?
-She is all right.

681
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,108
What happened all of a sudden?

682
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,779
PIL INN

683
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,286
What is the matter?

684
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,163
One of them got away, sir.

685
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,291
What?

686
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,168
It was someone I brought from Sugu Gate--

687
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,504
Is there anything you can do right?

688
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,422
I am sorry, sir.

689
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,840
All you ever do is apologize.

690
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,217
Is that all you know
how to say with your mouth?

691
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,137
How many times have I told you

692
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,140
that they must be handed over
without any problems?

693
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,267
She could not have gone far.

694
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,478
I will go and bring her back now.

695
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:44,898
Brother!

696
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,112
What in the world did you do
to bruise your entire body?

697
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,238
It is nothing.

698
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,698
How can you say that?

699
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,623
Don't you know how to defend yourself?
Aren't you supposed to be an officer?

700
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,168
So…

701
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,754
Are you looking
for Minister Yeom's painting?

702
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,173
Have you also heard of the painting?

703
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,551
So, it really must be famous.

704
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,346
I found the painting.
I will return it tomorrow.

705
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,681
Did you catch the thief?

706
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,602
He was gutsy enough
to jump over the finance minister's wall.

707
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,896
I would like to meet the man myself.

708
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:30,277
I have not seen his face either.

709
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,363
A thief that you cannot catch?

710
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,408
He must be like the wind.

711
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,079
I wonder whose wall he will jump next.

712
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,999
Here you go.

713
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,678
Do not put in too much effort.

714
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,223
Do not stand out
or draw attention to yourself.

715
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,476
There are many officials
who live quiet lives.

716
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,852
Brother…

717
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,104
Do not try to overdo it.

718
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,279
I wonder what life would have been like
if I had not survived that night

719
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,616
and not become Park Su-ho.

720
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,913
If I had not lost my memories of that day…

721
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,333
would it have been all right

722
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,420
if I pushed myself a little further?

723
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,426
We will never know.

724
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:38,804
Who knows?

725
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,724
You could have ended up being a playboy,

726
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,560
spending all your time
chasing after girls.

727
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,232
I should go now.

728
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,197
Make sure you eat well.

729
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,865
I will.

730
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,910
Get home safe.

731
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,589
MEMORIAL TABLET OF YEO-HWA'S
HUSBAND AND SEOK JI-SEONG'S SON

732
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,968
Aren't you hungry?

733
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,846
Are you hungry, my lady?

734
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,767
I am not talking about me.

735
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,853
I wonder if ghosts get hungry too.

736
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,145
Who are you calling a ghost?

737
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,064
Lady Yoo will get mad if she hears!

738
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,776
That does not sound like anything new.

739
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,111
I get scolded every day, anyway.

740
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,447
What is wrong, my lady?

741
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,535
What is making you act
as if you have given up on everything?

742
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,080
Yeon-seon.

743
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,085
What do you think is
the most important thing in the world?

744
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,253
Money.

745
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,588
Why did I even bother?

746
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,090
Then, what about you?

747
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,803
Have you still not figured that out
after serving me for 12 years?

748
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,933
"The heart has its reasons
which reason knows not."

749
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,729
You say that all you care about is
having three meals a day.

750
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,024
But one day,
you give medicine to the elderly.

751
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,360
And you provide shelter
to a homeless child the next.

752
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,614
After that, you protect a runaway slave.

753
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,034
My life is entirely out of your concern.

754
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,285
So, how could I ever empathize?

755
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,871
And, what about now?

756
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,749
And now, we are here.

757
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,585
You are worried for your faceless husband,

758
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,671
wondering if his ghost is hungry or not.

759
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,089
Such is the life of the faithful Lady Cho!

760
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,592
You have quite the silver tongue.

761
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,970
So,

762
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,056
who are you concerned about today?

763
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,561
The people were so hungry

764
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,730
that they could barely stand in line.

765
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,982
All I could do was
offer them a bowl of porridge

766
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,235
as I paraded around gingerly
with a lady's veil over my head.

767
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,240
I must have looked so ridiculous.

768
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,703
I am concerned today
about how pitiful I have become.

769
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,457
You cannot help
everyone in the world, my lady.

770
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,793
Not even His Majesty could do that.

771
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,629
You must have forgotten
since it was so long ago.

772
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,590
If it were not for you,
I would have died long ago.

773
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:25,303
That day when you first ran away
from home…

774
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,640
Oh, no…

775
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,268
Oh, no…

776
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,853
Oh, no…

777
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,854
You are right.

778
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,440
That was a really hard day for me.

779
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,276
Having to cry all day

780
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,737
even though I was not sad.

781
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,615
My life seemed so sad and pitiful.

782
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,869
I was only twenty years old.

783
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,996
At that moment,

784
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,957
I finally had the courage

785
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,001
to jump over the wall

786
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,337
and run away without looking back.

787
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,137
Come on, I am not a bad person.

788
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,513
That was the moment

789
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,725
you happened to stumble upon me
as I was dying on the street.

790
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,101
Who on earth are you?

791
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,894
Who does she think she is?

792
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,688
What are you…

793
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,525
Just run away!

794
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,573
Are you all right? Wake up!

795
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,911
Do you want some?

796
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,883
You could not leave me on the streets,

797
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,552
nor could you take off with me,

798
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,179
so you returned to this house.

799
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,183
This is for you, Yeon-seon.

800
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,309
THE BIOGRAPHY OF HONG GIL-DONG

801
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,147
Isn't reading and writing useless for me?

802
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,192
How is it useless? Knowing how to read

803
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,611
will expand your horizons.

804
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,750
Why? Is it not going well?

805
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,129
I will give you one yang
for each piece of embroidery.

806
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,799
You feed me three times a day, my lady.

807
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,009
What use would I have for money?

808
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,179
One day, I will no longer be by your side.

809
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,223
It will allow you to do many things.

810
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,734
My lady,

811
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,153
you are doing what you do best.

812
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,989
You are right.

813
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,991
Thanks for the encouragement.

814
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,121
You must have had a hard day today.
You should go and rest.

815
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,332
You should be more concerned
about Lady Yoo tomorrow.

816
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,542
She will be waiting for you.

817
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,420
-What?
-You will have to face the music tomorrow.

818
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,257
Why must you always ruin the moment?

819
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,341
That is your reality.

820
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,970
Oh, Yeon-seon…

821
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,016
when I close my eyes,
it looks just like my future.

822
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,270
I cannot see anything.

823
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,771
There is nothing there!

824
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,068
Have you seen my granddaughter?

825
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,863
My granddaughter is missing!

826
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,074
I must go out.

827
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,325
Where will you go?

828
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,412
I cannot stop thinking
about the old woman.

829
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,123
Her granddaughter is missing,
and her house has collapsed.

830
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,416
She has been made homeless.

831
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,884
RELIEF EFFORT

832
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,643
What is this?

833
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,566
Where did all the rice go?
There was so much earlier.

834
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,942
You saw them lining up earlier.

835
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,777
They must have finished it all.

836
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:14,157
My wife is pregnant
but has not eaten anything.

837
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,077
I guess we will have to wait
until the next relief effort.

838
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,997
It will not be
anything worth eating, anyway.

839
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,250
It will be full of dirt
and rocks like before.

840
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,466
Is that not rice?

841
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,468
-Rice?
-Is it really?

842
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,469
Let's see.

843
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:36,930
-It is rice!
-It is rice!

844
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,098
Hurry up and put it in.

845
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,935
-How could this be?
-We are so lucky!

846
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,728
Why is there rice on the ground?

847
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,522
What is going on?

848
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,191
-The heavens must have sent it.
-That must be it!

849
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,151
We are saved!

850
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,414
Would you look at how fresh it is?

851
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,251
That is right. Look how shiny it is.

852
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,919
Look how nice it is.

853
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,257
Hold on. He is wearing a mask.

854
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,342
Is he going to kill us?

855
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,720
What are you doing there?

856
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,723
We are sorry.

857
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,060
We must have lost our minds
when we saw the rice.

858
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,315
How long has that hole been there for?

859
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,404
Wait a second!

860
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,158
Do you know an old woman
who lost her granddaughter?

861
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:41,869
An old woman?

862
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,999
There was that granny who was saying
her granddaughter was gone.

863
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,417
Where is she now?

864
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,669
Her house collapsed,
and she is not in her right mind.

865
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,296
She is staying across the street.

866
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,758
Let's go.

867
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,302
Wait!

868
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,307
Do you know
when her granddaughter disappeared?

869
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:04,892
When was that?

870
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,814
It is quite often
that kids go missing around here.

871
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,190
Were there more of them?

872
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,445
There were quite a few.

873
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,864
-There are many.
-That is right.

874
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,742
-It is pretty common.
-There are lots of them.

875
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,118
It happens a lot!

876
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,162
How is it that you did not know?

877
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,211
I am sure she returned here.

878
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,546
Find her!

879
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,714
Yes, sir.

880
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:40,845
Who are you?

881
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,209
Was there no one there?

882
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,044
There were no kids in the area.

883
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,004
You go that way.

884
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,006
And you can come with me this…

885
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,640
I did not expect you to come.

886
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,267
They say enemies meet on a new bridge.

887
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,895
Don't you mean a "narrow bridge"?

888
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,607
I will surely take you down tonight.

889
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,235
I am not the type of person
to be easily caught.

890
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,655
I have no business with you,
nor do I wish to fight.

891
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,240
Just carry on as you were.

892
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,833
There you are!

893
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,210
Please let me go, Mister!

894
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,294
Please!

895
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,298
Do not hurt me. I beg you, Mister.

896
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,884
Please let me go. Please?

897
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:03,845
Please!

898
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,100
Are you lot here to take away this kid?

899
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,103
Now, that is a different story.

900
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,382
Has anyone seen my granddaughter?

901
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,136
-Have you seen her anywhere?
-Grandma!

902
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,429
There you are, Suk!

903
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,638
My baby!

904
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,140
-Come here!
-Grandma!

905
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,184
Suk!

906
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,270
What are you trying to pull?

907
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,438
Give me the girl.

908
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,939
Grandma…

909
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,149
Stay still.

910
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,442
I will try to save her.

911
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,820
Very well.

912
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,114
Take me in her place.

913
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,243
Wasn't I your target from the beginning?

914
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,913
Did you come here to catch that man?

915
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,415
I told you to hand her over.

916
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,876
I am telling you
that I would be willing to turn myself in.

917
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,509
Hold it right there!

918
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,445
Who in the world is that?

919
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,918
EPILOGUE

920
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,923
Oh, no.

921
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:11,472
Get a grip, Yeo-hwa. Wake up!

922
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,983
SIX-PACK ABS

923
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,405
SIX-PACK ABS

924
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,053
What is wrong with me?

925
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,306
My goodness.

926
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,835
Why must you come after me?

927
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,961
I became curious.

928
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,254
I wondered who could be

929
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,091
so bold in the presence
of a superintendent.

930
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,928
What? The masked man appeared
and took the child?

931
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,513
Go and find out
who the masked man is at once.

932
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:39,936
Are you saying this may be more
than a kidnapping of a single child?

933
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,313
You could even become
a target to Kang Pil-jik.

934
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:45,316
We need someone to tie off loose ends.

935
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,859
If someone were to break the law,

936
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,028
would you arrest them,
no matter who they were?

937
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,324
I only prepared this
for the worst possible scenario.

938
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,705
