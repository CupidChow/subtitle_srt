1
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,578
Wait!

2
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,704
Wait a second.

3
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,207
Do you know a man named Cho Seong-hu?

4
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,921
Cho Seong-hu is dead.

5
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,593
I found him one year after he disappeared…

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,889
and killed him myself.

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,558
I am Capital Guard Superintendent Park.

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,351
I have an urgent report for Your Majesty.

9
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,574
She is not breathing.

10
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,998
Please wait!

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,419
What did you just tell me?

12
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,297
-Yeo-hwa.
-My lady.

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,340
Let me go!

14
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,801
I must hear what Madam Oh said.

15
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,719
What did you say to me, Madam Oh?

16
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,138
How dare you act so impolitely
in front of His Majesty?

17
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,146
Listen, all!

18
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,485
All of this was

19
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,821
due to my negligence.

20
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,574
You shall return to your home.

21
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,750
I will uncover the truth
of what happened here today at all costs.

22
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,962
Until then…

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,050
no one is allowed to act carelessly.

24
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,098
You have made a lot of preparations,
unlike your usual self, sire.

25
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,726
Why did you not simply
arrest me for questioning

26
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,520
rather than go to all of this trouble?

27
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,112
Have you forgotten
what Madam Oh testified with her death?

28
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,617
The circumstances of how you poisoned
my father have come to light.

29
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,119
How can you still be so shameless?

30
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,997
I told you I know nothing of the matter,
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,751
And even if it were true,

32
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,086
there is no way to prove it

33
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,714
now that Madam Oh is dead.

34
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,925
Left Councilor.

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,135
Do you not fear the heavens?

36
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,262
Royal Advisor Park.

37
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,433
If you wish
to at least preserve His Majesty's life,

38
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,727
please guide him onto the right path.

39
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,898
How dare you try to oppose me
with such a measly trick?

40
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,240
There is a story about a monkey

41
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,868
that drowned while trying to grab
the moon's reflection in a lake.

42
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,706
Can you not see that Your Majesty is
a monkey who does not know his place?

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,461
How dare you say that to your king?

44
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,215
How can you be exactly the same
as the foolish former king?

45
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,051
Do not speak of my father!

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
My father…

47
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,309
wanted to build a wonderful nation

48
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,645
where all of the people could thrive.

49
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:40,113
"A nation where all of the people
can thrive," you say?

50
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,158
So,

51
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,413
is there no social class
in the world Your Majesty dreams of?

52
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,499
A world where lowly commoners
can take the state exam,

53
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,042
and slaves can become officials?

54
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,879
Have you thought about what effect
that would have on this nation?

55
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,089
If everyone was allowed

56
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,009
to live to the best of their ability

57
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
regardless of their social status,

58
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,973
the nation would grow stronger
in the future.

59
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,477
Did you just say,
"regardless of their social status"?

60
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,355
Your Majesty.

61
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,941
You also did nothing to deserve to be king

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,028
except for being born
as the former king's eldest son.

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,823
Knowing our place

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,244
and maintaining the positions
we were born into is only natural.

65
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,664
You must not forget the way of the world.

66
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,460
If you try to go against it, in the end,

67
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:40,506
you will have to surrender
your position first, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,353
Brother…

69
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,399
That was pretty good.

70
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,777
You should be able
to protect yourself now.

71
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,279
It is not your turn to stand guard today.

72
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,742
I will have a sword cane made
just for you one day.

73
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,789
Please do not go.

74
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,624
You must not go.

75
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,752
Brother.

76
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,920
Brother!

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,006
Are you all right?

78
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,344
My lady.

79
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,138
Where is Father?

80
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,476
He has not returned home yet.

81
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,111
By the way,

82
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,156
Superintendent Park said
he had urgent news to tell you.

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,243
He said he would wait for you
at the rental bookstore.

84
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,418
RENTAL BOOKSTORE

85
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,187
Are you all right?

86
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,610
Madam Oh said…

87
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,906
that my father-in-law killed my brother.

88
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,661
How could he do such a thing?

89
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,621
How could he

90
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,790
kill my brother

91
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,836
and look at me with such warmth?

92
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,130
It cannot be.

93
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,508
I am sure Madam Oh was mistaken.

94
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,971
That is what I was going to tell you.

95
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,349
Kang Pil-jik confessed

96
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,060
to killing your brother…

97
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,314
under the order

98
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,317
of the left councilor.

99
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,117
Lady Cho!

100
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,914
Mother.

101
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,499
Do you know

102
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,293
anything about what happened today?

103
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,382
How could I know what goes on
beyond these walls?

104
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,593
My only hope…

105
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,933
is that nothing happens to you or Yeo-hwa.

106
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,352
Mother.

107
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,855
What is the meaning
of my wife's brother going missing?

108
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,317
He disappeared a few months
before the wedding

109
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,027
and has not been heard from since.

110
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,532
She has not once heard from him
in over a decade,

111
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,243
but she believes he is still alive

112
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,286
and goes to pray for him every year.

113
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,122
She was able to endure
those difficult and harsh times

114
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,292
only because she awaited
the return of her brother.

115
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,878
I believe

116
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,798
that is what gave her strength to go on.

117
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,691
Did you

118
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,651
kill Cho Seong-hu?

119
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,111
Is anyone out there?

120
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,905
Superintendent!

121
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,992
Tell me when,

122
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,952
where,

123
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,871
and how you killed Cho Seong-hu.

124
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,627
After a year of searching for him,

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,381
we spotted him in Bukchon.

126
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,718
We chased after him

127
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,512
to the forest behind Sodang Valley--

128
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,014
My brother

129
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,182
came to Bukchon?

130
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,144
Father.

131
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,479
Hello, Yeo-hwa.

132
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,399
Are you not too hot?

133
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,818
No, I am all right.

134
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,237
Is there still no news of your brother?

135
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,114
No, not yet.

136
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,450
I am also looking as hard as I can.

137
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,120
He knew he would die if he got caught,

138
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,080
but he still came back

139
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,750
to see his sister.

140
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,502
So, he came back.

141
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,339
He came back.

142
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,681
When you killed him,

143
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,975
was…

144
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,021
the left councilor there?

145
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,039
Where are you going?

146
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,750
Do not follow me.

147
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,087
I will go with you.

148
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,381
I wish to be alone.

149
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,121
Did you die…

150
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,000
because of me in the end?

151
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,587
You came to see me and…

152
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, no…

153
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,849
I was in an unfamiliar place
all by myself.

154
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,769
When my brother died,
you should have just died too!

155
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,397
Despite spending my days
filled with sorrow,

156
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,150
the only reason I was able
to stand strong and endure,

157
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,112
gladly doing what I could,

158
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,449
is because I awaited the day…

159
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
to see you again as Cho Yeo-hwa,

160
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,582
your proud sister who lived confidently.

161
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,086
-Father.
-Yes.

162
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,090
Let us wait for him together.

163
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,718
How can the man I served as a parent

164
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,095
be the enemy who took your life?

165
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,140
How could the heavens

166
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,101
be this cruel to me?

167
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,316
What reason do I have…

168
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,819
to carry on living now?

169
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,162
Now,

170
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,706
I will complete…

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,002
my final task.

172
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,223
With Madam Oh now dead,

173
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,060
there is no evidence left.

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,109
-Stop.
-My lord.

175
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,069
My lord!

176
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,949
Who are you?

177
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,659
Did you truly

178
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,786
kill Cho Seong-hu?

179
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,873
How on earth do you know him?

180
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,918
Even though you killed him,

181
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,588
did you shamelessly pretend
that he was still alive?

182
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,093
I will show you who I am.

183
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,971
You will get to see

184
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,307
exactly what you have done.

185
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,945
My lord! Let us go.

186
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,281
Come, my lord.

187
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,301
Why are you stopping me?

188
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
Do you intend to die here?

189
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,888
Are you trying to give up everything

190
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,140
by exposing your identity
and killing Lord Seok?

191
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,308
Yes, I am!

192
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,601
I will kill that man

193
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,519
and simply pay the price.

194
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,355
Do you and His Majesty
not want to do the same?

195
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,273
I will end this!

196
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,526
But for what reason are you stopping me?

197
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,569
I am the same!

198
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,530
I think about killing Lord Seok

199
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,407
and sacrificing my life
to avenge my parents

200
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,742
dozens of times a day!

201
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,493
However,

202
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,537
I cannot do that.

203
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,081
Would your brother

204
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,460
truly want you to die to avenge him?

205
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,512
If that is

206
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,932
the only way to end this…

207
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,477
then I will do it.

208
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,646
So, please

209
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,316
do not harm yourself, my lady.

210
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,261
You are late, my lord.

211
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,142
You must have been very shocked today.

212
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,894
Are you all right?

213
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,813
Yes.

214
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,398
My lady.

215
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,485
All you have to do
is take good care of household affairs.

216
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,989
Do not worry about what goes on outside.

217
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,824
Yes, my lord.

218
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,997
You must be tired. Go inside and rest.

219
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,816
I heard you were attacked by the mask.

220
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,403
Park Su-ho also showed up there.

221
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,991
I am certain they are working together.

222
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,952
What on earth is going on?

223
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,837
Bring Prince An-san to the capital.

224
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,630
Pardon?

225
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,469
His Majesty will know better than anyone

226
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,722
what it means to bring
Prince An-san to the capital.

227
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,474
He is part of the royal family,

228
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,643
but he is of the collateral line
and is only six years old.

229
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,980
I decide who will become king anyway.

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,942
It does not matter
as long as he has royal blood.

231
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:49,860
Besides…

232
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,698
the younger he is, the better.

233
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,748
I believed

234
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,877
that my brother was alive all along.

235
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,839
There was a secret hiding spot

236
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,802
at the place
where we practiced martial arts.

237
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,512
Before my wedding,

238
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,223
I left a letter there.

239
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,768
When I went back to that spot,

240
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,312
the letter was gone,

241
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,524
and this sword lay there instead.

242
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,237
So, I believed that my brother was alive.

243
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,658
He probably intended…

244
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,912
to leave this sword for me.

245
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,419
I will have a sword cane made
just for you one day.

246
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,756
A secretive and special sword
that suits you perfectly.

247
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,424
A special sword?

248
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,082
To my one and only sister, Yeo-hwa.

249
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,710
If you are reading this letter,

250
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,254
that means I am no longer by your side.

251
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,591
Please forgive your awful brother

252
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,010
for breaking his promise to return.

253
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,431
Are you living the life you want now?

254
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,641
Are you living your life

255
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,393
gladly doing what you want?

256
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,812
If the crown prince

257
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,773
has safely ascended the throne,

258
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,818
please give him the other letter.

259
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,404
And

260
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,240
do not think of your brother anymore,

261
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,410
who failed to protect you
and only left you

262
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,204
with a heavy burden.

263
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,956
Kang Pil-jik has been murdered!

264
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
Who are you?

265
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,514
I will enter for a moment.

266
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,899
What is it?

267
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,111
I wish to ask you about what happened
at the palace yesterday.

268
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,862
It is none of your concern.

269
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,072
Did you know

270
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,993
that the tea had been poisoned?

271
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,706
How would I know that?

272
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,874
If you had known,

273
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,168
would you have stopped me
before I drank it?

274
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,965
You would not have.

275
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,927
Did you come in here
to ask such a useless question?

276
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,514
You should have already become
a state official by now.

277
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,641
Instead, you wallow in emotions
like a woman.

278
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,393
When will you pull yourself together?

279
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,894
I may not know politics,

280
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,689
but I know my duties to my family.

281
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,650
You abandoned your parents
and lived as you pleased.

282
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,528
Are you not ashamed
to speak about family now?

283
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,281
All of this is for the sake of our family,

284
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,991
but of course, you would not know.

285
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,369
What on earth are you trying to gain
by risking the lives of your family?

286
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
I hope

287
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,916
that my mother and wife
do not have to suffer again.

288
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,795
That is my last request as your son.

289
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,892
You are eating so heartily.

290
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,646
I must eat.

291
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,106
I must eat my fill

292
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,441
and do what I have to do.

293
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,526
Is it not just the letter

294
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,820
that you must deliver to His Majesty?

295
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,447
I will do that,

296
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,782
as well as other things.

297
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,036
I heard you crying all night,

298
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,289
so I worried
that you might be sick in bed.

299
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,042
It seems I still do not know
enough about you.

300
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,171
I should have thought about
what trouble you would cause next.

301
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,008
All right.

302
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,927
I will get going now.

303
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,388
Please be careful.

304
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,099
You are still Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

305
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,642
What will you do

306
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,228
if someone catches you
wandering Unjong Street?

307
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,979
Do not worry.

308
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,981
I have lived with him for 15 years.

309
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,818
He would not kill me
for staying out for one night.

310
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,821
But…

311
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,450
I wish she were sick instead.

312
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,911
I am so anxious I cannot take it.

313
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,206
GEONSEON GATE

314
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,296
What is it you had to tell me?

315
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,466
Yes, that is…

316
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,761
I personally saw the person

317
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,139
who killed Kang Pil-jik.

318
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,849
Last night,

319
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,976
a suspicious masked figure

320
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,520
snuck into the Capital Guard.

321
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,063
A masked figure, you say?

322
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,523
Yes, my lord.

323
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,774
I heard

324
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,443
what the mask said
as he killed Kang Pil-jik.

325
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,241
I thought I should tell you, my lord.

326
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,868
What did he say?

327
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,664
He said something
about avenging Cho Seong-hu.

328
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,085
He said he would give
a piece of evidence to His Majesty

329
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,090
and not let you get away
with what happened on that day.

330
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,091
Your Majesty.

331
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,427
I, Cho Yeo-hwa,

332
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,054
make your acquaintance.

333
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,764
Did you ask to see me?

334
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,852
You were searching for my brother,
Cho Seong-hu.

335
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,896
But the left councilor

336
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,357
has already killed him.

337
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,028
The royal advisor told me.

338
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,280
I am

339
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,367
so terribly sorry.

340
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,120
Now that the evidence of treason
that my brother had is gone,

341
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,456
what do you plan to do from now on?

342
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,380
I dare to ask Your Majesty again.

343
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,132
When you find the evidence of treason,

344
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,593
what do you plan on doing afterward?

345
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,304
I planned to get rid of the left councilor

346
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,432
and follow my father's will

347
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,019
to build a nation
where all people can thrive.

348
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,105
If you could not find any evidence,

349
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,732
did you plan to do nothing

350
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,110
and simply wait around?

351
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,449
You must have thought I was such a coward.

352
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,452
Since the moment you ascended the throne,

353
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,745
I lived

354
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,417
in the lowliest of places
as a widow of Joseon.

355
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,169
Do you know

356
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,089
how I lived each day?

357
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,804
Aside from missing
and crying aloud for my husband,

358
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,306
what could I do?

359
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,643
I thought about what I could do every day,

360
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,521
and eventually put on a mask
and jumped over the wall.

361
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,108
Because even if I died one day,

362
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,152
I would have been nothing

363
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,654
if I had not done anything.

364
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,409
I would have no reason
to live if I did nothing,

365
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,452
so I did my best

366
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,829
to carry on living.

367
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,085
Have you been spending your days

368
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,712
thinking of ways

369
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,673
to help the people of the nation each day

370
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,842
as you sat on your throne?

371
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,018
Aside from catching Lord Seok
and revealing the truth of that day,

372
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,313
I had forgotten
my daily duties as the king.

373
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,775
I should have thought of them…

374
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,404
every single day.

375
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,659
I had forgotten such an obvious thing.

376
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,082
What a foolish king I am.

377
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,085
I feel truly sorry…

378
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
and ashamed for my actions.

379
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,549
I believe

380
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,762
that you will become
a sage king, Your Majesty.

381
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,983
I apologize, Your Majesty.

382
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,486
I have wielded a sword in your presence.

383
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,780
This sword is

384
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,200
the only thing my brother left to me.

385
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,993
Within it,

386
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,872
there is a letter
my brother guarded with his life.

387
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,958
Please

388
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,335
become a king

389
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,796
who can gladly admit his faults

390
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,424
and help people like me

391
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,385
not give up hope of living

392
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,762
in a better world.

393
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,313
My beloved Crown Prince So.

394
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,066
If something bad happens to me,

395
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,443
it is certainly

396
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,988
the doing of the traitor Seok Ji-seong.

397
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,200
You must preserve your life

398
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,077
and ascend the throne.

399
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,164
You must finish what I could not

400
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,752
and become a strong ruler

401
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,087
who creates a new world

402
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,883
where all the people can dream.

403
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,188
No matter what…

404
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,985
I will become a strong ruler

405
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,280
and carry out what you willed, Father.

406
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,376
CAPITAL GUARD

407
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,631
How did I get involved in such a thing?

408
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,803
I thought my job
would be nothing but smooth sailing.

409
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:50,431
His Majesty will never forget
your contribution, Captain Hwang.

410
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,603
You see, I have six children.

411
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,315
My youngest daughter is still unmarried.

412
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,779
I am so very scared.

413
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,323
Do not worry.

414
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,367
Everything will work out.

415
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,953
You did perfectly this morning, too.

416
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,707
You are one to talk.

417
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,835
You were perfect
at pretending to be the mask.

418
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,839
What happened to Kang Pil-jik?

419
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,017
Please take me out now.

420
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,061
-I can barely breathe.
-Boss?

421
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,646
Is that you, Mansik?

422
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,689
Boss!

423
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,025
Shall we just leave them?

424
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,360
I was considering the same thing.

425
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,778
I did everything you said.

426
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,030
Please save me.

427
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,782
I will save you since you confessed.

428
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,661
But you must live as a butcher
for the rest of your life.

429
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,623
-Take them away.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,249
Royal Advisor…

431
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,710
-Sir!
-Boss.

432
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,632
What do you think
the left councilor will do?

433
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,718
He thinks the mask and I are a team,

434
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,553
so he will likely follow me.

435
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,391
I am His Majesty's closest aide.

436
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,602
He will surely follow me.

437
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,438
We will see once we leave.

438
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,154
Is this enough for Lord Seok
to take the bait?

439
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,075
Yes. We are being followed as expected.

440
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,870
There seem to be about five men.

441
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,915
I cannot sense them at all.

442
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,792
There are as many as five?

443
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,795
-Brother.
-Yes?

444
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,215
You do know how to use a sword, right?

445
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,717
I am the nation's royal advisor.

446
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,469
Do not worry.

447
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,222
I can protect myself.

448
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,060
Just in case.

449
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,775
What is that?

450
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,320
Please deliver this to His Majesty.

451
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,738
Stop!

452
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,198
Hand over the letter.

453
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,787
I cannot do that.

454
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,191
I got the letter.

455
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,408
It is done.

456
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,041
Would you not agree
that I could be a superintendent now?

457
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,383
My lord.

458
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,928
This is it.

459
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,579
HUIJEONGDANG HALL

460
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,919
Your Majesty.

461
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,255
The left councilor has come
to the royal palace.

462
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,719
Your Majesty.

463
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,097
I, Prince An-san, greet you.

464
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,600
PRINCE AN-SAN:
LEE SO'S FIRST COUSIN THREE TIMES REMOVED

465
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,895
Left Councilor.

466
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,315
What are you doing all of a sudden?

467
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,360
Why did you bring Prince An-san here?

468
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,613
You must show a firm will

469
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,074
to keep the throne, Your Majesty.

470
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,993
Only then can I serve you,

471
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,162
and this is my way
of showing you my intentions.

472
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,997
A firm will, you say?

473
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,624
Your Majesty.

474
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,211
You must immediately
dethrone the queen dowager.

475
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,506
Madam Oh dared try to poison Your Majesty,

476
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,758
and she died to escape her crime.

477
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,511
You must make the queen dowager
take responsibility.

478
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,805
-Left Councilor!
-If not,

479
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,641
will you pass down the throne

480
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,602
to young Prince An-san here?

481
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,416
Your Majesty,
I have summoned all of the royal court.

482
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,545
Summoning the royal court
at this early hour?

483
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,090
Let them enter.

484
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,009
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

485
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,364
Left Councilor.

486
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,658
Is this not Prince An-san?

487
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,205
Your Majesty.

488
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,499
Now that I have delivered my message,

489
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,920
I will escort Prince An-san and go.

490
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,840
Stop right there, Left Councilor.

491
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,221
Someone is here to meet you.

492
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,934
Let them enter.

493
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,323
-A woman?
-What is this?

494
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,161
-A woman cannot be here.
-How dare she?

495
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,205
What on earth is going on?

496
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,623
This is absurd.

497
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,633
Outrageous.

498
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,348
Your Majesty.

499
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,310
How can you allow a woman
in the royal palace?

500
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,858
Why are you here?

501
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,083
Explain why you are here, Lady Cho.

502
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,671
I am

503
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,132
Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

504
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,801
How dare you enter this place?

505
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,469
I am also the sister

506
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,764
of Cho Seong-hu,
a soldier of the King's Guard

507
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,225
who received the former king's
last secret order.

508
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,690
Fifteen years ago,

509
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,067
after my brother disappeared,

510
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,403
I married into the Seok family.

511
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,030
My husband died on our wedding day,

512
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,407
so I have been a widow since then.

513
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,616
Shut your mouth!

514
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,453
During this time,

515
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,246
my life as a widow was not all bad,

516
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,040
thanks to my father-in-law,

517
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,792
who was a renowned councilor
and kind person.

518
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,210
Your Majesty.

519
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,463
How could you summon court officials

520
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,506
to listen to a mere woman's complaint?

521
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,924
That is right.

522
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,676
Here and now,

523
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,887
this mere woman

524
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,847
intends to report

525
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,016
her father-in-law.

526
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,686
-What?
-What is she saying?

527
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,231
First.

528
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,942
To find my brother,

529
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,028
he held me hostage as his daughter-in-law

530
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,279
and killed Cho Seong-hu.

531
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,281
Second.

532
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,368
He slaughtered General Im Gang's
entire family.

533
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,494
Enough!

534
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,245
Im Gang?

535
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,664
The former general of the king's guard?

536
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,710
Was his whole family not killed
by a group of outlaws?

537
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,587
-Yes.
-That is right.

538
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,298
Let them enter.

539
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,360
I am General Im Gang's son,

540
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,403
Im Hyeon-jae.

541
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,698
I have come to see Your Majesty
as that day's witness.

542
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,577
Was his whole family not killed?

543
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,246
That is also what I heard.

544
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,749
Is he not Park Su-ho,

545
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,709
the chief scholar's adopted son?

546
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,046
Royal Advisor.

547
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,674
Is he not your brother?

548
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,011
Royal Advisor.

549
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,264
Explain how this happened.

550
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,145
On the night of the former king's passing
15 years ago,

552
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,896
I received an order from the king

553
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,274
to save the dying general's young son,

554
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,443
so I brought him to my home.

555
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,614
When that tragic incident happened
to a loyal subject like Im Gang,

556
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,949
it broke my heart.

557
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,326
To think his son was alive…

558
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,333
Lastly,

559
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,877
-the former king--
-Silence!

560
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,132
Do you want to be kicked out of our home?

561
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,052
Father.

562
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,932
I came here prepared to die.

563
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,767
Do you think

564
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,145
I would be afraid of getting kicked out?

565
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,617
This sword

566
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,994
was left to me by my brother.

567
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,370
Inside it

568
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,457
are the former king's dying words

569
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,834
proving Lord Seok is a traitor.

570
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,275
Left Councilor Seok Ji-seong

571
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,361
poisoned the former king

572
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,696
and killed General Im Gang

573
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,365
and my brother,

574
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,076
who received the former king's
royal edict.

575
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,161
I,

576
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,497
Im Hyeon-jae,

577
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,208
and this letter

578
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,794
are all evidence of that.

579
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,764
As the daughter-in-law
of the traitor Lord Seok,

580
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,558
I will gladly accept punishment

581
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,561
alongside my father-in-law.

582
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,397
What is the meaning of this,
Left Councilor?

583
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,275
The former king was poisoned?

584
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,609
Did you kill Im Gang?

585
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,528
Say something.

586
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,030
For what other reason
would your daughter-in-law

587
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,449
risk her life to say those things?

588
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,120
I heard Madam Oh also died
after drinking poisoned tea.

589
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,955
Were the rumors true?

590
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,206
So what?

591
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,629
Even if it were true,
what would be the problem?

592
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,384
It was all for the sake
of protecting this nation.

593
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,055
If I had not made the agonizing choice
to get rid of the former king,

594
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,266
where would you be right now?

595
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,184
And what about this nation?

596
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,896
What would have become of it all?

597
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,284
Father.

598
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,871
You have said quite enough.

599
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,518
You are…

600
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,811
Yes, Father.

601
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,271
It was me.

602
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:19,823
What is she doing?

603
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,172
Perhaps I should have

604
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,175
cut off your head that night.

605
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,760
Do not make me reconsider, Father.

606
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,762
How could you…

607
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,763
Your Majesty.

608
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,599
Please give your royal command.

609
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,893
I have a lot to discuss

610
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,312
with my father-in-law privately.

611
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,314
Guards.

612
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,901
Arrest the traitor Seok Ji-seong at once!

613
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,486
-Yes, sire!
-Yes, sire!

614
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,707
Do not lay a finger on me!

615
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,898
It was all to protect the nobility.

616
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,526
We are the foundation of this nation.

617
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,280
We have held these positions
for generations.

618
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,659
It is right that our descendants
hold them after us.

619
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,786
I was only protecting them.

620
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,500
You must bear this in mind.

621
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,211
The nation of Joseon

622
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,590
belongs to the nobility.

623
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,283
Who on earth are you?

624
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,202
Have you already forgotten

625
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,953
who I am?

626
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,002
I am Cho Yeo-hwa,

627
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,505
daughter-in-law of the left councilor.

628
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,741
HODU PAVILION

629
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,869
While you killed the former king

630
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,704
and supported

631
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,749
Kang Pil-jik and Madam Oh
to try and hide it,

632
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,709
your daughter-in-law

633
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,045
jumped over the wall every night,

634
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,923
risking her life to fight them.

635
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,550
However,

636
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,135
there was only one thing I did not do.

637
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,930
Consider yourself lucky

638
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,140
that I did not

639
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:37,020
punish you with my sword myself.

640
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,314
I am someone

641
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,817
who takes action before the law does.

642
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,943
But just this once,

643
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,071
I will watch you

644
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,615
pay for your crimes

645
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,033
in accordance

646
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,786
with the law of the nation.

647
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,052
The criminal Seok Ji-seong

648
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:13,307
ordered the poisoning of the former king
and damaged the royal edict.

649
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,435
He then slaughtered
General Im Gang and his family

650
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,061
and killed Cho Seong-hu

651
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,564
to destroy evidence of his treason.

652
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:23,900
Mother!

653
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,778
Father was just arrested

654
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,905
for the crime of treason.

655
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,407
Treason?

656
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,160
Mother.

657
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,371
Criminal Seok Ji-seong
will be dismissed from his post

658
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,998
and demoted to the lowest class.

659
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,335
He will receive 100 beatings
and be confined on Bogil Island.

660
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,003
CONFINEMENT WITHIN
THORN FENCES TO PREVENT ESCAPE

661
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,757
I order him to repent his crimes
until the day he dies.

662
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:52,012
Carry out the order immediately.

663
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,639
-Yes, sire!
-Yes, sire!

664
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,606
Your Majesty, I asked to see you

665
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,692
because I dare to have a request.

666
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,653
Tell me whatever it may be.

667
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:11,281
I will always listen
to what you have to say.

668
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,200
Your Majesty.

669
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,370
I dare to ask you to spare the lives

670
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,457
of the other family members who were
already hurt by my father-in-law's crimes.

671
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,127
I was deceived by him my whole life

672
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,963
and they were no different
and have no involvement in any of this.

673
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,719
As you said, his family knew nothing

674
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,805
and must be innocent.

675
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,434
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

676
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,662
HWAYEON

677
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,288
This is too harsh.

678
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,666
A divorced woman?

679
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,459
First, she was a widow,

680
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,421
and now she must live
the rest of her life as a divorced woman!

681
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,048
There is nothing I can do
about this situation.

682
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,134
She was stuck at home to cry all day,

683
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,636
and now she will be branded
as a divorced woman.

684
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,516
I wanted to run Myeongdo Inn with her
once she left that house.

685
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,143
Whether she is widowed or divorced,

686
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,687
she will still be treated poorly
in Joseon.

687
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,148
After everything she has been through,

688
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,649
she will end up living without a name.

689
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,446
I will take Lady Cho
and run away to Qing or anywhere else.

690
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,948
I blame the left councilor's family for…

691
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,661
Hello, sir.

692
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,705
-Yes.
-Goodness.

693
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,290
Well, then.

694
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,628
I actually came

695
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,006
because I wondered
what my wife plans to do.

696
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,549
Where is she?

697
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,594
She went out early this morning.

698
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,304
I do not know where she went.

699
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,515
Goodness.

700
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,936
What are you all gathered here for?

701
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,858
What brings you here, Royal Advisor?

702
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,781
I was also curious
about Lady Cho's future plans.

703
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,415
I am urgently needed at the palace.

704
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,083
I will be gone for a few days.

705
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,899
What brings you here?

706
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,984
I thought you would be here.

707
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,155
Do you remember

708
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,992
the question you asked me a long time ago?

709
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,955
If I found out what happened to my brother

710
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,250
and exposed all of Lord Seok's crimes,

711
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,336
you asked me what I would do next.

712
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,548
Have you

713
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,299
thought about it?

714
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,097
When everything is done,

715
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,266
who will I live as?

716
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,184
What will I live for?

717
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,855
Not as someone's daughter-in-law

718
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,773
or married to a man as his wife.

719
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,735
Not even as the mask in the moonlight.

720
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,782
But I realized

721
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,660
that even after everything was done,

722
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,831
the fact that I was
the Seok family's daughter-in-law

723
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,458
would never change.

724
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,422
Even if I were to get divorced,

725
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,550
I was the daughter-in-law
of a noble family.

726
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,759
So, my position

727
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,345
would not be much different than a widow.

728
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,014
What do you mean?

729
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,309
That is what the law states,
so nothing can be done.

730
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,310
Ask His Majesty--

731
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,437
He already spared the rest of my family,

732
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,480
which was a difficult enough task.

733
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,232
His Majesty

734
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,902
cannot change the law just for me.

735
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,738
-Lady Cho.
-So you should also…

736
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,410
follow your own path now, sir.

737
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,661
I cannot do that.

738
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,122
Whether you wear a mask

739
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,041
or are a widow or a divorced woman,

740
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,877
it does not matter to me.

741
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,172
I will stay by your side.

742
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,425
I wish

743
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,136
to be with you.

744
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,019
Such is the law.

745
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,395
Nothing can be done.

746
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,565
This is so unfair to Lady Cho, sir.

747
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,233
She was a widow for 15 years,

748
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,278
eating just one meal a day
and crying all day long.

749
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,030
She could not even go outside.

750
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,991
Is there truly nothing we can do?

751
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,326
Regardless, that house…

752
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,247
She cannot stay there any longer.

753
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,793
His Majesty does pity her,

754
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,212
but nothing can be done.

755
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,633
Excuse me.

756
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,719
I have a question.

757
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,473
Lady Cho said she married Novice Joo

758
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,308
without ever seeing his face.

759
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,685
Can you get married like that?

760
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,021
It takes two to form a pair.

761
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,440
Can you not get married on your own?

762
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,616
I have come

763
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,328
to report someone for fraud!

764
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,126
That person…

765
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,212
is me.

766
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,630
-What?
-What is he saying?

767
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,465
-Is he unwell?
-Did he say "fraud"?

768
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,676
-What is going on?
-I am not sure.

769
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,432
Make way for the Capital Guard.

770
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,058
Move aside.

771
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,059
Make way.

772
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,228
What are you doing?

773
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,521
Hurry up and arrest me.

774
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,899
Goodness.

775
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,026
You should report this

776
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,194
to the Ministry of Rites.

777
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,698
Why are you doing this
in front of the palace?

778
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,117
I am saying

779
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,202
that my marriage was a fraud.

780
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,414
I am here to confess this to everyone.

781
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,709
From the start,

782
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,795
my marriage was a sham.

783
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,303
I was blinded by love
and ran away to Qing.

784
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,305
Despite knowing that,

785
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,850
my father accepted Cho Yeo-hwa
as his daughter-in-law.

786
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,020
This was clearly a fraudulent marriage.

787
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,066
I am

788
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,902
already married in Qing

789
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,487
and have what is called a wife.

790
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,032
-What?
-What is a "wife"?

791
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,618
I have a spouse.

792
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,119
-Oh, a spouse.
-I see.

793
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,580
Since I cannot have two wives,

794
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,833
so this marriage must be declared invalid.

795
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,507
Then, because of a husband

796
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,801
who was alive and already married,

797
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,303
that poor woman…

798
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,141
had to endure life as a widow?

799
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,392
Please let me go.

800
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,602
Superintendent Park…

801
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,729
I did not know.

802
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,190
I did not know either.

803
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,445
Despite not knowing,

804
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,198
I still wronged that woman.

805
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,409
So please give that woman
who suffered because of me

806
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:58,373
her freedom!

807
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,750
I gladly approve.

808
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,509
It is His Majesty!

809
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,012
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

810
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,892
I heard there was a fun incident going on,
so I came to observe.

811
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,896
I will tell the Ministry of Rites

812
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,440
to nullify this marriage.

813
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:29,362
Thank you for your generosity,

814
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,989
Your Majesty.

815
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,370
That was a wise decision, Your Majesty.

816
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,376
Lady Cho has vanished?

817
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,796
She only left this behind.

818
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,177
I will live well,

819
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,179
so do not worry about me.

820
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,138
Is this

821
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,639
all there is?

822
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,270
She seemed perfectly normal
when we left home

823
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,813
and came to Myeongdo Inn yesterday.

824
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,190
Did she truly go

825
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,109
after leaving just one sentence behind?

826
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,861
I wonder if she even found out

827
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,779
her marriage was annulled.

828
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,429
If you leave now,

829
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,474
will you ever return to this house?

830
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,518
No.

831
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,937
Well…

832
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,858
It may be uncomfortable
to stay at Myeongdo Inn.

833
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,986
You can stay here

834
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,696
until you find a new home.

835
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,116
Can you not?

836
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,915
They say matches are made by the heavens.

837
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,793
It was truly a relief to see

838
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,753
that after 15 years,

839
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,048
you had returned as my husband.

840
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,386
Have a good life.

841
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,055
Be free.

842
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,557
And even better

843
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,142
if we ever crossed paths at night.

844
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,731
I like admirable people, you see.

845
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,682
I am sorry, Yeo-hwa.

846
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,770
That is all I can say.

847
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,689
I am sorry.

848
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,858
Mother.

849
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,405
Every day, I felt resentment,

850
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,741
sadness,

851
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,285
and hatred.

852
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,373
But I was able to endure those long years

853
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,627
because I had you

854
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,880
by my side, Mother.

855
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,635
Will you allow me to think of you

856
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,928
as my only remaining family?

857
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,807
No matter where I go…

858
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,728
can I say I have a mother

859
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,357
and rely on the thought of you?

860
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,739
Of course, you can.

861
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,700
I hope…

862
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,455
you forget all of the hard times…

863
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,667
and live well.

864
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,127
Smile

865
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,005
and live a good life.

866
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:16,923
Yes, Mother.

867
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,301
I will.

868
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:22,720
No matter what,

869
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:25,306
I will live like that.

870
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,277
SOUI GATE

871
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,392
Someone's daughter-in-law, someone's wife,

872
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,935
someone's lover.

873
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,938
I no longer wish
to be referred to that way.

874
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,565
Did you not

875
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,400
say this once, sir?

876
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,027
You told me

877
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,864
to worry about myself before others.

878
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,327
I would like to try living like that.

879
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,247
So you too

880
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,167
should not worry about me
and think of yourself.

881
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,294
Live a life full of smiles.

882
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:43,050
Do you know how lovely your smile is?

883
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,387
So now, be like everyone else

884
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,931
and live a very ordinary life…

885
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,769
in joy and happiness.

886
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,230
I will live like that.

887
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,068
I will

888
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,363
wait for you like that.

889
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,247
-Hello!
-Take a look.

890
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,917
1 YEAR LATER

891
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,508
DU-RE RICE CAKES

892
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,012
Kkon-nim,

893
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,680
I heard you've already learned
the Thousand Character Text.

894
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:33,684
Yes. The royal advisor said
he would teach me math next month.

895
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,978
Why are you studying so diligently?

896
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:40,650
I want to become someone great
like Lady Cho one day.

897
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,821
Hwal-yu, can you buy me
another sticky rice cake?

898
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,031
Is it for Mr. Joo?

899
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,032
Yes.

900
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,535
Please give us
ten more sticky rice cakes, ma'am.

901
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,702
All right.

902
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,748
Take a look at this too.

903
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:02,839
Yeon-seon.

904
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,510
Our profit rose
by 2,500 yang compared to last month.

905
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,595
Do not call her by her name.

906
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,306
She is now our merchant guild's investor.

907
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,936
Monthly profits have risen
since Yeon-seon joined.

908
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,021
I could pass the guild on to you at once.

909
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,439
Do not say that.

910
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,899
I still have a long way to go.

911
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:29,115
Royal Advisor Park
is here to see the investor.

912
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,996
Superintendent Park
used to come here every day,

913
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,582
but now it is Royal Advisor Park
who comes by.

914
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,752
I cannot tell if this is
Myeongdo Inn or the palace.

915
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,006
I will be back soon.

916
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:45,923
All right.

917
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,262
Did things go as you wished?

918
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,765
It was very difficult
to get His Majesty's approval,

919
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,351
but now I can live as a hallyang.

920
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,979
Your dream was to become a hallyang?

921
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,814
How funny.

922
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,651
It has long been my wish

923
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,864
to leave the stressful royal court
and live peacefully.

924
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,325
By the way,

925
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,912
have you chosen
your dream tile-roofed house in Hanyang?

926
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,374
I liked a few of the ones I saw,

927
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,793
but none of them felt quite right.

928
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,923
I know of a nice house.

929
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,134
The yard is always full of sunlight,

930
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,178
and flowers bloom in all four seasons.

931
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,513
Where is it?

932
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,027
Is this not your house, sir?

933
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,447
Would you like…

934
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,408
to take a look around with me?

935
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:58,537
Yes.

936
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,553
Goodness, my lord.

937
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,514
You have come.

938
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,350
Bi-chan.

939
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,647
So, did you bring what I asked you to?

940
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,815
Yes.

941
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,483
Here it is.

942
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,276
What is this?

943
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,989
Is this not his date and time of birth?

944
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,740
DATE AND TIME OF BIRTH
USED TO TELL MARRIAGE FORTUNES

945
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,743
You are far past the age to get married.

946
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,995
You cannot delay any more.

947
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,205
You have postponed marriage long enough,

948
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:42,999
so you must decide now.

949
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,626
Yes, of course you must.

950
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,753
-Thank you--
-No, Father.

951
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,219
What did you just say?

952
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:57,888
After marriage,

953
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,058
we will be husband and wife
for the rest of our lives.

954
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:06,564
I wish to enjoy courting a bit longer.

955
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,652
Oh, dear.

956
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:13,988
Goodness.

957
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,828
Royal Advisor.

958
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,582
What is going on?

959
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,750
It is better for you

960
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,543
not to know, Captain Park.

961
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,256
Why have you not
gotten used to things yet?

962
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,216
You should have known
she would react this way.

963
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,970
I heard the Ministry of Defense is busy.

964
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,638
Is it all right for you to be out?

965
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:46,645
An expert artisan in Cheongsong
made this himself.

966
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,857
To commemorate your promotion
to captain of the Capital Guard,

967
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,942
I brought it here personally.

968
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,195
Do you know what I went through

969
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:58,032
to obtain this precious white porcelain?

970
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,409
Captain Park.

971
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,995
We found the hideout
of the gang that is kidnapping women.

972
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,373
Where is it? Let us go.

973
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,959
-You cannot go without me.
-What?

974
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,753
Wait for me.

975
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:16,550
I wish

976
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,636
I could go too.

977
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,644
Have you heard of the masked figure
who makes an appearance

978
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,312
when the moon shines brightly?

979
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,481
-Of course!
-Who is that?

980
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,650
It has been a while since he vanished.

981
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,237
Settle down, everyone.

982
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,698
I will tell you
all about that woman today.

983
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,992
"Woman"? The mask was a woman?

984
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,745
But I heard they had
incredible martial arts skills.

985
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:45,996
It cannot be.

986
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,960
I call her…

987
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,172
the knight flower.

988
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:58,884
Help me!

989
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,514
Please, sir. Why are you doing this?

990
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:12,481
I was wondering who was disturbing
the peace in the capital again.

991
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,108
So, it was you fools.

992
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,776
Who are you?

993
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,588
I just arrived in the capital.

994
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,299
Is this not too warm of a welcome?

995
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,345
I will beat you to a pulp tonight.

996
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,188
Captain!

997
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,816
-Captain!
-What?

998
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,109
Run!

999
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,701
-That way.
-Yes, sir.

1000
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:07,828
Are you all right?

1001
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,213
Who on earth are you,

1002
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:20,925
covering your face and waving a sword
in the center of the capital?

1003
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,470
Did you return
because you distrust the Capital Guard

1004
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,640
and worry about peace in the capital?

1005
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,141
Or did you return

1006
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,685
for another reason?

1007
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,814
It is not that I distrust
the Capital Guard.

1008
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,151
Now that you are back in my sight…

1009
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:53,290
you can never leave my sight again.

1010
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,252
I am not the type of person
to be easily caught.

1011
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,714
But I will give you a chance to try.

1012
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:31,287
