1
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,331
How dare…

2
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,542
How could you do this?

3
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,265
What is going on here?

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,152
Are you all right, Madam Oh?

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,236
Please wake up.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,488
Madam!

7
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,284
Did you say, "guard my husband's grave"?

8
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,952
Why?

9
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,205
Do you not want to?

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,208
No, Father. It was just so sudden.

11
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,296
I heard the noblewomen have been arguing

12
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,049
about who will get
the virtuous women's gate.

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,843
I thought it was simply
a matter of jealousy

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,471
and was not going to get involved.

15
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,516
But after seeing your mother-in-law
having such a hard time,

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,559
I can no longer remain indifferent.

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,064
But if I suddenly leave
to guard my husband's grave,

18
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,566
who will look after Mother
in her weakened--

19
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,277
I will take care of that, so do not worry.

20
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,281
Focus on fulfilling your duty.

21
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,578
He is trying to prevent me

22
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,206
from finding out anything more.

23
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,626
Why are you not answering me?

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,379
My lord.

25
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,631
Could you please come outside?

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,966
What is the matter?

27
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,682
Captain Hwang of the Capital Guard
is asking to see you.

28
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,725
At this late hour?

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,027
I am Captain Hwang Chi-dal.

30
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,821
I apologize for my late visit.

31
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,200
An incident has occurred in the capital,
so we are securing the neighborhood.

32
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,702
An incident?

33
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,786
What happened?

34
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,832
A suspicious man broke
into the finance minister's home.

35
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,167
Madam Oh was almost murdered.

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,167
What?

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,838
We are searching for the culprit,
but as it is a serious matter--

38
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,715
Head inside now, Yeo-hwa.

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,634
Yes, Father.

40
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,971
We, the Capital Guard,

41
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,932
are always doing our best
to ensure the safety

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,436
-of the royal court…
-Did you try to have Madam Oh killed?

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,146
Father.

44
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,440
Is this truly your doing?

45
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,957
So, did you catch the assailant?

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,875
Pardon?

47
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,878
Well…

48
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,755
We lost him.

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,925
Did anyone see him?

50
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,427
I did.

51
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,556
You saw him yourself?

52
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,225
Yes.

53
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,936
It was too dark to get a good look at him,

54
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,730
but Madam Oh would have seen
the face of the assailant.

55
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,982
We will identify him
as soon as she wakes up.

56
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,611
Is that so?

57
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,699
It is a relief to hear
that we can catch him.

58
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,203
We will guard the homes
of every minister in the capital.

59
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,249
We will make sure
that not even a single ant gets through.

60
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,752
Your home will be guarded
with extra care, Lord Seok.

61
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,921
Do not worry, and have a good night.

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
Thank you.

63
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,425
I appreciate your hard work.

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,688
I will take another look around,
just in case.

65
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,648
Yes. Remember to be thorough.

66
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,566
Leave no stone unturned.

67
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,715
Summon the defense minister at once.

68
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,258
Yes, my lord.

69
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,152
You have complicated things, after all.

70
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,746
There are soldiers all over the place,

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,914
so tell the lady
not to come out in her mask.

72
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,464
Who tried to kill Madam Oh?

73
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,177
I believe it was Kang Pil-jik.

74
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,806
Father has ordered me
to go and guard my husband's grave.

75
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,977
Please find a way for me
to get to Myeongdo Inn.

76
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
Start packing up all of our gold.

77
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,030
Pardon?

78
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,033
I will leave for Gaegyeong…

79
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,826
No, I will go to Qing.

80
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,704
Why are you running
when you were not caught in the act?

81
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,956
Do you think I am running
from the Capital Guard?

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,793
I failed my mission,

83
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,253
so Lord Seok will not spare me.

84
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,339
Do not worry.

85
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,508
You are his weapon.
He will not discard you.

86
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,511
Getting a new weapon is nothing to him.

87
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,931
Hurry! Regardless of who catches us,

88
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,351
we are truly done for this time.

89
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,685
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,246
Can she really get out that way?

91
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,249
Do not worry.
She will have no problem getting out.

92
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,134
Trouble is brewing in the capital.

93
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,180
I will not ask for details
about what you are doing.

94
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,473
However,

95
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,978
what you and my lady are doing
is dangerous, is it not?

96
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,231
It seems likely.

97
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,654
You are always with Lady Cho,
so you could also be in danger.

98
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,657
You must be even more careful from now on.

99
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,658
I am

100
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,035
so worried.

101
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,080
Do not worry in advance.

102
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,875
Lady Cho will be fine.

103
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,753
After all, she has someone like you
by her side,

104
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,380
protecting and worrying for her.

105
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,843
You see…

106
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,014
Is there anything more you wish to say?

107
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,765
I am

108
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,143
also worried about you, sir.

109
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,732
Please be careful.

110
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,571
What are you two doing

111
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,531
in such a secluded place?

112
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,046
Why did you ask us all to gather?

113
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,549
I wish to talk about my father-in-law.

114
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,219
I will share the details
when we meet with everyone else.

115
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,303
Very well.

116
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,724
By the way, I've been curious
about something for a while.

117
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,684
May I ask you something?

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,144
Yes.

119
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,982
It is about my brother.

120
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,486
What is your relationship

121
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,780
with my brother?

122
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,032
What do you mean?

123
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,284
Siblings, friends, lovers,

124
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,662
spouses, parent or child.

125
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,665
I am asking how you would
categorize your relationship.

126
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,044
If I must give an answer,

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,963
I will say we're friends.

128
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,592
Friendship between a man and woman?

129
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,054
Is that even possible
in this nation of Joseon?

130
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,100
Do I look like a woman to you right now?

131
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,186
Then, let me ask you this.

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,273
What were you talking about
with Yeon-seon so sweetly earlier?

133
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,442
What were a man and woman doing
in such a secluded place?

134
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,490
I did not expect this
from Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

135
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,492
Though you two are not blood-related,

136
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,453
you and Superintendent Park
act exactly alike.

137
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,957
Royal Advisor Park.

138
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,086
Hello, Bi-chan.

139
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,756
Where are you going
while Bukchon is in such disorder?

140
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,552
I have not seen you before.

141
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,595
Are you a new recruit?

142
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,931
Superintendent Park told me
to escort the royal advisor.

143
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,560
What? But that is such an important task.

144
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,229
Yes. I personally asked him to escort me,

145
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,023
so we were on our way.

146
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,982
You asked for him?

147
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,946
Su-ho seemed to be
desperately looking for you earlier.

148
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,072
Really?

149
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,324
Where is he now?

150
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,578
-He said to come to the Capital Guard.
-Yes, sir.

151
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,539
See you around, newbie.

152
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,051
That outfit suits you quite well.

153
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,607
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

154
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,492
-Where are you going in such a hurry?
-Boss.

155
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,834
Lord Seok has already blocked off
every mountain path and sea route.

156
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,837
Getting past us would
not make any difference.

157
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,308
Why must you guard your husband's grave?

158
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,228
A suspicious man has appeared in Bukchon,

159
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,438
but is that what you are worried about?

160
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,868
My father-in-law must have felt
quite concerned.

161
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,413
A single fabricated note
made him send me to my husband's grave.

162
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,833
Also, the suspicious man is Kang Pil-jik.

163
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,044
The fact that I was suddenly told
to guard my husband's grave

164
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,756
and the attempted murder of Madam Oh
does not seem like a coincidence.

165
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,174
So,

166
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,844
must you go?

167
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,221
Su-ho.

168
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,807
This would be for the best.

169
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,436
I have been thinking of a way
to send Lady Cho to Qing.

170
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,604
Now seems like the perfect opportunity.

171
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,064
What are you talking about?

172
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,607
Absolutely not.

173
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,781
Do you truly think
Lady Cho would go to Qing now?

174
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,241
Pull yourself together.

175
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,827
I am not going anywhere.

176
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,873
So, how about you think of a way

177
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,916
to keep me from going away?

178
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,961
-Do you mean us?
-Do you mean us?

179
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:38,007
My father-in-law's desire to send me away
seems to be connected to all of this.

180
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,635
Who would be better suited than me
to find out why?

181
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,388
-Well…
-Seeing what happened to Madam Oh,

182
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,434
I think he planned to have me killed
on the way to my husband's grave.

183
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,061
Then, Madam Oh and I would become

184
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,398
proud widows who took their lives
to follow their husbands.

185
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,656
That will never happen,
so do not look at me like that.

186
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,371
Did you find anything related to Madam Oh
while investigating Kang Pil-jik?

187
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,875
It seems they embezzled relief grains,
but we are still investigating.

188
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,168
Relief grains, you say?

189
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,177
Are you saying they stole
from those pitiful people

190
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,346
who could only afford
to get watery porridge?

191
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:30,476
I guess the lives of the common people
were of no importance to them.

192
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,231
Isn't that why you went around
wearing a mask every night?

193
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,819
First things first.
I will handle Madam Oh.

194
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
Then, I will look more into Kang Pil-jik.

195
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,787
Then, what should I do?

196
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,413
Brother.

197
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,457
You can think of a way
for Lady Cho to stay.

198
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,380
-Who, me?
-You are this nation's royal advisor.

199
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,422
Well, that was sudden.

200
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,383
That is a good idea.

201
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,176
Please do so.

202
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,595
Wait a minute.

203
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,306
That seems like the most difficult task.

204
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,724
Thank you in advance.

205
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,434
Wait, but…

206
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,192
Let me think.

207
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,742
Please get home safely.

208
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,422
I have something to ask you,
Head Guildmaster.

209
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,424
Can we talk for a moment?

210
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,971
I also have something to ask you.

211
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,139
What great timing.

212
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,433
Let's go.

213
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,908
You said you had something to say.

214
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,579
If you must go
to guard your husband's grave,

215
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,874
there must be another way

216
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,209
to stay in the capital and not go to Qing.

217
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,839
Should I dress up as a man like this

218
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,925
and join the Capital Guard as an officer?

219
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,260
-That is not a bad idea.
-Please, sir.

220
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,892
Royal Advisor Park asked me a question.

221
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,226
My brother did?

222
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,522
He asked me what our relationship is.

223
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,236
You and I

224
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,530
cannot be in any relationship.

225
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,243
Even if the day comes

226
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,206
when I am no longer
Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

227
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,416
-Lady Cho.
-Exactly.

228
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,876
"Lady Cho."

229
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
That is what you call me.

230
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,760
That is because I am someone else's wife.

231
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,847
That is why

232
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,183
we cannot and should not

233
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,894
be in any relationship.

234
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,605
We are only two people

235
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,649
who share the same fate

236
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,068
and goal of resolving this matter.

237
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,153
So,

238
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,533
I do not want anyone to get
the wrong idea about us from now on.

239
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,329
Yes, my lady.

240
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,290
I understand what you are trying to say.

241
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,717
But I do not think

242
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,594
anyone misinterpreted our relationship.

243
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
I will not cause you any trouble.

244
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,394
I promise you, my lady.

245
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,202
I cannot believe I can feed you again.

246
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,495
Here.

247
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,709
Why are you crying again
when you cried all night?

248
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,960
I am sorry.

249
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,255
I simply cannot keep myself together.

250
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,301
That is enough.

251
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,594
If you keep crying,

252
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,971
a tiger will snatch you up with a…

253
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
You are too old for that now, Jae-i.

254
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,604
I will at least go
and bring your favorite gamju.

255
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,522
GAMJU: A BEVERAGE MADE
WITH MALT AND RICE

256
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,988
I will stay right here.

257
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,907
All right.

258
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,999
Eat up now, and then we will go home.

259
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,129
Your father will be so happy to see you.

260
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,342
Did Father search for me a lot?

261
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,302
Of course, he did.

262
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,681
He went all across the nation
desperately searching for you.

263
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,394
The heavens must have felt our sincerity.

264
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,898
Your wife

265
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,528
also prayed with her whole heart and soul.

266
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,032
She is a truly modest and kind woman.

267
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,160
She is so well-mannered.

268
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,498
Oh, no…

269
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,166
What on earth are you doing?

270
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,293
Why are you suddenly crying out?

271
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,587
I must do whatever I can to buy time.

272
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,883
-Oh, no…
-May I come in?

273
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,594
Oh, no…

274
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,978
I told you to prepare
to leave for my son's grave.

275
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,272
Why are you crying so loudly?

276
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,775
Are you thinking of not going?

277
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,193
No, Father.

278
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,405
I would not dare
to go against your command.

279
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,075
It is just that my husband appeared
in my dream last night.

280
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,579
He cried sadly, saying he would
be alone in the shrine if I left.

281
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,623
I could not bring myself to leave.

282
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,208
I see.

283
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,254
Your mother-in-law and I have seen you
for a long time,

284
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,174
so we know how you feel about Jeong.

285
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:40,095
That is why I am sure you will make
the right choice for Jeong and our family.

286
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,183
Someone will come in three days
to take you to his grave.

287
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,476
-But, Father--
-Be ready by then.

288
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,907
MEMORIAL TABLET OF YEO-HWA'S
HUSBAND AND SEOK JI-SEONG'S SON

289
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,744
It seems that he will no longer
hide his true colors from me.

290
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,543
It seems I must find
a way to stop Lady Cho

291
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,420
from going to her husband's grave.

292
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,256
Out of everything,

293
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,842
were you only given such a small task?

294
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,597
It is actually the most difficult task.

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,392
My mother has been curious
about Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

296
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,478
If I ask her to arrange a meeting,

297
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,230
that will buy some time.

298
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,399
Your generosity is boundless.

299
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,617
Here comes a man whom I find difficult
to give my generosity to.

300
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,958
Your Majesty.

301
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,377
There is something I must tell you.

302
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,421
Then, let us go to the royal palace.

303
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,864
What is all of this?

304
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,200
It is the amount of grains

305
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,328
the queen dowager took for relief efforts

306
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,873
and the amount the poor actually received
over the past ten years.

307
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,917
How could this be?

308
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,336
After the former king passed away,

309
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,632
the queen dowager greatly contributed
to helping Your Majesty

310
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,969
to be called a sage king by the people.

311
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,348
But if the people discovered

312
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,309
that she embezzled relief grains--

313
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,435
Left Councilor.

314
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,772
You should watch your words.

315
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,945
It will be an even bigger problem
if the royal court ministers find out.

316
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,697
They may even…

317
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,577
discuss dethroning the queen dowager.

318
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,290
How is this my mother's responsibility?

319
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,669
This was Madam Oh's doing.

320
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:23,175
Were you already aware that Madam Oh
was doing such a thing?

321
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,181
Will the royal court believe
that a mere minister's wife

322
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,643
committed such acts
without the queen dowager's order?

323
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,020
My mother is

324
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,815
an elder of the royal family
who has spent her life

325
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,984
governing the women of the internal court.

326
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,489
She has gracefully maintained
her position all this time,

327
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,033
so I will not just sit back and do nothing

328
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:53,330
if she is framed
for something she clearly did not do.

329
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,001
That is exactly what I mean, Your Majesty.

330
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,753
As long as you do nothing,

331
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,923
you can peacefully stay on the throne
as the king of this nation.

332
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,550
But, due to Your Majesty's rash behavior,

333
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,637
everyone is on the verge
of losing their places.

334
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,351
Madam Oh brazenly colluded

335
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,438
with lowly outlaws
to fulfill her own selfish interests.

336
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,024
Last night's unpleasant incident was

337
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,777
likely the result of a personal grudge.

338
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,028
Thus,

339
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,950
the queen dowager
must no longer cover for Madam Oh.

340
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,162
Now,

341
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,291
I will trust that you have
taken my words to heart.

342
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,546
Please excuse me, Your Majesty.

343
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,218
Madam Oh.

344
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,636
You are awake.

345
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,390
What happened?

346
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,393
The superintendent
of the Capital Guard saved you.

347
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,980
What about the man?

348
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,107
Was he caught?

349
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,610
They have not caught him yet.

350
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,155
The Capital Guard
is standing guard outside.

351
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,283
Also,

352
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,578
the guildmaster of the Hwayeon guild
is waiting for you.

353
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,747
She has something important to tell you.

354
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,167
What does she have to tell me?

355
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,922
I truly hope everything goes as planned.

356
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,131
Do not worry too much.

357
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,219
Lady Cho and the guild will be fine.

358
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,856
Where is Lady Jang So-un?

359
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,109
She is the head guildmaster
at the Hwayeon merchant guild.

360
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,069
Who are you?

361
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,363
She only acted on my behalf.

362
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,241
I am the true owner of the guild.

363
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,493
Why should I believe you?

364
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,376
Is this not enough to convince you?

365
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,710
This?

366
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,296
That is merely a seal.

367
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,090
This does not prove anything.

368
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,303
I have come to know many things
while owning a merchant guild.

369
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,596
How about this?

370
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,349
The connection between

371
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,352
the finance minister's painting
and the Pil guild.

372
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,856
I speak of your relation to Kang Pil-jik

373
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,901
and the nature of the petals
in the bar of that painting.

374
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,612
My position as the guildmaster
easily allows me

375
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,155
to obtain such information.

376
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,033
Who are you?

377
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,662
Are you here

378
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,290
under Lord Seok's orders?

379
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,103
I am the left councilor's daughter-in-law

380
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,898
and Cho Seong-hu's sister, Cho Yeo-hwa.

381
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,068
Lady Cho? But how…

382
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,655
I do not know why you gave me that bait,

383
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,742
but it seems you wrongly assumed

384
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,660
that I would be an easy catch.

385
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,540
I cannot believe this.

386
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,377
All this time,

387
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,130
you had everyone completely fooled.

388
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,050
It is still too soon to say that.

389
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,011
I know many things about you,

390
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,015
but you know far less about me, Madam.

391
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,688
Why have you come to see me?

392
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,316
I need you to become my bait.

393
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,402
As you know,

394
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,323
I have spent 15 years being deceived
by my father-in-law.

395
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,076
Now that I know everything,

396
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,411
I cannot stand by and do nothing.

397
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,332
You know everything, you say?

398
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,251
So if you help me,

399
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,046
I will find you a way to live.

400
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,224
Do you think I will help you?

401
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,768
You have no other options, do you?

402
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,399
Who knows who could come
to strangle you tomorrow?

403
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,860
My father-in-law has never given up

404
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,113
once he set his mind to something.

405
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,203
Send me a message
once you make up your mind.

406
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,248
If I do not hear from you for three days,

407
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,500
I will assume you rejected my offer.

408
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,674
What do you need me to do?

409
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,678
I will tell you that
after you have decided.

410
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,265
You say you know everything.

411
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,811
Does that mean you know everything

412
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,896
about what happened to your brother?

413
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,818
Of course.

414
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,162
Is that so?

415
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,382
My lady.

416
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,223
How did it go?

417
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,768
I am sure she knows
my brother's whereabouts.

418
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,354
She definitely knows
more than I do, at least.

419
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,608
-Please let the superintendent know.
-Yes, my lady.

420
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,778
Let's go.

421
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,866
PIL INN

422
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,744
Are you closed today?

423
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,288
Yes, the interior is under construction.

424
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,415
We will be closed for the time being.

425
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,876
Is Guildmaster Kang inside?

426
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,295
Well…

427
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,935
What brings you here, Superintendent Park?

428
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,853
I came to see Guildmaster Kang.

429
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,730
Is he available?

430
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,649
The guildmaster has stepped out.

431
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,360
Is that so?

432
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,071
Then, tell him I wish to see him

433
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,864
and to come to the Capital Guard.

434
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,534
-Do not forget.
-Yes, sir.

435
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,042
What if he ran away already?

436
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,919
Did you see the men behind him?

437
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,671
They do not work there.

438
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,256
Then, who are they?

439
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
Their outfits were unusual,

440
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,760
and they carried officers' swords,

441
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,764
while Kang Pil-jik's men were
completely unarmed.

442
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,350
It appears someone is watching them.

443
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,895
You must keep an eye out for Kang Pil-jik
and whoever goes in or out.

444
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,106
Yes, sir.

445
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,404
I had forgotten for a moment

446
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,741
about what kind of person
the left councilor was.

447
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,951
Your Majesty…

448
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,830
I doubt he would have made
any sloppy mistakes.

449
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,250
We are almost at the end, Your Majesty.

450
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,003
We have uncovered a lot already.

451
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,755
Now that I think about it,

452
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,301
it was strange
how he placed Madam Oh at the helm.

453
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,178
Rather than search for a connection
between Madam Oh and Lord Seok,

454
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:34,434
I should have thought about
who would go down with Madam Oh.

455
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,941
In order to kill my father,

456
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,029
he took my mother hostage.

457
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,074
There must be another way.

458
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,327
I will find and bring you evidence

459
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,662
that can bring down the left councilor.

460
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,708
I will find it at all costs, sire.

461
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,585
Left Councilor…

462
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,090
Left Councilor!

463
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:13,640
I have ensured that Kang Pil-jik
cannot step foot outside Pil Inn.

464
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,976
What on earth did he do that was so bad?

465
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,646
You do not need to know that,
Defense Minister.

466
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,565
How about getting rid of him

467
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,068
before things get any worse?

468
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,154
Whether he makes things worse

469
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,949
or will still be of more use to us,

470
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,326
getting rid of him
is not an urgent matter.

471
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,244
See how things go for now.

472
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,790
Rather than that…

473
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,504
I wonder what His Majesty will do.

474
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,344
I made myself very clear,

475
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,641
but if he were to push his luck again…

476
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:11,698
I do not wish to go through the trouble
of doing the same thing twice.

477
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,550
I was too flustered
to take a close look on that day.

478
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,679
It is fascinating
that a woman of a noble family

479
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,097
dresses like that.

480
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,599
Please, Brother.

481
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,602
That was a compliment.

482
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,479
It is a compliment.

483
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,065
Yes. Thank you.

484
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,903
The head guildmaster told me
you met with Madam Oh today.

485
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,866
I heard you acted
as the owner of the guild.

486
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,536
Is it not too dangerous
to say you have another identity?

487
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,206
She is a prideful person.

488
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,877
It would be no use
to beg or threaten her for information.

489
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,130
That is also why my father-in-law
tried to have her killed.

490
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,509
That is why I gave it a try.

491
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
I pretended to need nothing
and know everything.

492
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,099
I acted like I was on the same side as
her, wanting to seek vengeance together.

493
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,477
-"The same side"?
-We must deceive her as such.

494
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,022
I also have no intention
of standing on Madam Oh's side.

495
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,566
I do not know about anything else,

496
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,653
but I will never join hands
with someone who plays tricks with food.

497
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,115
Whatever Madam Oh says,

498
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,451
it may be of no use to us.

499
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,956
The left councilor used the queen dowager
to threaten His Majesty.

500
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,667
He had always planned to make it seem

501
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,961
like Madam Oh was
following Her Majesty's orders.

502
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,549
Why does he always take
family members as leverage?

503
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,804
-What of Kang Pil-jik?
-He is likely confined at Pil Inn.

504
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,098
Let's go.

505
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,186
Actions speak louder than words,
do they not?

506
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,481
PIL INN

507
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,816
Who goes there?

508
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,345
It is you!

509
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,976
It has been a while.

510
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,438
How dare you be so bold to come here?

511
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,733
I do not think you are in any position
to yell at us right now.

512
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,985
Boss.

513
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,320
Your swords were taken,

514
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,990
and by the looks of it,
you seem to be trapped in here.

515
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,033
Is it just me?

516
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,452
No one would dare to keep us confined!

517
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,584
I will forget all those times
you interfered with my business.

518
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,335
Take this and leave.

519
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,132
Does he think
I have come here to steal from him?

520
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,508
Considering your history…

521
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,845
Who do you work for?

522
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,265
And who are you?

523
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,933
You will answer me first.

524
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,479
You work with the mask.

525
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,650
Aren't you Superintendent Park Su-ho?

526
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,033
I was aware that you are quite close
with the mask.

527
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,952
A superintendent of the Capital Guard

528
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,623
cannot kill someone while wearing a mask.

529
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,002
If I am guilty of a crime,

530
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,379
you should question me
at the Capital Guard.

531
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
But instead, you are pointing
a sword at me.

532
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,801
What is my crime?

533
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,969
Your crime?

534
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,846
How dare you ignore your protocol?

535
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,223
If you knew who I truly was,

536
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,975
would you remember your crimes?

537
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,360
After you killed my entire family,

538
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,278
I survived alone.

539
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,280
I am King's Guard General Im Gang's son,

540
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:22,949
Im Hyeon-jae.

541
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,744
Hyeon-jae.

542
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,828
Father!

543
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,838
Do you remember what happened?

544
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,098
I remembered who you were.

545
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,683
It was all thanks to you.

546
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,227
I do not know anything.

547
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,481
The plan has changed.

548
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,858
Let's simply kill him right now.

549
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,861
Wait!

550
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,780
You said you would not stop me.

551
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,198
Please stop him.

552
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,242
Please spare me.

553
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,166
Well, I made this man a promise.

554
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,837
Do as you wish.

555
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,094
I will do whatever you say.

556
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,472
Why did you kill my family?

557
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,685
The general of the King's Guard
had a royal edict.

558
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,688
I was promised a hefty sum if I stole it.

559
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,899
I do not know the details either.

560
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,406
I only did as Madam Oh said.

561
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,999
Can you prove that statement?

562
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,544
I am the proof.

563
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,714
If you spare me, I will testify to it.

564
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,632
But if I die here,

565
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,552
you will never be able
to prove what happened.

566
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,348
If he does not have any evidence…

567
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,647
Let's go.

568
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,191
Are you all right?

569
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,827
I am relieved it is not worse.

570
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,664
You could have been in big trouble.

571
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,377
I totally agree.

572
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,937
I apologize.

573
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,106
I should not have--

574
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,691
Yes, you should apologize.

575
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,778
The plan was to threaten him a bit,
let him escape,

576
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,696
and follow after him, was it not?

577
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,449
Also, the basic rule of wearing a mask

578
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,410
is to hide your identity.

579
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,829
But you got caught as soon as we arrived.

580
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,419
Still, we have someone following him,

581
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,171
so the plan did not completely fail.

582
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,590
You told him your true identity.

583
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,384
That was not in the plan.

584
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,554
Seeing his shameless face
as he thought I knew nothing

585
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,181
almost made me kill him right then.

586
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,603
I forgot what I was there to do.

587
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,773
I should have gone alone.

588
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,525
If you went alone,

589
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,027
you would not have gotten hurt either.

590
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,074
On second thought,

591
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,161
it would have been very dangerous
had I gone alone.

592
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,745
If not for your help,

593
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,331
I could have been stabbed in the back.

594
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,374
Lady Cho.

595
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,502
That will not happen.

596
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,338
Never again

597
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,216
will you get hurt again, my lady.

598
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,891
Kang Pil-jik, that punk.

599
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,560
I will not stop you next time,
so kill him.

600
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,733
It is late, so I will get going now.

601
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,276
All right.

602
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,124
My lord.

603
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,585
Kang Pil-jik has escaped.

604
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,088
What?

605
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,049
Some masked figures suddenly appeared.

606
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,259
It seems he escaped amidst the chaos.

607
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,345
Masked figures, you say?

608
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,769
Find out who they were.

609
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,522
What should we do about Kang Pil-jik?

610
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,067
Just leave him be.

611
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,279
He will not be able to return
to living like a dog on the street,

612
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,367
so he will not just disappear
without a trace.

613
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,326
Yes, my lord.

614
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,473
I do not think we will be able
to go through the fortress gate.

615
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,526
I will follow them from here,

616
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,028
so ask the superintendent
for the next orders.

617
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,029
Yes, sir.

618
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,368
So, my father truly gave a royal edict.

619
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,956
His loyal subject guarded it with his life

620
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,167
but had it taken from him
in such an awful way.

621
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,838
It seems that our hands are tied now.

622
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,006
Your Majesty.

623
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,176
It is still too soon to be discouraged.

624
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:21,557
After the death
of the general of the King's Guard,

625
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,602
Cho Seong-hu disappeared
after meeting with the former king.

626
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,146
Seeing how eagerly
the left councilor searched for him,

627
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,774
I am sure he received a secret order
from His Majesty, the late king.

628
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,447
The question is if we will ever find it.

629
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,741
It seems like Madam Oh knows about it,

630
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,660
so please wait
until Lord Seok's daughter-in-law

631
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,537
comes back with some news.

632
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,666
What if Madam Oh becomes a threat
to the queen dowager?

633
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,463
If Madam Oh sides with Lord Seok
to try and find a way to live,

634
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,214
what will we do then?

635
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,052
Madam Oh's crimes are

636
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,638
grave enough to have her beheaded.

637
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,057
If we cannot gain anything from her,

638
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,894
you can personally order
immediate punishment for her crimes.

639
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,279
Madam Oh.

640
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,947
May I come in?

641
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:21,992
You may.

642
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,417
Someone asked that this letter
be delivered to you.

643
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,616
Last night, I saw an unfamiliar man
in the master's quarters.

644
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,619
He was likely guarding Kang Pil-jik.

645
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,123
Father's men seem to be hidden everywhere.

646
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,625
He must also be looking
for whoever sent the note.

647
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,169
Forcing me out must be his top priority.

648
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,421
Anyway,

649
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,589
what is the royal advisor doing?

650
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,259
While the superintendent and I
ran around all night,

651
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,094
he could not resolve one small task.

652
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,762
I am sure he has his reasons.

653
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,224
Are you

654
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,102
taking his side right now?

655
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,061
Pardon?

656
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,314
What do you mean?

657
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,734
No reason should keep him
from finding such a small solution.

658
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,821
Lady Cho.

659
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,199
Lady Yoo has returned.

660
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,034
Has Mother arrived?

661
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,744
You should come out at once.

662
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,954
I will be right there.

663
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,464
Tell the royal advisor
that he no longer needs to find a way.

664
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,675
Mother will buy us time.

665
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,969
Oh, Mother!

666
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,893
She has forgotten Lady Yoo wants
to send her to guard the grave

667
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,102
more than Lord Seok.

668
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,482
What? Who did you say has come?

669
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,610
Look, Father!

670
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,237
My lord.

671
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,072
It is our dear Jeong.

672
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,950
Our Jeong has returned.

673
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,160
Father.

674
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,954
Your unfilial son has finally returned.

675
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,833
How did you…

676
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,044
You cannot believe it either, can you?

677
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,047
I was in disbelief on my way back, too.

678
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,678
He was almost killed by a group of bandits
and lost his memory.

679
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:50,182
A merchant saved him and took him to Qing.

680
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,064
Due to the loss of my memories,

681
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,607
I could not return.

682
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,318
I heard you were very devastated.

683
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,444
Never again

684
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,030
will I fail my duties as your son.

685
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,579
All right.

686
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,707
My son has come back alive.

687
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:22,005
I never thought I would see those two
being so affectionate ever again.

688
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,594
Mother.

689
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,596
Have you returned?

690
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,765
Come here, Yeo-hwa.

691
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,267
This is our dear Jeong.

692
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,102
Your husband has returned alive.

693
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,437
Who?

694
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,106
My son, Jeong.

695
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,650
He is alive and well.

696
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,823
I apologize.

697
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,283
I have returned so late.

698
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,995
Wait, this punk is…

699
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,330
-My hair!
-What is the matter?

700
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,756
Is the head guildmaster in?

701
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,550
How rude!

702
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,468
Pardon my intrusion.

703
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,137
Please keep enjoying yourselves.

704
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,100
Goodness.

705
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,567
She has been faithful
to her late husband for 15 years,

706
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,360
so she must feel shy around men.

707
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,654
How naive of her.

708
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,158
She will warm up to you soon,

709
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,618
so do not feel too upset.

710
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,161
Yes, Mother.

711
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,413
Let us go inside now.

712
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,885
What kind of a strange dream am I having?

713
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,773
Are you afraid that I will run away
while guarding your grave?

714
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,982
You should be in there.

715
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,525
Why did you come out?

716
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,656
May I come in for a moment?

717
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,241
My husband,
please tell me that is not you.

718
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,534
Please. I beg you!

719
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,535
I am coming in.

720
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,537
You cannot.

721
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,706
Please excuse me.

722
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,836
Well…

723
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,254
My…

724
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,549
My lady?

725
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,387
You seem quite flustered.

726
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,306
Please call me when you have calmed down.

727
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,350
I will be waiting.

728
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,151
MEMORIAL TABLET
OF YEO-HWA'S HUSBAND

729
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,114
I did not know Mother would stop me
from guarding your grave this way.

730
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,502
Bi-chan is following that man closely.

731
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,755
We must closely watch

732
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,049
who approaches him and where he goes.

733
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,093
I am sending him frequent messages,

734
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,845
-so do not worry.
-Yes, sir.

735
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,638
Father!

736
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,599
Oh, it is you, sweetie.

737
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,019
Why have you come here again?

738
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,190
Another destined love story
that sounds like a novel

739
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,859
has occurred in the capital.

740
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,820
Lord Seok's son came back alive,

741
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,864
so their residence
is currently in a frenzy.

742
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,117
It was widely rumored
that his wife prayed for him every day.

743
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,703
Her sincerity must have moved the heavens.

744
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,082
Goodness, how could such a thing be?

745
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,334
That is wonderful news.

746
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,629
Lord Seok's daughter-in-law
must be overjoyed.

747
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,590
She can take off her mourning clothes

748
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,592
and can be with her husband.

749
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,887
I wish to have a love like that, too.

750
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,805
No. I certainly will, Father.

751
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,390
In that case,

752
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,059
you would have to start
by losing your husband.

753
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,603
That is absurd.

754
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,063
It cannot be.

755
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,777
Superintendent Park!

756
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,782
How could you say such a thing

757
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,201
in front of your future husband?

758
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,080
I have my eye on another man.

759
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,583
Bye now.

760
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,011
Have you heard, Brother?

761
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,557
Yes, I have.

762
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,351
How can a dead man come back to life?

763
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,353
It is impossible.

764
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,148
I will come in.

765
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,699
My lady.

766
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,537
I would like some time alone with Jeong.

767
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,288
I am sure you would.

768
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,166
I have also stayed
right by his side since yesterday.

769
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,460
Have you?

770
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,380
I will leave you to talk.

771
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:35,235
Why did you dare to crawl back here?

772
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,112
Everyone has become happy.

773
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,449
Except for you, Father.

774
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,993
You insolent scoundrel!

775
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,584
I will forget everything you did to me

776
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,169
and look after Mother and my wife.

777
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,256
So, do not worry too much.

778
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,887
Do you understand
that you have ruined my plans?

779
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,305
Please.

780
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,266
Whatever it is,

781
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,477
I hope no one else gets hurt
because of your plans.

782
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,328
I…

783
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,122
So, I…

784
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,626
Brother.

785
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,211
What should I do?

786
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,012
This cannot be.

787
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,430
It simply cannot.

788
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,556
Would you please…

789
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,560
Never mind.

790
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,103
Keep talking.

791
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,607
You should at least talk about it
to soothe your heart.

792
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,859
I am dying to know

793
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,445
who on earth that fool is.

794
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,492
When your husband
is alive and well like this,

795
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,078
you cannot be wearing mourning clothes.

796
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,124
He has already seen me
in mourning clothes a few times, Mother.

797
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,878
Those clothes are what Jae-i wore
before she got married,

798
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,673
but they suit you so well.

799
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,383
You look so beautiful.

800
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,677
Don't you agree?

801
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,136
Yes, Mother.

802
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,600
In those colorful clothes,

803
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,477
she looks even more like that lady.

804
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,022
You only ever wore mourning clothes
after getting married.

805
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,067
You endured so much all this time.

806
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,152
No, Mother.

807
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,363
I have truly been all right.

808
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,364
I mean it.

809
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,992
Our dear Jeong has returned safely,

810
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,161
all thanks to your sincerity.

811
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,664
Wear pretty clothes

812
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,582
and explore beyond our walls.

813
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,918
Let us live in happiness and fortune.

814
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,087
No, Mother.

815
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,881
I do plenty of exploring beyond our walls.

816
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,718
I wear black clothes too,
not just mourning clothes.

817
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,595
Can I not just stay in the shrine
in my mourning clothes again?

818
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,638
I understand.

819
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,392
How can one express such emotions
with only words?

820
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,603
It is only natural
that this feels unfamiliar,

821
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,772
but you must get used to it now.

822
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,443
Now, I will leave you two alone.

823
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,070
Get to know each other better.

824
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,448
Goodness.

825
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,991
Mother?

826
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,035
Mother…

827
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,811
She certainly resembles

828
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,646
Superintendent Park's lover.

829
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,775
Why is he looking at me like that?

830
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,486
It cannot be that he remembers me, can it?

831
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,824
You must have been through so much.

832
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,827
Not at all.

833
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,746
Last time at Myeongdo Inn--

834
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,081
Myeongdo Inn?

835
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,583
I have never been to Myeongdo Inn.

836
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,211
Do you not remember?

837
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,296
Your hair.

838
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,592
I did not recognize you at that time.

839
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,302
I apologize.

840
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,387
I also did not know you were my wife.

841
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,934
But why did you say
you have never been to Myeongdo Inn?

842
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,771
I thought something was wrong with him,

843
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,689
but he seems to be quick-witted.

844
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,361
I think she is hiding something.

845
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,157
A widow should not leave the residence.

846
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,286
I said so because
I do not wish to anger Mother.

847
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,871
I see.

848
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,665
That did not cross my mind.

849
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,709
Anyway,

850
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,296
do you happen to know
a superintendent of the Capital Guard?

851
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,006
Who is that?

852
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,384
I have no idea who you are talking about.

853
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,263
All right, then.

854
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,359
Tonight may be your last chance.

855
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,945
Wait a moment.

856
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,655
Let me think first.

857
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,324
What is there to think about?

858
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,951
Will you stay here?

859
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,245
Yeo-hwa.

860
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,881
Why are you in the shrine again?

861
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,343
It seems that I have
grown used to this place.

862
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,138
Your husband is alive and well.

863
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,516
Do not come here anymore.

864
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,684
Yes, Mother.

865
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:03,438
Also, until Jeong's room is ready,

866
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:06,816
I told him to stay with you
in your quarters for now.

867
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,359
Yes, Mother.

868
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,736
Pardon?

869
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,155
You must continue our family's bloodline.

870
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,908
Until you give birth to a son,

871
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,620
I told Jeong to stay with you
in your quarters.

872
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,796
I would love to have grandchildren
as soon as possible.

873
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,385
Go to your room now.

874
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,618
Do not worry too much.

875
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,538
I am a man with quite good manners.

876
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,667
Now, what are "manners"?

877
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,796
He is truly detestable.

878
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,591
It means that I am a gentleman.

879
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,595
Then I will say this
since you say you are a gentleman.

880
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,598
I was alone during the wedding ceremony
and drank the nuptial wine by myself.

881
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,809
We must officially complete
those formalities

882
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,727
to truly become a married couple.

883
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,230
I did not think of that.

884
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,567
Let us have another wedding.

885
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,987
Did our families exchange information
about our date and time of birth?

886
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,573
I am sure they did.

887
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,533
Did my family send a dowry?

888
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,827
Surely, they sent that as well.

889
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,247
Then we will start with…

890
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,420
the nuptial wine.

891
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,548
Should I just kill him?

892
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,018
I am sorry…

893
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,647
for making you do
all of those things alone.

894
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,565
I apologize.

895
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,109
I wanted

896
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,612
to say that all day today.

897
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,281
I do not know anything about you,

898
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,825
but you clearly went through a lot
because of me.

899
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,410
For that alone,

900
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,911
I wanted

901
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,039
to apologize to you.

902
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,751
Even if someone were to blame,
it would not be you, my…

903
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,338
My hus…

904
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,341
It is not your fault.

905
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,471
It was easy to say it
to a memorial tablet,

906
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,515
but it is hard to do so
to an actual living person.

907
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,184
All right.

908
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,560
Let us go to bed now.

909
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,399
If you are uncomfortable,

910
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,068
I will sleep by the door,

911
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,446
and you can sleep on the mattress.

912
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,126
All right.

913
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,212
I will sleep now.

914
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,299
What are you doing right now?

915
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,385
Just wear that to bed.

916
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,261
It is a habit.

917
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,764
I cannot sleep with my clothes on.

918
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,853
I really did not want to do this
on our first night together.

919
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,648
Then,

920
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,567
I will help you. Please turn around.

921
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,529
Will you?

922
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,496
My lady,

923
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,622
I am actually--

924
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,377
Oh, my husband.

925
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,255
How could you be such a lightweight?

926
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,770
What took you so long?

927
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,106
I had a hard time leaving the house.

928
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,608
You cannot go on like this.

929
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,361
What will you do now?

930
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,864
I must quickly find a way to leave home.

931
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,116
You were looking
for a way to stay until yesterday.

932
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,244
Life must not be easy
for a daughter-in-law.

933
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,330
Anyway,

934
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,709
what kind of a person is your husband?

935
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,169
Do not say the word "husband."

936
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,129
You know who he is.

937
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,549
It was Mr. Joo.
The one who used to sell his goods here.

938
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,717
Mr. Joo?

939
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,844
He acts so strangely.

940
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,888
I am unsure if he knows something or not.

941
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,223
Anyway, please look into him for me.

942
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,225
I cannot believe it was Mr. Joo.

943
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,603
That does seem strange.

944
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,021
It cannot be a coincidence.

945
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,358
I must make Madam Oh talk tomorrow.

946
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,028
This may be our last chance.

947
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,240
If she does not talk,

948
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,328
I am afraid
that I may never find my brother.

949
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:15,124
Someone just as pitiful as you
is sleeping in the room next door.

950
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,794
Will you wake them up
and tell them to leave?

951
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,632
Have you come?

952
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:26,469
I will give you my life, my lord.

953
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,909
My lady?

954
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,385
Just how much did he drink?

955
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,033
I must be starting

956
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,494
to see things now.

957
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,500
My lady.

958
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,547
You are someone else's wife.

959
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,215
My lady…

960
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:59,896
