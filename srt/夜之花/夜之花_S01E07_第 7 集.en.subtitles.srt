1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,875
I am the eldest daughter-in-law
of Lord Seok.

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,712
My name is Cho Yeo-hwa.

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,220
Are you taking a head-on approach?

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,975
I trust that you will not expose
my identity to anyone.

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,685
I am a superintendent of the nation.

6
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,688
-Why would you--
-I know that you have helped every time.

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,231
I have never helped you.

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,649
I am not talking about me.

9
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,278
You have helped
many powerless people in the nation.

10
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,908
You helped Kkon-nim,
the children who were kidnapped,

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,119
and even the finance minister's servant
and his lover.

12
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,915
These are all of the people
you have helped.

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,129
I only got involved by chance.

14
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,091
Would you like to know
why I am going this far?

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,102
I am a widow, as you know.

16
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,313
Being a widow

17
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,816
is considered a sin.

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,445
I do not even know
what my late husband looked like,

19
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,323
but I must only wear mourning clothes,
eat almost nothing,

20
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,158
and must not leave my home.

21
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,497
All I am allowed to do is
grieve for my husband.

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,375
I am nothing but a sinner.

23
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,257
There is only one way for me
to wash away this sin.

24
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,802
I must follow my husband
into the afterlife.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,973
I do not want to be
someone who can do nothing

26
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,768
but wait for the day I die.

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,771
Just being alive condemns me as a sinner.

28
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,398
So, this is my way

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,693
of not giving up and surviving.

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,364
So, let me ask you.

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,366
Will you…

32
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,121
grant me the chance to live?

33
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,634
Did you say she is
the left councilor's daughter-in-law?

34
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,428
Yes, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,641
Six months after the man
named Cho Seong-hu went missing,

36
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,437
his sister got married
to the left councilor's eldest son.

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,397
How could this be?

38
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,191
Were they engaged since childhood?

39
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,694
It does not appear so.

40
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,073
I do not believe that was by coincidence.

41
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,535
Someone like the left councilor
suddenly took a daughter-in-law

42
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,746
from a humble family with no reputation?

43
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,167
If Cho Seong-hu had received
the late king's royal seal,

44
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,337
the left councilor could have taken
in his sister

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,672
so he could use her
to capture Cho Seong-hu.

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,091
I would not put that past him.

47
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,887
If that were true, it is likely
that Cho Seong-hu would stay in hiding.

48
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,055
It could be

49
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,142
that the lady knows
of her brother's whereabouts.

50
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,770
He is, without a doubt,
the one who received

51
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,355
my father's final secret order.

52
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,524
Find out why his sister became
the left councilor's daughter-in-law

53
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,278
and whether she is aware
of any pertinent information.

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,905
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,470
I will…

56
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,515
give you the chance.

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:36,651
But from now on, whatever you do,
you must do so in my presence.

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,445
What do you mean by that?

59
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,781
How do you expect me to keep you safe?

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,034
So,

61
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,829
to prevent any rash behavior,

62
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,206
you must not leave my sight.

63
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:56,379
I am only involved in handing out rice
and giving out medicine.

64
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,506
-Those are just trivial--
-Trivial?

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,344
You jumped over the wall
of a high-ranking official's home,

66
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,471
broke out a criminal
from the police bureau,

67
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,515
and pointed your sword
at a superintendent just now.

68
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,434
How is that "trivial"?

69
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,937
I will keep my eye on you.

70
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,524
If you sneak into the homes
of high officials again,

71
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,651
I can assure you

72
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,862
that you will

73
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,157
see me at the front gates.

74
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,097
What is Madam Oh planning to do now?

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
That is…

76
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:54,062
Tell her to lead a quiet life
as the widow she is.

77
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,399
She is the living embodiment
of Instructions for Women, is she not?

78
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:05,031
It would seem fitting for her
to live in seclusion in a mountain temple.

79
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
-But…
-Why?

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,160
Do you wish to join her as her servant?

81
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,287
No, my lord.

82
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,041
I will deliver your orders to her,
word for word.

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,212
Then, let us wrap up
the case of the finance minister.

84
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,719
Lord Seok!

85
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,850
There is one person
who has been bothering me all along.

86
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,437
He has been tracking
Minister Yeom's case from the start,

87
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,733
but I am not in the position to make
any rash movements against that man.

88
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,236
Who is it?

89
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,614
His name is Park Su-ho,

90
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,450
Royal Advisor Park Yun-hak's brother.

91
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,912
If he is the royal advisor's brother…

92
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,916
is he the chief scholar's son?

93
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,917
Yes, he is.

94
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,503
More than a decade ago,

95
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,297
he was suddenly adopted
when he was over ten years old.

96
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,386
Rumors suggest that he was born
out of wedlock to the chief scholar.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,432
He is a principled man.
That cannot be true.

98
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,649
Find out more about Park Su-ho.

99
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,318
Yes, my lord.

100
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,177
How did it go?

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
It was a flop.

102
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,433
"Do not let me catch you step
out of line."

103
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,270
If he was going to threaten me,
why even bother to help?

104
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,023
That does not sound like a threat to me.

105
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,941
How would he keep an eye on me, anyway?

106
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
He cannot simply barge in.

107
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,740
I should have followed Lady Baek
when she left.

108
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,158
Just say the word.

109
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,202
I will form
a widows' village in Gaegyeong.

110
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,122
By the way.

111
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,336
Lady Baek told me something strange
before leaving for Hamgyeong Province.

112
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,633
Do you remember the ring
that Yong-deok stole from Minister Yeom?

113
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,052
Do you mean Lady Baek's ring?

114
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,931
She already knew that it was Lady Baek's.

115
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,475
But wait.

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,312
Are you saying
that Madam Oh gave a false testimony?

117
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,776
Why on earth would she do that?

118
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,156
Lord Seok must have

119
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,035
completely forgotten
about my contributions.

120
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,620
Indeed.

121
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,789
However,

122
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,417
I do not believe
you will actually live in the mountains.

123
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,922
Go to guard your husband's grave for now,

124
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,135
and I will try to arrange
a place for you to live secretly in Qing.

125
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,974
What have I done so wrong
to run away to Qing?

126
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,643
The entire land of Joseon is
in the hands of Lord Seok.

127
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,730
There is no way for us
to go against his will.

128
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,320
How could he do this to me?
Who do you think gave him all that power?

129
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,407
This will not do.

130
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,536
He will not get rid of me so easily.

131
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,715
You cannot just sit here, sir.

132
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,759
Rumors are spreading in the capital
that the body has gone missing.

133
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,136
What should we do?

134
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,805
The legendary altruist will be captured
at this rate.

135
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,557
Bi-chan.

136
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,768
-There is something you must do.
-Pardon?

137
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,572
Would that not be better
for the legendary altruist as well?

138
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
This is a love
that can never be outmatched.

139
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,913
What remains unfulfilled in this life
will find its way into the next!

140
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,749
Share this with the captain--

141
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,710
And it will spread
throughout the city before you know it!

142
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,254
I am a great storyteller.

143
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,923
Yes. Check on Myeongdo Inn
from time to time as well.

144
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,593
I will do my best
to fulfill my duties, sir!

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,145
They say,
"A fair face may hide a foul heart."

146
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,484
How could a widow
even consider leaving the house?

147
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:56,364
Acting all innocent like that
and pretending to be modest and composed.

148
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,493
Who could even dare to sneak out at night
and lead a double life?

149
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,619
Mother…

150
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,288
What a disgrace to the family.

151
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:10,044
The arrogant wife of the interior minister
has stopped eating and fallen ill.

152
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,129
But…

153
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,636
I am so glad not to have
any worries about such things.

154
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:25,351
I have always believed you far surpass
the interior minister's daughter-in-law.

155
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,853
It is all thanks
to your teachings, Mother.

156
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,938
Very well.

157
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,107
Given this incident,

158
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,151
you must be extra cautious.

159
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,820
I will keep that in mind.

160
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,532
I will constantly keep an eye
on how you carry yourself.

161
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,246
Yes, Mother…

162
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,209
Oh, how cruel fate can be!

163
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,045
Why must the one you love

164
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,383
be left behind in such a wretched manner?

165
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,510
So, what happened to his body?

166
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,640
She roamed the night,
searching endlessly for her lover's body

167
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,226
discarded carelessly in the wasteland.

168
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,311
At last, she found it!

169
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,646
How heartbreaking!

170
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,900
She desperately tried to revive him,

171
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,070
but the corpse had already turned cold

172
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,324
and lay still without an answer.

173
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,411
How is she to live on now?

174
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,956
She heaved her lover's heavy body
with her frail arms

175
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,708
and dragged it behind her.

176
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,003
Then she vanished,
leaving no trace behind.

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,343
What a beautiful story.

178
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,096
And how sad love can be…

179
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,100
Are you okay, sir?

180
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,199
Who said you could sell things here?

181
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,619
I was not told by anyone.

182
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,454
I just did as I pleased.

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,541
How dare you speak so freely?
Do you know whose street this is?

184
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,628
From what I can see,

185
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,757
you cannot be the owner of this street.

186
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,345
I know for sure

187
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,724
that this entire street belongs
to the Unjong family!

188
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,393
Is that not right?

189
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,728
Is it not?

190
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,231
That is… Ladies and gentlemen?

191
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,943
Is that not right? Regardless!

192
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,861
Put this back the way it was

193
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,196
-and apologize!
-Apologize?

194
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,990
Keep pushing it, punk.

195
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,033
Wait a second.

196
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,461
If you knew who I was,
you would not treat me so disrespectfully.

197
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,133
Hold on.

198
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,261
-Calm down.
-What is going on here?

199
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,393
Get up.

200
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,397
Thank you.

201
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,985
How dare you draw your swords
in public during the day?

202
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,862
Do you have no regard for the law?

203
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,613
Look who is here.

204
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,079
Why are you disciplining my men this time?

205
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,418
Why can you not just turn a blind eye
to a small dispute among merchants?

206
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,924
I was merely trying to stop
a bunch of outlaw look-alikes.

207
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,302
Could you be any more naive?

208
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,722
Why would you stir things up
so recklessly?

209
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,015
I also heard

210
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,436
you even went to the police
because of Minister Yeom's incident.

211
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,648
Guildmaster Kang,
you seem very interested in that case.

212
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,693
How could I not be?

213
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:10,284
Not when that wench Jang So-un
and you are so involved.

214
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,418
Was there not a girl who came
for seamstress work at the Capital Guard?

215
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,087
Oh, dear!

216
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,672
Seeing your surprised face,

217
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,176
I am getting very curious
about who she could be.

218
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,138
Well, then. I bid you farewell.

219
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,775
I appreciate your help.

220
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,486
My name is Joo Yo-seop.

221
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,950
I have been living abroad for a long time.

222
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,328
I am sorry.

223
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,082
What happened to the warm sentiments
of the Unjong Street that I once knew?

224
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
If you want to sell your merchandise,

225
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,713
go to Myeongdo Inn
and ask the head guildmaster.

226
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,883
Sorry to inconvenience you
on our first meeting.

227
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,723
It may not look like much,

228
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,226
but I personally made
these plum blossom hairpins.

229
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,436
Gift it to your beloved.

230
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,690
I do not have one. It is all right.

231
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,941
Come on now!

232
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,568
Look at you. You clearly do!

233
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,197
It is a token of my appreciation.

234
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,617
But…

235
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,085
How can the royal palace,
which should set an example,

236
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,921
prevent Madam Oh
from guarding her husband's grave?

237
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,798
This is unprecedented in history.

238
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,970
But how could I heartlessly refuse
my mother's earnest request?

239
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,972
She got the news early in the morning

240
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,307
and said she could not send away
Madam Oh like that.

241
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,726
It even made her cry.

242
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,854
This is not Your Majesty's business
in the first place.

243
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,149
Is there any way
you could come up with a justification

244
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,068
for Madam Oh
to continue staying in Hanyang?

245
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,197
She has repeatedly shown kindness
to those suffering from poverty,

246
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,367
so if the royal court can provide
a suitable excuse--

247
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:20,831
If the queen dowager intervenes
for personal reasons in this case,

248
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,584
she will become
a laughingstock to the nation.

249
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,214
So, Your Majesty must dissuade her
and fulfill your duty as a son.

250
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,640
You seem to have grown weary
over the past few days.

251
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:45,105
I had been preoccupied
with many tasks to take care of.

252
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,525
That must be why I seem to be weak.

253
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
When will you leave
for your husband's grave?

254
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,197
I do not know yet.

255
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,327
I would have left as early as tomorrow,

256
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:04,208
but the queen dowager is not allowing me
to go.

257
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,462
Madam Oh, there is
still a lot of work left for you to do.

258
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,091
It would make me sad
if you left like that.

259
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,095
I wish I had got
to know you better, Lady Yoo.

260
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,598
And the same goes
for your daughter-in-law.

261
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,683
It is truly regretful.

262
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,853
It is not too late
for us to visit each other more often.

263
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,191
The reason I came here today was for me

264
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,195
to receive teachings
from your daughter-in-law.

265
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,948
Pardon?

266
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,785
I told you not to come back
when you visited

267
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,079
because I was preoccupied with my leave.

268
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,082
Now, it looks
like I will not be going for a while.

269
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,878
So, I thought I could learn more
from your daughter-in-law,

270
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,091
who has been
a faithful widow for a long time.

271
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,387
I could not possibly teach you, Madam Oh.

272
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,888
Please reconsider your wish.

273
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,306
That is right.

274
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,059
She should be the one to learn from you.

275
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,980
In that case,

276
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,735
how about you visit me at home
and keep me company from time to time?

277
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,446
Would that be all right?

278
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,220
Royal Advisor Park!

279
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,600
-Are you here to see His Majesty?
-Yes.

280
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,853
He invited me to a game of janggi,
so I came to meet with him.

281
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,981
You have been working so hard
for His Majesty,

282
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,567
and I have not even treated you
to a drink.

283
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,986
Please do not say that.

284
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,905
I am simply fulfilling my duty.

285
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,741
They say to strike while the iron is hot.

286
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
Will you come to my house this evening?

287
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,998
I would gladly accept your invitation.

288
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,459
I will be waiting for you.

289
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,463
Oh, I almost forgot!

290
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,052
I heard you have a brilliant sibling.

291
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,096
Why not bring him with you?

292
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,516
Are you talking about my younger brother?

293
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,645
I heard he is a talented man
who excelled at the state exam.

294
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,898
I would love to meet him
through this opportunity.

295
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,946
Yes.

296
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,740
I look forward to it then.

297
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,176
Yeon-seon, I feel Madam Oh is
a bit strange--

298
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,638
-Oh, my goodness!
-You startled me too!

299
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,515
Yeon-seon told you earlier

300
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,475
that she was going
to the rental bookstore.

301
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,102
Did she say that?

302
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,562
So, what brings you here?

303
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,731
I walked in
because you were not responding.

304
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,651
But you were just sitting in silence.

305
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,783
Lady Yoo mentioned
that a guest was coming today

306
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,077
and asked you to come to the kitchen.

307
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,704
All right, then.

308
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,523
What are you doing?

309
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,734
Oh, nothing.

310
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,361
I needed to buy something.

311
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,613
Then why are you not looking at the items?

312
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,866
Why are you eyeing up the people instead?

313
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
Are you looking for someone?

314
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,579
No, that is not it.

315
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,457
-A criminal?
-No, that is definitely not it!

316
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,376
-Then, a lover?
-Oh, absolutely not!

317
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,838
Then who are you looking for?

318
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,844
How can you be so pretty

319
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,680
and cause so much trouble?

320
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,350
Did you just call me… pretty?

321
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,525
Wait. I think I left the fire on
in the kitchen.

322
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,869
Gift it to your beloved.

323
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,580
-I do not have one. It is all right.
-Come on now!

324
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,124
Look at you. You clearly do!

325
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,978
The lack of sleep must be getting to me.

326
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,278
Did you hear the story, Superintendent?

327
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,573
What story are you talking about?

328
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,161
The criminal who killed Lord Yeom.

329
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,541
They were so passionately in love…

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,210
Yes, I heard.

331
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,505
But if there were someone
who stole the body of a felon,

332
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,632
should we not catch them and execute them?

333
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,551
We, the Capital Guard, must catch them--

334
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,678
I cannot let you do that!

335
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,059
How can you be so heartless?

336
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:00,939
Are you really going to ignore
the heart-wrenching sadness

337
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,859
welling up inside you
after hearing such a tearful story?

338
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,863
Then what should I do?

339
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,075
The higher-ups have
already ordered the case to be closed.

340
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,371
So, do not instigate trouble
by trying to find out who stole the body.

341
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,001
I personally cannot allow it!

342
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,090
Understood, sir.

343
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,763
What is the matter?

344
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,726
A message arrived to the superintendent
from Royal Advisor Park.

345
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,187
From my brother?

346
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,355
Alewife!

347
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,858
Let me have a bowl of soup
and some rice wine!

348
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,817
Right away!

349
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,069
Welcome!

350
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,487
The left councilor has just

351
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,907
invited my brother and me to his house.

352
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,074
How does he know him?

353
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,661
I do not have
a good feeling about this, Your Majesty.

354
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,750
It cannot be a coincidence
that these things keep happening.

355
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,797
Your brother must be protected
before our plan gets discovered.

356
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,720
What have you called me for?

357
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,430
There is somewhere we need to go.

358
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,932
Where are we going?

359
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,227
The left councilor has invited us
to his house.

360
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,895
The left councilor?

361
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:22,854
Why?

362
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,899
Have you met the left councilor before?

363
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,445
No. I am yet to meet him.

364
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,822
Su-ho.

365
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,410
No matter
what the left councilor says today,

366
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,287
be careful not to respond hastily.

367
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,247
Pardon?

368
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,834
You will understand the reason eventually,
so be careful with every word you say.

369
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,379
Yes, I will.

370
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,880
Very well.

371
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,137
So,

372
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,223
if you let me open a stall,

373
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:03,061
I will give Myeongdo Inn
twenty percent of my profits.

374
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,566
You are quite skilled.

375
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,068
I know.

376
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,531
You do not come across these kinds
of Western-style products very often.

377
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,076
So, customers will flock
to Myeongdo Inn like clouds.

378
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,204
And here is a secret.

379
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,754
I am quite a smooth talker.

380
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,181
Very well.

381
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,311
Let us start with twenty percent
but go up to thirty percent

382
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,937
once your business is established.

383
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:51,484
In return, we will manage
and deliver your goods.

384
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,040
Then, the contract has been sealed.

385
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,542
You can start
your business tomorrow, Mr. Joo.

386
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,502
-Got it.
-One more thing.

387
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,546
Come in.

388
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,637
My name is Kkon-nim.

389
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,391
She will be assisting you from now on.

390
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,810
I will give you a tour of Myeongdo Inn.

391
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,020
Please follow me.

392
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,066
Good evening, ma'am.

393
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,784
His appearance and speech may be strange…

394
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,413
but he must be the son of a noble family.

395
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,333
Who could he be?

396
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,425
Welcome home, my lord!

397
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,470
I apologize
for the sudden notice about guests.

398
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,222
It must have kept you busy, my lady.

399
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,348
Do not mention it.

400
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,225
This is naturally my duty as a woman.

401
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,978
Yeo-hwa, you must be tired too.

402
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,271
Go on and get some rest.

403
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,773
Yes, Father.

404
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,067
Lord Seok.

405
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,611
The royal advisor has arrived.

406
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,744
There you are.

407
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,954
Yes, Left Councilor.

408
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,373
Welcome.

409
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,625
Thank you for visiting us
at our humble abode.

410
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,877
I appreciate your invitation.

411
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,341
You must be
the royal advisor's brother.

412
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,343
Allow me to introduce myself.

413
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,595
I am
Capital Guard Superintendent Park Su-ho.

414
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,183
I have heard great things about you.

415
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,102
I am pleased to finally meet you.

416
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,019
Likewise, sir.

417
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,856
I have been wanting to meet you as well.

418
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,444
Let us go in now.

419
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,903
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

420
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,327
You may be dismissed.

421
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,623
What are you still doing here?

422
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,333
Return to your quarters at once.

423
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,251
Yes, Mother.

424
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,139
I did not even climb
over any walls yesterday.

425
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,599
Why on earth did he come here?

426
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,227
Why has Yeon-seon not returned yet?

427
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,730
We are in a state of disconnection now…

428
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,356
DISCONNECTION: BEING OUT
OF TOUCH FOR A LONG TIME

429
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,943
…but I studied
under the same teacher as your father

430
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,280
and even taught you when you were young.

431
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,991
I had been too distant
toward you for too long.

432
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,578
It is truly an honor
to visit your home, Left Councilor.

433
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,040
You are well esteemed
by all civil and military officials.

434
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,129
I am embarrassed
to hear that said to my face.

435
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,925
Let us meet up often from now on.

436
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,142
By the way,

437
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,814
I heard the chief scholar took you in
when you were about ten.

438
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,696
I know well
the chief scholar's character,

439
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,824
so I do not believe in empty rumors.

440
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,830
He must have seen your potential
to excel at the state exam

441
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,873
and adopted you as his son.

442
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,292
I do not know the details of that time,

443
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,755
but I consider myself fortunate
to have a great younger brother like him.

444
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,718
But you did not care for your brother
as he roamed the nation for three years.

445
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,263
You really are quite cold-hearted.

446
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,892
Were you not disappointed
with your brother?

447
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,479
I have never thought so, sir.

448
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,400
If you ever have any trouble,
you can come to me anytime.

449
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,113
I will help you

450
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,283
without telling your brother.

451
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,540
He should not bother you
with personal matters.

452
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,376
Since I value people,

453
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:23,214
if someone is talented, I will
naturally promote them to a good position.

454
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,676
I think that my current position is
more than enough.

455
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,805
You are far too humble!

456
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,351
I need to use the restroom for a moment.

457
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,103
Please go ahead.

458
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,867
I am going to pay more attention

459
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:55,538
to your brother than you from now on.

460
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,044
Please, sir. There is no need.

461
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,089
Since he is someone with few ambitions,

462
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,676
I am sure he meant it when he said
his current position is enough.

463
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,596
This is unusual for you.

464
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,557
You are a very strict older brother
to your sibling.

465
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,952
What are you doing?

466
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,755
What are you…

467
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,635
What are you doing here?

468
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,804
I saw someone eavesdropping,

469
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,848
so I was about to ask
what they were curious about.

470
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,892
I…

471
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,727
I have…

472
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,355
I have something to say.

473
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,356
Go ahead.

474
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,608
I am sorry.

475
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,072
So, I kindly request that you keep
your lips sealed to my father-in-law.

476
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,409
Do you even know why I am here?

477
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,913
If you keep my secret, I will
definitely repay this debt to you, sir.

478
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,293
I do not wish to be in such a position.

479
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,338
If you ever tell anyone about me,

480
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,009
I will become a vengeful ghost
and haunt you wherever you go.

481
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,268
I made it clear
that I will keep you in my sight.

482
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,689
It is just a friendly reminder.

483
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,533
This night is still young.
It is a shame to send you away like this.

484
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,996
We must not cause trouble
to you and your wife any longer.

485
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,874
It was an honor to have been invited.

486
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,126
Then, I will see you again soon.

487
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,962
Take care.

488
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,547
-Yes, Lady Yoo.
-Thank you.

489
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,550
-Let us go.
-Yes.

490
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,570
Please go on ahead, Brother.

491
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,285
Do you have something left to tell me?

492
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,458
Come to the rental bookstore
on Unjong Street at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

493
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,918
The rental bookstore?

494
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,336
Do not be late.

495
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,735
I have not seen you in days.

496
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,863
How have you been, sir?

497
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,534
What are you doing wandering around
so fearlessly at this late hour alone?

498
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,745
I was just over
at the left councilor's house,

499
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,956
-but I did not see you, so…
-Why were you there?

500
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,208
Lord Seok called me over for a drink.

501
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,462
Did the superintendent go
with you as well?

502
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,466
Well, he did come with me,

503
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,764
but why are you asking me about him?

504
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,934
Well…

505
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,648
With his towering stature

506
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,860
and his chiseled looks,

507
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,071
it is only natural
for me to be curious about him.

508
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,743
But I am much taller than he is.

509
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,079
And I am not exactly bad-looking…

510
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,583
Yes.

511
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,672
Nothing special happened today, right?

512
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,756
What do you mean?

513
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,968
Well, I don't know.

514
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,805
Perhaps the superintendent was looking
for someone

515
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,393
or saying something strange
that you could not understand.

516
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,105
Are you wondering
if he was looking for you?

517
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,481
That is not it.

518
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,193
Please forget I ever mentioned it.

519
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,194
Wait!

520
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,905
Let me ask you one thing too.

521
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,074
It is about your lady.

522
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,409
What about her?

523
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,663
I am just curious to know
what kind of a person she is.

524
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,250
Is it not obvious?

525
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,838
Her heart and appearance are
as beautiful as an angel.

526
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,466
I have never seen
anyone as beautiful as my lady.

527
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,926
No one else in the world is…

528
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,347
Wait.

529
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,557
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

530
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,769
Oh, you know.

531
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,563
You said yourself
that she was as beautiful as an angel.

532
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,650
Is it not natural for me
to be curious about her?

533
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,613
Yes, I guess so.

534
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,990
I suppose it is.

535
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,330
Take care, sir…

536
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,667
Wait… But…

537
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,759
Why on earth is she upset with me?

538
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,896
Surely he would not say anything
if I begged him that much?

539
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,366
A Good Companion.

540
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,879
If you want to hear about your brother,

541
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,467
give this book to the person
who visits you in five days.

542
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,851
Was there not a girl who came
for seamstress work at the Capital Guard?

543
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,064
Oh, dear!

544
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,609
I am getting very curious
about who she could be.

545
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,325
Lady Cho!

546
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,659
Lady Yoo wishes to see you!

547
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,328
I will be right out.

548
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,839
-Did you call for me?
-Yes.

549
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,759
The Peony Society is meeting
at Myeongdo Inn.

550
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,763
Madam Oh insisted that I bring you along.

551
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,390
Go and get ready.

552
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,225
Yes, Mother.

553
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,608
Your eyes are like the deep blue sea!

554
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,070
Oh, my. Do not embarrass me.

555
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,993
There was a woman whose eyes were
the same color as this ring.

556
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,206
This is the tale of a man from Joseon
who left his family and parents

557
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,707
because of his passion for a woman.

558
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,668
He left his family and parents?

559
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,712
Are you interested?

560
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,550
Let me start without further delay.

561
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,469
-This man--
-Is he out of his mind?

562
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,305
How could he leave his family and parents?

563
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,473
How could you say that?

564
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,809
It is quite possible
to be blinded by love!

565
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,855
In faraway England, there was a bachelor
and a bachelorette named Romeo and Juliet.

566
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,816
The man died first,
and the woman followed after him.

567
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,944
-Even in their final moments, the two--
-What is this?

568
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
Another virtuous woman?

569
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,615
Tell us another story.

570
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,160
-Yes, tell us something else.
-Come on.

571
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,288
Are you not curious about a couple
who loved each other to death?

572
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,291
Who wants to hear about a woman
who died after her husband?

573
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,251
By the way, have you heard?

574
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,044
You know the virtuous woman's gate?

575
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,340
The left councilor's home will get it
since Lady Baek disappeared.

576
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,467
-Really?
-Is that so?

577
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,634
A virtuous woman's gate?

578
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,762
To the left councilor's house? Why?

579
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,055
What do you mean, why?

580
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,683
The king is rewarding a faithful widow.

581
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,978
I am not saying it is easy
to be a widow for 15 years.

582
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,855
But is that really enough?

583
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,984
Everyone thinks that the honor is given
because of the left councilor's influence.

584
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:31,780
I heard this from somewhere,
but that gentle-looking Lady Yoo is

585
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,617
absolutely obsessed
with the virtuous woman's gate!

586
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,035
-Oh, my!
-After all,

587
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,371
her eldest son died on his wedding day,
disrupting the family line.

588
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,542
Wait a minute. The eldest son died?

589
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,211
What do you mean? I died--

590
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,671
They had a wedding?

591
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,007
I guess you missed out
since you were in Qing.

592
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,593
I do not envy her fate.

593
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,846
She was denied a wedding ceremony,
and after remaining faithful for 15 years,

594
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,557
she will eventually be pushed
to her own grave.

595
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,310
-I could never live like that!
-Neither could I!

596
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,688
Who died?

597
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,775
I did?

598
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,698
Did they really kill me off?

599
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,375
How are you, Head Guildmaster?

600
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,544
Welcome, Lady Yoo.

601
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,004
We are in the midst
of taking down the stands

602
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,923
because I did not get the notice in time.

603
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,883
Do not worry about it. Come on.

604
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,843
Let us head inside.

605
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

606
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,471
Come this way!

607
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,115
-It has been too long.
-It is good to see you.

608
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,367
Did you hear the news?

609
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,660
What news?

610
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,997
Recently, a decent-looking merchant

611
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,542
with great talking skills showed up
at Myeongdo Inn.

612
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,877
I heard that too.

613
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,632
He does not seem like a merchant
but rather dignified, like a nobleman.

614
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:17,303
He said there would be big trouble
if we knew his identity.

615
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,806
Could it be that he was
born out of wedlock?

616
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,478
I wonder whose son he could be…

617
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,399
Anyway, for a mere merchant,

618
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,110
he seems to understand
a woman's heart quite well.

619
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,073
Just like how
the left councilor looks after Lady Yoo.

620
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,410
What are you talking about?

621
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:46,248
Are you implying
that he must be from our family?

622
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,459
That is not what I meant.

623
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,378
I meant to say he was
as kind as Lord Seok.

624
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,260
I may have misspoken
in front of your daughter-in-law.

625
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,733
I feel a bit dizzy
because I am only used to the shrine.

626
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,282
How about I take your daughter-in-law
to the main house for a while?

627
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,534
Would you do that for me?

628
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,997
It was Madam Oh
who requested to see you today.

629
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,208
But go and rest for a bit.

630
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,043
Yes, Mother.

631
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,007
Slowly, carefully!

632
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,973
Do you have something urgent to tell me?

633
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,894
I received this last night.

634
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,357
What could be the meaning of this?

635
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,775
Head Guildmaster.

636
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,026
Can I come in?

637
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,695
He should be at the Capital Guard.
Why is he here again?

638
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,155
Should I send him away?

639
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,866
No, that is okay.

640
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,620
I should meet him
as I have something to ask.

641
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,419
Please come in.

642
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,927
Why are you here?

643
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,096
I am a stakeholder in Myeongdo Inn.

644
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,558
I heard the Peony Society is meeting
here today.

645
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,563
You must be getting
very comfortable with me around.

646
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,445
Here you go.

647
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,287
I am here on a valid occasion,
so you cannot fault me for anything.

648
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,830
If you are

649
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,250
following me deliberately
to try to get me in trouble--

650
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,334
I am a busy man.

651
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,086
Then why are you here?

652
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,256
I came to speak with the head guildmaster.

653
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,384
Should we speak in private?

654
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,969
You can speak with her here.

655
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,764
Did you not tell me to stay in your sight?

656
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,561
You two should speak first.

657
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,781
It is good to see everyone.

658
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,368
Please come in, Madam Oh.

659
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,578
Please have a seat.

660
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,292
I hope you have all been doing well.

661
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,418
-Yes.
-Yes.

662
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,337
I understand

663
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,049
that it is improper to come out
while in mourning,

664
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,344
but before going to my husband's grave,

665
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:50,098
I felt I had to address the plight
of those starving outside Sugu Gate.

666
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,101
So, I urgently requested this meeting.

667
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,645
It is quite all right.

668
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,022
You are the embodiment
of Instructions for Women.

669
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,941
-An excellent example.
-That is right.

670
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,778
Where is your daughter-in-law?

671
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,782
She was not feeling well,
so I sent her to the main house.

672
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,659
You can speak with her later.

673
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,536
Very well.

674
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,791
Kang Pil-jik is watching Myeongdo Inn
and the masked figure.

675
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,585
It has been so for quite a while.

676
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,879
He seems to be aware

677
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,424
that I am also involved
with the masked figure and the inn.

678
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,385
That was how it seemed.

679
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,055
Seven years ago,

680
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,684
I started working with Myeongdo Inn
after saving Lady Jang.

681
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,646
The person who attempted
to kill Lady Jang at that time

682
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,690
was none other than Kang Pil-jik.

683
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,527
I should have done everything
to have him put behind bars.

684
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,945
That is my job.

685
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,572
I should have gotten rid of him, then!

686
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,284
I am not saying I will do that now.

687
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,120
You had better watch out.

688
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,289
Yes, Superintendent.
I will make sure of it.

689
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:59,042
I will not be coming out for a while
for the sake of Myeongdo Inn.

690
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,591
Can you not

691
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,594
think of yourself first?

692
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,899
How is the investigation
into Minister Yeom's murderer going?

693
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,073
Since the case is officially closed,
I am investigating it secretly.

694
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,908
Please do not worry.

695
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,664
Madam Oh may have already known
Yong-deok was not the real murderer.

696
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,461
Did you already know?

697
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,881
Then,

698
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,176
does she know who the real culprit is?

699
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,218
Lady Cho.

700
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,679
Do not concern yourself with this anymore.

701
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,642
Do you know what I have been through
because of this?

702
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,894
Are you there, Head Guildmaster?

703
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,438
How can you just leave like that?

704
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,566
Hey, I know you!

705
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,943
Is the head guildmaster in?

706
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,992
How rude!

707
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,204
Pardon my intrusion.

708
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,748
Please keep enjoying yourselves.

709
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,630
Are you all right?

710
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,176
What did I say? You clearly have a lover.

711
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,097
What is he…

712
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,988
Sorry for the late greeting.

713
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,907
Are you feeling better?

714
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,454
I was so busy with the Peony Society
that I had no time to speak with you.

715
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,624
If you are available tomorrow,

716
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:06,962
could we possibly meet
briefly at my house?

717
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,052
I will send her to you early tomorrow.

718
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,597
Then, I will see you tomorrow.

719
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,102
We will be taking our leave.

720
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,478
Yes, please take care.

721
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,523
-Let us go.
-Yes, Mother.

722
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,586
What is it that you need to tell me?

723
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,257
You must not tell Lady Cho
what I am about to ask you.

724
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,134
Please go ahead.

725
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,804
I need information about Madam Oh
that is not known to the public.

726
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,021
My goodness!

727
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,105
What are you doing?

728
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,483
I was told to close my stall for a bit.

729
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,860
The head guildmaster said
everyone has left.

730
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,320
We can get back to work now.

731
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,743
Do not just sit there!

732
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,287
The opening week sales will not keep you
afloat for long.

733
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,831
You must hurry
and welcome the new customers

734
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,042
and convince the ones leaving
to stick around!

735
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,214
I have a lot to learn, Master Kkon-nim.

736
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,383
It is all for Myeongdo Inn's success.

737
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:39,930
Well, then.

738
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,224
Please wait for me, Master!

739
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,383
Come this way.

740
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,835
We finally meet.

741
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,130
It is His Majesty. Show your respect.

742
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,676
Very well.

743
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,263
I heard you have been busy
since joining the Capital Guard.

744
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,017
I was simply fulfilling my duties,
Your Majesty.

745
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,105
I heard you discovered
that the finance minister was poisoned

746
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,649
and that there is another culprit.

747
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,445
Who is it that you suspect?

748
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,032
I believe

749
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,076
it was the finance minister's wife, Sire.

750
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,919
I have not found any certain evidence yet.

751
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,464
-If you give me time--
-Fifteen years ago

752
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,300
when my father passed away suddenly,

753
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:44,095
everyone said he died of a disease,
but I could not believe it.

754
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,766
I tried to investigate further,

755
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,478
but the general of the King's Guard,
who had visited my father that night,

756
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,813
got massacred with his family
by unknown assailants.

757
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,233
Your Majesty, are you aware
of what happened to my family back then?

758
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,489
Do you understand
where your current pursuit will lead you?

759
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:07,702
Minister Yeom's death is
surely connected to that day's events.

760
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:14,501
The group that wants to cover it up
still controls this nation,

761
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,878
and I do not have the power
to fight against them yet.

762
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,256
Therefore,

763
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,301
if you wish
to continue investigating this,

764
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,180
your life will be in danger again.

765
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,308
So, it would be best to stop now.

766
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,564
But, Your Majesty!

767
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,775
If I stop my work now,

768
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,612
who will punish those
who are responsible for what happened?

769
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:56,710
You have the same look in your eyes
as General Im Gang does in my memory.

770
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,673
Your eyes are truly upright and firm.

771
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,305
I must apologize to you.

772
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:14,060
However, this is also the fate
that we must face.

773
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,980
Yes, Sire.

774
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,487
How would you like to join us?

775
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,379
Is it true that my parents' murder

776
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,424
is linked to the events of that day?

777
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,510
That night,

778
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,514
His Majesty the late king
urgently summoned me.

779
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,562
Yun-hak.

780
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,566
Even if I cannot protect the crown prince,

781
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:06,279
will you remain by his side
and protect his safety?

782
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

783
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,325
I shall give you my word.

784
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,451
Moreover,

785
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,330
if something happens
to the general of the King's Guard,

786
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,875
can you take care
of the rest of his family?

787
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,668
Pardon?

788
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,171
Perhaps

789
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,467
I have committed
a transgression against his family.

790
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,140
We will be faced
with a great disaster tonight.

791
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,351
What do you mean, Sire?

792
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,229
If I do not succeed in my plans,

793
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,148
I might

794
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,777
never see you again.

795
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,754
Sir? Wake up!

796
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,297
Can you hear me?

797
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,845
Are you awake, my boy?

798
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,348
Hang in there. Just for a little longer.

799
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,688
We were unable to discover anything
after all these years,

800
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,150
and the events
from that day have still not ended.

801
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,028
Therefore, as you dig deeper
into this case,

802
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,116
you might not be able
to continue living as you are now.

803
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,873
No matter how hard I try to recall it,

804
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,625
the memory of that day keeps escaping me.

805
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,714
I am in so much pain, Brother.

806
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,388
That is why…

807
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,351
you could not truly become Park Su-ho.

808
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,187
I need to find out

809
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,982
what I really went through 15 years ago.

810
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,944
Only then will I be able
to truly live as Park Su-ho.

811
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,515
What is wrong with me?

812
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:55,174
Now that I am a widow,
it has been hard to meet up with people.

813
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,968
I am already feeling lonely.

814
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,179
It must have been
so hard for you, Lady Cho.

815
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,140
It was not difficult for me.

816
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,395
Since I have never had a husband,

817
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,398
I do not fully understand
the feeling of loneliness and desolation.

818
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,776
My parents-in-law have
also taken good care of me.

819
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,156
The left councilor and Lady Yoo are

820
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,159
truly warm-hearted people.

821
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,877
Is it true you have a brother
you have not heard from?

822
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,718
Lady Cho!

823
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,220
What is the matter?

824
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,933
You must go to the shrine right away.

825
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,132
I have returned, Mother…

826
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:21,928
Let me borrow your fan.

827
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,612
What is this?

828
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,134
EPILOGUE

829
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,510
What is he…

830
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,431
Goodness…

831
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,476
Seriously?

832
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,645
Calm down, Lady Cho.

833
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,398
-I was covering your face--
-Why are you doing this to me?

834
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,027
Hey, will you…

835
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,032
Lady Jang?

836
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,327
-It is not what you think.
-It is not what you think.

837
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,417
What are you talking about?

838
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,837
What is there to think about?

839
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,174
It is time for you all to go home.

840
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,009
Please follow me out.

841
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,818
Are you feeling hot, Lady Cho?

842
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,737
You are blushing all over!

843
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,238
No, I am not.

844
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,783
It is so darn cold these days.

845
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,421
What…

846
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,173
Hold on.

847
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,217
Why is it so warm?

848
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,594
It is not even summer yet.

849
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,125
It seems your brother was involved

850
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,879
in a secret affair inside the palace.

851
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,589
Who else knows about the incident?

852
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,800
My father-in-law?

853
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,051
While we are here,

854
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,720
should we buy
some sticky rice cakes to take home?

855
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:13,516
My mother also loved
the sticky rice cakes I would bring her.

856
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,601
-Mother?
-Wait. Is that…

857
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,816
What if this note was sent
by someone dangerous?

858
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,985
This is far more dangerous than you think.

859
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,653
It is better not to know.

860
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,406
-You are worrying about Lady Cho again.
-Sir!

861
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:33,619
