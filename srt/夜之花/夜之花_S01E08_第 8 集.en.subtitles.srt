00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,246
MEMORIAL TABLET OF YEO-HWA'S
HUSBAND AND SEOK JI-SEONG'S SON

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,915
You have never appeared
in my dreams before.

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,794
For what reason are you visiting me now?

4
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,078
Lady Cho!

5
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,498
You must go to the shrine right away.

6
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,764
I have returned, Mother…

7
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,235
What is this?

8
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,035
It is a fan.

9
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,079
Do you think I do not know that?

10
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,207
Why is a man's fan in the shrine?

11
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,961
I do not know either, Mother.

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,547
Very well.

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,049
If you do not know,

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,720
then I must find the person
who would dare to defile

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
my dear Jeong's shrine.

16
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,183
-Bongmal.
-Yes, my lady.

17
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,354
Gather all of the servants
and find the owner of this fan.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,482
Find them by any means,
even if you must flog them.

19
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,067
No, Mother!

20
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,656
What did you just say?

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,283
Mother…

22
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,077
It cannot be.

23
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,370
The thing is…

24
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,164
Did you really…

25
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,082
It was…

26
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,670
I am the one who hid it.

27
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,839
What do you think you are doing?

28
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,382
How dare you get involved?

29
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,259
Yeon-seon, wait outside.

30
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555
My lady,

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,057
I have committed a grave sin.

32
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,605
My lady, Lady Cho knows
nothing about this.

33
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,981
That fan was

34
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,317
hidden away by me.

35
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,615
If you are lying to me
with that cunning tongue,

36
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,200
you will not leave here in one piece.

37
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
So, tell me.

38
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,079
Who does this fan belong to?

39
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,505
I was walking down a mountain path alone

40
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,342
when I encountered
a group of bandits and was in danger.

41
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,513
The servants ran away,

42
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,975
and the scary bandits approached me
with swords.

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,480
"If you do not give us the rice,
something terrible will happen to you."

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,565
As they stepped closer,

45
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,735
I was so terrified that I froze.

46
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,613
"Somebody save me. Help me."

47
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,782
At that moment…

48
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,369
Halt!

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,295
Someone appeared and saved me.

50
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,759
He dropped that fan on the ground

51
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
and abruptly disappeared.

52
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,909
So, you are saying
you do not know who it was?

53
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,080
Must you be thrown out of this house
before you tell me?

54
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,581
It was Royal Advisor Park!

55
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,209
Are you referring

56
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,378
to the second son

57
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,756
of the chief scholar?

58
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,218
Yes.

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,554
How could I dare return it to him?

60
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,723
But I cannot get rid of it either.

61
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,352
I see.

62
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,066
Prepare to go out.

63
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,446
-Pardon?
-You are a servant of our household.

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,990
Should we not go and thank him in person?

65
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,451
Follow me.

66
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,561
The chief eunuch asked
the eunuch on the long shift at the time.

67
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:59,025
That night, the finance minister's wife
personally served tea to my father.

68
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,486
If so,

69
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,530
was Madam Oh truly the one who did it?

70
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,534
For a long time, she has stayed
by my mother's side like a shadow.

71
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,871
She was upright
and never once asked for a personal favor.

72
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,542
Why would she do such a thing?

73
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,086
I doubt

74
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,546
that she was working alone.

75
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,717
Fifteen years ago,
she visited the queen's quarters freely.

76
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,347
It is likely then
that she got involved with Lord Seok.

77
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,022
Since the poisonous petals
have reappeared,

78
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,775
the left councilor will try
to keep things in control

79
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,902
by getting rid of the root of the issue.

80
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,363
To prevent the truth
from being buried again,

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,951
I will tell my brother
to keep a close eye on Madam Oh.

82
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,972
Why are you not organizing your stand?

83
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,224
They say I am dead.

84
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,810
Can you see me, Head Guildmaster?

85
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,023
You do not look like a ghost to me.

86
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,695
Head Guildmaster.

87
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,406
You know of everything
that happens in Hanyang, right?

88
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:32,493
They say that every rumor
in Hanyang passes through Myeongdo Inn.

89
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,413
-Ask away.
-Then, do you know

90
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,332
Lord Seok's widowed daughter-in-law?

91
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,876
I do not know her.

92
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,628
-You spoke as if you know all--
-Head Guildmaster!

93
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,755
I have brought him.

94
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,799
Welcome.

95
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,177
It is good to see you yet again.

96
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,638
I heard it was urgent.

97
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,140
Please come inside.

98
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,067
-I have a question.
-I do not know.

99
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,194
About what?

100
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,278
Where are you going?

101
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,906
I did not even ask you anything!

102
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,078
Have you found something

103
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,623
about the finance minister's wife?

104
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,708
Yes.

105
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,085
I was quite shocked to learn of it.

106
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,462
What is it?

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,132
Have you forgotten that I was a merchant?

108
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,225
This cannot be bought with money.

109
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,727
What is it that you want?

110
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,190
Will you promise
to give me whatever I want?

111
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,526
As long as it does not break the law,

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,736
I promise that I will.

113
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,823
I will take your word for it and tell you.

114
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,746
Madam Oh's mother secretly gave birth
and abandoned the child.

115
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,289
That child…

116
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,085
was Kang Pil-jik.

117
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,092
Why would she abandon her child?

118
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,471
At the time, Madam Oh's mother
was mourning her late husband.

119
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,932
If a widow gave birth,

120
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,269
it would not be strange
for them to kill the child.

121
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,149
The two of them were siblings?

122
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,779
Kang Pil-jik suddenly became
a guildmaster and gained power.

123
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,489
At around the same time,

124
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,950
the insignificant Yeom Heung-jip

125
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,827
became the finance minister

126
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,162
and partook in all sorts
of shady business.

127
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,624
There is no way
the finance minister's wife knew nothing.

128
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,171
Thank you.

129
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,924
That is helpful information.

130
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,805
Why did you ask me
not to tell Lady Cho about any of this?

131
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,517
This is far more dangerous than you think.

132
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,477
It is better not to know.

133
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,773
You are worrying about Lady Cho again.

134
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,113
It is the right thing to do
as a Capital Guard superintendent.

135
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,247
Let me now tell you what I want.

136
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,170
Please do not meet with Lady Cho anymore.

137
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,385
What will you do now?

138
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,764
This is all your fault, my husband.

139
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,892
This happened because Yeon-seon
looks after me in your place.

140
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:48,314
If anything happens to Yeon-seon,
consider your memorial meals gone.

141
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,334
We were just on our way to see you,
Royal Advisor Park.

142
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,045
Who, me?

143
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,468
She is one of our household's servants.

144
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,137
Have you met her before?

145
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,982
Yes, I know her.

146
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,787
I heard that you helped her
when she was in a difficult situation

147
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,123
and lost your fan in the process.

148
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,835
We came to return it
and to thank you for your help.

149
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,259
This…

150
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,555
is my fan, I see.

151
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,226
I was wondering where I lost it.

152
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,064
I must have lost it
while I was helping her.

153
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,490
Thank you.

154
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,203
She belongs to our household,
so we will not forget your kindness.

155
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,247
Also, you do not have to worry

156
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,625
about there being gossip
about the nation's royal advisor

157
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:37,756
being involved with a lowly commoner
when he is from such an esteemed family.

158
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,261
I will make sure
that no one hears of what happened.

159
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,097
How can it go against the customs of class

160
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,351
to help out and worry
for a fellow human being?

161
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,190
If the girl were to ever be in danger,

162
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
I would gladly help her again.

163
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:03,240
Regardless, I apologize for making you
personally return my fan.

164
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,825
Forgive me, my lady.

165
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,702
It is all right.

166
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,748
I shall get going now.

167
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,874
Please return safely.

168
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,668
Let us go.

169
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,319
Yeon-seon.

170
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,283
The royal advisor?

171
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,369
I wondered since that time
in the mountains.

172
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,828
How do you know him?

173
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,581
Is that important right now?

174
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,917
What will you do from now on?

175
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,420
We somehow managed
to get out of trouble this time.

176
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,716
If Lady Yoo catches us again,
both of us will be as good as dead.

177
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,635
Do not worry.

178
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,931
I will not let you die,
no matter what happens.

179
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,143
Why are you being so serious?

180
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,523
Then, I will be serious too.

181
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,026
-I will follow you to the grave, my lady.
-Do not say such a thing!

182
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,361
No one is going to die.

183
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,947
I will not die, no matter what.

184
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,157
My lady…

185
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:33,080
So, why did Royal Advisor Park
say the fan was his?

186
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,081
For what?

187
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,837
You should go to the shrine now.

188
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,430
What did you just say?

189
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,474
What about Park Su-ho?

190
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,977
He was brought
to the chief scholar's home,

191
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,938
and they barely managed
to save him from his injuries.

192
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,273
But that happened

193
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,942
15 years ago.

194
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,278
Exactly when was it 15 years ago?

195
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,905
It was on the day

196
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,576
that the former king passed away.

197
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,577
What?

198
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,872
Could he be the child from back then?

199
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,956
That is impossible.

200
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,834
There is no way Im Gang's son is alive.

201
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,009
I found it, sir.

202
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,637
EDICT

203
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
Let us go.

204
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,864
What should we do now?

205
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,243
I am sure
Park Su-ho does not recognize us.

206
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,624
He could not be so calm in front
of the ones who killed his parents.

207
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,501
For now,

208
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,672
we must thoroughly check if it is true.

209
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,273
Please do not meet with Lady Cho anymore.

210
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,194
I will ensure that Lady Cho stays
out of dangerous matters,

211
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:31,031
so I ask you
to consider her a stranger, sir.

212
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,327
How can I do that when I already know her?

213
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,205
You ordered her to stay
within the walls to avoid danger.

214
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,168
Do you truly not know
how painful that is for Lady Cho?

215
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,088
Do you wish for her
to slowly waste away within those walls?

216
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,172
If not,

217
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,886
will you free her from her confinement
so she can live a normal life?

218
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,100
There is nothing you can do
for Lady Cho, sir.

219
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,858
What would you like me to do?

220
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,204
Yeon-seon.

221
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,874
Where has she gone?

222
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
-Yeon-seon?
-What are you

223
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,127
-doing here, my lady?
-Goodness.

224
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,215
I was on my way to the main house
to talk to Mother.

225
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,386
Lady Yoo left early this morning
with Lady Jae-i.

226
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,804
Is that so?

227
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,058
But why did you stay behind
instead of escorting Mother?

228
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,101
And have you seen Yeon-seon?

229
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,107
Lady Yoo told me to take Yeon-seon's place

230
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:52,696
and asked me
to stay right by your side at all times.

231
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,989
What?

232
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,617
What is it?

233
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,327
Is Lady Yoo inside?

234
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,953
She has gone out.

235
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,914
Madam Oh has sent a message.

236
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,332
She did?

237
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,920
She is asking to see you, Lady Cho.
What should I say?

238
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,089
What else can be said?

239
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,841
I must not keep Madam Oh waiting
and go immediately.

240
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,302
-Wait here. I will get ready.
-Wait.

241
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,138
Where are you going
without Lady Yoo's permission?

242
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,640
Did you not just hear?

243
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,183
Madam Oh wants to see me.

244
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,393
Still, you must get permission first--

245
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,522
Madam Oh personally asked to see me,
and if I rejected,

246
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,023
she would be angry.

247
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,443
If Madam Oh gets angry,
the queen dowager will hear of it.

248
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,986
If the queen dowager finds out--

249
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,321
All right.

250
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,659
Let us go.

251
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
I will escort you.

252
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,849
Hello, Mister.

253
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,146
Hey, there…

254
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,441
Wait a moment!

255
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,946
Are you running away from me?

256
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,239
Please do not follow me.

257
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,285
An esteemed royal advisor
should not be acknowledging me.

258
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,870
Stop right there.

259
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,586
Should you not explain to me
what happened yesterday?

260
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,007
PUB

261
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,425
-Alewife.
-Yes, sir?

262
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,302
Give me the most expensive one.

263
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,220
Coming right up.

264
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,316
What are you doing?

265
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,402
Since you are good with numbers,
you must know

266
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,822
this is a very reasonable price
for yesterday's events.

267
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:01,992
Right.

268
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,786
Well…

269
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,332
Thank you for helping me

270
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,753
and I apologize for causing you
a needless misunderstanding.

271
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,050
I am the one
who is needlessly misunderstanding.

272
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,972
Are you in love… with my brother?

273
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,932
Pardon?

274
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,476
What on earth do you mean?

275
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,271
If not, then why did you have his fan?

276
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,525
Was that the superintendent's fan?

277
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,406
I bought the fan for him as a gift.

278
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,077
But did you not even know whose it was?

279
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,621
Well, that is…

280
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,832
In that case,

281
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,378
the person who had my brother's fan…

282
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,631
must not have been you.

283
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,145
It seems like the person you are hiding

284
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,149
is the same person
that my brother is hiding.

285
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,609
Pardon?

286
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,114
I am very curious as to who that is.

287
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,367
Please do not be curious. I beg you.

288
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,203
-Never.
-Is that so?

289
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,044
Did I not say
that I would look for your brother?

290
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,505
Did you find something?

291
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,758
It seems your brother

292
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,636
was involved

293
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,598
in a secret affair inside the palace.

294
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,560
What do you mean by that?

295
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,937
I apologize.

296
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,440
I cannot say anything further.

297
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,859
Please tell me a little more.

298
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,945
I promise not to tell another soul.

299
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,657
I have not found anything
for the past 15 years.

300
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,702
Whatever it is,

301
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,540
if it is a clue
to help me find my brother, I must know.

302
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,215
Long ago,

303
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,844
on the day of the former king's passing,

304
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,764
the capital was

305
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,977
filled with many strange
and scary happenings.

306
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,981
The general of the King's Guard had
his family massacred,

307
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,192
and several of the king's guards vanished.

308
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,109
And I heard

309
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,823
one of them had received
a secret edict from the former king.

310
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,869
Are you saying
that my brother was one of them?

311
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,707
Just what kind of edict was it

312
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,127
that made him disappear for so long
without a word to his family?

313
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,381
Almost no one knows of this,

314
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:08,595
so it will likely be difficult
to find your brother's whereabouts.

315
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,263
Then what should I do?

316
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,682
Who knows about what happened that day?

317
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,226
The queen dowager?

318
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,644
His Majesty?

319
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,020
They may not even know

320
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,273
that any soldiers
of the King's Guard vanished.

321
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,359
Then who would know?

322
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,195
At the time,

323
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,699
the chaos in the nation was ended

324
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,869
by the left councilor, Lord Seok.

325
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,165
Do you mean my father-in-law?

326
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,753
He told me that he would try

327
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,172
to look for my brother.

328
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,926
He cherishes his daughter-in-law
more than anyone,

329
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,055
so I am sure
he will do his best to find him.

330
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:57,394
However, even if Lord Seok knows
everything that happened,

331
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,939
he must fulfill his duties
as the left councilor.

332
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,440
So, he may have

333
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,737
a justifiable reason not to tell you.

334
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,616
Yes, he must do.

335
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,370
I apologize for causing you
unnecessary trouble.

336
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,289
I will return home now.

337
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,503
I am sorry that I only know this much.

338
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,713
There is no need.

339
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,715
You have been of great help.

340
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,383
Thank you, Madam Oh.

341
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:50,113
That should have Lord Seok sitting
on the edge of his seat.

342
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,995
RENTAL BOOKSTORE

343
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,582
Are you telling me
to protect Minister Yeom's wife?

344
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,792
What do you think is
the most effective way

345
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,420
to completely silence someone?

346
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:10,717
The truth of this case cannot be buried
with her futile death.

347
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,594
So, you are saying

348
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,513
that those who wish to harm her

349
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,725
are the same people behind everything

350
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,562
from the assassination of the former king

351
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,857
to the murder of my parents?

352
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,609
That is right.

353
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,944
At the very least,

354
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,656
until we find the guard who vanished
with the former king's royal seal,

355
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,492
we must protect Minister Yeom's wife.

356
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,872
-All right.
-This is an order from His Majesty.

357
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,250
You must not do anything carelessly.

358
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,085
I understand.

359
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,964
It just came in today.

360
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,340
No.

361
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,716
But this is…

362
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,510
Do you feel better now, Mother?

363
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,514
After getting some fresh air
and observing the people,

364
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,224
I feel much better.

365
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,771
While we are here, should we buy
some sticky rice cakes to take home?

366
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,359
Are you thinking about Brother again?

367
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,987
I get angrier the more I think of it.

368
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,155
How dare she bring
another man's belongings

369
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,074
into my brother's shrine?

370
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,493
Why did you not punish her?

371
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,288
I do not wish to speak of it anymore.

372
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,669
It is nearly impossible
to see Superintendent Park.

373
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,171
I wonder where he is and what he is up to.

374
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,259
What if he is working by himself in secret
to take all the credit for himself?

375
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,803
Oh, please. He is doing no such thing.

376
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,597
I believe he is in love.

377
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,142
-In love?
-In love?

378
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,893
Whenever he gets drunk since then,

379
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:48,898
he says, "I am dying to find out
what kind of a person they are."

380
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,818
So, the rumor that he has a lover is true.

381
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,986
Could it be

382
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,529
-Lady I-gyeong?
-Lady I-gyeong?

383
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,866
It is not Lady I-gyeong.

384
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,993
It is someone else.

385
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,167
Superintendent Park…

386
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,379
is not such a bad choice.

387
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,981
How can I shake her off?

388
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,409
This is the best thing I have ever tasted!

389
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,579
See? I told you it was delicious.

390
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,792
Master Kkon-nim.
There is plenty here, so eat up.

391
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,502
Give us five more.

392
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,711
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,837
It is all right.

394
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,048
Just this one is enough for me.

395
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,550
These are not just sticky rice cakes.

396
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,844
It is a bribe to ask you
to take care of me.

397
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,766
Then, can I take five pieces to go?

398
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,978
I have a mother at home,

399
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,190
and she is a bit ill.

400
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,362
Give me ten pieces.

401
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,489
No, give me 20.

402
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,532
Yes, sir.

403
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:26,454
My mother also loved the sticky rice cakes
I bought for her.

404
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,997
Your mother?

405
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,499
She was so lovely

406
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,543
and beautiful.

407
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
Whenever I called for her,

408
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,799
she came to me with a bright smile.

409
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:42,721
Just like that.

410
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,348
My dear…

411
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,477
Mother? Goodness.

412
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,148
Something has come up, so I must go now.

413
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,357
Novice Joo!

414
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,155
Wait… Is that…

415
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,721
I do not think this suits me.

416
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,187
Lady Cho.

417
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,230
We must hurry.

418
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,363
Was… Is that… Squire?

419
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,704
Lady Cho, one moment.

420
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,831
Please wait right here.

421
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,224
Mother, what is the matter?

422
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,485
Are you all right?

423
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,073
Where…

424
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,157
Bongmal!

425
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,494
What are you doing here?

426
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,873
The thing is…

427
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,625
Well…

428
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,922
We came out for a short while,
but Lady Cho has vanished.

429
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,051
My lady?

430
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,846
What is the matter?

431
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,141
My lady…

432
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,984
MYEONGDO INN

433
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
-Are you all right?
-What on earth?

434
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,540
-My hair!
-What is the matter?

435
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,542
-My hair!
-Your hair?

436
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,002
Why are you doing this?

437
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,217
I mean, I apologize…

438
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,148
What on earth?

439
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,400
Is he unwell?

440
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,943
Lady Cho.

441
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,697
Hello, Kkon-nim.

442
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,658
Is Lady Jang inside?

443
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,869
The head guildmaster stepped out.

444
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,662
I see.

445
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,669
There is a strange man here.

446
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,966
He opened up a stall here recently.

447
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,176
His name is Mr. Joo.

448
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,182
So, this is the infamous man
with the unknown identity?

449
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,184
Let me introduce my--

450
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,727
Tell Lady Jang I will be back.

451
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,316
He seems very ill, so be careful.

452
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,400
Yes, my lady.

453
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,281
My lady.

454
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,532
Allow me to introduce myself.

455
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,952
Where are you going?

456
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,121
At least tell me your name!

457
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,208
Novice Joo!
How dare you ask my lady for her name?

458
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,627
Master Kkon-nim.

459
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,920
Who on earth is she?

460
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,546
She is Lord Seok's daughter-in-law.

461
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,256
Lord Seok's…

462
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,055
Is he really unwell?

463
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,810
I did not get to see Lady Jang.

464
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,813
And who was that lunatic?

465
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,723
Why are you out alone during the day?

466
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,230
Do you fight in this outfit too?

467
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,233
I almost did.

468
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,569
Just here, do you…

469
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,406
Why? Does your head hurt?

470
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,700
No, I mean here…

471
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,765
It looked as if your hair got messed up
while you were fighting.

472
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,145
I would grab a sword
rather than hair in a fight.

473
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,232
Why did you bring me here?

474
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,528
How goes the investigation
of Minister Yeom?

475
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,739
Is that why you brought me here?

476
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,076
I told you not to get involved with that.

477
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,745
That was my intention…

478
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,208
but Madam Oh recently told me…

479
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,462
-Never mind.
-What did she tell you?

480
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,469
It seemed like she was
intentionally trying to tell me something.

481
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,181
Never mind.

482
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,642
You said to leave
the investigation to you.

483
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,021
What exactly are you trying to say?

484
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,569
Surely, a mere woman like me
could not have found out anything crucial.

485
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,115
But Madam Oh has asked for me often
lately and tells me many things.

486
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,869
It is likely that something she says
would be of great use to you.

487
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,041
I still stand by what I told you before.

488
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,876
Do not get involved in anything dangerous.

489
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,381
I think it would be best
if you kept your distance from her.

490
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:37,426
Is getting close to Madam Oh
a dangerous thing to do?

491
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,054
Are you saying
she could be the true killer?

492
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,390
Well, that is not what…

493
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,350
That is…

494
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:49,647
If you do not tell me the details,
I cannot tell you anything either.

495
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,190
Please think it over.

496
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,359
What is it?

497
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,154
What on earth am I supposed to do?

498
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,505
I am curious as to
what Lord Seok's daughter-in-law will do.

499
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,674
Why would you do such a thing?

500
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,094
You should look into escaping
to somewhere like Qing.

501
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,222
Why are you trying to create more issues?

502
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,266
If Lord Seok truly gets angry,

503
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,894
do you think either of us will be safe?

504
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,980
What is it? Do you fear death?

505
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,155
To cover something up,
you must hide a hundred other things

506
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,199
in order to barely conceal one secret.

507
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:47,496
However, I have struggled for so long
to hide the hundred other things

508
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,666
that I can no longer even remember…

509
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,047
the one secret I truly had to conceal.

510
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,343
This is not the time to be so calm.

511
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,677
Is that one secret…

512
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,139
the fact…

513
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:11,062
that you are the child
my mother secretly gave birth to?

514
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,980
Or could it be

515
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,774
the fact

516
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,694
that I killed my bastard of a husband?

517
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,529
If it is not even that,

518
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,283
then is it that I killed the former king?

519
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,162
Have you lost your mind?

520
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,622
And to think

521
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,503
I endured all of that suffering
just to hide such measly secrets.

522
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:00,861
My lady?

523
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,074
Do not get up.

524
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,079
I heard that you collapsed in the street.

525
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,331
What is the matter?

526
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,004
It is nothing.

527
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,298
My lady,

528
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,802
please tell me what caused this.

529
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,388
It was

530
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,016
our dear Jeong.

531
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,645
Were you thinking about our son again?

532
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,605
Our Jeong…

533
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,735
I miss him so dearly.

534
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,030
I miss him as well. Of course.

535
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,743
However, drowning in your sorrow will
only harm your health.

536
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,080
Jeong would not want
his mother to be in pain.

537
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:59,378
We should have just allowed him
to marry the girl he was in love with.

538
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:04,842
No, we should not have let him travel
to Qing in the first place.

539
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,097
If I knew I would never see him again,

540
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,726
I would have fed him
his favorite taro soup

541
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,023
that morning before he left home
for the last time.

542
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,527
Physical fatigue seems
to have weakened your heart.

543
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,614
Tomorrow, I will buy you something…

544
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,033
My lord.

545
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:34,246
Could you search for him one last time?

546
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:40,169
I would not be so upset and vexed
if we had at least found his body.

547
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,005
An accidental death in the mountains?

548
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,715
That cannot be true.

549
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,218
Who knows?

550
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,472
He may have survived
and is alive somewhere--

551
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,556
My lady.

552
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,434
You already know
that I checked many times.

553
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,733
I went to Unjong Street today

554
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,570
and saw a man
who looked exactly like our Jeong.

555
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,865
His shoulders, his back,

556
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,576
and even the way he walked were
exactly the same.

557
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,913
Even the slight glimpse
of his face looked like our Jeong.

558
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,498
It cannot be him.

559
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,459
Yes, of course, I know that.

560
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,962
How could I not know that?

561
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,839
It is only because

562
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,050
I wish to see him at least once,
even as a ghost.

563
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,011
I convince myself that I am all right,

564
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,600
but then there are days when I miss him
so much that I cannot breathe.

565
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,504
How dare you dishonor
the reputation of our family,

566
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,965
which was built over hundreds of years?

567
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,341
No matter what you say,

568
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,136
I will marry that girl, Father.

569
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,346
As long as I am alive,

570
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,934
I will never accept a blue-eyed woman
as my eldest daughter-in-law.

571
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,145
She will be my wife,
not your daughter-in-law.

572
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,480
She will live with me,

573
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,398
so do not get involved.

574
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:29,153
If that is what you want,
then leave this house and never return.

575
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,530
I will never return of my own accord,

576
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,866
so do not worry.

577
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,287
Do as you please.

578
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,747
However,

579
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,960
I will not allow this family to fall apart
because of a fool like you.

580
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,339
You are dead to me now.

581
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,635
If you ever return,
I will get rid of you myself.

582
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,763
Father.

583
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,724
I know that you are
more than capable of doing so.

584
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,362
My mother…

585
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,449
My goodness!

586
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,013
How is Mother feeling?

587
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:43,852
What words can comfort a mother
who longs for her child?

588
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,812
My apologies.

589
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,822
I heard you have become close
with Madam Oh recently.

590
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,449
Yes.

591
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,369
She summons me sometimes
to keep her company.

592
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,122
How kind of you to do so.

593
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,374
However…

594
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:11,213
I think it is best if you do not visit
Madam Oh too often.

595
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,801
The people call Madam Oh

596
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,679
the living embodiment
of Instructions for Women.

597
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,515
If the people found out

598
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,603
that such a person fostered
personal relationships as a widow,

599
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,105
nothing good would come of it.

600
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,984
Moreover, I worry
you will be gossiped about

601
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,112
since you did not even go
to guard your husband's grave.

602
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,739
Yes, Father.

603
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,490
I realize I have been careless.

604
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,076
All right.

605
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,994
Go inside now.

606
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,954
Father.

607
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,460
Is there something you wish to say?

608
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,879
I apologize for asking,

609
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,341
but I am curious if there is any news
about my brother.

610
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,384
I am sorry about that.

611
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,764
I left no stone unturned,
but I could not find anything.

612
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,892
Could something have happened
to the king's guards

613
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,435
in the palace that night?

614
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,064
What do you mean by that?

615
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,858
Is there something you heard?

616
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,360
No.

617
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,487
We heard nothing at our residence,

618
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,406
so I wondered if something had happened
at the palace.

619
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,452
Did I not tell you
that I meticulously looked for any trace

620
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,371
of your brother in the palace?

621
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,540
-Yes.
-He finished his shift as usual

622
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,002
and left the palace,
after which no one heard from him.

623
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,423
That is what you told me
the year I married into this family.

624
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,383
However,

625
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,510
after some time passed,

626
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,098
I began to wonder if my brother was just
an ordinary soldier of the king's guard.

627
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,479
A soldier
of the king's guard is nothing more.

628
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,523
Why do you say such an odd thing?

629
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,693
He went to the palace often
when it was not his shift

630
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,238
and was suddenly summoned in the night--

631
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,199
You must not have known much
as you were young at the time.

632
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,411
Your brother was just an ordinary soldier
of the king's guard.

633
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
Do you wish to say anything else?

634
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,336
I apologize.

635
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,131
I seem to have had foolish thoughts.

636
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,843
It is late. Go inside now.

637
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,969
Yes, Father.

638
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:39,361
Why have there suddenly been instances
related to my brother?

639
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,866
One thing is certain.

640
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,912
My brother's disappearance is related
to something very important.

641
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,583
What if this note was sent
by someone dangerous?

642
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,961
They likely do not know
what a dangerous person

643
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,838
Lord Seok's daughter-in-law is.

644
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,219
Are you not going to tell
Superintendent Park?

645
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,513
What on earth

646
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,349
am I supposed to do?

647
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,228
I told him to think it over,

648
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,814
so I will await a reply.

649
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,401
I must go and meet with Lady Jang.

650
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,132
ROYAL SEAL

651
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,720
EDICT

652
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,773
If you had handed over
the edict and royal seal sooner,

653
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,068
your sister would have had a better life.

654
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,195
Rest in peace now.

655
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,907
I will take good care of your sister.

656
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,697
It is not your turn to stand guard today.

657
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,282
I am urgently needed at the palace.

658
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,033
I will be gone for a few days.

659
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,607
Where is Father going at this late hour?

660
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,633
Who is that?

661
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,434
It is such a shame
that I cannot even serve you a cup of tea

662
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:02,397
when we are meeting
at such a lovely pavilion.

663
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,401
I knew you were a bold person,

664
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,572
but that is inappropriate attire
for a woman who lost her husband.

665
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:16,370
I am so bored
by only wearing mourning clothes.

666
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,955
You were different in the past.

667
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,418
I remember that it was my boldness
that you were so fond of.

668
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,130
I kindly told you to leave quietly.

669
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,551
Have you decided to stay
and complicate things?

670
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,552
I only said

671
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:37,224
a few things to your daughter-in-law
out of worry for her brother,

672
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,561
but it seems to have
greatly complicated things for you.

673
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,987
What on earth are they talking about?

674
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,366
Surely, you do not believe
you will remain unscathed.

675
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,079
If I cannot remain unscathed,

676
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,457
then I will simply die.

677
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,213
However, when I think
about the events in the past,

678
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,634
I made a significant contribution
fifteen years ago.

679
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,053
I would feel too wronged to die alone.

680
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,097
Did you forget
your contribution allowed you

681
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,391
to live as the finance minister's wife?

682
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,686
That incident put the nation
in the palm of your hand.

683
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,813
All I got was being
the finance minister's wife.

684
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,110
No matter how I think about it,

685
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,154
it simply

686
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,240
does not add up.

687
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:39,035
They say a mantis will try
to stand in the way of a wagon.

688
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,080
How dare the likes of you stand in my way?

689
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,792
Someone like me could not dare
to stand in your way.

690
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,793
All I am saying is

691
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,839
that I will not let things end

692
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,550
in such vain as this.

693
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,188
What?

694
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,773
Madam Oh?

695
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,194
Your daughter-in-law is very smart.

696
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,244
As long as I can safely stay at my home

697
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,580
-and continue the work I do…
-What?

698
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,750
-…I would have no reason to talk…
-Why is Madam Oh here?

699
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,669
…to your smart daughter-in-law
about her brother anymore.

700
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,384
Do you believe
that will be a threat to me?

701
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,764
You have become so vulgar.

702
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,305
Father!

703
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,515
Hyeon-jae.

704
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,065
Sir!

705
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,818
Let us go.

706
00:53:58,902 --> 00:53:59,903
Sir?

707
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,821
Please wake up, sir.

708
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,989
Sir?

709
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,783
Sir!

710
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,952
Please wake up.

711
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:07,953
Sir!

712
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,439
How are you feeling?

713
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,440
Are you all right?

714
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,526
What happened?

715
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,654
You fainted.

716
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,996
I nearly died carrying you here.

717
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,583
I told you that you would be indebted
to me one day.

718
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,754
How could you be so confident
when you could not even handle them?

719
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,632
Thank you

720
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,342
for saving me.

721
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,098
You saved me once too.

722
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,350
Anyway,

723
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,769
do you know where they came from?

724
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:28,658
Seeing how they checked my scar,
I am sure they know who I am.

725
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,875
Since I am holding
your secret against you,

726
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,793
I will tell you

727
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,920
a secret of mine to repay your help.

728
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,715
No, thank you.

729
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,343
My secret is a burden enough.

730
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,054
Why would I bear another's secret?

731
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,432
Is that so?

732
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,813
If you insist,

733
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:03,485
pretend that I am a wall
and talk to yourself if you wish.

734
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,242
Sitting alone all day in the shrine,

735
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,995
I also share
my inner thoughts with the wall.

736
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,705
It is quite relieving.

737
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:24,798
I am someone

738
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,593
who should not be alive.

739
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,306
My warm mother,

740
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,266
father,

741
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,060
and nursemaid…

742
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,898
My loving family were

743
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,026
slaughtered before my eyes.

744
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,739
Thus, 15 years ago,

745
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,951
one day without any forewarning…

746
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,663
I managed to survive alone

747
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,416
in that bloodbath.

748
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,546
Not only did I survive,

749
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,423
but I cannot clearly remember…

750
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,136
that awful day.

751
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,889
I am the perfect example

752
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,935
of someone whose crime is being alive.

753
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,729
Just being alive condemns me as a sinner.

754
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,648
So, this is my way

755
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,234
of not giving up and surviving.

756
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,112
-What I meant by that was--
-So…

757
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,574
do not worry too much.

758
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,619
My conscience is not clear enough

759
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,331
to use your secret as a weakness.

760
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,960
I shall go now.

761
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,014
Thank you

762
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,558
for today.

763
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,944
I am the perfect example

764
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,199
of someone whose crime is being alive.

765
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,708
I should not have listened.

766
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,527
CAPITAL GUARD

767
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,036
Captain Hwang.

768
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,539
You are here early.

769
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,332
Yes.

770
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:08,002
Where is
our dear Superintendent Park Su-ho?

771
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,380
Well, I think…

772
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,925
He must have caught a cold.

773
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,093
He is feeling unwell.

774
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,344
What?

775
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,471
Our dear superintendent is sick?

776
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,306
Where is he now?

777
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,065
Are you feeling very unwell?

778
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,066
Captain Hwang.

779
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,652
You are ill, so do not get up.

780
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,864
Were you having such a hard time
that you fell ill?

781
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,242
I am fine.

782
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,660
You are not fine.

783
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,203
You look so thin and haggard.

784
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,915
This is usually how it goes

785
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,834
with lovesickness.

786
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,627
It must have been difficult.

787
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,796
Of course, I know it is difficult.

788
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,092
I will wait for the right time
and speak with her,

789
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,137
so do not worry
and focus on getting better.

790
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,473
What… are you talking about?

791
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,893
There is no need
to feel shy about it with me.

792
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,815
We will take care of the project
to dig the waterway for Cheonggyecheon,

793
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,026
so get some rest today.

794
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,527
Me, sir?

795
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,528
Yes, you.

796
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,823
Captain Hwang.

797
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,325
-Rest up.
-Captain?

798
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,669
If you wish to hear about your brother,

799
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:36,674
give this book to the person
who visits you in five days.

800
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,644
There are so many pretty items.

801
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,605
How about this fine-toothed comb?

802
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,525
Did you enjoy the book you received?

803
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,364
Yes, I did.

804
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,615
Wait here.

805
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,909
-I will get the book.
-One moment.

806
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,410
If you come to this place,

807
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,122
the one who you must give
the book to will be waiting there.

808
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,983
I apologize for asking to meet like this.

809
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,069
Please forgive me.

810
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:44,283
Your brother was a soldier
of the king's guard 15 years ago,

811
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,327
and you are
Lord Seok's eldest daughter-in-law,

812
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,579
Cho Yeo-hwa, correct?

813
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,750
Can you promise

814
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,004
that you will not speak
of this meeting to anyone?

815
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:07,265
My lady, this is about the life
of your brother, Cho Seong-hu.

816
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,933
It is very important.

817
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,354
Can you make that promise?

818
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,030
If you cannot promise me,

819
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,200
then I cannot tell you anything more.

820
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,967
Who are you?

821
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,597
Do not turn around.

822
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,475
Why are you looking for Cho Seong-hu?

823
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,144
I have come

824
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,689
to speak with Cho Seong-hu's sister.

825
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,524
What do you wish to ask her?

826
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,528
May I speak while this man is present?

827
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:07,909
I am looking

828
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,245
for something Cho Seong-hu left behind.

829
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,331
What is it?

830
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,167
I cannot tell you that.

831
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,460
I came to ask

832
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:22,006
if he had left anything to his family
or contacted them at all.

833
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:22,965
Do you know

834
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,177
why Cho Seong-hu disappeared?

835
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,179
Do you know

836
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,807
that reason?

837
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,391
Answer my question.

838
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,309
Now!

839
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,313
Step away.

840
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:51,953
