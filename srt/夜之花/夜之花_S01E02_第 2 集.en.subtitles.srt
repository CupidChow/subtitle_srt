1
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,128
My lady, Kkon-nim was taken away
by debt collectors!

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,261
Are you really going to go back there?

3
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,638
That is too risky. Let me go and get her.

4
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,226
What would happen if you were
to be seen at Kang Pil-jik's inn?

5
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,605
It could affect the relationship
between the two guilds.

6
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
I will go and bring her back.

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,860
If you really must,
then please take Hwal-yu with you.

8
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,780
And I did not think
this would be put to use so soon, butâ€¦

9
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,611
I apologize for the lack
of a proper change of garments.

10
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,696
We only have
colorful garments at our guild.

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,908
She can only wear plain white anyway.

12
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,243
Do not worry about it.

13
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,163
I will make sure to be prepared
when you visit again.

14
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,460
The Pil Inn?

15
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,632
I feel worried
about sending Lady Cho there by herself.

16
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,760
Come now, Guildmaster.

17
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,014
None of Kang Pil-jik's men
would stand a chance against Lady Cho.

18
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,558
You have nothing to worry about.

19
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,229
But it is such a crowded place.
What if her identity becomes exposed?

20
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,981
That was pretty good.

21
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,066
You should be able
to protect yourself now.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,279
I still have a long way to go
if I am to match your skills, Brother.

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,036
What would you even do
with skills like mine?

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,413
I want to be like you.

25
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,206
I want to protect the people.

26
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,551
How could you use
a real sword for training?

27
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,802
That is cheating.

28
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,889
Is that what you will tell your foe?

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,436
But I do not even have my own sword.

30
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,815
I will have a sword cane made
just for you one day.

31
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,192
SWORD CANE: A SELF-DEFENSIVE SWORD
THAT RESEMBLES A SWEET FLAG LEAF

32
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,531
How could a pretty girl like you
have such a talent?

33
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,784
It is quite a shame
I cannot let the world know about it.

34
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,332
But I am sure
there will be a use for your skills.

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,085
Once you find it,
do not hesitate to use it.

36
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,176
It is not your turn to stand guard today.

37
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,511
I am urgently needed at the palace.

38
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,222
I will be gone for a few days.

39
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,140
Do not worry about me.

40
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,934
Please come back safe.

41
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,144
Look after the house for me

42
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,687
and do not skip any meals.

43
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,397
I will not.

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,944
She has no one to call her family
after losing her brother at a young age.

45
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,570
There would be big trouble

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,031
if the left councilor ever found out.

47
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:04,953
How did Lady Cho end up
marrying into the left councilor's family?

48
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,123
Uncle, how can I get married
without my brother here?

49
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,126
I never heard anything
about an arranged marriage.

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,544
He is the left councilor's son.

51
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,422
You were orphaned at a young age.

52
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,049
This is more than you deserve.

53
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,885
And your brother has not been home
for months--

54
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,928
Uncle!

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,111
You know how unpredictable life can be.

56
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,783
As if marrying into
their family was not enough,

57
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,786
who knew she would become
a virgin widow on her wedding day?

58
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,288
VIRGIN WIDOW: A WOMAN WIDOWED
BEFORE HER WEDDING NIGHT

59
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,415
There is no way
that Lady Cho could have known.

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,671
The groom was attacked

61
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,298
-on his way to the wedding.
-What?

62
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,259
What kind of a fate was she born with
to lose her husband like this?

63
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,470
Still, she looks after others
more than she does herself.

64
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,431
Who am I to stop her will?

65
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,349
No one knows
if her brother is alive or not.

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,828
Lead the way.

67
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,928
Girls who are sold to repay gambling debts

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,805
are made to work as servants at an inn

69
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,640
until they're sold
as a nobleman's concubine

70
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,851
or handed over to brothels.

71
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,483
You cannot do this, sir!

72
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,901
Come with me.

73
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,237
What is going on?

74
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,864
Has she already been sold to him?

75
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,913
Let go of her hand.

76
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,457
I will buy the girl from you.

77
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,591
I do not know how much you paid for her,

78
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,468
but sell her on to me.

79
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,183
Who are you?

80
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,311
I will pay you double the amount you paid.

81
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,147
Reveal your identity first.

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,233
That is none of your concern, sir.

83
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,901
Finding out such things is my job.

84
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,611
And that is none of my concern.

85
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,993
I am a Capital Guard superintendent.

86
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,663
Who are you,
and why do you want this girl?

87
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,875
I was unaware
that such a great man as yourself

88
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,503
would abuse his power
over something so trivial.

89
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,880
Regardless, I will be taking this girl.

90
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,215
Wait a minute.

91
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,802
Have we not met before?

92
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,307
Where would we have everâ€¦

93
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,731
Unhand me.

94
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,786
Let me take a look.

95
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,414
What on earth are you doing?

96
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,665
I have to check something.

97
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,833
No, you cannot!

98
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,546
Which one is it?
"You can," or "You cannot"?

99
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,218
Look at this man and woman
acting so affectionate.

100
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,345
You are making the rest of us jealous.

101
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,559
There are plenty of rooms here.

102
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,563
She is here for a gambling debt,

103
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,399
so pay up if you want to take her.

104
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,487
100 yang. Will that be enough?

105
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,655
Oneâ€¦ 100 yang?

106
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,741
150 yang.

107
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,367
My goodness.

108
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,079
I will buy her for 200 yang.

109
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,081
250 yang.

110
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,625
300 yang.

111
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,877
350 yang.

112
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,505
What a generous man you are, sir.

113
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,676
500 yang in silver.

114
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,765
Let us go.

115
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,087
Would you stop following us?

116
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,966
Let us go.

117
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,221
Hey, go easy on the drinks!

118
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,847
What on earth are youâ€¦

119
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
-Are you okay, sir?
-Sir.

120
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,477
You must have had too much to drink

121
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,812
-Up you get.
-What?

122
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,313
Goodness me.

123
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,566
What are you saying? I am not drunk!

124
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,485
Who is causing such a commotion at my inn?

125
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,028
Are you the owner of this inn?

126
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,990
I am Capital Guard
Superintendent Park Su-ho.

127
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,992
Park Su-ho?

128
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,871
Are you not the superintendent

129
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,873
who caused a commotion at my inn?

130
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,043
I apologize for that incident.

131
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,964
After I heard about the mess you made
just to catch a swindler,

132
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,717
I was curious about who you were.

133
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,888
Who knew we would meet like this?

134
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,559
As many gambling dens are run illegally,

135
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,311
I had no choice but to investigate.

136
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,572
It must be your first time in Hanyang,
so I will let you off easy this once.

137
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,700
But if you disturb my inn again,

138
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
I may not let you go

139
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:24,123
as easily as today, Superintendent.

140
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,958
That is a national superintendent.

141
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,085
How dare you act this way?

142
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,630
Brother?

143
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,300
He is my younger brother.

144
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,640
I did not mean to call you here
to cause you this trouble.

145
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,851
Goodness.

146
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,103
Were you the younger brother
of Royal Advisor Park?

147
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,693
I do not know what sort of trouble
he caused at your inn,

148
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
but tell me what it was.

149
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,072
I will reimburse you.

150
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,367
That is not necessary.

151
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,869
This ignorant merchant had been careless.

152
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,162
Please forgive me, sir.

153
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,791
Let us go, Su-ho.

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,209
Yes, Brother.

155
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,349
She has a high fever,
so observe her for about four hours.

156
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,558
Yes, my lady.

157
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,646
Take good care of her.

158
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,363
Is Kkon-nim doing okay?

159
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,115
She had a shock-induced fever,

160
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,450
so I gave her some medicine
and let her rest.

161
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,998
Her father could sell her
as gambling collateral again,

162
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,043
so I might put her to work
at Myeongdo Inn from tomorrow.

163
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,129
What do you think, my lady?

164
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,672
That is a great idea.

165
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,716
It would be better to keep her close by.

166
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,511
Kkon-nim is a smart girl.

167
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,887
She will excel at any task.

168
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,435
You will not be owed anything this month

169
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
after I deduct
the amount you spent tonight.

170
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,397
Is that okay, my lady?

171
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,941
But the business is thriving.

172
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,484
You have already spent it all?

173
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,530
Says the one who spent
500 yang in one night.

174
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,789
Anyway,

175
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,002
Hwal-yu said there was
a man following you, my lady.

176
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,962
Was he someone you knew?

177
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,214
Goodness, of course not.

178
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,134
I am not acquainted
with any man in Joseon.

179
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,012
He was a complete stranger.

180
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,474
I only asked

181
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,851
because I was worried

182
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,020
that your identity may have been exposed.

183
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,441
Never have I once been caught
over all these years.

184
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,067
And I plan to keep it that way.

185
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,821
Are the clothes to your liking?

186
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,242
It was absolutely beautiful.

187
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,953
But they do not suit me.

188
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,664
Neither the clothesâ€¦

189
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,333
nor the shoes.

190
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,960
And on my way here,

191
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,505
I even lost one of the pair.

192
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,134
I appreciate your thoughtfulness,
Lady Jang.

193
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,304
But I should not dress up
like I have today

194
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,431
ever again.

195
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,445
That man, Kang Pil-jik,
is no ordinary merchant.

196
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,156
He is not afraid to get his hands dirty.

197
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,408
You must keep your distance from him.

198
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,993
Brother.

199
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,499
Thank you.

200
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,628
I did not do it for your gratitude.

201
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,674
It is already late.

202
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,467
Hurry back to the Capital Guard.

203
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,929
-What is this?
-It is evidence.

204
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,848
Leave it there.

205
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,182
Evidence, sir?

206
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,934
Is it an evidence of love?

207
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,937
Goodness me.

208
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,938
Bi-chan.

209
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,316
Yes, sir?

210
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,233
How much money do you have?

211
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,985
Why do you ask?

212
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,697
My mother always told me not to get
financially involved with anyone,

213
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,158
regardless of how close I was to them.

214
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,496
There is a woman who can spend
500 yang in a day like it was nothing.

215
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,250
Can you please introduce me to her?

216
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,298
So,

217
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,758
who is this woman?

218
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,968
She is a woman

219
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,095
who has no name or face.

220
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,932
Does this shoe belong to her?

221
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,683
My, you do catch on quickly.

222
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,101
Then I will find her--

223
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,145
Leave it right there.

224
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,110
I had a bad feeling from the start.

225
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,124
He was persistent.

226
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,716
He was also quite skilled.

227
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,802
Who are you,
and why do you want this girl?

228
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,179
He even had
an annoyingly strong sense of duty.

229
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,435
What on earth are you doing?

230
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,354
I must confirm something.

231
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,731
No, you cannot!

232
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,533
It could be dangerous
if we get involved any further.

233
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,350
My lady.

234
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,413
Hello, sir.

235
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,915
No need for a greeting.

236
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,334
Take a look at this first.

237
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,927
And that is the sum
which will be deducted from your pay.

238
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
You will not receive anything this month.

239
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,681
That will likely be the case
for a few months.

240
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,351
On the first day at your new post,

241
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,312
you caused a commotion at Pil Inn

242
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,439
and even lost Lord Yeom's golden toad.

243
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,026
Just what did you break
for the compensation to cost 150 yang?

244
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,032
Who knew we would meet like this?

245
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,871
Do you know Kang Pil-jik well?

246
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,956
And what if I do?

247
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,793
Will you go and ask him to lower the cost?

248
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,836
Do not even bother.

249
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,047
You have no idea
how obsessed he is with money.

250
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,633
I am sure I have seen him before,

251
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,176
but I cannot remember where.

252
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,427
I am sure that you have.

253
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,222
He is involved in all sorts
of shady business.

254
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,349
I bet you have seen him before.

255
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,267
But how is itâ€¦

256
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,811
that you are leaving him be?

257
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,437
What?

258
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,566
He seems close
with high-ranking public officials.

259
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,442
And when I said I was a superintendent,

260
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,153
he was not at all phased.

261
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
The incident occurred
during an investigation.

262
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,367
Seeing how he demanded
compensation from you directly,

263
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,704
it seems he has quite the connections.

264
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:28,000
Now, there is no need
to say it quite like that.

265
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,295
Of course, we want to arrest him.

266
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,257
The Capital Guard has not yet had
a good enough reason to step in.

267
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,759
Also, you said yourself
that criminal investigations

268
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,845
are done by the police bureau.

269
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,724
In that case, I will keep
a close eye on him from now on.

270
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,115
Are you the new superintendent, sir?

271
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,950
And, who might you be?

272
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,578
My name is Hwang I-gyeong.

273
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,288
I am 17 years old.

274
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,498
I have five older brothers.

275
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,711
My father is the captain
of the Capital Guard.

276
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,507
She is my youngest daughter.

277
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,886
When did you get here, sweetie?

278
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,847
Please come in.

279
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,019
My name is Hwang I-gyeong.

280
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,397
Yes, I heard you earlier.

281
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,320
Why are youâ€¦

282
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,826
She is at it again.

283
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,664
Yes, all right.

284
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,875
This is Superintendent Park Su-ho.

285
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,670
All right, let us go.

286
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,839
Even your name is perfect.

287
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,882
This must be destiny.

288
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,800
It has to be.

289
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,720
You met your destiny last month, too.

290
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,639
Now that you know his name,

291
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,723
let us go.

292
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,558
Squire, I will see you tomo--

293
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,229
Did you finish all of the work I gave you?

294
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,563
Pardon?

295
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,024
You know, the task I told you to do.

296
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,027
-Oh, do you meanâ€¦
-Right.

297
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,529
I will go to Lord Yeom's house.

298
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,030
Yes, there you go.

299
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
Go on ahead.

300
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,534
Run like the wind. Go!

301
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,787
Father, enjoy your meal.

302
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,498
Squire, let us meet often from now on.

303
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,876
CHANHAP: JOSEON ERA LUNCH BOX

304
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,045
Both of our futures

305
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,589
are looking so bleak.

306
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,408
Lady Cho!

307
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,119
Kkon-nim.

308
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,123
Are you unwell?

309
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,042
Not at all. I feel great.

310
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,835
I am relieved.

311
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,255
I started working at Myeongdo Inn today.

312
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,716
Is that so?

313
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,134
That is great news.

314
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
Someone saved me yesterday

315
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,096
and left me at Myeongdo Inn.

316
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,265
She was like an angel from above.

317
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,518
-Just like you, Lady Cho.
-Is that so?

318
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,729
Kkon-nim.

319
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,482
You must be even stronger from now on.

320
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,524
Do you understand?

321
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,609
Yes, Lady Cho.

322
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,321
Lady Cho.

323
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,907
You dropped this.

324
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,411
Unhand me.

325
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,170
I washed it clean
and even beat out the creases.

326
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,256
Lady Cho.

327
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:04,966
Thank you.

328
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,220
Thank you for everything.

329
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,275
Scholars at a few Confucian schools
in the countryside are struggling

330
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,487
because their books are old and worn.

331
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,495
Thus, I think it would be good
if you sent them new books.

332
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,955
I approve.

333
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,420
These are the recommendations
for the governor of Pyeongan Province.

334
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,094
I believe the best candidate
for the position

335
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,430
is the eldest son
of the former chief inspector, Son Min--

336
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,765
I approve.

337
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,356
This is a report from the deputy commander
of Hamgyeong Province.

338
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,864
As the stone monuments
in the north are heavily damaged,

339
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,448
the people must urgently be sent--

340
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,366
Wait.

341
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,745
Is this such an urgent matter
when there is a severe drought?

342
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,878
I urgently approve.

343
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,923
Your Majesty.

344
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,301
The monuments honor the hundreds of men

345
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,596
who gave their lives
to protect the border.

346
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,599
How could such a report
not be considered urgent?

347
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,936
I should have been more thoughtful.

348
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,819
Your Majesty.

349
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,534
Even if you occasionally
miss council meetings,

350
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,704
would you consider attending
the royal lectures, at least?

351
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:01,208
You do not attend royal lectures
and often miss council meetings.

352
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,919
I must say
that I am concerned, Your Majesty.

353
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,924
Why would I further my study
of the Confucian classics?

354
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,720
You are always by my side, Left Councilor.

355
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,097
You always steer me
in the right direction.

356
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,560
Your Majesty, I am overwhelmed
by your gracious words.

357
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:25,732
As your inferior subject, I am merely
doing my best to serve Your Majesty.

358
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,027
I am always grateful, Left Councilor.

359
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,990
-Goodness.
-What happened?

360
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,492
-Oh dear.
-Please!

361
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,618
-Gosh.
-You are killing him!

362
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,577
That wretched fool.

363
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,039
Beat him as hard as you can until he dies!

364
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,415
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

365
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,585
What should we do?

366
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,795
My lord.

367
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,839
Must you insist on killing the man?

368
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,509
How dare you!

369
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,969
How dare a woman speak out of place?

370
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,721
That vermin is just a waste of food.

371
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,890
Whether I beat or stomp him to death,

372
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,059
he is my property, and I can do as I wish.

373
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,520
What are you doing?

374
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,105
Keep on beating him!

375
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,481
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

376
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,193
You are killing him.

377
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,287
He may really die.

378
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,413
You have come.

379
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,630
Is thisâ€¦

380
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,433
I knew you would find it for me.

381
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,647
Is this the golden toad
that you were looking for?

382
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,648
What?

383
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,066
Yes, it certainly is.

384
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,401
My precious golden toad.

385
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,528
It is my big and precious golden toad.

386
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,738
The apple of my eye.

387
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,200
I must ask
what all the commotion is about.

388
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,618
That?

389
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,163
Since you brought it up,

390
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,622
let me say this.

391
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,584
There have been so many
infuriating events lately.

392
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,253
That good-for-nothing servant

393
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,174
spattered water on one
of my precious paintings.

394
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,925
Do you see it?

395
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,140
Can you feel
the magical energy emanating from it?

396
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,601
Thanks to this tiger's energy,

397
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,312
I have risen to the position I have now.

398
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,984
Where is the area that was damaged?

399
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,819
What? Oh.

400
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,279
Right here.

401
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,947
The tip of its tail.

402
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,990
Can you not see it?

403
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,250
Goodness, you should not work so much.

404
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,546
You are too young
to have such blurry vision.

405
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,632
Regardless.

406
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,885
I've done away with a useless servant
who only wasted my food.

407
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,012
All the better for me.

408
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,472
Do you not agree?

409
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,984
They dumped the old man outside

410
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,070
when he was on the verge of death.

411
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,323
Let us go.

412
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,373
My goodness, ladies!

413
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,374
Have you heard?

414
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,169
What are you making
such a big fuss about now?

415
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,796
It is about Mr. Kwak,

416
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,881
Minister Yeom's servant.

417
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,426
Gosh, they beat him
after rolling him up in a straw mat.

418
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,636
They say he might die.

419
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,930
But he was just an old man.

420
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,016
What could he have done
to deserve such a cruel punishment?

421
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,893
Is it not obvious?

422
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,189
They say Mr. Kwak spattered
a single drop of water

423
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,108
on the minister's favorite painting.

424
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,361
They beat him like a dog

425
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,864
and threw him out onto the street.

426
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,117
My goodness.

427
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,995
We might have to tend to his dead body.

428
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:07,954
You may be right.

429
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,039
His son died early,

430
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,375
and all he has is his young grandson.

431
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,003
What an unexpected tragedy.

432
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,423
How can a painting
be more precious than a person's life?

433
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,427
Who is there?

434
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,682
What is all of this?

435
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,810
Someone told me to give this to you.

436
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,648
How can I ever repay their goodwill?

437
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,028
Did they also send the physician?

438
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,530
Have you been seen by a physician?

439
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,948
Yes, he came by earlier

440
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,868
and brought me some medicine.

441
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,912
Who did such a kind thing?

442
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,580
I feel so wronged.

443
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,625
I did not even go anywhere
near that tiger painting.

444
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,711
Why must I be treated lesser
than a painting

445
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,963
and be thrown out like this?

446
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,840
I am so angryâ€¦

447
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,552
that I want to tear
that painting to shreds.

448
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,805
How can I provide

449
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:11,142
for this young child with this frail body?

450
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,686
Grandfather, what is that?

451
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,323
Does the law not state that even slaves

452
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,284
cannot be beaten to death
without any evidence?

453
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,995
He has served that family his whole life.

454
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,665
Those people are above the law.

455
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,334
But that is none of our concern.

456
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,296
And yet you still sent a physician?

457
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,882
Well, we must uphold the law,

458
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,717
which I did with the act of guhyul.

459
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,053
GUHYUL: A RELIEF EFFORT BY DONATING GRAINS
TO THE POOR OR VICTIMS OF DISASTERS

460
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,221
I almost forgot.

461
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,348
Do you remember the girl
who sold you a dried persimmon?

462
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,477
That girl who sold dried persimmons
is at Myeongdo Inn now.

463
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,728
Myeongdo Inn?

464
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,856
It is a long story.

465
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,233
I looked into the story
of the legendary altruist.

466
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,278
Recently, a man at the inn
lost the deed to his house.

467
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,071
So I found the man, and according to him,

468
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,073
a masked man at the gambling den said,

469
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,241
"If I ever see you here again,

470
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,868
I will not only take
the deed to your house

471
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,870
but your life as well."

472
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,457
How is that related
to the girl who sold dried persimmons?

473
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,668
Keep listening, and you will find out.

474
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,130
The man who lost his house deed was
the dried persimmon girl's father.

475
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,385
So, it was an attempt to save the girl?

476
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,846
It turns out the man was
so obsessed with gambling

477
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,973
that he even sold off his own daughter.

478
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,099
At that moment,

479
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,895
I realized this was a tale
of the legendary altruist--

480
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,730
What did you conclude?

481
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,356
Sum it up in three words.

482
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,319
Legendary, altruistâ€¦

483
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,905
and brilliant.

484
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,060
Please do not run away.

485
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,062
I only want to ask you something.

486
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,566
Do you work here?

487
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,947
The woman who took you that day,

488
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,782
do you know her?

489
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,035
I do not know anything.

490
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,411
I swear!

491
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,878
All right. I understand.

492
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,798
Do not say anything you do not want to.

493
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,470
Keep your secret safe.

494
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,073
What brought you here

495
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,659
all the way from the Capital Guard?

496
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,872
How did that girl

497
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,166
end up in this place?

498
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,087
We are paying her a wage
to work at our guild.

499
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,465
Who brought her here?

500
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,430
I see you are not curious about the girl

501
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,225
but about who brought the girl here.

502
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,979
Head Guildmaster.

503
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,356
Do you know that person?

504
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,825
In some ways, I do.

505
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,870
And in other ways, I do not.

506
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,915
I have done business
with them a few times,

507
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,961
but I do not know
their name or their face.

508
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,005
They could not take the girl in,

509
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,382
so they asked me to care for her.

510
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,553
She was bought

511
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,598
for quite a hefty sum at Pil Inn.

512
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,559
But they simply left her with you?

513
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,062
These are the words they said.

514
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,483
"People will call her unlucky
for being born to a terrible father."

515
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,986
But when a girl
of just ten years of age is sold

516
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,572
to pay off her father's gambling debt,

517
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,449
the world turns a blind eye to it

518
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,993
when the law should be keeping her safe.

519
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,829
What a deplorable reality it is.

520
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,040
And with that,

521
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,753
even a lowly merchant
like myself was moved.

522
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,297
So, I took the girl in
without any questions.

523
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,970
If I get the chance,

524
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,558
I would like to see them in person.

525
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,854
Even I do not know

526
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,316
when will I see them again.

527
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,636
He nearly beat the old man to death
over a mere painting?

528
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,399
21 REASONS TO LOVE BEING ALONE

529
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,777
This book looks interesting.

530
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,239
I shall buy this one.

531
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,699
Yes, sir.

532
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,450
That is a great choice.

533
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,707
I will only go out for a short while.

534
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,000
Not today, my lady.

535
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,294
It is no different than any other day.

536
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,006
I had an ominous dream,
and I am sure it was a sign.

537
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,425
Do not believe in such nonsense.

538
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,010
I will be fine, so hand it over.

539
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,845
I am worried.

540
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,139
What if something bad happens today?

541
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,476
All right, fine.

542
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,062
I will not fall for it this time.

543
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,817
That was quite impressive.

544
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,239
You cannot go no matter what.

545
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,326
Nothing in this world is absolute.

546
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,285
No, Lady Cho!

547
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,704
You cannot.

548
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,414
I will never let you go.

549
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,999
You are making me use force today.

550
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,669
You cannot, my lady.

551
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,088
Please, my lady!

552
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,466
All right, you win.

553
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,551
There is no winning against you.

554
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,180
You cannot go today, my lady.

555
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,808
You are getting stronger by the day.

556
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,910
Are you going somewhere, sir?

557
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,871
I thought I would go on patrol.

558
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,082
There are hundreds of patrol officers.

559
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,167
Why would you personally go?

560
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,339
You are right.

561
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,093
Are you okay, sir?

562
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,594
I am fine.

563
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,805
Anyway,

564
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,474
how is the old man
I sent the physician to doing?

565
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,184
Fine, sir.

566
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,854
I heard a sack of rice
was left in his yard.

567
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,064
Do you know what I think?

568
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,693
I think the legendary altruist
paid him a visit.

569
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
The legendary altruist?

570
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,907
You know, the one
who flies over the rooftops,

571
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,243
leaving grains for the poor
while wearing a mask.

572
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,996
If I had waited at that house,
I would have seen him.

573
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,873
Why would one jump across rooftops

574
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,875
when we have perfectly good roads?

575
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,085
So?

576
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,504
Where do they usually appear?

577
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,422
Well,

578
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,132
how would I know that?

579
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,552
Then, when do they usually appear?

580
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:09,972
At night, I suppose?

581
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,440
Where are you going, sir?

582
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,568
Sir?

583
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,113
Your Majesty.

584
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,158
The royal advisor is here.

585
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,661
Come in, Royal Advisor.

586
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,085
Have a seat.

587
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,211
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,801
I have brought you a new book today.

589
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,481
There were no traces in Jeolla Province.

590
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,609
I did not expect much,

591
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,487
but they found nothing, yet again.

592
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,324
Please try to remain patient.

593
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,535
You should wait until next month.

594
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,294
What is this?

595
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,966
It is quite an entertaining short story
that I enjoyed reading.

596
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,302
I brought it as I thought
Your Majesty would also enjoy it.

597
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,514
It is not exactly a pleasing title, is it?

598
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:38,102
It seems you are more popular
than I am these days.

599
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,062
Rather than Your Majesty,

600
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,858
who has a queen
and concubines by your side,

601
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,152
-a single man like me would--
-Oh, come on!

602
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,783
It is time you started
your own family too.

603
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,202
It has already been ten years
since you lost your wife.

604
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,791
When I can leave your side
without any worries,

605
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,335
I will consider doing so.

606
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,754
I have a feelingâ€¦

607
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,798
that you will die alone.

608
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,550
Oh, please, Sire.

609
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,310
Who dared to touch the property
of the nation's finance minister?

610
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,688
Who was it? Tell me!

611
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,443
There you are.

612
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,699
Come on in.

613
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,912
You are the only one I can trust,

614
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,539
so I asked Captain Hwang
for a special favor.

615
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,416
Look!

616
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,626
This paintingâ€¦

617
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,086
You saw it before.

618
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,838
My White Tiger in the Mountain!

619
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,215
Some lunatic has made

620
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:54,053
an absolute mockery
of my precious and expensive painting.

621
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,180
Is there anyone that you suspect?

622
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,182
Who in this land of Joseon

623
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,434
would dare to mess
with the great Yeom Heung-jip?

624
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,436
Wait.

625
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,396
One of my servants said he saw

626
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,607
a man in black
jump over the wall last night.

627
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,567
Did he happen to say

628
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,694
the man was in a black mask?

629
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,612
Right!

630
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,198
Yes, he was in a black mask.

631
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,368
I shall do more than tear him to pieces!

632
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,329
Just wait until I catch that punk.

633
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,290
-Did that lady do this too?
-I will make him pay!

634
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,593
What a magnificent tiger.

635
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,804
Why do you have this?

636
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,182
It is the price of a beating.

637
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,107
Could you beginâ€¦

638
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,278
by explaining what happened?

639
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,781
So, what happened wasâ€¦

640
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,870
The old man said that he wanted
to tear the painting to shreds.

641
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,998
And it just made me furious, right?

642
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,669
Since that lord
cherished the painting so much,

643
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,838
I grew curious
and wanted to see it for myself.

644
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,132
I wondered just how great it was

645
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,467
to make him beat
the old man near to death.

646
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,386
His beating was
the price for that painting,

647
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,305
so Yeom Heung-jip had
no reason to keep it.

648
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,098
You should do
the math yourself, Yeon-seon.

649
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
Does it not just all add up?

650
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,580
I was even so kind

651
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,959
as to fill the empty space
with a brand-new painting.

652
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,380
That is how this ended up here.

653
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,933
Lady Cho!

654
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,980
Come and take a look!

655
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,232
Goodness, Guildmaster.

656
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,901
Good to see you, sir.

657
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,736
Is business going well?

658
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,738
I was just able to make ends meet

659
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,740
thanks to you letting me sell here.

660
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,367
I will never forget your goodwill.

661
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,703
That is a walnut from Cheonan.

662
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,289
It is incredibly delicious.

663
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,957
What did you say?

664
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,169
A Cheonan walnut!

665
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,087
A CHEONAN WALNUT

666
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,422
A CHEAP WALNUT

667
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,510
Who are you calling "cheap"?

668
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,595
How dare you say that when I am around?

669
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,223
You imbecile.

670
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,308
Cheap?

671
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,560
-Goodness.
-Did you just call me cheap?

672
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,813
-I will show you cheap!
-What are you doing, Guildmaster Kang?

673
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,071
It is all right.

674
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,245
Well, look who it is.

675
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,666
I think you should carry on as you were.

676
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,044
I wanted to try some walnuts from Cheonan.

677
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,923
It seems you have not acquired a taste
for such cheap things, Guildmaster.

678
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,302
I should have killed you then.

679
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,640
I should have made it
so you could not even taste these nuts.

680
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,684
And what a relief it was.

681
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,104
I managed to survive and am now
doing my best as the head guildmaster.

682
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,442
A centuries-long tradition
could have been ruined

683
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,404
by a groundless, ill-mannered thug.

684
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,030
"Thug"?

685
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,615
How dare you!

686
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,784
I may not look it, but I amâ€¦

687
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,681
How long do you think
you can keep your position?

688
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,309
Are you worried about my seat?

689
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,813
Even if you do,
it will never become yours anyway.

690
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,048
Is it a dog?

691
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,549
Or is it a bear?

692
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,969
Well, one thing is certain.

693
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,554
What is that?

694
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,805
The legendary altruist

695
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,058
is an awful painter.

696
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,356
To be honest, I am quite satisfied
that the painting got stolen.

697
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,858
Have you forgotten
your duties as an officer?

698
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,488
Well, when I think
of the old man who was beatenâ€¦

699
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,534
Delivering rice to the old man's home
can be a heartwarming tale.

700
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,869
But this is undeniably a case of theft.

701
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,039
Hello, sir.

702
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,084
Why did Minister Yeom summon you?

703
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,253
Did he bother you for another favor?

704
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,755
Be understanding of him.

705
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,924
He always mixes up
public and private matters

706
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,510
and uses his authority
for personal affairs.

707
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,017
What is this?

708
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,477
A theft occurred last night.

709
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,688
The original tiger painting went missing,

710
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,855
andâ€¦

711
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,775
this lousy doodle was left in its place.

712
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,068
What?

713
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,406
It is still something that was left behind
in the minister's home.

714
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,658
There must be some meaning behind it.

715
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,745
Perhaps it is a warning
sent by rebel forces.

716
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,331
From my perspective,

717
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,792
I believe it was just an ordinary thief.

718
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,345
How unsettling.

719
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,141
Have you heard of the phrase,

720
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,312
"A fierce tiger becomes a mouse"?

721
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,106
EVEN A ROYAL SUBJECT CAN SUBDUE
A KING WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY

722
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,357
If a tiger loses its claws,

723
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,359
it becomes as weak as a mouse.

724
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,155
Do you know
the true meaning of the phrase?

725
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,991
If a king loses his authority,

726
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,619
he will be subdued by his subjects.

727
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,537
That must be it!

728
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,168
It is a sign of defection.

729
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:42,878
Did you say affection?

730
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:47,049
AFFECTION: A FEELING OF LOVE AND LONGING
FOR SOMEONE OR SOMETHING

731
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,884
Whether it was a thief or a rebel,

732
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,927
you must arrest who did this.

733
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,596
The Capital Guard's reputation

734
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,431
is in your hands.

735
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,060
Yes, sir.

736
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,147
I understand.

737
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,405
PIL INN

738
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,412
I will take over
her precious Myeongdo Inn at all costs

739
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,832
and see the look on that wench's face.

740
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,626
I will make sure of it.

741
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,089
What of the boat to Qing?

742
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,341
Everything has been prepared.

743
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,889
Do you know how much I've spent
bribing Yeom Heung-jip?

744
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,142
I have expended too much effort
to secure this route,

745
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,603
so there must be no mistakes
with the delivery.

746
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,063
Do not worry, sir.

747
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,652
There is another urgent matter
you must look into.

748
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,905
Who do you wish for me to kill?

749
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,077
Find a painting for me.

750
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,206
This was requested in secret,

751
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,583
so handle it with discretion.

752
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,544
Yes, boss.

753
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,444
Grain syrup can only be made
if you continue to put in all your effort

754
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,154
over a prolonged period of time.

755
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,613
Yes, Mother.

756
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:40,454
Do not rush or go too slowly.

757
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,915
You must stir at a consistent pace

758
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,500
so the bottom does not burn.

759
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,294
Yes, Mother.

760
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,378
Let me stir it now.

761
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,337
How dare you!

762
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,507
Do not touch your lord's grain syrup.

763
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,093
I apologize, ma'am.

764
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,558
By the way, Mother, tomorrow--

765
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:05,103
Tomorrow's work can only begin
once today's work is done.

766
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,106
Continue stirring slowly.

767
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,983
Yes, Mother.

768
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,577
Yeon-seon.

769
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,372
My eyes sting even more painfully today.

770
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,165
Will the grain syrup
even be completed by tonight?

771
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,673
I must finish this
if I am to go to the temple tomorrow.

772
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,470
You can do this, Cho Yeo-hwa.

773
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,434
Lady Cho!

774
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,727
Lady Cho.

775
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,147
Lord Seok is asking for you.

776
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,494
You called for me, Father?

777
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,997
You are going to the temple tomorrow.

778
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,165
Did I summon you too late at night?

779
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,919
Did you know that it was tomorrow?

780
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,424
How could I not?

781
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,635
I shall give you 160 kg of rice.

782
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,596
Use it as an offering.

783
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,265
Thank you, Father.

784
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,684
You are my daughter-in-law,

785
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,187
which makes your brother, Seong-hu,
part of our family as well.

786
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,816
If your sincerity can bring him back,

787
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,485
I would gladly give you
a few sacks of rice.

788
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,157
I know the hope
that your brother will return

789
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,285
is what has kept you going
through all these difficult times.

790
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,995
I know that very well.

791
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,998
Fatherâ€¦

792
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,251
You are fortunate.

793
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,755
At least you can still hope.

794
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,098
You must be tired.

795
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,725
Go and get some rest now.

796
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,061
Yes, Father.

797
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,192
SEONG-HU,
I BELIEVE YOU ARE ALIVE

798
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,361
UNCLE HAS BETROTHED ME
TO LORD SEOK'S SON

799
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,488
My dear brother.

800
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,866
I may have to get married.

801
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:48,910
So, please.

802
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,621
Please come and take me with you.

803
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,817
Is thisâ€¦

804
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,444
This is a sword cane.

805
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,864
SWORD CANE: A JOSEON-ERA SWORD
THAT RESEMBLES A SWEET FLAG LEAF

806
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,163
I will have a sword cane made
just for you one day.

807
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:34,914
Brotherâ€¦

808
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,544
Does this mean you are alive?

809
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,175
Where on earth are you,
and why have you not returned?

810
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,653
It hasâ€¦

811
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,865
â€¦already been 15 years.

812
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,892
SU-HO'S FATHER IM KANG,
SU-HO'S MOTHER SEO SUK-HYEON

813
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,870
Father!

814
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,080
Han-jae.

815
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,540
You scoundrels!

816
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:03,920
No!

817
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,265
Han-jaeâ€¦

818
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,854
You must hang on.

819
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,554
Thank you for coming with me.

820
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,849
My father would nag me
for three days straight,

821
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,392
saying I was an unkind brother,

822
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,769
if I didn't join you
to commemorate your parents' death.

823
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,439
It has been three years since I came,

824
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,399
so I took longer than expected.

825
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:07,984
Let us go now.

826
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,403
All right.

827
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,248
You came last year in the heavy rain.

828
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,918
I see you did not forget
to visit this year too.

829
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,140
He cares deeply for you
as your older brother.

830
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,127
My lady.

831
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,129
How much farther must we go?

832
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,256
We are nearly there.

833
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,677
You said we were nearly there an hour ago.

834
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,138
Yes, you must be tired.
Let us rest for a bit.

835
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,100
-Let us take a break.
-Yes, my lady.

836
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,653
Look, boss.

837
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,030
You must be strong.

838
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,074
Do you see what they are carrying?

839
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,909
That is 160 kg of rice.

840
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,621
What if the heavens punish us
for doing this?

841
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,248
My children may starve to death

842
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,126
before that happens.

843
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,669
I have nothing to lose.

844
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,505
Goodness, you better be careful.

845
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,592
-Remember that no one must get hurt.
-All right.

846
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,718
All right then.

847
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,303
Are we going to go

848
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,054
on the count of three?

849
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,515
One, twoâ€¦

850
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,100
How about on the count of two?

851
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,939
The sun will set at this rate.

852
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,568
Look as threatening as you can.

853
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,532
One, twoâ€¦

854
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,368
Three!

855
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,758
Say something.

856
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,219
If you want to live,

857
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,138
hand over your rice now.

858
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,181
Hand it over.

859
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,516
If you do not, we will attack.

860
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,934
We will attack.

861
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,438
-We mean it.
-That is right.

862
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,357
Is it the rice you are after?

863
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,485
What else would we want?

864
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,365
Do not hurt anyone,
and take the rice with you.

865
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,866
What?

866
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,160
Do you mean it?

867
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,331
Can we really take all of this?

868
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,083
Yes, you may take it.

869
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,836
You cannot take back what you--

870
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,213
Just hurry up and take it!

871
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,756
-Come on.
-Take it.

872
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:18,841
Look, Brother.

873
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,178
-Come on.
-Hurry up.

874
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,346
Please wait here.

875
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,348
Why?

876
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,062
Head Guildmaster.

877
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,899
We got a letter from the Capital Guard.

878
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,573
This is from a superintendent
of the Capital Guard.

879
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,577
Stop what you are doing!

880
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,919
What is that man doing here?

881
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:55,878
Who is he?

882
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,338
Do you know him, my lady?

883
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,096
Please help, sir. We are in trouble.

884
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,223
I shall help you. So, step aside.

885
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,349
No, sir.

886
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,101
I meant that I was in danger.

887
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,561
Do not worry.

888
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,062
That is not what I am sayingâ€¦

889
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,240
Give me that.

890
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,451
My dear sir!

891
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,745
I am in danger, so please save me first.

892
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,705
-Why are you doing this?
-Hold on tight.

893
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,457
Save me first!

894
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,937
This is from a superintendent
of the Capital Guard.

895
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,648
I will do whatever it takes to arrest you.

896
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,484
So, please.

897
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,154
Do not let me even catch a glimpse of you.

898
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:17,335
EPILOGUE

899
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,352
I hear your brother is investigating

900
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,854
Minister Yeom's stolen painting.

901
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,147
Did you catch the thief?

902
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,524
I could not see his face.

903
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,734
Who goes there?

904
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,653
Did I not tell you
to stay out of my sight?

905
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,114
Let us make this easy
by saying you never saw me.

906
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,493
The wives of the high-ranking officials
will visit Sugu Gate to donate grains.

907
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,829
Thank you all for coming all this way.

908
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,206
The woman in the mourning dress.

909
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,250
What do you think of her?

910
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,128
One should keep their distance from her.

911
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,380
I must go out.

912
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,008
I cannot stop thinking
about the old woman.

913
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,011
Ma'am!

914
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:39,602
