1
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,257
Does your shoulder not hurt?

2
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,301
Why did you insist
on fixing this yourself?

3
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,138
I am sure someone will worry
that the old woman

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,224
has no shelter from the rain.

5
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,356
So, that someone would come
and fix it themselves, would they not?

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,611
Here you go, sir.

7
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,030
You should at least put this on.

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,409
You need to wear something like this

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,912
when working in such a dusty place.

10
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:24,334
If you do not, your throat will be sore,
and your nose will be running all day.

11
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,586
Bi-chan.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,671
There we go.

13
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,349
I look ridiculous.

14
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,768
There is no one around to see you anyway.

15
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,020
-Turn around, sir.
-What?

16
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,939
If you are trying to work…

17
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,023
Your arm, please.

18
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,444
It is important to work
as comfortably as possible.

19
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,910
How does that feel?

20
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,252
Well, it does not seem too bad.

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,507
I will work on the rest, Bi-chan.

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,635
You should go and find out
where the old woman is staying.

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,512
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,195
You three again?

25
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,239
What is going on here?

26
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,533
-Are there two masks now?
-It seems so.

27
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,454
I feel as if I have seen someone
who is as tall as you before.

28
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,915
What is that you are carrying?

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,833
A sack of rice.

30
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,043
-Are you crazy?
-Why would you tell him that?

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,253
Did you steal it?

32
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,629
My goodness.

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,673
What? Of course not.

34
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,384
-We look nothing like thieves!
-That is right.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,101
Tell me the truth.

36
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,769
Where did you get that rice?

37
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,439
-I swear we did not steal it.
-That is right.

38
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,357
Someone in a mask like yourself

39
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,943
-gave it to us to eat.
-That is right.

40
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
-A mask?
-Yes.

41
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,448
Where is this person now?

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,449
Well…

43
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,868
He was… Over there.

44
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,876
Something about this situation feels…

45
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,753
It feels familiar, does it not?

46
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,962
It sure does.

47
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,267
Stop!

48
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,371
You have caught me,
so let the old woman go.

49
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,374
What are you doing here?

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,876
And what are you wearing?

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,877
Are you a team?

52
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,295
-No.
-No!

53
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,673
Stop getting in my way and be on your way.

54
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
I am trying to help.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,883
Be quiet.

56
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,260
Do you not see this sword?

57
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,428
-Take me instead, so--
-No, take me.

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,639
I want the girl, not either of you two.

59
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,100
Why do you insist on being captured?

60
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,935
Come closer, and I will kill this--

61
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,478
Well, that is not my business.

62
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,980
Is that not too harsh?

63
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,856
This all happened because of you.

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,233
Oh, really?

65
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,818
So, this was all my fault?

66
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,320
Are you trying to test me?

67
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,323
Why would you lose your sword?

68
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,743
Do not worry.
I will return it when I am done.

69
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,995
Thank you.

70
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,883
Go now.

71
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,302
Oh, my dear Suk!

72
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,729
Go to Myeongdo Inn
and say the mask helped you.

73
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
-Go on!
-Yes, sir.

74
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,910
I shall be dealing with you.

75
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,124
Superintendent Park!

76
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,710
-Where are you, sir?
-It must be the Capital Guard.

77
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,545
-Let us go.
-Superintendent Park!

78
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,839
Should you not be going after them?

79
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,674
Why must you come after me?

80
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,345
While I know who sent them here,

81
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
I do not know why you are here.

82
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,973
Of course you do. You were watching me!

83
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,684
I certainly have, which is why I cannot…

84
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,853
What on earth are you doing?

85
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,481
Unhand me.

86
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,233
Unhand me.

87
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,333
That will do.

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,421
-Are you crazy?
-I became curious.

89
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,507
I wondered who could be

90
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,844
so bold in the presence
of a superintendent.

91
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,222
Perhaps they have strong connections.

92
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,307
Or perhaps

93
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,686
they are from a noble family
that does not fear a mere superintendent--

94
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,986
Superintendent Park!

95
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,031
Are you all right, sir?

96
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,911
A mask

97
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,455
and a bright full moon…

98
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,665
The legendary altruist?

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,834
Sir!

100
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,586
That was the altruist.

101
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,337
Bi-chan.

102
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,717
My shoulder seems to have got worse.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,844
That is not important right now.

104
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,721
The legendary altruist is here.

105
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,265
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,809
I do not see anything.

107
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,395
I was sure that was him.
Did you not see him?

108
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,815
-Bi-chan.
-Yes, sir?

109
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,068
I feel unwell, so let us go.

110
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,695
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,697
Goodness.

112
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,781
-Oh, dear.
-Watch your step.

113
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,367
Did you really not see him, sir?

114
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,244
No. Come along now.

115
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
I am sure it was the altruist.

116
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,372
Goodness.

117
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,216
-Yeon-seon.
-Yes, my lady?

118
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,927
Why do you think

119
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,554
Kang Pil-jik's men wanted
to take those children?

120
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,350
It is not like they were sold off
by their fathers like Kkon-nim.

121
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,936
They would not have any intention
of looking after them.

122
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,563
They are very different from you, my lady.

123
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,481
Then, why?

124
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,985
If it was not for you,
I, too, would have been taken by such men

125
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,488
to be sold off
as a courtesan or a concubine.

126
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,198
No one would even notice.

127
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,575
It is

128
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,328
quite common to see death in this place.

129
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,248
Or she may have run away
because life was so difficult.

130
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,875
Those worthless bastards.

131
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,713
It is great that you saved someone.

132
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,552
But you said they were Kang Pil-jik's men.

133
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,137
Have you forgotten
they tried to kill Lady Jang?

134
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,847
How could I forget?

135
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,684
I am furious
that they are still running freely.

136
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,687
They kill people without batting an eye.

137
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,147
You must not get involved with them.

138
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,568
I should have been done with them
by driving them out of the capital.

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,236
They chase children with swords.

140
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,446
Please spare me, sir.

141
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,658
"They say enemies meet on a new bridge."

142
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,493
What an ignorant fool.

143
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995
Did he recognize who you were?

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,253
Perhaps they are from a noble family
that does not fear a mere superintendent--

145
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,338
It cannot be…

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,883
How could he know who I am?

147
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,095
They will search the whole capital
to identify the mask.

148
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,430
My lady.

149
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,640
You really must be cautious, all right?

150
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,852
I will really be cautious.

151
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,188
Send word to Myeongdo Inn.

152
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,357
Ask if the old lady and girl are safe.

153
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,483
Yes, my lady.

154
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,071
Lady Cho.

155
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,782
Lady Yoo has urgently called you
to the main building.

156
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,910
So, my mother-in-law wants to see me.

157
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,537
I must now face the music.

158
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,789
Do not worry.
It will only upset you even more.

159
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,751
Yeon-seon…

160
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,337
Does it really matter why
when you get scolded every day anyway?

161
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,465
You are the worst.

162
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,597
Did you want to see me, Mother?

163
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:45,186
The finance minister has sent you
a magnificent gift.

164
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,604
For me?

165
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,943
It is a copy of Instructions for Women,
transcribed by the queen dowager herself.

166
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,570
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN:
A MANUSCRIPT COMPILED

167
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,780
BY QUEEN SO-HYE TO EDUCATE WOMEN

168
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,783
I am so deeply grateful.

169
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,950
That is not enough.

170
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,663
This is a family heirloom
to be passed down for generations.

171
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,583
It is a huge honor for our family
and something to be truly proud of.

172
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,170
It makes me so happy
to see you this jovial, Mother.

173
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,965
A virtuous woman's gate may even be…

174
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,138
I could jinx it if I speak too soon.

175
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,559
There was just one thing
that I felt regrettable about yesterday.

176
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,776
What are you waiting for?

177
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,320
Are we going somewhere?

178
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,366
Just step in for now.

179
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,371
What? The masked man appeared
and took the child?

180
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,458
It was the same one
who caused trouble at the inn.

181
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,252
But now that I think about it,

182
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,505
I believe he was also the same man
who saved Jang So-un seven years ago.

183
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,424
What? It was the same one?

184
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,675
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,802
On top of that,
another strange man appeared.

186
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,138
That was why we lost the child.

187
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,891
How could you lose the kid and the mask
and still be so bold?

188
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,601
-I am sorry--
-Are you?

189
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,521
You know better than anyone
how much I resent him.

190
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,357
Forget about the child.
The mask should have been killed!

191
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,568
-I apologize--
-Do not even dare!

192
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,990
If I hear you apologize again,
I will shove this fan down your throat.

193
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,908
Please forgive me, sir.

194
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,247
Every single time you make a mistake…

195
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,377
I remind myself of the time
I was a hungry butcher

196
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,213
and the half of a rotten potato
you shared with me.

197
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,758
I think about it over and over again…

198
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,803
to hold myself back.

199
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,180
Boss!

200
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,766
Go and find out who the mask is at once.

201
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,143
Yes, sir.

202
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,166
Did I not tell you
to stay out of my sight?

203
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,251
You told me to return it, did you not?

204
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,170
Unhand me.

205
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,188
Good day, sir.

206
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,107
A new novel has just arrived.

207
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,824
DAY FLOWER

208
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,079
Two deaths were confirmed
in Gyeongsang Province.

209
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,915
The following are three men
who are still missing.

210
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,460
Jung Hae-jun, Pyo Hyeon-ung,
and Cho Seong-hu.

211
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,302
Tell them to send
the next volume with haste.

212
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,762
Yes, sir.

213
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,265
Go ahead and try it on.

214
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,184
Try it on.

215
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,023
It may be safer than a mask
to dress up as a man.

216
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,408
-How much is this?
-This one is one yang.

217
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,535
-What about that one?
-That is also one yang.

218
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,705
-How about this one?
-You chose an expensive one.

219
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,547
You must be buying a gift for a lover.

220
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:43,883
A lover?

221
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,301
I have no such thing.

222
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,803
It is fine if you do not.
There is no need to get upset.

223
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,972
Well, you should not have assumed.

224
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,309
Then, who are you buying that gat for?

225
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,478
Well…

226
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,647
It is for me.

227
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,401
What brings you here anyway, sir?

228
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,363
I was looking to buy a gat as well.

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,993
Since we cross paths so often,
I would like to at least exchange names.

230
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,871
I am Park Yun-hak.

231
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,415
Thank you for letting me know.

232
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,251
Wait.

233
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,338
Why did you not respond?

234
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,721
Are you asking for my name too?

235
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,642
Who else would I be speaking to, then?

236
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,689
My name is Yeon-seon.

237
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,566
Lee Yeon-seon.

238
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,778
Very well.

239
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,700
Let me see.

240
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,457
This one will suit you best.

241
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,337
I shall see you again.

242
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,475
I did not doubt for a moment

243
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,061
that you would find this for me.

244
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,987
I was so upset after losing my painting.

245
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,947
I could not even eat.

246
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,908
Can you notice?

247
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,118
I have even lost weight.

248
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,163
-I did manage to find the painting.
-Yes.

249
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,000
Did you catch the thief
whom I want to tear apart myself?

250
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,418
The thing is,

251
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,336
the culprit could not be caught.

252
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,213
What?

253
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:47,881
How could that be?

254
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,971
Also, after retrieving the painting,
I saw that the bar was cracked.

255
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,639
What? Where?

256
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,267
It truly is cracked.

257
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,102
This piece is priceless!

258
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,064
There must not be
a single flaw in this painting.

259
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,441
This cannot be!

260
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,401
Look at this bar!

261
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,779
It was carved from the wood
of a 100-year-old empress tree.

262
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,948
What will you do about this? Tell me!

263
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,409
I apologize.

264
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,578
To hell with your apology.

265
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,121
You must take responsibility.

266
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,831
Pardon?

267
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,042
You failed to catch the thief
and cracked the bar.

268
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,543
You must be held responsible.

269
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,003
-But, sir--
-If you do not find

270
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:31,258
an exact replacement for it,
I will not let this slide.

271
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,259
Do you understand?

272
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,302
Unbelievable!

273
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,636
This is outrageous.

274
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,558
Let us try that once more.

275
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,106
No.

276
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,817
You must not waddle like that.

277
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,278
You must step lightly like a butterfly.

278
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,076
No, that is not right.

279
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,453
You must not flail your arms like that.

280
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,457
Move gently like the first snow falling
on a tree branch.

281
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,419
No, not like that.

282
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,130
Your legs must not bend so awkwardly.

283
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,256
No.

284
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,884
You must not waddle like that.

285
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,720
You must step lightly like a butterfly.

286
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,100
No.

287
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,435
Do not lurch forward or wobble.

288
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,897
Yes, there you go.

289
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,692
Now, lower your hands
and gather your legs.

290
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,444
No.

291
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,117
Goodness.

292
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,828
Have you gone crazy?

293
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,206
Why on earth can you not do this?

294
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,541
Do it again!

295
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,256
What are you doing, my lady?

296
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,009
You have returned, sir.

297
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,055
Were you waiting outside for me
until this late hour?

298
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,557
You should have stayed inside.

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,559
Welcome home, Father.

300
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,602
Hello, Yeo-hwa…

301
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,863
-Father…
-What were you doing in there?

302
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,450
Yeo-hwa is setting
a good example for all women.

303
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,328
She was practicing

304
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,999
how to beautifully and gently exit
a palanquin in a picturesque way.

305
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,672
I see.

306
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,680
However, the sun has already set.

307
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,517
I think it would be best
to call it a night and continue tomorrow.

308
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,520
Very well, I shall.

309
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,982
Go inside and rest now.

310
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,525
Yes, Mother.

311
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,986
-Let us go inside.
-Yes.

312
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,962
My lord.

313
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:19,051
The queen dowager has bestowed Yeo-hwa
a copy of Instructions for Women.

314
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,013
This is it.

315
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,182
Thanks to Yeo-hwa,

316
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,561
we can finally stand proud
when we face our ancestors.

317
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,731
That is wonderful.

318
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,691
However,

319
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,986
how is it thanks to Yeo-hwa?

320
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,406
It is all thanks to you

321
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,283
for teaching her so well, my lady.

322
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,664
She was an orphan from a poor family.

323
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:53,293
It was you who has properly educated her
ever since we took her in.

324
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,586
My lord…

325
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,346
Is that not an apple?

326
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,016
Cheongsong offered them up to His Majesty.

327
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,980
I remembered
that you like apples, my lady.

328
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,237
-So, I secretly took one.
-Goodness.

329
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,661
You look more beautiful than the apple.

330
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,329
Oh, dear.

331
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,595
This was all because of you.

332
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,518
SEOK-JEONG, MEMORIAL TABLET
OF YEO-HWA'S HUSBAND

333
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,692
My lady…

334
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,323
Do you know how many times
I went in and out of the palanquin today?

335
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,450
I can barely even stand.

336
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,785
I was seeing stars after a while.

337
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,371
I feel nauseous too.

338
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,166
Stretch out your legs.
I will massage them for you.

339
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,542
Any word from Myeongdo Inn?

340
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,671
They sent the old lady
and girl somewhere safe,

341
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,674
but the girl said
something strange as they left.

342
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,092
What did she say?

343
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,304
They said they will share
the details in person.

344
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,388
Stretch your legs.

345
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,767
-I had better go there.
-Right now?

346
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,268
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

347
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,438
I cannot wait.

348
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,440
I knew you would say that.

349
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,485
So, I prepared
a ride for you just in case.

350
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
A ride, you say?

351
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,074
You will not be able to run
with your sore legs.

352
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,926
Your pouty lips may reach
the capital fortress wall.

353
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,302
Are you still upset?

354
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,764
I cannot help but find it strange.

355
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,681
What do you mean?

356
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,351
The legendary altruist.

357
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,270
You know him, do you not?

358
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,731
Preposterous.

359
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,358
No, I do not.

360
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,069
How did you get the painting
that the altruist stole?

361
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,570
And what about yesterday?

362
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,075
Please be honest with me, sir.

363
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,661
Bi-chan.

364
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,376
Do you know of a place that sells bars
made of 100-year-old empress tree wood?

365
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,669
Do not change the subject.

366
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,213
It seems that this legendary altruist

367
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,799
has cracked the bar
of Minister Yeom's painting.

368
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,885
When I saw him earlier,
he seemed set on killing--

369
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,845
Myeongdo Inn.

370
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,779
Yeon-seon told me

371
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,324
to prepare a ride for you
since you cannot move easily.

372
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,743
But she said it must not be a palanquin.

373
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,996
Do not even say the word "palanquin."

374
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,080
Yes, my lady.

375
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,291
LAND OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY

376
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,417
We are almost there.

377
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,961
Please hold on a bit longer.

378
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,046
Do not worry. I am very comfortable.

379
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,384
It feels like I am lying on a cloud.

380
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,852
Gosh, you are working hard.

381
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,312
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

382
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,191
It is good to see you.

383
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
MYEONGDO INN

384
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,707
-Goodness.
-Be careful.

385
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,006
Gosh, my legs.

386
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,226
What is going on, Lady Jang?

387
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,479
After receiving your letter,
I asked the child a few questions.

388
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,398
She said she heard other children's voices
while she was captured.

389
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,609
There were other children?

390
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,823
Are you saying this may be more
than a kidnapping of a single child?

391
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,367
I am scared.

392
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,704
I also found it strange,
so I have been looking into it.

393
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,832
For the past few years throughout Hanyang,

394
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,127
many children
of a similar age have gone missing.

395
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,879
-Help.
-Please let me go.

396
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,799
-I want to go home.
-Spare me.

397
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,467
-Let me go.
-Please help.

398
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,095
Was Kang Pil-jik really
that horrible of a person?

399
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,513
He is certainly capable of it.

400
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,765
He would sell children without remorse

401
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,102
if it would make him money
to line his own pockets.

402
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,648
Lady Jang. You must keep an eye
on the goods being handled by his guild.

403
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,483
Also, see if there is a place

404
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,361
in or around Pil Inn
where they may be holding children.

405
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,407
And what do you plan on doing?

406
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,034
If we find actual evidence
of human trafficking,

407
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,245
what will you do then?

408
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,208
This is different
than what you have been doing thus far.

409
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,502
You could end up in great danger.

410
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,463
You could even become
a target to Kang Pil-jik.

411
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,840
Head Guildmaster.

412
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,176
I know what you are concerned about.

413
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,469
However,

414
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,640
if there are children out there
desperately waiting to be saved,

415
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,519
should I not do as much as I can?

416
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,403
We need someone to tie off loose ends.

417
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:54,988
Moreover,

418
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,825
they must be a trustworthy person
who can go up against Kang Pil-jik.

419
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,746
What is it?

420
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,124
The superintendent
of the Capital Guard is here.

421
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,003
Why has he come here again?

422
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,672
For now, you must hide in here.

423
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,469
-This way.
-Gosh, my legs.

424
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,397
What brings you here?

425
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,691
I apologize for my late visit.

426
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,486
On Minister Yeom's painting…

427
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,078
The bar on this painting has been cracked.

428
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,622
I came to ask
if you have something like it.

429
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,500
The wood of an empress tree.

430
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,419
If I do not restore it
to its original state,

431
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,254
he will not stop chasing after the thief.

432
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,301
Are you trying to help the one
who stole the painting?

433
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,761
That is ridiculous.

434
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,888
I just do not want
to deal with the hassle.

435
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,099
From what I heard,

436
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,810
Myeongdo Inn has everything
one could ever need.

437
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,645
You have come to the right place.

438
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,064
I will see if we have the item you need.

439
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,942
-Would you please wait a moment?
-Very well.

440
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,537
I know you have been eavesdropping.

441
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,539
You can come out now.

442
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,421
If you do not come out,

443
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,632
then I will come in.

444
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,592
I barely fit in here alone.

445
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,986
You are always so loud.

446
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,447
Oh, goodness.

447
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,407
What are you doing here again?

448
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
The bar of the painting was cracked.

449
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,288
Finish up and be on your way.

450
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,501
You cannot just leave like this.

451
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,130
Thanks to a certain someone,
Minister Yeom berated me,

452
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,507
and my head was almost split open.

453
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,306
I was planning on going to your residence.

454
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
I was scolded for the bar you broke,

455
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,478
and it felt so unfair.

456
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,812
How would you know where I live?

457
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,064
I do not, which is why I came here.

458
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,821
If you fear being scolded
by Minister Yeom, I will return this.

459
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,822
Put that down.

460
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,076
I shall jump over his wall again.

461
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,996
Hand it over.

462
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,290
Give it back to me.

463
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,156
What on earth is going on?

464
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,871
-Did you put that in there?
-No. Did you?

465
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,383
Have you found the mask?

466
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,052
I kept an eye on Myeongdo Inn all day,

467
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,429
but there were no signs of him.

468
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,597
However,

469
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,184
I did see
Superintendent Park enter Myeongdo Inn.

470
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,477
He was at Myeongdo Inn?

471
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,692
I doubt he was there
to buy a ring for his lover.

472
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,445
The mask, Park Su-ho, and Myeongdo Inn…

473
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,284
What of the cargo?

474
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,494
We found a replacement,
so we will send them at once.

475
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,540
No one would even notice if they died.

476
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,584
If we send them on the next boat,

477
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,004
it should make up for the loss
after paying off Minister Yeom.

478
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:21,921
Yes, sir.

479
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,596
Please take your time
and talk things over.

480
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,022
What happened to those people yesterday?

481
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,568
The old lady and the child were sent
to a safe place.

482
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,613
Is this something that you always do?

483
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,656
What do you mean?

484
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,367
Providing assistance to the needy,
like the child or Kkon-nim.

485
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,994
Oh, that?

486
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,416
We need someone to tie off loose ends.

487
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,710
Moreover,

488
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,672
they must be a trustworthy person
who can go up against Kang Pil-jik.

489
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,762
If someone were to break the law,

490
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,598
can you arrest them,
no matter who they are?

491
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,685
That is my job.

492
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,897
Can I take your word for it?

493
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,774
Of course.

494
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,658
I think
Kang Pil-jik is kidnapping children.

495
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,662
The child we saved yesterday said
she heard other children's voices.

496
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,206
Someone from Myeongdo Inn will look
into it first--

497
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,415
I cannot allow it.

498
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,211
Our nation is governed by law.

499
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,089
This matter must be dealt with
by the Capital Guard,

500
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,757
not Myeongdo Inn.

501
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,135
If what you say is true,

502
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,179
we will formally proceed
according to the law.

503
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,098
"According to the law," you say?

504
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,433
I am saying a measly masked figure

505
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,687
must not disturb the capital
over something like this.

506
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,615
Unbelievable!

507
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,752
The two men were confirmed dead
in Gyeongsang Province,

508
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,506
while the three men listed are
still missing.

509
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,509
Jung Hae-jun, Pyo Hyeon-ung,
and Cho Seong-hu.

510
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,178
Did they all serve
General Im Kang of the king's guards?

511
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,347
Yes, Your Majesty.

512
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,266
They are soldiers of the king's guards

513
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,893
who vanished after the late king's death.

514
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,187
That night,

515
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,399
someone left with my father's royal seal.

516
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,484
If we find him,

517
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,280
we may be able to learn
the truth from that day.

518
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,034
We are searching
for every last trace they left behind,

519
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,411
so please wait a little longer.

520
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,707
I am sure we will find out
the truth this time, Sire.

521
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,177
CHO SEONG-HU

522
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,344
CAPITAL GUARD

523
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,138
So, what is it you want to do?

524
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,265
We must investigate Kang Pil-jik's guild.

525
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,392
Forget it.

526
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,188
How many times have I told you
to just leave them be?

527
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,024
Why are you trying
to stir up a hornet's nest?

528
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,820
Not only was there
an illegal gambling den at the Pil Inn,

529
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,407
but I saw one of Kang Pil-jik's men trying
to kidnap a child yesterday.

530
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,618
They tried to kidnap a child?

531
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,914
That man was probably acting alone.

532
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,291
The man basically owns
the entire Unjong Market.

533
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,376
What would he gain
from kidnapping a child?

534
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,130
Kang Pil-jik looks down on us
because you keep looking the other way.

535
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,884
What? He looks down on us?

536
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,260
Think about it.

537
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,887
You are the face of the Capital Guard.

538
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,808
How could he bill you
for the incident at the gambling den?

539
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,018
How lowly does he think you are?

540
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:05,853
Captain Hwang.

541
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,398
I have no complaints
regarding my salary cut.

542
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,901
But if we let him weasel out of it again,

543
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,153
how will he think of us next?

544
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,114
That weaselly scoundrel!

545
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,407
How measly does he think we are?

546
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,034
I have the evidence to prove it.

547
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,578
With your approval,

548
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,582
I will bring him in
and raise the Capital Guard's esteem.

549
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,377
Listen, Captain Hwang.

550
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,671
This endeavor will help you move up
the ladder.

551
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,007
You are right.

552
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,468
How much longer must I remain
stagnant as a captain?

553
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,140
The Capital Guard's esteem
and my future are in your hands.

554
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,267
No, that will not do.

555
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,019
Let us go right now.

556
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,648
I will lead the way.

557
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,657
"A measly masked figure"?

558
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,992
Oh, sure. That is all I am.

559
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,827
See if I care if they handle everything.

560
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,205
Who hurt you so, Lady Cho?

561
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,165
I am not hurt.

562
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,251
It was not as if he said anything wrong.

563
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,836
What could I ever do to help?

564
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,630
It is not like I can have Kang Pil-jik
imprisoned or exiled.

565
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,049
If the law is so mighty,
why do people still feel wronged,

566
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,342
and why would you jump over walls?

567
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,969
What good would that do?

568
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,554
I am just a measly masked figure.

569
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,183
He said the Capital Guard would
investigate Kang Pil-jik.

570
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,517
So, do not be upset.

571
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:31,772
I do not care how I am treated
if the law can take care of everything.

572
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,191
I am just a measly mask.

573
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,279
Superintendent Park witnessed it himself,
so I am sure he will hurry.

574
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,325
Will he really follow the protocol
and look for the children first?

575
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,910
Lady Cho.

576
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,454
What is it?

577
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,665
The Peony Society is here,
so you must come down.

578
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,500
Very well.

579
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,336
I will be back.

580
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,301
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN

581
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,347
-You must be overjoyed.
-Yes, you must be.

582
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,269
Now, you must also receive
the virtuous woman's gate.

583
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,148
Have you decided to send her
to guard her husband's grave?

584
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,819
Well…

585
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,827
Do not tell me that you assume
you will receive the virtuous woman's gate

586
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,082
because the queen dowager bestowed you
a copy of Instructions for Women.

587
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,964
A virtuous woman's gate is not given
for only guarding a grave, either.

588
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,389
PIL INN

589
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,272
Will you lead the way?

590
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,148
After you, sir.

591
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,445
I will show them the authority
of the Capital Guard today.

592
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,250
It is a pleasure to see you all.

593
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,504
Have you been well, Lady Cho?

594
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,589
I have, thanks to you, my lady.

595
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,966
Have a seat.

596
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,384
Yes, Mother.

597
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,728
I wish to show you all
my gratitude for your help

598
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,771
at the last relief effort.

599
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:41,027
Would you like to go out
and see the flowers tomorrow?

600
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,404
-How wonderful.
-I would love to.

601
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,574
How about…

602
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,579
letting your daughter-in-law join us?

603
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,253
How would you feel about that, Yeo-hwa?

604
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,679
I must read Mother's mind.

605
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,014
What is she thinking?

606
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,142
MOTHER'S INNER THOUGHTS

607
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,148
I am grateful for your offer,

608
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,359
but I worry
that seeing the beautiful flowers

609
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,195
will distract me from my duties.

610
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,697
So, I must respectfully decline.

611
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,201
That is such a shame.

612
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,797
What brings you here, Captain Hwang?

613
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,050
So…

614
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,846
About what happened at the gambling den--

615
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,098
My goodness.

616
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:56,811
Were you upset that we sent a bill
to the Capital Guard for the damages?

617
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,687
No, it is not that.

618
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,109
Is it not illegal to run a gambling den?

619
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:08,280
It was simply a social gathering
of men with high status.

620
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,247
I heard there is evidence

621
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,291
of children being sold off
as high-interest loan payments.

622
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,505
I cannot let people steal
my hard-earned money.

623
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,549
Also…

624
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,260
What else…

625
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,513
-The kidnapping.
-Right.

626
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,601
Several days ago,
someone witnessed your men

627
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,311
kidnapping a child.

628
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,066
That incident has nothing to do with us.

629
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,529
Recently,

630
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:54,368
my men did save a child
who was almost kidnapped by a masked man.

631
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,454
Is that a problem?

632
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,082
Since we received a report…

633
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,419
let us follow the protocol.

634
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:09,425
Shall we go back to the Capital Guard
and discuss the details over a cup of tea?

635
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,680
Captain Hwang,
you are hurting my feelings.

636
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,058
-Come inside!
-Yes, sir.

637
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,323
Step aside!

638
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,023
Out of the way.

639
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,942
What is happening?

640
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,778
Search the inn for gambling dens
or any other illegal acts.

641
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,154
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,741
Look for a place
that can confine children.

643
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,160
Yes, sir.

644
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,458
Kang Pil-jik was arrested
by the Capital Guard.

645
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,545
-The almighty Kang Pil-jik was arrested?
-Really?

646
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,713
-That is crazy.
-Unbelievable.

647
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,756
Alewife.

648
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,299
Is that really true?

649
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,259
Did you not know?

650
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,347
Are you already done?

651
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,203
I do not think they are inside.

652
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,747
It might be somewhere outside.

653
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,625
You must stay behind
and check the surroundings.

654
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,003
Yes, sir.
Will you return to the Capital Guard?

655
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,547
I must speak with Kang Pil-jik.

656
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,146
Where are you going dressed like that?

657
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,108
This is a letter from Hwal-yu.

658
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,403
They followed protocol
and arrested Kang Pil-jik.

659
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,071
It means they have yet
to find the children.

660
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,365
This is the Pil Inn we are talking about.

661
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,493
I will just go
and see if the children are safe.

662
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,579
They may really be held captive there.

663
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,790
Still, it is dangerous
for you to wear the mask.

664
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,584
Should I wear my mourning dress instead?

665
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,838
I only prepared this
for the worst possible scenario.

666
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,217
But since it is a very urgent situation…

667
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,503
Bring me some drinks.

668
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,088
Yes, sir.

669
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,587
I doubt you brought me here to show me
how comfortable these chairs are.

670
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,715
I am a busy man.
Why have you brought me here?

671
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,800
Several days ago,

672
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,595
someone witnessed children being kidnapped
by some suspicious men.

673
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,596
Precisely.

674
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,559
I hear a masked man has been causing
trouble in the capital lately.

675
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,064
Should you not be going after him
instead of bringing me in?

676
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,542
PIL INN

677
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:01,216
According to the witness's testimony
of the incident that day,

678
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,344
it was not a masked man but your men

679
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,597
who threatened a child with a sword.

680
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,182
My goodness.

681
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,560
I do not know who,
but someone must be trying

682
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,812
to frame me for an old grudge.

683
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,816
You must know
that it is very common among merchants.

684
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,907
It seems that you went to all this trouble
over a trivial matter, Superintendent.

685
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:29,244
Further investigation will show
whether or not it was worth the trouble.

686
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,498
We shall see
if what the witness saw was true.

687
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:44,384
Naive curiosity can lead
to great peril sometimes.

688
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,603
Where are the Capital Guard officers?

689
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,980
They must have left
after not finding anything.

690
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,899
Good thing we moved them in advance.

691
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,068
Until we send them to Jemul Port tomorrow,

692
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,946
make sure
that not even a rat can get past you.

693
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,030
I will, sir.

694
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,310
NO ENTRY

695
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,159
Who are you?

696
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,168
Can you tell me where the toilet is?

697
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,797
It is over there. Go that way.

698
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,259
Thank you.

699
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,278
I said it was that way!

700
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,696
What is the matter?

701
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,411
Thank you very much.

702
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,873
The moon shines brightly tonight.

703
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,503
Is the toilet this way?

704
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,380
Or is it that way?

705
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,967
INJEONG GATE

706
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,510
Why are you doing this?

707
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,803
Please stop now.

708
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,305
Royal Advisor Park,

709
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,016
Minister Yeom is
clearly abusing his authority!

710
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,603
Although Minister Yeom is close
with Guildmaster Kang Pil-jik,

711
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,065
I doubt his actions were
for his own personal benefit.

712
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,775
They say that Minister Yeom

713
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,527
regularly receives bribes
from that scoundrel Kang Pil-jik.

714
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,364
-I have heard all of the rumors.
-What are you saying?

715
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,075
-How dare you try to frame me?
-I am sure it is not true.

716
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,578
The rumor is that you even stole gifts
offered up to His Majesty.

717
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,163
-Surely, that cannot be true.
-Right.

718
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,166
You even stole gifts
offered up to His Majesty?

719
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,876
What did you just say?

720
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,252
Say it again, you fool.

721
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,921
-Let us end this right now.
-Gosh.

722
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,548
-Come here, you fool.
-You are always full of it!

723
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,676
You look like a coward.

724
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,224
By the way, are the finance minister
and the justice minister not coming?

725
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,978
Why are they absent with no explanation?

726
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:48,110
A short while ago, the two ministers had
a minor argument over a trivial matter.

727
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,653
That must be why…

728
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,156
Are you saying
the two of them got into a fight?

729
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,076
Can you tell us what was going on?

730
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
From what I heard,

731
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,038
the finance minister gave the order

732
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,332
to release someone
in the Capital Guard's custody.

733
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,087
Why would he interfere
with the Ministry of Justice?

734
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,548
That must be
why the justice minister was so upset.

735
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,552
Who exactly did he order to be released?

736
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,555
He is a close friend
of the finance minister

737
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,766
and the guildmaster
of the nation's largest merchant guild.

738
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,936
The largest merchant guild in Joseon?

739
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,105
Is that not the Hwayeon guild?

740
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,525
Your Majesty.

741
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,279
It has been a long time
since Kang Pil-jik's guild took the title.

742
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,075
If Royal Advisor Park is telling
us the truth,

743
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,287
this is a constitution of misconduct
in the royal court.

744
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,414
Your Majesty.

745
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:46,251
I shall summon both ministers
and strictly reprimand them.

746
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,589
Do not scold them too harshly.

747
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:54,092
If it is not a serious issue,
just let them off with a warning.

748
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,056
I will look into the details
of this incident

750
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,976
and settle the matter correctly.

751
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:03,977
Very well.

752
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,357
Superintendent Park Su-ho!

753
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,445
What is the matter, sir?

754
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,031
I told you
it was a hornet's nest, did I not?

755
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,493
Do not say another word
and release Kang Pil-jik at once!

756
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,411
But the investigation is still ongoing.

757
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,038
That is not important.

758
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,165
I might get fired from my post.

759
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,169
Are you determined to screw me over?

760
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,340
I heard that you even broke
Minister Yeom's expensive wooden bar!

761
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,050
Darn it!

762
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,440
It seems you have no fear

763
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,901
since your brother is
the royal advisor.

764
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,445
How could I compare my brother…

765
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,991
to the connections you have,
Guildmaster Kang.

766
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,620
If you knew how strong my connections are,

767
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,666
you should not have made
such a big deal of things.

768
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,215
I can hold quite the grudge,
so your life may be in grave danger, sir.

769
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,843
Are you concerned for my safety?

770
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,350
I will not just let it go next time.

771
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,327
Kang Pil-jik was released?

772
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,455
Everyone found out about it
as soon as he got out.

773
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,540
What of the children?

774
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,710
I am sure they are locked up
at the Pil Inn warehouse.

775
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,670
Since Kang Pil-jik was released,

776
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,840
the Capital Guard may not be able
to move right away.

777
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,467
That darn superintendent.

778
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,929
I should have known
when he went on his power trip.

779
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,062
Goodness.

780
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,607
Look who it is.

781
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,571
Oh, dear.

782
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,240
You do not look very happy to see me.

783
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,493
I heard you were released after a day.

784
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:30,206
Your influence must be truly incredible.

785
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,587
"Influence," you say?

786
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,714
I was simply released
because I was innocent.

787
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,093
You cannot expect
to keep the truth hidden forever.

788
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,596
You will pay the price someday.

789
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,897
I wonder if you will be
alive to see the day, you wench.

790
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,277
I am behind on work, so please excuse me.

791
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,113
Let us go.

792
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,125
It truly is flawless.

793
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,962
Great work. You may go now.

794
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,463
Yes, sir.

795
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,688
-Brother.
-Did you arrest Kang Pil-jik?

796
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,650
He was released
before I could finish questioning him.

797
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,568
Was it your idea to do so?

798
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,324
Did I not warn you
that he was no ordinary merchant?

799
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,955
I have personally witnessed
several of his crimes already.

800
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,457
From the illegal gambling den at Pil Inn

801
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,292
to the abduction of children
from the slum.

802
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,712
I could not ignore it any longer.

803
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,590
Did you think
this could easily be resolved?

804
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,260
He has many connections
in the royal court alone.

805
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,095
I am an officer of this nation.

806
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,140
How could I turn a blind eye to injustice?

807
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,350
If it were you,

808
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,894
could you do such a thing?

809
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,320
What is this?

810
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,780
It is a record of evidence

811
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,825
showing that his guild has been stealing
gifts meant for the royal court.

812
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:35,165
A few pieces of circumstantial evidence
will not be enough to bring him down.

813
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,333
You must gather as much as you can

814
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,169
and take him down in one.

815
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,795
Brother…

816
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,006
Be careful.

817
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,632
Understood?

818
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,718
Yes.

819
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,280
How were things at the inn?

820
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,032
There have been no issues, sir.

821
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,366
What of the Capital Guard?

822
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,410
They have been keeping their distance.

823
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,372
I should have killed those punks.

824
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,628
I am tired
after being kept up by a pesky mosquito.

825
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,880
I must go inside and rest.

826
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,852
My White Tiger in the Mountain.

827
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,730
The bar was replaced
with an identical one.

828
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,322
Made from a 100-year-old empress tree?

829
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,240
Yes, sir.

830
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,368
Please check and see if it is the same.

831
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,376
It appears to be.

832
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:06,798
Good work.

833
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,633
Here.

834
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:10,927
Have a drink.

835
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,559
What is this?

836
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,395
It was inside the bar of the painting.

837
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,860
You should have just thrown it away.

838
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,319
Are you messing with me?

839
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,029
Are you?

840
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,241
What did you bring this garbage for?

841
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,289
Please excuse me.

842
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,334
I heard it was you…

843
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,297
who summoned Guildmaster Kang
to the Capital Guard.

844
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:54,345
Do you know
how much of a hassle that was for me?

845
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,515
A person should not be too upright.

846
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,187
One should also know
when to let things go.

847
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,398
You may go now.

848
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,752
How long has it been?

849
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,046
How many days have I been waiting?

850
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,343
Her lady says
you must make up your mind soon.

851
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:34,802
Very well.

852
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,348
You may go.

853
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,497
Darn you, Justice Minister!

854
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,545
My lord!

855
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,629
That foul scum…

856
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,050
You have had too much to drink.

857
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,426
Just leave it.

858
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,514
Please stop for today and get some rest.

859
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,601
How dare you touch me?

860
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,774
My lord…

861
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,612
You are the embodiment
of a virtuous woman.

862
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,159
Look how arrogant you have become
after being treated so highly.

863
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,788
You are drunk, sir.

864
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,249
If those brown-nosing fools were
ever to find out

865
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,376
who your wench of a mother was,

866
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,461
I wonder how they would see you then.

867
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,466
I am so curious.

868
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,135
Please stop now.

869
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,345
Three years after being widowed,

870
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,598
the vulgar wench had relations
with a servant.

871
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,849
That is your wretched mother.

872
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,892
That is enough, my lord!

873
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,227
How dare you!

874
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,480
How dare you look down on me?

875
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,487
How dare you, you wench!

876
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:18,990
Get up.

877
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,368
Do you know who I am?

878
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:25,913
Die, you wench.

879
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,374
I am fine.

880
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,544
I am the finance minister.

881
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,631
A minister of Joseon.

882
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,260
That is who I am.

883
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,650
It is late, sir.

884
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,819
I will bring water to your bedside.

885
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,863
WATER KEPT BY THE BEDSIDE
TO DRINK AT NIGHT

886
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,340
You persistent wench.

887
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,984
It has been a long time, my lord.

888
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,082
I apologize for troubling you
with my shortcomings.

889
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,752
While doing business,
I caught attention over a trivial issue.

890
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,423
"A trivial issue," you say?

891
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,303
Your name was even mentioned
within the palace.

892
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,765
And yet,
how could you see this as trivial?

893
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,976
I will not act carelessly ever again.

894
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,603
Have you forgotten?

895
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,856
I turned you from a brute

896
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,775
into the respected master
of a merchant guild.

897
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,527
Was that not enough?

898
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,695
Of course not, my lord.

899
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,364
I will never forget your generosity--

900
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,867
Did you think the small part
you played 15 years ago

901
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,328
was some kind of a great achievement?

902
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,248
I swear I would never even dream of it.

903
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,418
Pil-jik.

904
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,711
Yes, my lord.

905
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:43,426
I know that a horse must be fed
in order to make it run.

906
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:50,016
However, would a horse that bothers
its owner to feed it deserve to live?

907
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,773
You see,

908
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,485
I truly dislike bothersome things.

909
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,904
Do not forget that.

910
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,823
Yes, my lord. I will always remember.

911
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,940
I told you that this was a job
for the Capital Guard.

912
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,499
EPILOGUE

913
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,126
What is this?

914
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,755
I prepared it just in case
you could not go out in your mask.

915
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,801
Have you been spending
your hard-earned money on such things?

916
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,262
I had no idea.

917
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,889
I was worried the money you took from me

918
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,266
was still not enough
to buy a house for yourself.

919
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,687
-What do you mean, my lady?
-What?

920
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,857
It will cost one yang per wear.

921
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,275
The gat and trimmings will be extra.

922
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,235
Deal?

923
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,904
You never miss an opportunity.

924
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,072
Deal.

925
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:17,371
Thank you.

926
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,310
This is…

927
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,096
Where will you take the children?

928
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,682
I found the children, so I will take them.

929
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,975
Find where that punk is now!

930
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,352
Are you not afraid
of getting your identity exposed?

931
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,771
If you want to arrest me,
you can do so now.

932
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,357
Minister Yeom has passed away!

933
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,150
Are you saying he was murdered?

934
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,485
It was not me, sir!

935
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,112
What did you do last night?

936
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:32,530
Last night, I…

937
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,031
Well, you see…

938
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,784
Was he not seen
meeting a lady in a mourning dress

939
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,285
at the town shrine?

940
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,578
A widow?

941
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,914
-Were you meeting your lover?
-I can never tell you--

942
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,332
Even if it costs you your life?

943
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,669
Is this what they call… love?

944
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:51,757
