1
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,248
Just how much did he drink?

2
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,557
I must be starting

3
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,060
to see things now.

4
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,772
My lady.

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,399
You are someone else's wife.

6
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,526
My lady…

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,839
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

8
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,674
I am sorry.

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,596
Something must have upset you.

10
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,224
You should shake it off and let it go.

11
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,394
It will all get better with time.

12
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,941
Are you all right?

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,405
I heard that Councilor Seok's eldest son
has returned home.

14
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,494
I am doing fine.

15
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,453
Not me.

16
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,705
I am worried about you.

17
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,752
I worry that your husband's return

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,463
will have you bound to the left councilor.

19
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,466
I am worried you may be forced

20
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,095
to fulfill your duties as a wife.

21
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,141
You need not worry about that.

22
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,434
Until now,

23
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,981
it was not my choice
to live as a widow in mourning,

24
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,567
but from this point forward,

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,944
no one will dictate how I live my life.

26
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,657
My lady.

27
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,579
You are someone else's wife.

28
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,748
My lady…

29
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,921
Get a grip, Cho Yeo-hwa.

30
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,215
Snap out of it!

31
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,928
My lady.

32
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
A shabby-looking man
has entered the master's quarters.

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,935
Something feels suspicious.

34
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,977
At this hour?

35
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,065
I must find out who he is.

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,695
You look quite shabby.

37
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,323
Looking at the state of you

38
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,534
takes me back to when I first took you in.

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,621
I have never forgotten
your kindness, my lord.

40
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,915
Not even a little or for a single moment.

41
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,126
If you feel that way about me,

42
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,170
why did you run away?

43
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,632
I was not running away.
That would be absurd.

44
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,552
Who in this land of Joseon
would escape from your watchful eyes?

45
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:26,349
But there was something
that I had to do before I died,

46
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,226
so I could not help it.

47
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,108
So, what is it that you must do?

48
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,778
The son of the former King's Guard general
is still alive, my lord.

49
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,031
What?

50
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,867
Who is still alive?

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,203
It is

52
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,664
Im Gang's son.

53
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,124
How could he be?

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,003
It was Park Yun-hak.

55
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,463
Park Yun-hak took
the half-dead child that day

56
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,673
and saved his life.

57
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,343
Park Yun-hak's brother, Park Su-ho,

58
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,262
is Im Gang's son.

59
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,139
What did you say?

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,435
They knew everything
from the very beginning

61
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,687
and made a mockery of me.

62
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,650
They were hiding their claws
and waiting for the right moment.

63
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,737
Park Su-ho is looking into the events
from 15 years ago.

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,821
Lord Seok.

65
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,658
I will make sure to bring down
Park Su-ho and Park Yun-hak.

66
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,327
After I get rid of them,

67
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,703
I will

68
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,457
surrender my life to you, my lord.

69
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,514
Perhaps this was not Madam Oh's doing.

70
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,477
It could have been Park Yun-hak all along.

71
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,356
How dare he try to lure me out
with such a measly piece of bait?

72
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,951
Take this chance
to uproot the problem completely.

73
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,792
Who goes there?

74
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,922
A suspicious person has intruded.

75
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,507
Find him at all costs!

76
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,883
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

77
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,054
-Let's split up here.
-All right. I'll go this way!

78
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,055
It is so late!

79
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,681
Go look over there!

80
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,016
Let's go quickly!

81
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,427
What are you doing?

82
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,143
A suspicious person broke in,
so I was looking for him here.

83
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,879
What brings you here?

84
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,884
Why are you cleaning the discarded tablet?

85
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,597
Well, you see,

86
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,601
I am so used to doing this
before going to bed.

87
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,317
Squire!

88
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,825
Is this yours?

89
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,080
There is not much going on here.

90
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,124
-Be on your way.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,517
Sir!

92
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,812
-Sir, we have a big problem!
-What is the matter?

93
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
Kang Pil-jik entered
the left councilor's house,

94
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,525
so I stood guard at the front.

95
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,151
Kang Pil-jik is at the left councilor's?

96
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,028
That is not what is important now.

97
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,240
A stranger broke into their house,
and there was a huge commotion.

98
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,868
I will go to the house.
Keep pursuing Kang Pil-jik.

99
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,078
Yes!

100
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,125
What on earth are you doing here?

101
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,091
A suspicious person broke into the house.

102
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,717
Are you all right, my lady?

103
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,640
A suspicious person?

104
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,185
I guess they got away.

105
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,771
I see.

106
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,782
You should go on down first.

107
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,242
I will follow you shortly.

108
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,368
I must ask.

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,412
What is with your clothes?

110
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,748
Is it not peculiar?

111
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,377
-The thing is--
-Why are you back in your mourning dress?

112
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,425
I just cannot get used to this.
Why did I put this on?

113
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,759
The mourning dress,

114
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,929
and cleaning the tablet…

115
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,516
-Are you unhappy with my return?
-That is not true!

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,059
Then, are you happy?

117
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,859
You should put on your regular clothes
before coming out.

118
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,237
Mother will scold you if she finds out.

119
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,615
I will.

120
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,665
My lady.

121
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,127
You really are full of secrets.

122
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,012
What on earth is "seek"?

123
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,891
Why does he always speak such nonsense?

124
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,544
CAPITAL GUARD

125
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,841
Superintendent Park Su-ho!

126
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,223
That bastard Kang Pil-jik
beat them up like this!

127
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,224
Are you hurt badly?

128
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,683
I apologize, sir.

129
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,520
All these men showed up out of nowhere.

130
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,939
We lost Kang Pil-jik.

131
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,733
How dare he assault
the officers of the Capital Guard?

132
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,236
I will not let them get away with this!

133
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,654
Did you see their faces?

134
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,825
Do you remember the armed men
who locked up Kang Pil-jik last time?

135
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,535
It was them.

136
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,081
I need to find out
how much the left councilor knows.

137
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
Captain Hwang.

138
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,459
Yes?

139
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,169
I have something to tell you.

140
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,678
Those darn officers
kept following us around.

141
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,304
I feel much better now.

142
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,265
Should I take all of them out now?

143
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,476
Yes, we should.

144
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,980
Should we chase down Park Su-ho,
like last time?

145
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,401
Park Su-ho and the mask
must be taken down together.

146
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,613
Those scoundrels…

147
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,791
My lord.

148
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,877
Should we not capture that man

149
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,504
by reporting this
to the Capital Guard or police bureau?

150
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,924
I am worried
because you told us not to tell anyone.

151
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,053
Nothing was stolen, and nobody was hurt.

152
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,014
I will look into it quietly.

153
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,727
We cannot worry the people
by needlessly starting a rumor, can we?

154
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,729
But still…

155
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,070
Do not worry, my lady.

156
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,406
I will take care of everything.

157
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,576
Would I tolerate someone
who dared to break into the house

158
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,203
of the nation's left councilor?

159
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,836
I will see you later, my lady.

160
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,714
Lord Seok!

161
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,843
We heard that a masked individual
broke into your house last night.

162
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,263
I worried ominous rumors might
spread throughout the capital

163
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,891
and told everyone
not to report it to the Capital Guard.

164
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,269
How did you find out about it?

165
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,647
Are we not the Capital Guard?

166
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
You know what we are capable of!

167
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,151
We work endlessly, day and night,

168
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,736
to keep the capital safe.

169
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,113
It was only a matter of time
until one of our officers

170
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,407
spotted the masked figure
jumping over your wall.

171
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,868
Was anything missing from your residence?

172
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,119
No. Nothing was stolen.

173
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,289
Did anyone see the intruder
inside the house?

174
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,291
He tried to come into the master's room

175
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,545
but ran away as soon as I stepped outside.

176
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,090
The audacity!
How dare he target the left councilor?

177
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,634
-Why, I ought to--
-How about you, Lady Yoo?

178
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,970
Were you with the left councilor
at the time?

179
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,346
No, I was not.

180
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,642
I fell asleep early in the main house
and only found out about it later.

181
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,435
So then,

182
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,271
were you the only witness?

183
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,067
Listen, Captain Hwang.

184
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,653
Yes, my lord!

185
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,783
Since the Capital Guard is
so interested in the mask,

186
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
I will leave the investigation up to you.

187
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,704
However,

188
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,332
everyone in my household
only saw him running away,

189
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,627
so you will not find
any evidence in the house.

190
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,462
Yes, I understand.

191
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,756
I will catch that scoundrel by all means,

192
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,800
even if it takes scouring the whole city.

193
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,595
By the way,

194
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,639
do you think this masked figure

195
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,018
was the one who stole
the finance minister's painting?

196
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,021
We cannot make any assumptions.

197
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,647
But, I must ask.

198
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,902
Is there a reason why you think
they are the same person?

199
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,656
Should you really be
asking me that question?

200
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,368
The mask has been rampant
in the capital for so long.

201
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,788
How is it that you still have
no information on the culprit?

202
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,002
How could the Capital Guard be
so negligent

203
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,297
unless you are purposefully
letting him go free?

204
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,590
I apologize.

205
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,091
We will find him at all costs

206
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,930
and get to the bottom of
why he broke into your house.

207
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,891
You have just given me your word.

208
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,936
I hope you will stay true to your promise.

209
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,896
Yes, Lord Seok.

210
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,989
Please excuse me.

211
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,217
Are you all right, Captain?

212
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,597
Superintendent Park Su-ho!

213
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,682
I am

214
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,769
only helping out because you said
this was His will.

215
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,231
The left councilor is such a scary man.

216
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,025
He is absolutely terrifying!

217
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,113
Did you see the fire in his eyes?

218
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,991
What brings you here?

219
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,910
I am here for work.

220
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,286
What about you?

221
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,748
I live here.

222
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,920
Are you the left councilor's eldest son
who came back alive?

223
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,844
I did not mean
to keep my identity hidden for this long.

224
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,138
Let me introduce myself.

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,099
I am Seok Jeong.

226
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,853
Are you saying you are…

227
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,816
There is something I must tell you,
Superintendent.

228
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,861
But my wife is waiting for me.

229
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,197
Oh my, how lovely that must be!

230
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,365
Please go on in.

231
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,411
I will go to Myeongdo Inn in a bit.

232
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,787
So let us meet there.

233
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,297
How happy the left councilor's
daughter-in-law must be

234
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,967
that her handsome husband
has returned alive.

235
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,805
My lady.

236
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,893
The superintendent was here.

237
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,144
Is that so?

238
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,606
I must say, he is very quick-witted.

239
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,733
My lady.

240
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,779
You are someone else's wife.

241
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,448
-My lady…
-My lady.

242
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,533
That is quite enough.

243
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,452
Will you stop saying "my lady"?

244
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,919
If I cannot call my wife "my lady,"

245
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,004
what should I refer to you as?

246
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,173
Darling?

247
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,550
Honey?

248
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,679
Therefore, please continue.

249
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,765
That is music to my ears.

250
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,308
Honey.

251
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,438
Mother gave me permission
to go on an outing with you.

252
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,274
I am only used to staying home,

253
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,276
so I do not know
how to go out and have fun.

254
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,945
Therefore, I will continue

255
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,155
to work on my embroidery as usual.

256
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,074
Oh, what a shame.

257
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,284
Mother said to go out with you,

258
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,996
to buy you some pretty accessories
and enjoy the scenery.

259
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,206
That is too bad.

260
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,001
Then I will go to Myeongdo Inn--

261
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,294
If I do not go,

262
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,672
Mother might feel disappointed, right?

263
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,799
I will get ready.
Please wait just a little.

264
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,467
-Yeon-seon!
-Coming!

265
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,437
How could he be…

266
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,605
But wait.

267
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,024
Why does he want to meet me?

268
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,945
Is the head guildmaster in?

269
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,240
How rude!

270
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,075
Pardon my intrusion.

271
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,785
Could it be

272
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
that he saw her face then?

273
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,125
Brother?

274
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,962
I just sent a message to the Capital Guard
asking you to come here.

275
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,797
How did you get here before me?

276
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,215
I came to see someone briefly.

277
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,344
Lady Cho will not be here until tonight.

278
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,762
The two of you are here early.

279
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,975
Good thing I ran into you,
Head Guildmaster.

280
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,186
I have a question about Mr. Joo.

281
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,103
Head Guildmaster.

282
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,856
It has been a while.

283
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,159
Welcome.

284
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,660
It is good to see you again.

285
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,079
I did not know you were
the left councilor's son.

286
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,081
Please excuse my past insolence.

287
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,958
No.

288
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,461
I am sorry for not telling you in advance.

289
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,004
Thank you for everything.

290
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,048
What is going on now?

291
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,010
Is he the left councilor's eldest son?

292
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,097
Wait, Su-ho!

293
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,899
Why did you want to meet me here?

294
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,028
I would rather not talk in public.

295
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,613
Let's go elsewhere.

296
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,457
I happen to have a fine new coral hairpin.

297
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,708
Would you like to see it?

298
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,050
Come this way.

299
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,472
What are you trying to do?

300
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,395
Wait just one minute.

301
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,481
Did they just leave me here by myself?

302
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,241
I hope it did not seem rude,

303
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,618
but I wanted to see you
to ask you something.

304
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,330
I could not mention this to anyone else.

305
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,041
But I thought you might know

306
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,460
since it is your job to investigate.

307
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,879
What are you talking about?

308
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
I am suspicious

309
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,758
of my wife.

310
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,095
What do you mean?

311
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,348
The left councilor's daughter-in-law is
highly respected and wise.

312
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,268
No one would dare speak ill of her,
as far as I know.

313
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,480
The term "suspicious" does not suit her.

314
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,025
Do you know much about my wife?

315
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,071
You have returned to the capital
after 15 years.

316
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,740
It is your first time meeting your wife.

317
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,533
So, I am sure I know more than you.

318
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,371
Fine then.

319
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,709
Then, will you tell me about my wife?

320
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,799
Kang Pil-jik said
he was going to bring you down

321
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,551
along with the superintendent.

322
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,221
He will do whatever it takes
to achieve his goals.

323
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,891
He can rush in and kill you at any time.

324
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,100
You have to be careful.

325
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,436
I am the royal advisor, after all.

326
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,313
It would not be easy to kill me.

327
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,522
However,

328
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,277
it seems that Su-ho could become a target.

329
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,489
When I showed
the fabricated note to Father,

330
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,742
as if it was something
that had to be kept from me,

331
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,327
he rushed to hide it from me.

332
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,081
He must be trying to silence Madam Oh
for knowing too much

333
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,208
and doing whatever he can to prevent you

334
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,168
from pursuing him any further.

335
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,672
I understand the situation,
so I will prepare a countermeasure.

336
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
-As for the superintendent--
-Do not worry.

337
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,928
My brother should be able
to protect himself.

338
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,722
We do not know what kind of cowardly thing
Kang Pil-jik will do.

339
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,142
Are you worried about Su-ho?

340
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,272
Something could happen to him

341
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,525
that could jeopardize our mission.

342
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,156
I have nothing more to say.

343
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,492
Let me just ask you one thing.

344
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,082
Is it better for my wife to be your lover

345
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,918
or the masked assailant?

346
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,299
I pondered this all night

347
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,510
but could not find the answer.

348
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,559
And what would you do
if she was either of those two things?

349
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,147
I was not trying to threaten you.

350
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,692
I was letting you know in advance
that I was thinking

351
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,319
about what I should do next.

352
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,949
Before you ask me such a question,

353
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,243
why not try to understand her first?

354
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,039
If you understood who she is
and where her heart lies,

355
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,292
I am sure

356
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,586
that you wouldn't judge her
like you are now.

357
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,477
I need to speak
with Lady Cho for a moment.

358
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,412
What is going on?

359
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,290
Are you sure you are okay?

360
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,127
The left councilor's son
asked me about your identity.

361
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,421
So, he noticed.

362
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,299
I was in a rush yesterday
and could not get changed in time.

363
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,051
How can you be so calm?

364
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,347
I have been worried all along

365
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,099
that he might be as despicable
as the finance minister

366
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,227
or as ruthless as the left councilor.

367
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,104
You worry too much.

368
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,149
If he were like that,
would I just sit back and take it?

369
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,903
I also worried
that he might be a desirable man

370
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,446
to all the women in the capital.

371
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,286
What you should worry about now
is your safety, sir.

372
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,664
Kang Pil-jik is coming after you.

373
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,709
The royal advisor told me not to worry,

374
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,879
but didn't you collapse
in front of Kang Pil-jik?

375
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,216
I suddenly had a headache at that time.

376
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,510
You must be careful.

377
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,931
Are you

378
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,891
worried about me?

379
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,272
Of course I am.

380
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,690
We are…

381
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,068
on the same side.

382
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,532
I may not be the best swordsman in Joseon,

383
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,492
but I am about the third best,

384
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,077
so do not worry.

385
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,956
I will take your word for it.

386
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,925
Have an apple.

387
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,226
How I missed this taste!

388
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,562
There are no apples like these in Qing.

389
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,107
These are precious apples sent
from Cheongsong for the Peony Society.

390
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,609
The head guildmaster
especially gave them to us.

391
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,112
This is an apple fit for a king!

392
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,698
So what you are saying is

393
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,701
that the mask is not a villain
but a hero, right?

394
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,747
They give rice to starving families
and also bring them food.

395
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,831
And that is not all.

396
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,833
One time, they gave rice to an old man

397
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,170
who was unjustly almost beaten to death,
and punished the nobleman.

398
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,173
That is truly admirable.

399
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,134
We should have
really laid into that nobleman back then.

400
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,471
People call Lady Cho
the legendary altruist--

401
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,555
Hwal-yu!

402
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,599
Have this one, too.

403
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,934
It is so deliciously red.

404
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,273
So that is how she lived

405
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,817
throughout all those years.

406
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,322
By the way, I heard you are
suffering from amnesia.

407
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,117
That is right.

408
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,535
I was suffering from it, but…

409
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,372
I need to get going now.

410
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,208
I will tell you more about it later.

411
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,585
Hwal-yu.

412
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,045
Have mine, too.

413
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,468
So,

414
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,261
did you like the hairpin?

415
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,097
Yes.

416
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,682
Let us go.

417
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,277
Goodness.

418
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,948
The mask that helps the poor
in the capital.

419
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,951
The legendary altruist of the night

420
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,662
who has been jumping over walls
for years on end.

421
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,124
Yesterday, when I heard
an intruder broke in,

422
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,667
I assumed it was real.

423
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,544
But who knows?

424
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,796
Maybe it was the legendary altruist.

425
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,885
So, what if it was the altruist?

426
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,722
Is it all right for him
to break into Father's home?

427
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,224
Who knows what he was getting up to?

428
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,602
I heard he was righteous.
I do not believe he would harm anyone.

429
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,896
I am sure he was there for a reason.

430
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,609
I heard you lost your memory
and had your fair share of trouble.

431
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,320
I guess you still do not know
how scary life can be.

432
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,075
You speak as if you are aware
of all the horrors of the world

433
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,454
even though you were a widow
trapped in my father's house.

434
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,502
I like people who are admirable.

435
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,383
So, I hope this masked legendary altruist

436
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,052
does not ever get caught.

437
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,610
I see what you mean.

438
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,321
Here comes the royal advisor.

439
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,039
I heard your family is celebrating
a joyous occasion.

440
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,582
Congratulations, Left Councilor.

441
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,750
Thank you.

442
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,837
I plan to hold
a light tea party in two days.

443
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,839
A tea party, Your Majesty?

444
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,801
The left councilor's dead son
has come back to us alive.

445
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,471
I wish to share in his joy.

446
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,390
That is a wonderful idea, sire.

447
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,019
Your Majesty.

448
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,396
The nation is going through a rough time.

449
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,567
There is no need to concern yourself
with my personal household matters.

450
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,237
Indeed, the capital is quite troubled.

451
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,826
But it would be a shame
to simply let it pass.

452
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,621
I simply wish to see everyone
and share a quick cup of tea,

453
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,541
so please bring your wife, son,

454
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,001
and your daughter-in-law, Left Councilor.

455
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,755
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,062
CAPITAL GUARD

457
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,028
Are you all right?

458
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,033
What happened? Were you beaten severely?

459
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,703
What brings you here?

460
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,663
When a man undertakes a big project,

461
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,999
he might face setbacks now and then.

462
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,292
Why are you so downcast?

463
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,378
It is because my pride as an officer

464
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,714
has been wounded.

465
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,804
Eat this, feel better,
and pay them back for what they did.

466
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,473
You will never get better
by being so down.

467
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,476
My lady…

468
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,480
Will the captain go hungry today?

469
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,648
Hey!

470
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,488
Did I not seem like
wife material just now?

471
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,241
I heard that men go crazy
for someone like that.

472
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,370
Were you? I am not so sure.

473
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,039
Bi-chan.

474
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,957
Yes, Captain Hwang.

475
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,629
I appreciate all the hard work
you are doing.

476
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,341
Go on in.

477
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,928
Superintendent Park is waiting for you.

478
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,304
Yes, sir.

479
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,976
Why are you so late?

480
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,103
I thought I was going to die of hunger.

481
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,900
No way. This is Bi-chan's.

482
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,860
Bi-chan's?

483
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,451
Are you going home already?

484
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,830
I am a bit tired today,
so I will go home early to rest.

485
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,583
Yes, I hope you get some rest.

486
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,001
Good work today.

487
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,020
Who are you?

488
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,164
You are scaring me again!

489
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,958
So you were saying,

490
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,461
the resurrected tablet said…

491
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,423
My lady.

492
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,300
I am craving Kkon-nim's dried persimmons
and cannot sleep.

493
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,344
Please get some for me, will you?

494
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,181
Mother will scold me
for making you run errands,

495
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,726
so be discreet
and do not let her find out.

496
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,107
Did he really ask you to run
such a ridiculous errand?

497
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,567
Why?

498
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,403
He probably suspects
that I have nightly duties.

499
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,405
But how did he know?

500
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,033
Please do not tell me

501
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,828
that the tablet knows about your identity.

502
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,374
If Madam Oh tells me
about my brother tonight,

503
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,084
I plan to leave tomorrow.

504
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,717
What will you do if Kang Pil-jik tries
to kill Madam Oh again?

505
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,721
That is why
I am preparing myself like this.

506
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,102
Do not worry.

507
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,604
Be careful.

508
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,524
I am dying to know
the altruist's identity.

509
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,984
Please just tell me that.

510
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,487
Please, sir!

511
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,489
-Please tell me.
-I cannot.

512
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,948
Honestly, I think…

513
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,206
Let me see it.

514
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,588
COME ALONE IF YOU WISH TO SAVE
THE HEAD GUILDMASTER

515
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,340
Sir, what will you do?

516
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,136
Find Captain Hwang now
and ask to send officers to Pil Inn.

517
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,554
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,015
Bi-chan. Make sure
nothing has happened to Madam Oh.

519
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,352
Are you going to Pil Inn
by yourself right now?

520
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,895
Let me come with you.

521
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,731
We do not know
what Kang Pil-jik is plotting.

522
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,525
Madam Oh's safety must come first.

523
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,276
Yes, sir!

524
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,119
Welcome, sir.

525
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,703
Please come this way.

526
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,423
PIL INN

527
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,239
-Are you okay?
-Sir!

528
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,575
Let's get out of here.

529
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,125
Welcome, Superintendent!

530
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,302
The Capital Guard are on their way.

531
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,221
You will be arrested anyway.

532
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,182
So, why get hurt in the process?

533
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,517
Even if I get arrested,

534
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,855
I must kill you and the mask
with my own hands.

535
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,318
Where is the mask?

536
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,987
You will not see them until you die.

537
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:44,577
I am so curious to find out
about the rascal's identity.

538
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,538
I should have thought of it sooner.

539
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,167
Why didn't I take
the head guildmaster hostage earlier?

540
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,813
Let her go!

541
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,565
If you wish to save her,

542
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,277
lay down your sword.

543
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,058
I should have killed you then!

544
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,526
-Lady Jang, are you all right?
-Yes.

545
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,950
Stop!

546
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,952
Im Hyeon-jae.

547
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,037
Is this not the same as 15 years ago?

548
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,916
Your father, reputed to be
the best swordsman in Joseon,

549
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,628
could not even take a proper swing
and died for your life.

550
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,508
Put down your sword.

551
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,761
That person has nothing to do with me.

552
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,430
So, just kill me!

553
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,016
Didn't you hear what I said?

554
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,479
No, you cannot!

555
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,566
You are all going to die anyway.

556
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,110
Why are you being so desperate?

557
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,783
Do you remember the first time we met?

558
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,912
I remember everything
from that night vividly.

559
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,873
I hope you remember it, too.

560
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,875
-What on earth are you--
-Do you recall

561
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,337
the way you acted when you first saw me?

562
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,964
I have had enough of your nonsense!

563
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,049
Drop the sword!

564
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,842
Yes, I will!

565
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,125
Capital Guard! Do not move!

566
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,923
Arrest everyone!

567
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,383
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

568
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,929
Sir!

569
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,139
By the way,

570
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,183
where is the legendary--

571
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,811
Lower your voice.

572
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,274
You despicable scoundrels.

573
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,489
-Take them away!
-Yes, sir!

574
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,962
What happened?

575
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,256
So, let me explain.

576
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,551
I was just about to enter
the finance minister's house.

577
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,805
Are you not
the superintendent's subordinate?

578
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,765
The legendary altruist?

579
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,601
Why are you here by yourself?

580
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,023
Did something happen
to the superintendent?

581
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,278
Oh, my legendary altruist!

582
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,488
There is a problem!

583
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,576
Thank goodness I ran into the altruist.

584
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,202
That was a close call.

585
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,704
Why must you be so disobedient?

586
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,707
Do you know how dangerous
that could have been?

587
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,168
The altruist saved you, didn't they?

588
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,545
Now I know for sure.

589
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,548
The legendary altruist is a little bit

590
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,216
stronger than you.

591
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,844
That punk.

592
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,811
My lord.

593
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,522
Kang Pil-jik has been arrested
by the Capital Guard.

594
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,401
-You can leave now.
-Yes.

595
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,331
Go immediately

596
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,792
and arrest Madam Oh,
the former finance minister's wife.

597
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,590
Oh Nan-gyeong!
Come out and receive the king's orders!

598
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,093
Search the premises thoroughly!

599
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,720
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

600
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,259
Your Majesty.

601
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:36,178
Is it true that you ordered
the intelligence bureau

602
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,805
to arrest Madam Oh?

603
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,267
That is correct.

604
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:46,146
I did not want to wake you
too early in the morning,

605
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,483
so I made the decision on my own.

606
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,362
Your Majesty, how could you make
such an important decision by yourself?

607
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:57,866
Since you were so sure
that the relief grains had been embezzled,

608
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,493
I wished to personally oversee

609
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,371
the investigation of Madam Oh
to expose her crimes.

610
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,667
I told you that the queen dowager
could be involved in this.

611
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,460
If a crime has been committed,

612
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,215
I will not make an exception,
even for my mother.

613
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,967
However,

614
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,762
if you dared to slander
my innocent mother,

615
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,976
you should also be punished accordingly.

616
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,603
Your Majesty.

617
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:30,357
Did you really think that you could
accomplish something like that alone?

618
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,567
Left Councilor.

619
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,572
I am still the king of this nation.

620
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,908
Are you rebuking me for giving an order

621
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,328
that I rightfully gave
as the nation's ruler?

622
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,919
You gave such a bold order, for once.

623
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,173
But hasn't Madam Oh already run away?

624
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,551
You finally showed your claws,

625
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
but now you just look like a kitten.

626
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,725
Your honor has been tarnished,
Your Majesty.

627
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,868
He is a tough nut to crack.

628
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,328
What a piece of work!

629
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,664
He will not say a word.

630
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,124
Allow me to try, Captain.

631
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,751
No need.

632
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,838
I have seen a lot of men like that
during my ten years at the Capital Guard.

633
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,051
Those types will never confess
if you keep pressing them.

634
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,138
No one should interrogate him today.

635
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,431
Just let him be.

636
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,935
Has there been any news on Madam Oh yet?

637
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,939
Didn't she almost die last time?

638
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,651
Perhaps she has finally croaked
without anyone noticing.

639
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,987
I wonder if that is what has happened.

640
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,450
We have not found anything out
about Madam Oh.

641
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,744
That is troubling.

642
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,581
But we still have Kang Pil-jik.

643
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:15,045
There is one sure way
we can make him talk.

644
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:33,063
Have you come here after hearing the news?

645
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,280
What is going on?

646
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,532
Now that Madam Oh has disappeared,

647
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,035
will I never be able
to learn about my brother?

648
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,124
I will personally ask my father-in-law.

649
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,126
I must find out,
even if I have to threaten him.

650
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,211
This is no time to act in haste.

651
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,924
His Majesty will be hosting
a tea party tomorrow.

652
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,595
He invited the left councilor
and all of the family.

653
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,974
Whatever unfolds
between His Majesty and the councilor,

654
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,603
you must never interfere, feign knowledge,

655
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,647
or undermine His Majesty's will.

656
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,316
What do you mean by that?

657
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,652
I cannot tell you everything right now,

658
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,154
but I kindly implore you.

659
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,598
I am very glad we have come together
for such a joyous occasion.

660
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,562
The royal advisor also wanted
to meet the left councilor's son,

661
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,147
so I called him to join us.

662
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,198
My son has much to learn.

663
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,785
I am honored to meet you, Your Majesty.

664
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,334
You look just like the left councilor.

665
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,587
Do you share
similar personalities as well?

666
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,465
No.

667
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,719
I seem to resemble my gentle mother.

668
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,894
How joyful you must be
to have your son return

669
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,647
after he had been presumed dead
for such a long time.

670
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,357
Yes, Your Majesty.

671
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,610
It still feels like a dream.

672
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,196
As I witness this joyous occasion,

673
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,824
I am reminded of my father,

674
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,368
who passed away 15 years ago.

675
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,079
If only my father

676
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,124
could also come back to us from the dead…

677
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,424
You must be freed from all your worries

678
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,051
now that your husband has returned.

679
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,637
Your Majesty.

680
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,557
I have a brother

681
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,060
that I have been waiting
for 15 years to return.

682
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,687
Oh, is that so?

683
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,358
Why do you speak of
such private matters to His Majesty?

684
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,611
Please do not scold her.

685
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,406
My heart aches
as if it were my own problem.

686
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,116
Left Councilor.

687
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,994
I will do my best to help you,

688
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,997
so please find her brother.

689
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,458
Yes, Your Majesty.

690
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,711
I will also search for him by all means.

691
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,550
Records of human trafficking…

692
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,514
piles of documents to prove
the embezzlement of relief grains…

693
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,770
and evidence of bribing
the finance minister's wife.

694
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,611
You tried to kidnap and murder
the head guildmaster before my eyes.

695
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,907
-And you also tried to kill me.
-That I did.

696
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,868
Kang Pil-jik.

697
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,247
As a Capital Guard superintendent,

698
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,792
it will not be easy for me
to punish you legally.

699
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,127
So,

700
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,421
I will have to employ another method.

701
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,264
What do you think you are doing?

702
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,935
Are you going to personally execute me
on the Capital Guard's grounds?

703
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,353
There is no need for me

704
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,606
to treat you as Park Su-ho.

705
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,483
I can treat you as Im Hyeon-jae.

706
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,694
Get out!

707
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,736
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

708
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,780
What? Where are you going?

709
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,783
Where is the captain? Get Captain Hwang!

710
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,244
Let's just end it here.

711
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,498
Wait!

712
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,749
Wait a second.

713
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,091
I invited one more special guest
to this happy occasion.

714
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,636
A special guest, sire?

715
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,390
You will be very pleased
to see the guest, Left Councilor.

716
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,686
-Have her come in.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

717
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,944
Your Majesty.

718
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,571
What on earth is--

719
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,907
You must be quite surprised.

720
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,367
I apologize for
not informing you in advance.

721
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,286
Your Majesty.

722
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,788
All this time,

723
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,998
my shortcomings have caused

724
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,543
so much trouble for the queen dowager.

725
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,962
Please forgive me, sire.

726
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,924
It was also my fault for not knowing

727
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,760
what kind of person you truly were.

728
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,805
To atone for my sins against Your Majesty…

729
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:43,850
and also

730
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,270
to extend my congratulations…

731
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,071
to the left councilor
for this joyous occasion,

732
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,907
I have prepared a special tea.

733
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,103
This is the tea
that I offered on the night

734
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,438
when His Majesty
the late king passed away.

735
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,317
Do you remember, my lord?

736
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,364
How should I know that?

737
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,842
It was an order
you personally gave me, Left Councilor.

738
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,345
How could you have already forgotten?

739
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,889
I feel disappointed.

740
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,183
Did the left councilor order you

741
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,186
to offer this tea to my father?

742
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,856
Yes, Your Majesty.

743
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,110
If you take a sip of the tea,

744
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,695
it might jog your memory.

745
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,998
I am curious,
so please prepare it quickly.

746
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,382
I am Capital Guard Superintendent Park.

747
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,134
I have an urgent report for Your Majesty.

748
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,809
What brings you here?

749
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,566
This tea has such a special aroma.

750
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,861
Left Councilor.
Can you still not remember it?

751
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,114
I cannot remember at all, sire.

752
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,452
Well, I suppose I have no other choice.

753
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,207
I will first grant this cup
to the left councilor's son.

754
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,627
He is the main guest
of the day, after all.

755
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,155
Please have a drink.

756
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,911
Your Majesty.

757
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,456
This is the only way we have left.

758
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,337
I am deeply grateful to Your Majesty.

759
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,839
Very well.

760
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,552
I will gladly resort to cowardly tricks

761
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,430
to prove that the left councilor
murdered my father.

762
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,686
Surely, no father would want
to witness his son die before him.

763
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,460
Your Majesty!

764
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,422
How could the son be the first

765
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,009
to drink such a precious drink?

766
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,470
This is not your place
to dare voice your opinion!

767
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,224
Your daughter-in-law must be nervous

768
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,519
since it is her first time here.

769
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,687
I apologize.

770
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:07,650
My daughter-in-law has only learned
household rules for dealing with elders

771
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,111
and is unfamiliar with palace etiquette.

772
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,988
Please forgive her, sire.

773
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,532
Do not worry about it.

774
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,036
I have a special intent for today.

775
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,330
Left Councilor.

776
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,584
Would it be all right if I offered the tea

777
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,961
to your son first?

778
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,676
How could I go
against Your Majesty's will?

779
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,304
Do as you wish, Your Majesty.

780
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:51,319
Then, I will drink the tea first.

781
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,876
-Wait--
-Stop!

782
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,884
That is enough.

783
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:20,974
We can stop this.

784
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,608
Left Councilor.

785
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,653
You are truly remarkable.

786
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:40,159
I did not expect you
to be so cruel to your own son.

787
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,288
Your Majesty.

788
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,873
Madam Oh does not belong in this palace.

789
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,042
She should be in the interrogation hall!

790
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,628
Why did you call in
a criminal who deserves death

791
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,964
and entertain her nonsense?

792
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,216
Look here!

793
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,386
Take Madam Oh out of here right now!

794
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,387
Yes!

795
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,764
I am a criminal.

796
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,474
Fifteen years ago…

797
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,396
by the left councilor's order,

798
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,064
I offered this tea

799
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,191
to His Majesty the late king--

800
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,947
I poisoned him to death.

801
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,242
MURDER BY POISON

802
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,827
The tea contains…

803
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,456
a poisonous flower.

804
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:36,257
Did you just say
that you offered poison to His Majesty?

805
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,593
What are you waiting for?

806
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,721
Drag Madam Oh out immediately!

807
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,015
Be quiet, Left Councilor!

808
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,395
Since you did not even spare
your child's life,

809
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,066
I have no choice…

810
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,862
but to prove your actions.

811
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,243
Do not!

812
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,508
Your Majesty.

813
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,386
Before I came here,

814
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,347
I had already…

815
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,145
The tea…

816
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,567
-Madam!
-You there!

817
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,653
Call for a physician. Right now!

818
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,321
Madam!

819
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,073
Call a physician. Now!

820
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,493
Madam?

821
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,994
Lady Cho…

822
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,623
Poor Lady Cho…

823
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,795
I truly believed
I would lead a precious life.

824
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,297
I felt wronged,

825
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,301
believing that others had ruined my life.

826
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:03,970
However,

827
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,139
looking back on it now,

828
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,974
I now see

829
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,102
that I ruined everything myself.

830
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,854
Do not speak.

831
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,480
The poison is spreading.

832
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,859
Lady Cho…

833
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,701
Your brother has

834
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,620
already died

835
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,373
at the left councilor's hands.

836
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:58,191
