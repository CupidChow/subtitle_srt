1
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,170
Good evening, Superintendent.

2
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,797
Pardon me for visiting so late.

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,092
We are closed for the day.
Are you looking for something?

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,261
So… I was just…

5
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,221
Is he here… I mean,

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,182
has the individual visited recently?

7
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,186
Oh, are you looking for the person
who entrusted Kkon-nim to me?

8
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,854
I have a message for them.

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,689
They are not here right now.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,817
Then, will you relay this message?

11
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,778
Please tell them not to make
any hasty moves,

12
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,404
as the Capital Guard will resolve
this case.

13
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,532
-Especially with Kang Pil-jik--
-But, Superintendent.

14
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,286
They have already left.

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,829
What?

16
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,174
Jackpot!

17
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,813
PIL INN

18
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,197
I told you that this was a job
for the Capital Guard.

19
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,700
How did you know I was here?

20
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,410
That is not important now.

21
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,953
This is no place for you to come alone.

22
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,208
My goodness…

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,178
-Are you all right?
-Wake up.

24
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,556
You must wake up.

25
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,100
Are you all right?

26
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,144
Can you hear me?

27
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,731
Why are all the guards passed out?

28
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,900
Let us see what is going on inside.

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,449
What on earth?

30
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,035
Who untied you?

31
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,475
Lady Cho!

32
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,311
Who is this man?

33
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,521
I will explain later. Take the kids first.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,149
Be careful.

35
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,859
Where are we going?

36
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,694
Are you taking us home?

37
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,450
Watch your step.

38
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,534
Get in.

39
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,121
Careful, now.

40
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,624
You have to stay quiet, all right?

41
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,708
-We will.
-We will.

42
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,721
Where are you taking the children?

43
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,200
Darn it!

44
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,079
Find those rats and bring back the goods!

45
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,205
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

46
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,256
I asked you
what you are planning to do with the kids.

47
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,843
I will send them to a safe place.

48
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,887
The children are witnesses.
You cannot just send them away.

49
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,640
-I must take them to the Capital Guard--
-No, you cannot.

50
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,976
I found them, so I will take them.

51
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,353
How can you be so reckless?

52
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,732
Are you not worried
that I could arrest you immediately?

53
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,400
If we delayed any further,

54
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,610
they would have been sold off
and lost forever.

55
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,238
That is why this case must be investigated
and resolved!

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,365
My resolution is
to keep the children safe.

57
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,868
Kang Pil-jik must be punished
by the law of the nation.

58
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,454
That is how this case will be resolved.

59
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,042
Are you sure he will be punished

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,211
if the children are
brought in as witnesses?

61
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,798
Can you stop him
from ever doing this again?

62
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,468
Can you guarantee
the safety of those children?

63
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,845
Will they be able
to return to their normal lives?

64
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,599
I know that we have laws,
the Capital Guard, and the police bureau.

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,100
But what good do they serve?

66
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,102
Can you really say
that they are protecting

67
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,896
all the defenseless people I have seen?

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,855
That is…

69
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,232
Carry on
with your investigation, Superintendent.

70
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,569
I will continue to do what I can.

71
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:09,660
Are you not afraid
of getting your identity exposed?

72
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,456
If you want to arrest me,

73
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,708
you can do so now.

74
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,506
What did you just say?

75
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,299
-We apologize, sir.
-We apologize, sir.

76
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,730
On top of letting the children escape,
you lost the mask as well as Park Su-ho?

77
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,692
I dare you to speak again.

78
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,943
Please forgive me!

79
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,740
I am unbelievably generous.

80
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,453
I have taken in you morons
to be my subordinates.

81
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,415
I wish I could just cut
our ties right here.

82
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,001
-I am sorry--
-I was only gone for a moment!

83
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,919
How could you mess this up so badly?

84
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,222
Get rid of everyone involved immediately.

85
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

86
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,600
And you!

87
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,437
For now, do not do anything
that would give away your involvement.

88
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,355
Remember to be discreet

89
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,608
and find where the mask is!

90
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,568
Yes, sir. I will.

91
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,961
Brother.

92
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,714
Where have you been this late at night?

93
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,841
Are you worried about me?

94
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,760
Why should I be?

95
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,226
It is good to see you twice in one day.

96
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,188
You look as if you have
just been scolded by someone.

97
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,026
How did you notice?

98
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,694
Wait, did you really get scolded?

99
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,033
Brother.

100
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,494
Would you like to have a drink?

101
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,465
Is that a person or a ghost?

102
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,685
The finance minister's daughter-in-law?

103
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,898
What?

104
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,320
Are you all right, my lady?

105
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,738
Yong-deok…

106
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,037
I am fine.

107
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,482
Brother.

108
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,736
You know what I went through as a child.

109
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,238
So, why did you and Father take me in

110
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,658
when you knew the risk
of accepting me into your family?

111
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,789
I do not remember
everything that happened,

112
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,791
but you held onto my hand

113
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,503
regardless of the circumstances
or the risks that were involved.

114
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,673
You did not seem
to care about that at all.

115
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,261
What are you talking about?

116
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,555
I do not remember doing that.

117
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,060
Even though you continued
to be distant from me ever since,

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,397
the warmth of your clasped hands kept me
from being upset with you.

119
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,440
Su-ho.

120
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,983
-I want you to--
-I know.

121
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,944
I know that you are being like this

122
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,614
because no one must know that I am alive

123
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,701
or find out who my father is.

124
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,246
You have been living quietly
as I wished until now.

125
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,706
So, why the sudden change of heart?

126
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,134
I happen to have become acquainted
with someone.

127
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,137
With whom?

128
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,728
Are you not afraid
of getting your identity exposed?

129
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,440
Of course I am. It is terrifying.

130
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,818
Why would I be immune to fear?

131
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,529
Can you stop him
from ever doing this again?

132
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,989
Was I too harsh?

133
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,632
Why would he stare at me like that?

134
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,395
I did not see anything. I saw nothing!

135
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,815
Instructions for Women says,
"Do not spy on others' secrets

136
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,692
and do not tell on others' faults…"

137
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,696
Oh, just forget it!

138
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,752
Actually,

139
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,548
I do not really know who it is.

140
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,885
You got my hopes up for nothing.

141
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,307
Anyway, what that person stands for is
similar to the warmth I felt

142
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,476
when you held my hand that day.

143
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,103
I do not know what you are talking about.

144
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,939
That is right! The person is so daring.

145
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,275
I am amazed by what they can accomplish.

146
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,612
And I cannot figure out
what is going on in their head.

147
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,240
But sometimes, they act so quickly
that I wonder if they even think at all.

148
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,369
And every time they speak,
they are always right.

149
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,996
It is driving me crazy!

150
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,836
So, who is this person?

151
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,298
I am a Capital Guard superintendent.

152
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,842
But I could not do it.

153
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,178
I could not say anything back.

154
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,804
So, to whom?

155
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,641
Do you know what?

156
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,020
I will do everything I can
to bring down Kang Pil-jik!

157
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,363
I did not realize until now
how much of a lightweight you were.

158
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,911
And I also learned something
about you today.

159
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,081
I did not know
you were so good at drinking.

160
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,515
So, who is this person you speak of?

161
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,230
I am not going to tell you.

162
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,862
I am dying to find out too!

163
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,363
Find out about what?

164
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,285
What kind of a person they are…

165
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,703
Who are you talking about?

166
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,124
I bet you want to know!

167
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,713
Park Su-ho!

168
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,010
What on earth have I done?

169
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,595
My thoughts exactly.

170
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,139
How are you feeling, sir?

171
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,475
-When did you get here?
-Last night.

172
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,105
How could you do that to me?

173
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,649
You made me search for evidence
for two days straight

174
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,027
while you were drinking
with the defense secretary.

175
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,821
And why did you not tell me
that Kang Pil-jik was released?

176
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,450
So, did you find anything?

177
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,996
You went to report to the captain
while you were plastered yesterday.

178
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,665
He told you not to go near Kang Pil-jik

179
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,001
and said that if you did anything stupid…

180
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,383
Do you know
that you have been acting strange lately?

181
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,969
What do you mean?

182
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,308
"I am dying to find out

183
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,603
what kind of a person they are."

184
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,480
Did I say that to you too?

185
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:44,234
There's been trouble around every corner
ever since we came to Hanyang.

186
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,072
We have a big problem!

187
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,202
-Minister Yeom has passed away!
-Pardon?

188
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,038
My lord? Lord Yeom!

189
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,624
Please open your eyes!

190
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,126
An earth-shattering event has taken place
last night.

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,461
Lord Yeom!

192
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:08,509
How could such a heinous thing happen
in the middle of the capital?

193
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,135
And why did it have to be now

194
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,389
when I am the captain
of the Capital Guard?

195
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,182
He was well until yesterday.

196
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,102
Yes, he was. He was quite well!

197
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,855
And someone has killed
such a healthy person!

198
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,608
-Someone killed him?
-Was he murdered?

199
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,570
Did you expect such a hearty man
to fall gravely ill overnight?

200
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,072
Who would do such a thing?

201
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,740
Would I be here if I knew…

202
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,618
Wait a minute.

203
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,914
Were you not very close
with the finance minister?

204
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,420
Do not just stand there.
Go to the scene and find the culprit.

205
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,423
You must best the police bureau!

206
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,550
Are we investigating this too?

207
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,968
Of course we are.

208
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,639
"I am dying to find out

209
00:16:55,723 --> 00:17:00,060
-what kind of a person they are!"
-"…what kind of a person they are!"

210
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,024
I said that to you too, Captain?

211
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,818
I am dying to know who killed him too.

212
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,612
-So, let us go now. Lead the way!
-Yes, sir!

213
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,167
By now, the children would have left

214
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,210
for the Hwayeon Guild
in Hamgyeong Province.

215
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,505
Right. That is a relief.

216
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,721
Why did you sigh like that?

217
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,600
It was nothing, really.

218
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,310
It was nothing, and?

219
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,814
The superintendent appeared.

220
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,524
-Again?
-I know.

221
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,736
I do not know how he knew,
but he just showed up.

222
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,821
Was he there
to rescue the children as well?

223
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
I also think that was the reason,

224
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,326
but he said he was going
to take them as witnesses.

225
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,328
So, what did you say?

226
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,538
"No way! Mind your own business!

227
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,207
Do not interfere with my work!"

228
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,042
Did you really say that to him?

229
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,211
What in the world?

230
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,005
What if the superintendent
really arrests you?

231
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,093
So I said, "If you want to arrest me,
arrest me right now!"

232
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,056
My goodness.

233
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,894
I do not think he will actually arrest me.

234
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,314
But on the other hand,
he may be considering it.

235
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,358
What if he really does?

236
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,360
What if he finds out who you are?

237
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,321
That is why I am a little bit worried.

238
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,616
Just by a little bit.

239
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,327
A little bit?

240
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,955
Only by a little bit?

241
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,790
It is making my knees tremble!

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,085
Seriously, Lady Cho.

243
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,421
Why do you neglect yourself so much?

244
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,926
Yeon-seon…

245
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,557
Lady Cho!

246
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,479
Lady Yoo says to get ready quickly
to leave for a condolence visit.

247
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,148
A condolence visit?

248
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,360
Yes, the finance minister has passed away
last night.

249
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,743
NO ENTRY

250
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,331
How could this have happened?

251
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,542
Thank you for coming.

252
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,961
This has happened all too suddenly.

253
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,796
You must be feeling devastated.

254
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,215
That would be an understatement.

255
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,759
I cannot contain

256
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,095
this feeling of bitter grief.

257
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,600
The Capital Guard will catch
the culprit at all costs.

258
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,352
The police bureau has begun
its investigation.

259
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,270
By the way,

260
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,440
it is awful enough
that he passed away so suddenly.

261
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,067
Is a postmortem exam necessary?

262
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,904
Did the police bureau say
they would do so?

263
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,073
What are you doing?

264
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,577
Get inside immediately
and keep a close eye on the bureau

265
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,871
to ensure they do not make any mistakes!

266
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,914
Yes, sir.

267
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,822
How dare you show up here?

268
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,908
You bastard!

269
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,439
Hand me that silver hairpin.

270
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,514
You were so quick to get here.

271
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,141
That was what I wanted to say.

272
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,062
Did you have to bring
your daughter-in-law here?

273
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,441
As the old saying goes,
in times of a great feast,

274
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,987
you have a thousand companions around you,
but when faced with urgent challenges,

275
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,281
there is no one around by your side.

276
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,160
Madam Oh has long admired
your daughter-in-law,

277
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,163
yet you have chosen not to bring her
to this tragic occasion

278
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,332
just because she is a widow.

279
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,419
-Let us go in.
-Yes, Mother.

280
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,968
NO ENTRY

281
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,651
There it is again.

282
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,905
An ice-cold blizzard
that cuts through the battlefield.

283
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,956
Thank you for coming.

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,666
You must be so devastated.

285
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,169
I am sorry for your sudden loss.

286
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,755
I cannot find the words
to truly comfort you.

287
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,094
I see you have joined us.

288
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,805
The sudden news was so…

289
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,143
surprising.

290
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,774
An investigation is underway
by the Capital Guard and the police.

291
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,526
So, there is a bit of a commotion.

292
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,445
How dare someone do this to Minister Yeom?

293
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,740
Please, sir!

294
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,909
It was not me.

295
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,452
I did not do that, sir!

296
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,162
-Sir!
-Bring him over here!

297
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,747
-Sir!
-Get him on his knees!

298
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
Yong-deok…

299
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,628
My lady!

300
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,051
He is the murderer.

301
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,762
I did not kill Lord Yeom!

302
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,515
This man is a family servant.

303
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,812
Why do you say that he is the culprit?

304
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,439
The circumstantial evidence indicated
an inside job.

305
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,441
We searched the servants' quarters,

306
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,235
and this man…

307
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,696
had this in his possession.

308
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,325
This is…

309
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,662
Lord Yeom's ring.

310
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,746
I am sure of it.

311
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,500
That ring belongs to me.

312
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,379
Madam, please look at it closely.

313
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,006
That is really mine.

314
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,886
If so, where did you get the ring?

315
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,512
That is…

316
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
It was…

317
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,976
According to another servant,

318
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,937
he left his room last night
and did not return until dawn.

319
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,565
What did you do last night?

320
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,194
I did not go anywhere
near the master's quarters last night.

321
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,446
You must have a witness
to confirm that statement.

322
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,156
Do you have one?

323
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,037
Well, you see…

324
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,140
I apologize.

325
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,516
You see, the thing is,

326
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,936
the cold weather has got me coughing,
you see.

327
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,986
How dare you?

328
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,155
How could you do such a thing?

329
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,782
Please, Madam Oh.

330
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,493
How could you betray my husband like this?

331
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,995
He took you in
and looked after you in this house!

332
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,416
Please believe me.

333
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,712
I have only spoken
the truth to you, Madam.

334
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,339
How dare you…

335
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,757
Madam Oh!

336
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,301
-Please take her inside.
-Yes, of course.

337
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,887
What are you waiting for?

338
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,099
Tie up this criminal immediately!

339
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,184
-Yes!
-Madam!

340
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,894
Please believe me!

341
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,021
-Madam Oh!
-Take him away!

342
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,606
Please believe me!

343
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,192
No!

344
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,707
How on earth could
such a terrible thing happen?

345
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,959
How could Minister Yeom be murdered?

346
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,502
It truly is terrible.

347
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,755
It is humiliating that he died
at the hands of his own servant.

348
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,509
He was getting out of control.
I knew he would end up like this one day.

349
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,430
That is enough!
Be careful what you say, Defense Minister.

350
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,225
Are you suggesting
that a problematic individual

351
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,436
deserves to die
at the hands of his servant?

352
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,937
That was not what I--

353
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,397
-Do they have the culprit?
-Yes.

354
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,151
He was arrested at the house
and taken to the police bureau.

355
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,990
The capital is becoming
more and more chaotic these days.

356
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,328
This is a heinous crime
in which a royal official was murdered.

357
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,999
Investigate thoroughly to see
if there is a mastermind behind the crime.

358
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,667
Yes, Left Minister.

359
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,838
Have them report directly to me
on all the progress regarding this case.

360
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,923
Are you going to personally oversee it?

361
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,554
We must urgently resolve the situation
and restore order in the nation!

362
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,472
Yes, sir.

363
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,566
Two bowls of soup for us.

364
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,151
Coming right up!

365
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,987
Please wait for just a moment.

366
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,162
PUB

367
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,124
What are you doing here in broad daylight?

368
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,336
Oh, Defense Secretary Park!

369
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,255
It is good that you are here.

370
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,965
Have a seat, sir.

371
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,510
Please let me buy you a drink.

372
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,347
-Alewife, I need another bottle over here.
-Coming!

373
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,473
My goodness…

374
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,350
This again?

375
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,229
Why must everyone drink so much
when they cannot handle it?

376
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,448
Are you drunk?

377
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,411
Oh, let us see.
Is this what being drunk is like?

378
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,497
This is my first time trying alcohol.

379
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,542
It tastes good, and it makes me feel good.

380
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,711
I now see why people like to drink.

381
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,255
My goodness.

382
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,340
You are asking for trouble.

383
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,301
What more trouble could I possibly be in?

384
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,678
Does it matter?

385
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,389
No matter how much I worry,
it never makes any difference!

386
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,523
I give up now.

387
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,443
They will do as they please.

388
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,071
Who are you so worried about?

389
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,782
It is someone

390
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,076
who is special to me.

391
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,415
They saved me as a child
when I almost died of starvation.

392
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,001
They are like an angel
who fell from the heavens.

393
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,301
I promised to buy a house and leave
once I saved up a thousand yang.

394
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,972
So, I kept on trying
not to save up a thousand yang.

395
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,812
You must not want
to leave that person's side.

396
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,776
It is not exactly like that.

397
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,238
I cannot leave until that person is happy.

398
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,537
I have someone like that too.

399
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,791
Only when that person is happy

400
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,251
can I be at peace too.

401
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,713
I have two people like that.

402
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,839
You have two?

403
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,717
One is hard enough, but two?

404
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,512
One of them is

405
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:10,099
a very lonely person
who has no one else but me.

406
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,768
And the other is

407
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,189
a pitiable brother who has
no one else to protect him but me.

408
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,690
Sir,

409
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,527
you have my sympathy.

410
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,053
You have had enough.
It is time to go home.

411
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,471
Pardon?

412
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,474
Were you not going to return home?

413
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,108
How did you know?

414
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,654
Well, it is always the same for me too.

415
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:06,990
I always go back.

416
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
You cannot enter.

417
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,011
What is this insolence?

418
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,096
How dare you touch a woman's body.

419
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,436
I will go right after I see my father.

420
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,064
It seems like 20 days have passed
since I last saw the squire.

421
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,608
What is going on?

422
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,943
Hurry up and dismiss these men.

423
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,279
Well, she is Captain Hwang's daughter.

424
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,864
I see.

425
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,950
She must be the one not to be let
inside the Capital Guard.

426
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,580
I am Officer Bi-chan.

427
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,208
All right, Officer Bi-chan.
Will you let me in now?

428
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,335
You are not permitted.

429
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,087
It is a direct order from the captain.

430
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,839
Today, my father asked me

431
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,674
-to bring him a snack.
-Bring him a snack.

432
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,927
He told me not to believe those words.

433
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,678
The sun will be setting soon.

434
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,555
Please hurry back to your home.

435
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,189
What did you just do?

436
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,231
What do you mean?

437
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
Did you just throw
this lunch box at me just now?

438
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:25,985
I am not sure.

439
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,321
If you keep doing this, I will…

440
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,408
I think I need to speak
with the pathologist one more time.

441
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,911
Why, all of a sudden?

442
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,537
Let me just say hi to the squire.

443
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,414
He is not here!

444
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,375
Do not lie to me. I know he is here!

445
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,210
-Oh, come on!
-All right, go ahead!

446
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,712
Run like the wind and attend to your job!

447
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,090
Quickly!

448
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,800
If you do not leave right now…

449
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,593
What now?

450
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:57,725
Even when he was wrongfully accused,
he refused to tell the truth.

451
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,522
I cannot say I witnessed anything,
but I cannot turn a blind eye either.

452
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,359
What are you pondering about now?

453
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,610
Yeon-seon!

454
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,488
Why have you come back so late?
I have been waiting all day!

455
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,949
I did some day drinking.

456
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,993
A drink?

457
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,997
I was afraid I might not recognize you
and say something rude in my state,

458
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,416
so I sobered up before I came.

459
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,127
I will be careful from now on.

460
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,548
Now, tell me.

461
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,508
Why can you not turn a blind eye?

462
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,261
There is a widow in worse trouble than me.

463
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,478
Please ignore what I say, my husband.

464
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,069
THE STORY OF LADY BAEK:
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WATERMILL

465
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,537
My goodness!

466
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,423
What?

467
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,133
No way!

468
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,301
I was surprised too.

469
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,887
I could not believe it
even after seeing it myself.

470
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,431
Do you know how long I practiced
on the palanquin because of her?

471
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,640
I was so graceful too!

472
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,933
I cannot believe it.

473
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,479
She really outmatched you
in so many different ways.

474
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,982
The situation has grown
way out of control.

475
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,152
I am worried about Lady Baek.

476
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,451
There she goes,
worrying about other people again.

477
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,122
I really worry about her.

478
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,637
Something did not seem right
when you said you lost the other one.

479
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,351
I never thought you would dare
to entertain such a daring idea.

480
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,895
No, Mother. It is just a misunderstanding.

481
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,438
I really did misplace it.

482
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,983
I knew all along
about your late-night excursions.

483
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,860
Did you really think I did not know?

484
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,570
Mother…

485
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,033
Please, Mother…

486
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,124
Stubbornly starving yourself
to follow your husband to the afterlife?

487
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,127
How could I possibly overlook
your exemplary heart?

488
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,129
Mother…

489
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,048
No, Mother!

490
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,220
Do not disgrace your family any longer.

491
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,601
You must remain faithful and be praised
by everyone until the very end.

492
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,857
I hope you are not alive
when I open the door again.

493
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,276
If you are,

494
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,613
you will not be able
to die a dignified death.

495
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,245
Mother…

496
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,681
The sudden death of the finance minister
is such shocking news.

497
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,309
I think you must be prepared
for the worst.

498
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,644
Is it that bad?

499
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,814
He ordered for the progress
of all investigations

500
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,234
to be delivered
directly to him personally.

501
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,654
The left minister's reaction seems
a bit excessive.

502
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,532
I wonder why that is.

503
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,621
Seeing as a royal court minister has
suddenly died,

504
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,291
it seems that we must
also look into the matter closely.

505
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,337
Very well.

506
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,925
Did you find out anything else
about the missing three?

507
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,929
Yes, I looked into their activities
during the night of the incident.

508
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,805
I found out that one of them

509
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,808
entered and left the palace
when they were off duty.

510
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,185
Who was that?

511
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,770
It was a man named Cho Seong-hu.

512
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,398
Cho Seong-hu, you say?

513
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,693
Then we should start with him.

514
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,071
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,214
What are you pondering so deeply?

516
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,423
I am sure of it.

517
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,968
There was a sweet fragrance.

518
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,386
A sweet fragrance?

519
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,481
There was a sweet scent coming
from Minister Yeom's mouth.

520
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,776
How could a dead person's mouth give
off a fragrance?

521
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,695
This is Minister Yeom's mouth we are…

522
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,739
Did you bring the postmortem report?

523
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,452
Have you not already checked the details
with the official yourself?

524
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,960
He died around 8 p.m.

525
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,884
The cause of death was

526
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,054
a head injury.

527
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,764
Well, you see…

528
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,192
What did she want to tell me?

529
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,744
Let us go.

530
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,413
Where to?

531
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,623
Can you tell me where we are going?

532
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,169
I wonder if Lady Baek is okay.

533
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,134
Look at this straight handwriting.
It is full of energy.

534
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,638
When the queen dowager wrote down
each of these letters,

535
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,266
do you think she only transferred it
onto the paper?

536
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,143
Does she even know what is going on?

537
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,854
She must have engraved it
deeply in her heart

538
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,731
and meditated on it again and again.

539
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,401
I should not worry about others right now.

540
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:28,157
How dare you get distracted
while I am talking to you!

541
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,575
I apologize, Mother.

542
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,370
The queen dowager may have given you
a copy of Instructions for Women,

543
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,998
but you still fall short compared to
the interior minister's daughter-in-law.

544
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,792
Why must you let your mind wander?

545
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,752
You are right, Mother.

546
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,838
She is very thorough in many ways,

547
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,132
so she likely did not do anything
to be at fault.

548
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,843
Are you implying
that I am finding faults in you?

549
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,178
That is not what I meant.

550
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:55,393
You must do everything to get ahead,
not to fall behind Lady Baek.

551
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,853
So, what is your plan of action now?

552
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:09,490
How about I meet her in person
to see how her days are going?

553
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,908
What do you think, Mother?

554
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,910
What are you talking about?

555
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,665
What brings you here, sir?

556
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,210
I have a few questions about the suspect
who was arrested yesterday.

557
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,461
Do you mean Yong-deok?

558
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,463
Have you noticed
anything odd about him lately?

559
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,342
I would not say odd,
but he kept going out at night.

560
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,177
Perhaps he found himself a lover.

561
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,137
A lover, you say?

562
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,723
Do you know who that is?

563
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,602
Was it Gu-wol or Eon-nyeon?

564
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,566
Was he not seen meeting
a lady in a mourning dress

565
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,984
at the town shrine?

566
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,779
-I heard he fell in love with a widow.
-That is right!

567
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,490
-A widow?
-She was beautiful

568
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,367
and had a gentle demeanor.

569
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,454
She did not seem like a widow
from a peasant's family.

570
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,499
Is this what they call love?

571
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,086
I must go to the prison.

572
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,226
Lady Cho?
What brings you all the way here?

573
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,688
I hope it is not rude
to drop by unannounced.

574
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,066
Not at all. Please come in.

575
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,069
I came to ask
your daughter-in-law for a lesson.

576
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,989
Where is she?

577
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,244
If you came
to see my second daughter-in-law,

578
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,330
it might not be the best time right now.

579
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,040
Has she fallen ill?

580
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,838
She has stopped eating,
insisting on following her husband.

581
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,925
I am worried sick about her.

582
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,553
-Please come inside for now.
-Thank you.

583
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,358
I think she will be here for a while.

584
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,321
You should go to the kitchen
and spend some time with Sun-geum.

585
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,906
I will wait for Lady Cho here.

586
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,783
What a good idea.

587
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,470
Your daughter-in-law is
such a role model for all women

588
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,556
who are faithful to their late husbands.

589
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,017
I would like to speak with her
and learn from her.

590
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,311
Unfortunately, you came here for nothing.

591
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,231
You will not be able
to meet my daughter-in-law.

592
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,110
If you tell me
when I can see your daughter-in-law,

593
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,320
can I come and see her then?

594
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,490
From what I have heard,

595
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,910
you have been a widow for over 15 years.

596
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,081
I guess you still do not know
what it means to be faithful.

597
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,711
Do you really not understand
what it means to stop eating?

598
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,212
Do you honestly not get it?

599
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,300
My daughter-in-law

600
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:20,097
will be an example for all widows
who are faithful to their husbands.

601
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,874
I am innocent, sir.

602
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,585
The ring really belongs to me.

603
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,421
I have never laid a finger on Lord Yeom.

604
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,591
Is there anyone
who can corroborate your story?

605
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,927
There is no way
you were able to buy that ring.

606
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,221
Someone must have given it to you.

607
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,058
I can never tell you who that is.

608
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,065
It is a grave offense.

609
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,149
GRAVE OFFENSE:
CRIME THAT VIOLATES

610
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,108
SOCIAL BONDS AND RELATIONSHIPS

611
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,863
If you fail to prove your innocence,
you will be subjected to chamhyeong.

612
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,990
CHAMHYEONG:
EXECUTION BY BEHEADING

613
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,668
I have heard that you have a lover.

614
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,796
Did you meet your lover that night?

615
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,841
-I can never tell you--
-Even if it costs you your life?

616
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,094
I would rather die instead.

617
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,514
But, sir, I swear to you.

618
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,600
I did not kill Lord Yeom.

619
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,289
Did you see that, sir?

620
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,458
See what?

621
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,961
If that man is really innocent,

622
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,131
is he not sacrificing his life
to protect his secret lover?

623
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,883
Stop with the nonsense.

624
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,768
So, has the case been closed?

625
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,104
Yes, it is basically closed.

626
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,649
Even though the servant is
still holding out on his confession,

627
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,693
it will not be a problem anyway.

628
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,988
He has still not confessed
after being caught at the scene?

629
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,073
What could be the reason behind that?

630
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,242
It is a grave offense.

631
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,454
He must be trying to delay
his punishment by dismemberment.

632
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,334
Did you bring the documents
on Minister Yeom's case

633
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,627
from the police bureau?

634
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,296
Yes, Left Minister.

635
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:02,134
As you can see,
there is nothing noteworthy here.

636
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,803
Any significant findings
from the postmortem examination?

637
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,721
No, sir.

638
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,517
But the Capital Guard captain must be
quite desperate for the merit.

639
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,354
A superintendent of the Capital Guard,
who is not even part of the police bureau,

640
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,482
asked the pathologist
for the postmortem report.

641
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,234
He made detailed inquiries
about the purple spots

642
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,944
found inside the corpse's mouth.

643
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,165
My lord, your absence is making me…

644
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,335
so very sad.

645
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,385
Is there anyone…

646
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,311
Is there anyone out there?

647
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,666
It has been ages since this was last used.

648
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,797
Lord Yeom cared for this so much.

649
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,721
Why did it have to fall out from it?

650
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,860
The men were guarding the cellar door.

651
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,737
That must be where she is.

652
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,907
Go to Myeongdo Inn now
and ask them to send Hwal-yu.

653
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,451
What are you planning to do?

654
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,369
We should save her first, should we not?

655
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,580
I can hear everything you are saying.

656
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,501
Do you think I am clueless?

657
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,338
Are you trying to sneak out
the leftover rice cakes?

658
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,135
As a widow in mourning,

659
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:53,805
I cannot raise my voice
out in the street in broad daylight.

660
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,808
I was giving Yeon-seon an errand to run.

661
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,731
Goodness, my lady!

662
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,775
-Are you all right?
-My lady!

663
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,943
How can you be so frail?

664
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,112
This did not happen because I pushed you.

665
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,239
It was because you are weak.

666
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,157
All right?

667
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,618
Since I sit in a shrine all day,

668
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,954
even a short walk is enough
to make my legs feel weak.

669
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,290
-Help me up.
-Yes!

670
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,792
Carefully now!

671
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,585
There you go.

672
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,089
Yeon-seon.

673
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,635
I have no strength in my knees,
so quickly go to Doctor Kim's clinic.

674
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,719
Yes, my lady.

675
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,973
-I will go on my errand now.
-Yes, go ahead.

676
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,101
-Let us go slowly.
-Yes, my lady.

677
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,396
Oh, my lady!

678
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,065
Do you think you can carry me?

679
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,150
Oh, no way.

680
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,657
That was the left minister's
daughter-in-law, was it not?

681
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,617
Every time I see her,

682
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,955
she reminds me of a single blossom
growing on a rocky cliff.

683
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,708
What a forlorn sight.

684
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,043
A single blossom?

685
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,922
But why have you been feeling
so irritable since earlier?

686
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,048
Who, me?

687
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,800
Your gaze has been quivering

688
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,679
like a man blinded
by jealousy since earlier.

689
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,888
That is enough!

690
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,224
I would not do such a thing.

691
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,934
You insolent fool.

692
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,984
FUNERAL

693
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,117
I appreciate you visiting us.

694
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,369
I really cannot thank you enough.

695
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:42,080
The minister and I have worked together

696
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,790
for more than ten years
in the royal court.

697
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,961
I regret not being able
to pay my respects sooner.

698
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,255
The Yeom family will never forget

699
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,383
the kindness and care
you have always shown us.

700
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,937
I know this must be very difficult,
but you need to stay composed.

701
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,940
You must take care of your household now.

702
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,488
The queen dowager has
also been very concerned.

703
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,199
Thank you.

704
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,757
You have decorated your home
with such refined elegance.

705
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,763
I am sure that not a single detail escapes
your notice.

706
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,518
Not even a single flower tree,

707
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,563
nor a single flower petal.

708
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,744
I trust that you managed it
with the utmost care.

709
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,711
Then, I will take my leave now.

710
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,712
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

711
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,081
Who goes there?

712
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,629
What should we do about the door?

713
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,474
Who are you?

714
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,644
Put that thing down.

715
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,521
Did my mother send you to kill me?

716
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,772
Who, us?

717
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,775
We may look the part,
but we are not assassins.

718
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,569
No need to be too alarmed! Put down the--

719
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,820
Do not come any closer!

720
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,238
If she wants my life so badly,

721
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,157
I will end it myself.

722
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,329
Do not do that!

723
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,413
Let go of me!

724
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,292
Why would you cover her mouth?

725
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,544
Help me!

726
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,172
Do something, will you?

727
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,089
Oh, goodness!

728
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,717
Will you please calm down?

729
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,978
You have really startled her!

730
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,605
Let us go.

731
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,198
Good job, Hwal-yu.

732
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,002
Were you not hurt?

733
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,172
Yes, I am okay.

734
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,009
I was talking about Lady Baek.

735
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,388
I did not hit her or anything.

736
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,934
What are you planning to do now?

737
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,021
As suspected, she was not trying
to take her own life.

738
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,900
Are you that concerned about Lady Baek?

739
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,781
Being a role model for mourning women
and dedicating your life to the family.

740
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,117
I understand what it means to live

741
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,411
a life of personal sacrifice.

742
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:55,083
The interior minister's family will not be
able to say that she was taken.

743
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,003
I will look for a place for her
to live in hiding.

744
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,172
Thank you once again, Lady Jang.

745
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,304
I think this one will cost quite a bit.

746
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,599
You are becoming
more and more like Yeon-seon.

747
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,875
When will she be back?

748
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,308
Are you okay?

749
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,642
Who…

750
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,982
Head Guildmaster?

751
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,778
How did I get here?

752
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,863
Your life seemed to be in danger,

753
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,990
so I had to bring you here
despite the intrusiveness.

754
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,287
I received a request from someone
concerned about your situation.

755
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,167
If you sincerely wish
to follow your husband in death,

756
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,877
I cannot stop you from doing so.

757
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,754
But if you wish to live,

758
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:26,508
I can help you start a new life
far away from this place

759
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,093
where no one can find you.

760
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,554
No.

761
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,349
I cannot do that.

762
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,186
I may as well die

763
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,772
if I had to live on my own.

764
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,614
What should I do now?

765
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,453
How am I supposed to live like this?

766
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,558
There was definitely a sweet smell

767
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,602
coming from the corpse's mouth.

768
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,938
Was it a floral scent?

769
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,566
Are you messing with me?

770
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,861
What did you bring this garbage for?

771
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,281
A floral scent…

772
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,388
Why are you smelling dried-out petals?

773
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,226
They do not smell of anything.

774
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,855
The floral shoe, the petals…

775
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,773
Have you really found a woman you like?

776
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,029
Stop it and leave.
You are being quite distracting.

777
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,906
Yes, sir.

778
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,326
Sir.

779
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,703
It melted. Do flower petals melt?

780
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,705
What?

781
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,503
Let me see.

782
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,354
Look, sir. It is melting!

783
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,442
Do you smell that? It smells like flowers.

784
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:00,912
This was the scent.

785
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,666
This was the scent I smelled
from the finance minister's corpse.

786
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,569
Do not be too disheartened.

787
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,239
I know that you have done nothing wrong
as the royal physician.

788
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,200
Thank you, Left Minister.

789
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:44,706
I am worried because the crown prince is
very distraught after losing His Majesty.

790
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,667
He must now take over the throne.

791
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,753
How is the crown prince's physical health?

792
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,964
Well, there is one other thing.

793
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,925
His Majesty's body has been prepared
for the funeral.

794
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,885
But the crown prince said

795
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,056
that he saw purple spots
inside His Majesty's mouth

796
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,018
and detected a sweet scent.

797
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,979
So he asked me to examine his body again.

798
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,023
What kind of nonsense is that?

799
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,317
When Her Majesty heard about this,

800
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,819
she scolded the crown prince severely.

801
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,614
He has remained silent after that.

802
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,367
Very well. You should get back to work.

803
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,001
Father?

804
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,740
Lady Cho?

805
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,047
Yeo-hwa?

806
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,217
Are you spending the night in there?

807
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,803
You must hurry, my lady!

808
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,562
Oh, no.

809
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,860
May I come in for a moment?

810
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,713
EPILOGUE

811
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:45,636
There is a law
allowing a husband to remarry,

812
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,973
but there is no provision
that a wife can remarry.

813
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,435
He is not even her own servant
but rather someone else's.

814
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,270
How long has it been going on?

815
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,194
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN

816
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,661
Did she not go to Madam Oh
to learn Instructions for Women

817
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,914
but to see Yong-deok?

818
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,833
Why, exactly? What on earth for?

819
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,085
Did she love him enough
to give up everything?

820
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,218
Why are you letting your mind wander?

821
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,969
I apologize, Mother!

822
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,013
I heard the interior minister's
daughter-in-law

823
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,890
stopped eating,
thinking about her husband.

824
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,059
Did you learn anything
while you were there?

825
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:39,190
Follow Lady Baek's lead and do the same…

826
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,903
No, you must do more than her.

827
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,904
In your demeanor,

828
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,865
your thoughts,

829
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,745
and your actions alike.

830
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,456
Pardon?

831
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,084
I should do the same?

832
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,988
Look, sir. They are all dead!

833
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,656
Could this be…

834
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:33,244
Are you sure the ring
that Yong-deok had was Lord Yeom's?

835
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:38,374
A Capital Guard superintendent is showing
interest in this matter.

836
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,793
He was just trying to protect his lover.

837
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,211
He is not the perpetrator.

838
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,754
I can attest to that.

839
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,090
Given her impatient nature…

840
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,718
The head guildmaster of Myeongdo Inn
just left with a veiled woman

841
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,344
and headed straight to the police bureau.

842
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,388
Drink this right now.

843
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:55,016
Who dared to allow
a visit to the criminal?

844
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:58,102
I have come this far. I cannot stop now.

845
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:03,649
