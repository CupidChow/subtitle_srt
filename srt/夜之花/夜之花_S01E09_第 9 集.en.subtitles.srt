1
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,876
My lady.

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,378
This is not going to work.

3
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,131
I will take care of everything.

4
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,507
Just sit there and play along.

5
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,720
It will be so easy to notice
that I am not you.

6
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,766
How about just having
a heartfelt talk with him?

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,268
The fact that he wants to meet in secret
shows how shady he is.

8
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,729
I will look for the right time
to ask him who he is,

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,939
so just act surprised when I come out.

10
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,820
You are a natural.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,156
Let's go.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,622
Are you sure Cho Seong-hu is

13
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,083
the person you and His Majesty
have been looking for?

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,543
I cannot be certain.

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,670
The fact that the late king had

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,673
shadow warriors disguised
as soldiers of the King's Guard

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,635
was even kept a secret
from the crown prince at the time.

18
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,805
Then, even if his sister was
the only family he had,

19
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,556
she might also not know about anything.

20
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,061
Even if she does not know
about what happened back then,

21
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,814
she might have information
on his recent whereabouts.

22
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:50,401
There is also the possibility
that he gave her something since then.

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,072
This sister of his…

24
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,032
What if she should not be trusted?

25
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,371
What happened to the fan
I gave you last time?

26
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,873
Oh, that?

27
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,960
I left it in the night-duty room.

28
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,878
Oh, is that so?

29
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,258
I cannot believe you are lying to me.

30
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,717
But, Brother…

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,886
How did you get this?

32
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,436
Stay outside and keep watch

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,272
while I go and meet with his sister.

34
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,402
Brother, about the fan…

35
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,419
Wait here.

36
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,336
Yes.

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,481
Does anyone know

38
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,275
that you came here today?

39
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,361
Can you promise

40
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,197
that you will not tell anyone

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,657
about this meeting?

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,206
Madam.

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,251
This is a very important matter
that concerns

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,170
your brother's life and death.

45
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,838
Can you make that promise?

46
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,719
If you cannot do so,

47
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,890
I also cannot say anything more.

48
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,656
Who are you?

49
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,367
Do not turn around.

50
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,743
Answer my question.

51
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,536
Now!

52
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,751
Stand down.

53
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,590
Sir?

54
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,426
My lady!

55
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,729
-Brother!
-Royal Advisor Park?

56
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,189
Do you know me?

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,774
I do not!

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,745
Was the woman who just left

59
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,998
the left councilor's daughter-in-law?

60
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,460
Where are you going?

61
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,546
Brother!

62
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,426
Stop right there!

63
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,644
-What are you playing at?
-Brother!

64
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,938
You should have grabbed him and not me!

65
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,399
I have something to take care of.

66
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,109
Go on ahead. I will visit you soon.

67
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
Hey, Su-ho!

68
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,325
Did he…

69
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,286
Did he just push me?

70
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,431
You should have started
by talking with him first.

71
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,724
Why did you draw your sword?

72
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,727
If he said, "I am the royal advisor"
from the start,

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,270
I would not have done that.

74
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:58,149
Anyway, what could have possibly happened
to your brother?

75
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,569
First, the finance minister's wife,
and now the royal advisor?

76
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,073
The superintendent
will probably visit us soon.

77
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,075
We should ask him when he does.

78
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:13,039
I told the superintendent
not to come near Myeongdo Inn again…

79
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,749
What? Why?

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,252
You kept running into problems with him,

81
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,089
and I worried you might be
in real trouble later,

82
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,465
so I told him to stay away.

83
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,468
You are still, in fact,
a widow in mourning,

84
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,179
and the superintendent is
undeniably a healthy man--

85
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,890
What does being a widow and a man
have to do with this?

86
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,101
This matter is related to my brother--

87
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,062
What if you two start to have feelings
for each other?

88
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,231
Yong-deok and Lady Baek--

89
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,024
Have you lost your mind?

90
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,609
Head Guildmaster.

91
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,444
Are you in there?

92
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,583
Good evening, sir.

93
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,461
I came here to speak
with Lady Cho for a moment.

94
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,423
I will leave you to it then.

95
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,889
Please consider
what I said as still valid.

96
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,347
Why not get rid of the problem
once and for all?

97
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,601
Both Lord Seok and the man
do not seem to be aware of the issue.

98
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,353
Acting in haste
will only make matters worse.

99
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,522
He could be pretending not to know.

100
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,774
I will find the right time
to be rid of him for good.

101
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,610
Do not make any rash moves.

102
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,111
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,577
You cannot tell me why the royal advisor
is looking for my brother?

104
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,245
Why not?

105
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,790
I cannot give you an answer to that.

106
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,835
Then please go back.

107
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,587
I have nothing more to add, either.

108
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,007
The head guildmaster told me

109
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,052
that I was killing you slowly

110
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,845
by confining you inside your home.

111
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,522
I do not wish to do such a thing,

112
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,398
but I do not wish you to be in danger.

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,777
That was why I wanted you to stay put,

114
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,446
and I felt lost about what I should do.

115
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,200
Do you know what to do now?

116
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,077
The answer may not be

117
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,162
something I had to look for.

118
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,790
Perhaps it was already predestined.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,878
Why did it have to be you
who my brother wanted to find?

120
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,463
And why is it that you are

121
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,757
everywhere I go?

122
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,051
Now that I think about it,

123
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,887
the two of us share the same fate.

124
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,685
My real name is Im Hyeon-jae.

125
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,355
The last general of the late king's guard,

126
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,356
Im Gang,

127
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,567
was my father.

128
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,487
The general of the King's Guard
had his family massacred,

129
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,739
and several of the king's guards vanished.

130
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,074
Then,

131
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,326
that was your family

132
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,120
who got massacred on that day?

133
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,457
I was on the brink of death

134
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,002
when the royal advisor rescued
and saved my life.

135
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,129
I have been living my life,

136
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,423
hiding who my parents are, until now.

137
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,428
What in the world happened on that day?

138
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,307
My brother and I are seeking the truth
about the events of that day.

139
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,683
If so,

140
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,185
I must see the royal advisor again.

141
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,687
That is too dangerous.

142
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,189
Please stop worrying about me.

143
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,526
Besides, I am actually stronger
than the royal advisor.

144
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,573
We must get them back.

145
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,575
My brother…

146
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,244
and also your name.

147
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,474
Lady.

148
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,893
Stop right there!

149
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,900
Was that the superintendent's fan?

150
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,527
The one who Yeon-seon
was trying to protect…

151
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,863
You see,

152
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,824
the witness cannot reveal their identity
to the police bureau.

153
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,202
They cannot reveal their identity.

154
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,662
Royal Advisor Park?

155
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,996
The masked person…

156
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
So, who is this person you speak of?

157
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,459
I am not going to tell you.

158
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,711
Someone he must protect…

159
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
I cannot believe you are lying to me.

160
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,632
The owner of the fan!

161
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,973
What do you think
the royal advisor is looking for?

162
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,477
He said he was looking for something
that belonged to my brother.

163
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,771
But the only thing my brother left behind

164
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,439
was this sword.

165
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,983
He cannot be looking for that, right?

166
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,655
I even pointed this sword at his neck.

167
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,116
If this was it,
he could not have missed it.

168
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,619
Then what is he searching for?

169
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,623
Whatever it is,

170
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,459
I feel like I have to find it.

171
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,589
Some have been through
unimaginable things.

172
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,050
I was the only one who made it

173
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,719
out of the pile of corpses

174
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,597
fifteen years ago.

175
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,878
You said you would be here soon.

176
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,962
What took you so long?

177
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,338
I'm sorry, Brother…

178
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,723
I was up all night waiting for you.

179
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,642
You should have just come tomorrow.

180
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,811
I apologize.

181
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,731
It was already too late,
and I did not want to wake you up.

182
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,774
The left councilor's daughter-in-law.

183
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,652
-She is the mask, is she not?
-Pardon?

184
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,866
Lady Cho cannot even leave her home.

185
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,328
How could she stir up the capital
dressed as the masked figure?

186
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,704
Absolutely not.

187
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,291
I was only asking

188
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,086
if she was the mask from last night.

189
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,673
I have to say,

190
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,009
it did not seem like her first time.

191
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,220
-Brother--
-And I assume

192
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,681
that she was the one
who was holding on to your fan.

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,018
What is the matter?

194
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,522
Should I go to the left councilor's house
to see if I am right?

195
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,112
You do not have to do that.

196
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,451
In fact, Lady Cho wanted
to arrange another meeting.

197
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,917
At least try a little, Mother.

198
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,427
I think Jeong keeps appearing in my dreams

199
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,472
to say how much he resents me.

200
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,393
We have not even recovered his body.

201
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,853
There is no doubt
that he is not resting peacefully.

202
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,690
Please do not say that, Mother.

203
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,693
This is all due to my lack of devotion.

204
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,239
I must go to the temple to offer a prayer.

205
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,533
Let me accompany you.

206
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,203
If I am leaving the house,
one of us should stay behind.

207
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,082
I will go with Jae-i,
so you can stay home.

208
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,295
LET THE LADY KNOW

209
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,512
You seem busy these days, sir.

210
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,723
What do you want to say to me?

211
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,808
I have so much I want to say to you.

212
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,272
You said this was for the altruist,
but all I have done is visit Myeongdo Inn.

213
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,690
Bi-chan.

214
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,235
Give this to the altruist.

215
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,114
But how?

216
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,741
If you go to Myeongdo Inn,

217
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,576
there will be someone to deliver it.

218
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,954
Yes, I will complete the mission.

219
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,915
Oh, and also…

220
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,835
I am planning
to reinvestigate Kang Pil-jik.

221
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,753
What?

222
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,090
But the captain told us
to stay away from him.

223
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
Yes, exactly.

224
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,303
That is why this will be
a secret mission for us.

225
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,307
Well, in that case…

226
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,935
I will take care of the captain for now.

227
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,519
You must find transaction records

228
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,897
that were approved by Minister Yeom
for Kang Pil-jik's guild.

229
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,066
Yes, sir!

230
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,446
Where the heck is Bongmal?

231
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,990
How can nobody know
where she went this morning?

232
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,908
The thing is--

233
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,118
My mother wishes to visit the temple.

234
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,371
Who will prepare her for her trip?

235
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,789
-We apologize.
-Stop making a fuss.

236
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,207
Come in and get ready.

237
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,544
-Oh my, she is in trouble.
-What should we do?

238
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,470
Squire!

239
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,764
-Who are you?
-Pardon me.

240
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,396
-Squire?
-What do you want?

241
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,398
Pardon me. I am sorry.

242
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,236
I am counting on you.

243
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,156
Young man, can I ask you a question?

244
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,410
Have you seen
an incredibly handsome man nearby?

245
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,536
He is also very tall.

246
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,373
That sounds like me.
Can I help you with anything?

247
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,753
Squi--

248
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,757
Well, look who's here.

249
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,009
Long time no see.

250
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,468
Long time no see!

251
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,971
"Long time"?

252
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,223
The No family?

253
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,773
Stop crying, will you?

254
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,108
I am sorry.

255
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,278
I was actually considering visiting today

256
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,405
or tomorrow at the latest…

257
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,742
How could you do this to us?

258
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,330
You were alive and well, after all!

259
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,250
How could you not return home

260
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,171
and wander around like a ghost?

261
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,924
Bongmal, relax!

262
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,593
Bongmal, relax.

263
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,844
You need to calm down.

264
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,387
Take a deep breath.

265
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,313
There you go.

266
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,191
Did you really think that I died?

267
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,444
Are you sure it was not just a rumor?

268
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,491
We heard the news on your wedding day.

269
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,285
And since your body was not found,

270
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:04,083
Lady Yoo was bedridden for over a year.

271
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,667
Did my father

272
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,712
really tell my mother that I died?

273
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,882
Was he really that cruel?

274
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,510
We should not waste any more time.

275
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,596
You have to go back home.

276
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,847
Bongmal.

277
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,891
If I go back now,

278
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,352
it will only make things worse.

279
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,063
I will return
as soon as things are resolved,

280
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,357
so take care of my mother in the meantime.

281
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,277
You are the only person I can trust.

282
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,531
Well, that is true.

283
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,617
You have nothing to worry about.

284
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,704
Give me that!

285
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,718
Why would you go through the trouble
to see me off like this?

286
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,179
You are going to be
late to work because of me.

287
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,600
I already told them I would be late.

288
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,274
Besides, your husband is
the left councilor of this nation.

289
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,486
My dear lady is going on a long journey,
so I will be a bit late to see her off.

290
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,738
Who would dare say anything to me?

291
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,615
Father.

292
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,160
You always only take care of Mother.

293
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,830
You should also take good care
of your mother.

294
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,415
I will.

295
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,709
Do not worry about any household affairs.

296
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,419
Make sure to relax and return safely.

297
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,880
I will, so do not worry about me.

298
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,593
There must be no negligence
in serving the lady.

299
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,389
Have a safe trip, Mother.

301
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,191
Let's go.

302
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,935
Yeo-hwa.

303
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,019
Yes, Father.

304
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,646
You can attend to your business.

305
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,064
Yes.

306
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,783
Is anyone there?

307
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,992
Yes, Lord Seok!

308
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,667
Yes, my lord.

309
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,592
My lady!

310
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,263
You got a message from Myeongdo Inn.

311
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,430
Is that so?

312
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,559
MEET AT MYEONGDO INN
IN TWO HOURS

313
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,895
I must leave now.

314
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,566
Tell the servants that I will be praying
at the shrine all day.

315
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
-Yes, my lady.
-Since Mother is not here,

316
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,529
no one will come looking for me.

317
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,452
HUIJEONGDANG

318
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,248
Doesn't it get funnier
the more you think about it?

319
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,460
-Your Majesty--
-The one who was admirable enough

320
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,756
to help the poor and needy
when the moon is high in the night sky was

321
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,925
the left councilor's daughter-in-law?

322
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,054
When you first told me about this,

323
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,390
I thought the people were
in so much distress

324
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,268
that they had to resort
to making up such nonsensical stories.

325
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,187
It felt uncomfortable to be on the throne.

326
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,817
The left councilor dreams of a nation
that only cares for the nobility,

327
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,820
while his daughter-in-law wears
a mask for the people.

328
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,282
I wonder what the left councilor will do

329
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,868
if he finds out about this.

330
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,622
Your Majesty, as your old friend,

331
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,292
may I humbly request a favor from you?

332
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,711
Tell me.

333
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,797
Could you entrust me
to take care of matters

334
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,924
regarding the councilor's daughter-in-law?

335
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,842
What for?

336
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,220
Some people are concerned for her safety.

337
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,681
Could it be…

338
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
that you are one of them?

339
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,020
No, sire.

340
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,230
I only wish

341
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,232
to protect those people

342
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,777
who are concerned for her.

343
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,822
Do not worry.

344
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,867
She is none other
than Cho Seong-hu's sister.

345
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,203
We should protect her, of course.

346
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,455
Thank you, Your Majesty.

347
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,665
Not even a little?

348
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,459
No, sire.

349
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,517
It has been a long time.

350
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,900
You have not changed a bit.

351
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,029
You have aged a lot, Father.

352
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:30,033
Have you forgotten what I said I would do
if you came back?

353
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,494
You already killed me
when I had not even returned.

354
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,288
It was in everyone's best interest.

355
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,873
And who might they be?

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,877
I would have no problem with it

357
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,338
if you treated me as dead
or even killed me right now.

358
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,840
But how could you tell Mother

359
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,883
that I was dead when I was clearly alive?

360
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,802
You should have told her
to consider me dead.

361
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,471
Can you imagine how much pain she was in
for all those years?

362
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,598
You turned your back on your parents.

363
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,059
It is ridiculous to see you
worrying about us now.

364
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,353
When you told me to consider you dead,

365
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,398
did you think
you would ever see your mother again?

366
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,650
I was wrong, Father.

367
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,320
If you know, then go back.

368
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,449
Do not even think
about setting foot in Joseon again.

369
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,078
No.

370
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,626
Now that I know what I did wrong,
I need to fix it.

371
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,005
I made a widow out of a woman
and also made my mother suffer.

372
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,507
I will personally apologize to them.

373
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,468
But you must make amends
for your own mistakes.

374
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,511
How dare you!

375
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,388
I have already died once.

376
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,433
I will atone for my sins
as I live on borrowed time.

377
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,934
Is that so?

378
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,229
Then, leave the capital tomorrow.

379
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,231
-Father!
-That is the only way!

380
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,903
There is no other way
to pay for your sins against our family.

381
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,198
You are already a dead man.

382
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,867
The dead cannot come back to life.

383
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,662
Do not let your mother
lose her child twice.

384
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,895
Novice Joo!

385
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,271
Master Kkon-nim.

386
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,190
What are you doing on the street?

387
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,983
The day is already well underway.

388
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,110
Why haven't you set up your stand yet?

389
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,322
How can you make a living
without taking your job seriously?

390
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,949
I totally agree, Master.

391
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,369
Life is so hard.

392
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,496
Of course, it is.

393
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,164
Nothing is easy in this world.

394
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,587
Even so,

395
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,589
you must cheer up.

396
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,884
Have a dried persimmon.

397
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,472
A lady I know said

398
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,016
that this persimmon cheered her up

399
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,478
when she was glancing over the wall
and contemplating life.

400
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,438
This is so good!

401
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,565
I feel energized already.

402
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,651
I suppose that lady

403
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,654
also had a tough time in this world.

404
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,282
I am still young, so I do not know why,

405
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,576
but I hear widows are
not allowed to leave their homes.

406
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,790
This lady that you speak of…

407
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,625
Is it the left councilor's--

408
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,967
She is my favorite person
in the whole world,

409
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,178
but she looked so sad
as she sat alone in her quarters

410
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,973
that it upset me.

411
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,776
I see.

412
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,280
I am very sorry about that.

413
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,324
Why are you sorry?

414
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,701
Oh, it is nothing.

415
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,911
Do you have more persimmons?
It is so good!

416
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,581
If you are feeling better,

417
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,957
you must get back to work.

418
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,292
Yes, Master Kkon-nim.

419
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,220
Kang Pil-jik and Madam Oh
are half-siblings with different fathers?

420
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,474
She asked me to keep it a secret,
so I could not tell you.

421
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,726
Whose side are you on, Lady Jang?

422
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,604
It seems to me
that you two are on the same side

423
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,647
while I am on the other side.

424
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,694
Since Madam Oh is
a member of the royal family,

425
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,365
I was always curious
why she was married off to Yeom Heung-jip.

426
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,076
But she endured all that humiliation

427
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,370
because of her family's shame.

428
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,123
Are you feeling sorry for Madam Oh?

429
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,333
No!

430
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,544
I would not have let her manipulate me
if I had known about this sooner.

431
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,465
Why are there so many people
living false lives?

432
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,345
I do not think
that is something you can say.

433
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,059
Can you find out

434
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
if there is any connection

435
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,230
between Madam Oh and my father-in-law?

436
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,942
I am feeling suspicious
about their secret meeting a few days ago.

437
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,528
That is not going to be easy.

438
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,240
What about looking
deeper into Kang Pil-jik?

439
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,742
What if Kang Pil-jik is also involved

440
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,453
with Madam Oh and the left councilor?

441
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,373
I cannot deny
that my father-in-law deceived me.

442
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,126
But he devoted his life to this nation.

443
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,838
I would hate to think
that he was related to such an awful man.

444
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,758
The superintendent will be here soon,

445
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,052
so I will prepare some tea.

446
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,938
MYEONGDO INN

447
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,399
-Is the head guildmaster in?
-She might be in her office.

448
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,192
Thank you. I appreciate it.

449
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,277
Ttaeng?

450
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,699
Thank you.

451
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,659
I appreciate you.

452
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,995
That is what it means.

453
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,708
Thank you.

454
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,335
Are you in, Head Guildmaster?

455
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,799
Head Guildmaster?

456
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,013
Head…

457
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,056
Guild…

458
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,397
Head Guildmaster!

459
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,072
Pardon me.

460
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,491
Have we not

461
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,951
met somewhere before?

462
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,328
We have not.

463
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,913
I am certain I know that face.

464
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,498
Where do you live by chance?

465
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,583
I think we might have met on the street.

466
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,001
I do not have a home.

467
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:55,919
What?

468
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,713
What is the matter?

469
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,133
Hey.

470
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,637
I came to see the head guildmaster,
but someone else was inside.

471
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,057
But I was sure I had seen her before.

472
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,149
I am sure you are mistaken.

473
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:19,901
Weird.

474
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,695
Why would you assume
that I do not know her?

475
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,281
There is no way you would know her.

476
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,116
Look for the head guildmaster elsewhere.

477
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,034
Wait.

478
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,998
I just remembered.

479
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,756
It is your lover.

480
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,509
Am I right?

481
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,929
It is nothing like that. Go away.

482
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,390
I will leave you to your sweetheart.

483
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,689
Enjoy yourselves.

484
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,609
You cheeky thing.

485
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Seriously?

486
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,372
How can you be so careless?

487
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,374
Why do you bother with that veil?

488
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,127
I do not like that man one bit.

489
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,295
He speaks very strangely.

490
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,547
I get a bad feeling whenever I see him.

491
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,048
We must be ill-fated.

492
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,633
You cannot blame him.

493
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,220
He just thinks that you are my lover.

494
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,974
I did not mean it--

495
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,977
Your callous words are
why Lady Jang makes sly comments.

496
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
What on earth did she…

497
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,526
What if you two start to have feelings
for each other?

498
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,986
Yong-deok and Lady Baek--

499
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,071
Have you lost your mind?

500
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,452
Why didn't the royal advisor
come with you?

501
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,997
You can see him if you go
to the rental bookstore with me now.

502
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,040
Very well.

503
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,082
By the way…

504
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,711
My brother knows who you are.

505
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,423
What an astute individual.

506
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,217
I expected this might happen.

507
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,761
One more thing.

508
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,889
Whatever happens,

509
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,391
think of yourself first.

510
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,361
The finance minister position has been
vacant for a while.

511
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,696
Have you still not found
the right candidate?

512
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,741
We are seeking suitable candidates

513
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,369
and hope to recommend
three candidates to you soon.

514
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,371
If there is no one suitable,

515
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,166
how about Park Yun-hak?

516
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:45,046
Are you saying we appoint someone
who has only been the royal advisor

517
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,715
for the last ten years
as the finance minister?

518
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,511
There is a first time for everything,

519
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:56,349
so couldn't you guide him
with your experience, Left Councilor?

520
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
Your Majesty.

521
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,235
Do you know why I believed
you would make a good king?

522
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,154
I am not sure.

523
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,200
I always wondered about that, too.

524
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,452
Why did you tell me back then

525
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,788
that I could be a sage king?

526
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,792
It was because you understood fear.

527
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,046
When you were a young crown prince,
and I was your teacher,

528
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,883
you mentioned that you wished
you had been born a grand prince instead,

529
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:36,472
fearing the heavy responsibilities
of becoming king.

530
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,017
I do remember that.

531
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,145
I liked you for that, Your Majesty.

532
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,064
I liked the humble king

533
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,275
who did not chase dangerous dreams

534
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,153
and was not overly ambitious,

535
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,572
even for occasional smaller aspirations.

536
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,994
Was that why you put me on the throne?

537
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,371
Because I know my place?

538
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,420
It is my duty to choose the right person

539
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,672
for the position of finance minister.

540
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,969
Your Majesty must clearly distinguish

541
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,597
between what you can and cannot do.

542
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,974
That is the essence of humility.

543
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,268
If you maintain that spirit,

544
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,438
your reign will not be short-lived.

545
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
Your Majesty.

546
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,949
Her Majesty the Queen Dowager is here.

547
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,250
What brings you here, Mother?

548
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,465
I called Madam Oh to console her.

549
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,759
She has been heartbroken for a long time.

550
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,053
Madam Oh has brought us

551
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,138
some fine tea to the palace.

552
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,725
I would appreciate it
if the left councilor could join us.

553
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,768
Regretfully,

554
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,480
I have an urgent matter to take care of,

555
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,066
so I must take my leave at this time.

556
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,692
That is a shame.

557
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,657
I often hear from Madam Oh
about your daughter-in-law.

558
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,827
You have a truly admirable
daughter-in-law.

559
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,504
I heard that Madam Oh's guidance
was of great assistance.

560
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,341
You must bring her to the palace sometime.

561
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,427
I would love to speak with her in person.

562
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,806
I will, Your Majesty.

563
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,710
MAY SPRING BRING YOU
GREAT FORTUNE

564
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,379
RENTAL BOOKSTORE

565
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,119
I apologize for my rashness last time.

566
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,331
It was my fault for asking to see you
without any forewarning.

567
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,041
Please have a seat.

568
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,760
I would like to hear the answer
I missed that day.

569
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,846
Ever since your brother disappeared,

570
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,140
have you not heard from him at all?

571
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,186
I am not here to answer that question.

572
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,148
I heard that 15 years ago,

573
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,568
my brother disappeared after receiving
a secret order from the late king.

574
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,028
Is this true?

575
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,531
How did you know that?

576
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,284
Madam Oh told me.

577
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,871
I do not know what her intentions were,

578
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,207
but I do not believe
she fabricated the story.

579
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,297
What happened 15 years ago?

580
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,050
Why did the general's family get killed,

581
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,636
and why did my brother disappear?

582
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,054
Why did it have to be this way?

583
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,181
You seem to know a great deal already.

584
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,726
How much and what more do you know?

585
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,980
Please tell me what happened first.

586
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,359
That was the day

587
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,612
when the late king passed away.

588
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,072
On top of that,

589
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,866
we believe the late king

590
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,995
was killed by poison.

591
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,998
Are you saying it was treason?

592
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,501
Since nothing occurred on the surface,

593
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,712
it is still too early to say

594
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,506
whether it was treason or not.

595
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,468
The poison used on the late king

596
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,888
is the same as the one
the finance minister drank.

597
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,892
Since she told Lady Cho
about Cho Seong-hu,

598
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,519
is it safe to assume

599
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,690
that Madam Oh is aware of everything?

600
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,899
It seems

601
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,235
that you are right.

602
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,657
Who is the mastermind behind Madam Oh?

603
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,460
Your daughter-in-law is very smart.

604
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,092
Why can't you tell me who it is?

605
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,430
Who is the mastermind behind Madam Oh

606
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,140
with the power to plot treason?

607
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,727
Why are you trying
to hide the person responsible

608
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,481
for everything that has happened so far?

609
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,818
You are correct.

610
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,990
His Majesty and I believe that all of this

611
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,243
was orchestrated by the left councilor.

612
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,041
What evidence do you have?

613
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,334
Lady Cho.

614
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,586
You are one of them.

615
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,591
Why else would the left councilor ask

616
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,760
a comparatively humble family like yours

617
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,054
to propose an arranged marriage
between the families?

618
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,972
The left councilor

619
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,017
had to find the person who received

620
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,561
the secret order from the late king.

621
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,564
The reason why

622
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,359
my father-in-law took me in…

623
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,863
was because of my brother?

624
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,865
That is what I think.

625
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,076
Fifteen years.

626
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,995
It has been 15 years

627
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,124
since I regarded them as my parents.

628
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:22,711
Things are still left to be investigated,
are they not?

629
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,550
This must be hard for you to believe.

630
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,971
I will take my leave for today.

631
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,765
Are you all right?

632
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,352
I am all right.

633
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,771
I will get back to you later.

634
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,382
Oh, no…

635
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,134
Can I come in?

636
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,853
You are enduring a lot
because of my dead child.

637
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,439
I am all right.

638
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,817
You miss your brother a lot, do you not?

639
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,071
I am looking everywhere for him,

640
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,699
so if you hear anything from him

641
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,368
or think of anything to help find him,
let me know.

642
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,496
Thank you.

643
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,873
Thank you, Father.

644
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:42,958
Father!

645
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,295
Yeo-hwa.

646
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,673
Do you know the places
your brother used to go to often?

647
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,134
That will be helpful in finding him.

648
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,931
When your brother left,
did he leave anything behind?

649
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,557
He left in such a hurry, so…

650
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,977
Oh, what a heartless person he was.

651
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,898
By the way, is there still no news

652
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,317
about my brother?

653
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,737
I am searching everywhere,
so we should hear back soon.

654
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,533
Let us wait for him together.

655
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,245
I would have no more reason

656
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,915
to talk with your smart daughter-in-law
about her brother anymore.

657
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,460
Is that supposed to be a threat?

658
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,880
You have become so vulgar.

659
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,718
Was it my brother

660
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,098
that you were after from the beginning?

661
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,983
I did not know
that you had already arrived.

662
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,985
Please forgive me, my lord.

663
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,070
Do not worry about it.

664
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,156
I came a little early
to think about some things.

665
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,161
I hear I have aged.

666
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,374
Who would dare to make
such an insolent statement?

667
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,875
I will go and immediately…

668
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,463
Many years have passed,

669
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,967
and I have left something unsettled
for too long.

670
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:19,471
I should sort things out
before they become even more troublesome.

671
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,391
Give me your orders, my lord.

672
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,520
I think that Madam Oh

673
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,858
should take her own life
to follow her husband, after all.

674
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,985
Pardon?

675
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,363
Even though her lineage
is vastly different,

676
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,283
isn't she actually
your blood-related sister?

677
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,869
It is a better end
than being locked up in prison

678
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,830
as a murderer and dying a miserable death.

679
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,583
In the end,
this is for your sister's benefit.

680
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,087
My lord, how could you tell me
to do such a thing?

681
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,134
Hanging herself seems like a nice end.

682
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,928
But it also would not be such a bad idea

683
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,223
to take her own life
by throwing herself off a cliff

684
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,017
so that her body cannot be found.

685
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,936
Whatever you choose,

686
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,688
do not take too much time deciding.

687
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,235
The older I get,
the less patient I become.

688
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,911
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

689
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,413
What would you have done
if you had known sooner?

690
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,791
If the left councilor is behind all this,

691
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,126
he is also the one
who killed my parents that day!

692
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,003
That is right.

693
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,297
So what would you have done?

694
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:36,882
I would at least

695
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,426
not have accepted a drink from him.

696
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,928
Would you have drawn your sword

697
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,513
and avenged your parents there?

698
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,847
What is wrong with that?

699
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,891
If you had killed the left councilor,

700
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,601
we'd be unable to discover any truths,

701
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,020
and you would have also been in danger,

702
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,147
and everything would have ended in vain.

703
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,857
I've already died 15 years ago.

704
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,942
What about His Majesty?

705
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,404
He has endured 15 long years
of humiliation

706
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,282
and waited patiently for the right time.

707
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,370
If the goal was
to kill the left councilor,

708
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,914
this would not have taken this long.

709
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,004
So…

710
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,383
what is it that I must do?

711
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,469
Cho Seong-hu must have had the evidence

712
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,597
to prove that
the left councilor plotted treason.

713
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,349
What if we cannot find it?

714
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,060
Perhaps,

715
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,396
there could be another way.

716
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,194
Are you considering
Lady Cho as the alternative?

717
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,738
That is not up to me to decide.

718
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,491
Brother,

719
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,244
I will…

720
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,708
no longer let the people around me

721
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,711
get hurt anymore.

722
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,921
Does Lady Cho

723
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,508
mean that much to you?

724
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,558
I will protect the lady to make sure

725
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,478
that she is not put in harm's way.

726
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,868
But I am sure

727
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,620
there will be a use for your skills.

728
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,915
Once you find it,
do not hesitate to use it.

729
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,375
Brother.

730
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,961
I should not hesitate, should I?

731
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,942
Would you come out for a moment?

732
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,783
Are you all right?

733
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,119
I am all right.

734
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,789
What about you? Are you okay?

735
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,336
If your brother's words are true,

736
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,297
would that not mean

737
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,174
that our families are enemies?

738
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,135
Even if that were true,

739
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,929
I would not take revenge on you.

740
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,556
Do not worry.

741
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:36,270
Besides, there is no guarantee
that I will win against you.

742
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,276
Oh, I remembered.

743
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,905
The ones who checked your scars that day…

744
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,116
I have fought them before.

745
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,367
Who were they?

746
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,579
I should have killed him long ago.

747
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,746
Lady Cho!

748
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,332
I am sure

749
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,001
that was Kang Pil-jik.

750
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,087
Are you sure?

751
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,883
He uses a uniquely shaped sword,
so I am sure of it.

752
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,762
I did not realize it then
because I saw you falling to the ground.

753
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,395
When I saw that sword,

754
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,480
I remembered the pain I felt back then.

755
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,985
I will look into this.

756
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,070
No.

757
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,572
I must bring him in myself.

758
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,452
In that case, I will gladly yield.

759
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,079
He and I also have a bad history,

760
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,540
so please be rough with him.

761
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,666
Yes, I will.

762
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,086
Then, I will take my leave now.

763
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,589
Please take care.

764
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,224
Be careful, my lady.

765
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,070
Go to Myeongdo Inn and discreetly find out

766
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,571
if a man named Joo has left.

767
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,697
Yes, my lord.

768
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,298
Are you ready
to go into the office, Father?

769
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,383
Yes.

770
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,136
You must be worn out
doing all the chores by yourself.

771
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,554
It is nothing.

772
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,392
I have something to tell you urgently.

773
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,268
Yes, what is it?

774
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,482
I received this strange note yesterday.

775
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,325
If you want to hear about your brother,

776
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,745
meet me in front of Sugu Gate
around 10:00 p.m. in ten days.

777
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,792
Where did you get this?

778
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,546
I picked it up from the garden
by my quarters yesterday.

779
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,676
This must be some kind of a joke.

780
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,514
I will find out
who committed this despicable act.

781
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,307
But just in case,

782
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,226
may I meet them in person?

783
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,980
How can a widow in mourning
come forward in such a matter?

784
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,606
I apologize.

785
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,403
But what if they really want
to tell me something about my brother?

786
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,113
Please, I beg you.

787
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,617
All right.

788
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,411
However,

789
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,496
you must not act rashly.

790
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,540
Yes.

791
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,220
Captain Hwang.

792
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,266
What is the matter,
Superintendent Park Su-ho?

793
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,895
Please give me permission to investigate
Kang Pil-jik again.

794
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:05,937
What?

795
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,773
What?

796
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,026
Kang Pil-jik?

797
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,201
Oh my,

798
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,370
what brings you here, Royal Advisor Park?

799
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,289
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

800
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,751
A favor to ask me?

801
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,509
It is a secret command from above.

802
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,511
Could it be…

803
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,387
Him?

804
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,432
That is right. His Majesty's--

805
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,059
Just give me the word!

806
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,852
I am ready to do anything

807
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,563
if it is His command.

808
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,774
He says to investigate Kang Pil-jik.

809
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,026
Kang Pil-jik?

810
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,616
Hold on to your worries!

811
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,992
I will uncover

812
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:04,162
every bit of dirt on him
and offer it to Him.

813
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:08,166
Sir, I brought everything I could find
regarding Kang Pil-jik.

814
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,718
Thank you. Come again.

815
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,637
Hey. You there.

816
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,389
What are you looking for?

817
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,476
I heard there was
a merchant from Qing here.

818
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,394
His name is Joo.

819
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,312
Joo?

820
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,773
I came here to ask him something.

821
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,400
Is he inside?

822
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,779
I do not know him.

823
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,239
There is no one like that.

824
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,240
Are you sure?

825
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,326
I said he is not here.

826
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,161
I will go in and just check briefly,

827
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,413
-so step aside.
-Who are you?

828
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,500
Who are you to cause trouble?

829
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,171
I do not want trouble.
I was just looking for someone.

830
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,549
-Go away, will you?
-I heard that he was here.

831
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,302
There is no one like that here!
Go away! All right?

832
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,012
Move along!

833
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,096
Master Kkon-nim!

834
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,390
You can stop now.

835
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,601
Are you in debt?

836
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,686
How much? A lot?

837
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,938
There is no time for this.

838
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,982
You should hide quickly.

839
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:14,941
Master.

840
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,693
Wait.

841
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,119
What should we do now?

842
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,454
What else can we do?

843
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,372
I showed the letter to my father,

844
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,916
so we will have to wait and see.

845
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,794
Do you really believe
Lord Seok was behind all this?

846
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,260
Even if my father-in-law
really plotted treason,

847
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,054
nothing would change for me.

848
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:49,142
I have no choice, if he was sentenced
to have three generations executed,

849
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,727
but to be executed with him.

850
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,437
Why should you be punished?

851
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:57,609
It is the law of the nation
that we must pay for our parents' sins.

852
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,111
But if,

853
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,947
for whatever reason,

854
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,282
he uses me and harms my brother,

855
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,284
that would be a different story.

856
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,373
You look even scarier
than Lord Seok right now.

857
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,541
It must be from imagining things, right?

858
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,877
Even if I become
a ghost haunting this house,

859
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,880
I will find out
Father's true intentions at all costs.

860
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,820
Novice Joo.

861
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,865
Do you have to leave?

862
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,995
If I stay here any longer,
I will only be a nuisance.

863
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:52,914
Master Kkon-nim.

864
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,125
Please take care of yourself.

865
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,544
You take care, too.

866
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,587
Do you even have a place to go?

867
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,715
Maybe if you asked the head guildmaster,

868
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,717
she could help you pay off your debt.

869
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,926
There are

870
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,388
more problems in the world
that money cannot solve.

871
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,557
Then,

872
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,475
I will see you again sometime.

873
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,861
See you!

874
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,113
-See you!
-See you!

875
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,119
Novice Joo!

876
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,000
I appreciate you!

877
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:50,764
CAPITAL GUARD

878
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,269
NO ENTRY, UNDER MAINTENANCE:
CAPTAIN HWANG

879
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,233
The Pil merchant guild is
steeped in suspicious activities.

880
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:08,114
But the problem is
that the investigation seems endless.

881
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,951
Captain, please take a look at this.

882
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,245
Doesn't it seem odd?

883
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,710
Isn't this the list of relief grains

884
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,046
that Madam Oh entrusted to the Pil guild?

885
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,005
What seems odd?

886
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:30,678
The relief grains that the queen dowager
donated last year totaled 15,400 tons,

887
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,514
but the actual amount of rice distributed

888
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,849
was less than 1,540 tons.

889
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,017
What?

890
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,435
Where did the rest go?

891
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,315
The rice could not have just disappeared.

892
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,861
Something smells fishy…

893
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,281
Superintendent Park Su-ho.

894
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,036
This is clearly a big problem,
even judging by my poor eyesight.

895
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,039
Do you have a plan?

896
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,001
The plan is…

897
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,964
to think about what to do.

898
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,639
Should I abandon my dream

899
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,643
of entering the palace now?

900
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:27,360
I have confirmed
that the person you asked about has left.

901
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,404
You can leave now.

902
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,912
But just in case,

903
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,623
may I meet them in person?

904
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,170
Oh, Yeo-hwa.

905
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:50,175
It would be easier if you had simply lived
as part of our family.

906
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,470
So many years have already passed.

907
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,097
How can you still not let go
of your attachment?

908
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,076
Mother.

909
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,456
I still seem to be hallucinating.

910
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,043
What should I do about this,
my dear Jeong?

911
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,296
Mother.

912
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,176
Brother?

913
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,432
Brother!

914
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,185
Jeong?

915
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,020
I am sorry for being late, Mother.

916
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:45,939
I have

917
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,066
finally returned.

918
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,736
Jeong…

919
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,321
Jeong…

920
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,783
Are you really my son, Jeong?

921
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,244
My goodness!

922
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,580
Oh, my son was alive!

923
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,498
Jeong!

924
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,625
Jeong!

925
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,794
Jeong…

926
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,923
Jeong…

927
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,508
What…

928
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,592
How…

929
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,844
How could this be?

930
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,267
Jeong…

931
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,690
They are on the move.

932
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:44,080
What brought you here all of a sudden?

933
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,168
I came to deliver
an urgent message from Lord Seok.

934
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,713
I am sorry, Sister.

935
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,966
You seem to have
greatly offended Lord Seok.

936
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:01,055
He should have just left me alone.

937
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,182
What does he want?

938
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,810
Did he tell you
to kill me right away to silence me?

939
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:09,689
Shouldn't you find a way to live?

940
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,108
Do you think that I would beg for

941
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,612
my pitiful existence
to someone as lowly as you?

942
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,532
No matter how rough it may be,
isn't it better to be alive than dead?

943
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,702
Even if it means
to live as a lowly commoner,

944
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,203
choosing to live could be better.

945
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,539
How dare you preach to me?

946
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,666
I don't need your understanding.

947
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,339
Even if it is just half,
you are still my sister.

948
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,924
I said these things
out of concern for you.

949
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,259
How dare you!

950
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,348
Do not dare to consider
the two of us as equals!

951
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,153
Father, did you call for me?

952
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,238
Come in.

953
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,840
Have you been at the shrine all this time?

954
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,217
Yes.

955
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,012
But why did you want to see me?

956
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:24,806
Have a seat.

957
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,349
Yes.

958
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,528
I may not know much
about the customs of women,

959
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:42,490
but I do know that you have done better
than anyone else.

960
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,992
Even the queen dowager

961
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,204
has praised you as a virtuous woman

962
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,498
worthy of the virtuous woman's gate.

963
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,001
It is all thanks to you and Mother.

964
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,050
Hence,

965
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,762
now it is your turn to repay the favor.

966
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,815
I apologize, Madam Oh.

967
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,485
Get out of here!

968
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,654
You can live

969
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:26,159
your whole life
as the left councilor's dog,

970
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,745
but I shall do as I wish.

971
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,384
Now that I know you never
considered me as your younger brother…

972
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,767
I cannot help but feel at ease.

973
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,155
Prepare to guard your husband's grave.

974
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:17,460
