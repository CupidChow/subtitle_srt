00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,720
Grandpa.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,440
This is all my fault.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,440
Xiangxiang has nothing to do with it.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,840
She did everything

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,080
because I hired her to do so.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,520
I gave her the orders.

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,160
That's why she had to lie to you.

12
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,280
Do you think

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,640
I haven't thought of that?

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Grandpa.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,120
So...

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
That's enough.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,280
Let's put an end to this.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,720
Xiangxiang had promised me

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,200
before she left

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,480
that she would never see you again.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,720
Don't look for her.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,920
Sihan.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,040
You are from two different worlds.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,200
This is the best way

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,720
for both of you.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
Grandpa.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,960
I really like her.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Do you remember

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,040
what I've said before?

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,640
At the next shareholders' meeting,

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,080
I will announce

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,920
the successor of Fu Group.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,160
Originally,

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,520
I was going to choose you.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,160
But,

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,360
to take charge of our group,

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,840
you cannot fall prey

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
to your love affairs.

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Career

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,840
or love?

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Make your choice.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,760
I went to the Fu family

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,720
as soon as I heard what happened.

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
They said you had already left.

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,160
And I thought you would be here.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm okay.

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,440
Thank you.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,280
You are not.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
An irresponsible man like Fu Sihan

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,320
doesn't deserve your tears.

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Xiangxiang.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,680
Actually I...

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,040
Chu Beiye.

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
That's enough.

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
I just want to be alone now.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,720
I don't want to

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
think about relationships for now.

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,840
Miss Yun.

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Chu Beiye.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
Why are you here?

61
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
That's for me to ask.

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,920
How dare you come here?

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Xiangxiang.

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,720
There's something

65
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
I want to tell you.

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Just go.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,760
I don't have anything

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
to say to you.

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
She said she doesn't want to see you.

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Mr. Fu.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Please go.

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,640
This is between the two of us.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,840
Why don't you
mind your own business, Mr. Chu?

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,400
Xiangxiang.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,080
There's something
I need to tell you in private.

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Xiangxiang.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,560
You have to be faithful
to yourself in a relationship.

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
Don't let anyone wrong you.

79
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,560
I know.

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,040
You can go now.

81
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,920
Fu Sihan.

82
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,680
You'd better be good to her
for the rest of your life.

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
If you dare wrong her

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,800
and make her sad,

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,360
I can take her back anytime.
