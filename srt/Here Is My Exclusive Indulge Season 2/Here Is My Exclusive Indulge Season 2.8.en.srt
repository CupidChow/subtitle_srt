5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,160
I have a picture of
the real daughter of the Yun Group.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,160
Dad.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,360
Have a look.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,360
This is the real daughter
of the Yun Group.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Look at that ugly nose.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,520
Now look at hers.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
And those small eyes.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,400
Look at her eyes.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,560
And the mouth and eyebrows.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,920
She's nothing like it in the picture.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
Rongrong.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
You were even uglier
when you were little.

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,120
Girls become prettier as they get older.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,080
Auntie, do you think

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,760
I was too ugly as a kid?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Your auntie didn't mean that.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,360
If auntie wants my picture,

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,760
you can just tell me.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's no need
to look for it in secret.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,880
You should apologize to Xiangxiang.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,120
But...

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
It's okay, grandpa.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Auntie's intention was good.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
Since Xiangxiang said so,

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,600
we'll let it go.

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,160
It's my fault this time.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
As an apology to Xiangxiang,

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,840
I'll throw a socialite's party tomorrow.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
You have to come, Xiangxiang.

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,440
I think...

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Maybe next time.

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,360
Sihan.

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,240
There'll only be girls on the party.

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
No man will be chasing her around.

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,920
Just let her come. Don't worry.

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
But I...

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,160
I just got back from abroad.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm so tired.

43
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
The jet lag is such a pain.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Oh my.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,200
So you are still blaming me?

46
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,960
Xiangxiang.

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Your auntie is doing this for you.

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Just go.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,080
You can take this opportunity

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,920
to get to know
the friends of our family.

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Grandpa...

52
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,840
Yeah. I believe

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,000
that auntie will treat you well there.

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,360
Of course,

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
I will treat her well.

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,720
That was a long day.

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,480
Thankfully, nothing went wrong.

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,120
What about the party tomorrow?

59
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Can Miss Yun manage it on her own?

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,400
Go home first.

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm off work. Drop me off at home.

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,920
Which home?

63
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,360
Our home.

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,360
Your home?

65
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,520
What?

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I mean drop me off at my place.

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
No way.

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
You have to live with me from now on.

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Fu Rong is suspicious of your identity.
She would have eyes on you.

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
It's too risky
if you still live at your place.

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,920
And...

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,280
You...

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,200
You agreed?

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,880
Of course. No more rent or bills!

75
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,960
You are a really good boss.

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Let's go.

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Hello, Miss Yun.

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm Butler Chen.

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,880
If you have any needs,

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,800
just tell me.

81
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay. Thank you.

82
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,840
Your butler looks like a good person.

83
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Fu Rong pretends to be looking after me.

84
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,040
She placed those people around me.

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
Especially that butler.

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
Be careful around him.

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Problems of the rich people.

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
Anyway, in this house,

89
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
you can't trust anyone

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,640
except Chu He.

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,040
You guys really don't
have other worries, huh?

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
Living your life
like you are in a movie.

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
Oh.

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
Why doesn't your auntie like you?

95
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,800
You don't need to know.

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Fu Rong.

97
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
She's not my blood relative.

98
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,800
My grandpa adopted her.

99
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,040
So you only have
one family in this world,

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
just like me.

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
What are you saying?

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,520
Nothing.

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
What's for dinner?

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,880
There must be much delicious food.

105
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
You can go now.

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Enjoy your dinner.

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,360
Abalone? Lobster?

108
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,320
Or Kobe steak?

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,440
This is all?
