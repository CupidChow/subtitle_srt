00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,176
(President: Fu Sihan)

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,040
It's time to change to another one.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,280
Ms. Fu.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
Do you think it's that easy

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,560
to become the new president?

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,560
Guards.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,640
Do you still remember Yang Shan, Ms. Fu?

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,040
Anything I can do for you, Ms. Fu?

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,360
It's fine now. You may go.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,280
Yes, Ms. Fu.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,960
Ms. Fu, I suppose you already know

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,600
that Fu Sihan and I got back together.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
He can't live without me.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,240
I'm not running a relationship show.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,360
My time is precious.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,400
What do you want to say?

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
Fu Sihan has always been suspecting

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,880
that the car crash
wasn't an accident at all,

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
but a plot.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
He's been investigating
for all these years.

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
Not long ago,

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,080
he went to the US

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
to see someone.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,880
And that person

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
is related to the car crash.

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,320
I've heard that you used to make comics.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Don't you think
this one is a bit cliche?

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,480
He is the former president's
secretary, Yang Shan.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,080
Yang Shan told him that there was
an event data recorder in the car,

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,080
which recorded everything that happened.

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,440
Is that so?

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you trying to say
that he has the data records?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,080
It's a real pity.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
The recorder was
already destroyed, as someone's will.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
But,

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
for his own safety,

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,920
he kept another copy.

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
And that copy

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
is right here in my hand.

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,280
Do you really think

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,280
I'll believe everything you say?

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
You know what, Ms. Fu?

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,880
The car crash was caused
by brake malfunction.

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,920
And someone

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,160
had changed the braking line furtively.

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
How much do you want?

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,880
Do you think you can
get rid of me just with money?

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
Now Fu Sihan has lost the company.

53
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,960
If I can't be the wife of the president,

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,720
I want to be
the vice chairwoman of the group.

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,240
How does that sound?

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Ms. Fu.

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,880
I can help you.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
We are the same kind of people.

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,200
You have quite an ambition.

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
Fu Rong! You...

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,680
Want to blackmail me?

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,040
No way.

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,080
Today you want to be
the vice chairwoman.

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
And tomorrow you would want my seat.

65
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,720
Fu Rong, are you even human?

66
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,280
How could you do that
to your own brother?

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
He was not my real brother.

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
As long as he was alive,

69
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
the group would never be mine.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
Even if it was really me who did it,

71
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
without any evidence,

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
what can you do to me?

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Dad!

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,480
Sihan! You...

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
Dad.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Fu Rong.

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,000
How could you be so evil?

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,160
I raised you up

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
as one of my own children.

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,720
How could you do
such an abominable thing?

82
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
I suggest that you turn yourself in.

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,080
And take responsibility

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,440
for everything you've done.

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,120
Do something decent
for once in your life,

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
since we've spent
so many years together.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
I was an orphan.

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,880
I have done everything you asked
during the past 40 years.

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,760
I was always more capable
than my brother.

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,760
But you wanted to give him the company,

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
just because I'm not your own blood.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,360
You treat Yun Xiangxiang better than me,
even if you've only known her for days.

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,080
I'm always an outsider in this family.

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,760
Right?

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
Old man?

96
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Why is that?

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Why?

98
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
Why are you so stubborn?

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
You disappoint me so much!

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,040
You murdered your own kin

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,840
just for a position.

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
You are frenzied!

103
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
From now on,

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,280
we are not father and daughter anymore.

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,560
Henceforth,

106
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,680
we have no relation whatsoever.

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
And you...

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
You are on your own.
