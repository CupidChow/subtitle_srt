00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,920
It's written in the contract.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,280
You can only visit your family
at a specified time on the weekend

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,480
under the watch of my people.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Well, Fu Sihan.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,640
It was only because
there was an emergency...

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
Do you know what could've happened

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
if Fu Rong found out about that?

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Yes.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,120
Boss.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,200
I will do what the contract says.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,520
It won't happen again.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,040
Stop.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Grandpa's birthday is in a few days.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,960
Tomorrow morning,

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,400
come with me to pick a present.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Yes.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,360
Why hasn't she come yet?

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,880
I think she'll come soon.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
Should I go check?

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,880
Yeah.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm here!

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,920
You can let go all your worries, boss.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,320
During the contract period,

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,160
I'll try my very best

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
to play your fiancee.

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,600
Better keep your words.

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,680
Okay, let's go.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,200
Mr. Fu, many reporters are outside.

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,480
They want to interview you.

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,600
Mr. Fu.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,320
Miss Qin was seen
in the Obstetrics yesterday.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,800
And earlier,

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
there were news that Miss Qin
and you were secretly dating.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
Is her child yours?

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
What happened?

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
I...

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,200
She stalked me yesterday.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,800
That's why I revealed her identity.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
I didn't mean to.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,840
Please tell us the truth, Mr. Fu.

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,680
What's your relationship with Miss Qin?

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,200
There is none.

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,520
Yeah. No relationship.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,480
Nothing.

49
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,000
I can testify for that, really.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
Well, miss.

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,840
What's your relationship with Mr. Fu?

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
I...

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
She's my fiancee.

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,000
Fu Sihan!

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,160
You...

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
How could you...?

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
Well.

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
How could you do that?

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,720
That was...

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
That was my...

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
First kiss.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
You are smiling?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
What's so funny?

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,800
I never had a boyfriend.

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
And now my first kiss is taken.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,400
Miss Yun.

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
Don't say it like

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
someone took advantage of you.

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
That was my boss's first kiss too.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
You made so much trouble.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,360
I was just helping you solve them.

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
Can you be reasonable?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm here only for the money.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Now you ruined my reputation.

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
There were so many reporters.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,920
What if my mom sees some reports?

77
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,760
What do I do then?

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,560
Good morning, chairman.

79
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Good morning, Ms. Fu.

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,920
Premarital pregnancy?
How can he do that?

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
He brings disgrace on our family.

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't get mad, dad.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,640
I believe it was just
a one-time mistake.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Chairman.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
Where is Sihan?

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
He's in there.
