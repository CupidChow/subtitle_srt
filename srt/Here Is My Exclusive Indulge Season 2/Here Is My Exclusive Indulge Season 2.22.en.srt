A big star like me

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,000
wants to be with you

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,720
no matter what people would say.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,720
My feelings for you are sincere.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,600
Yun Xiangxiang.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,600
She doesn't deserve you.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,000
Dad.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,160
No hurry.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,800
Why is Sihan asking for me?

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
I don't know either.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,840
He said he'll be waiting
in the guest room.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,960
(Right, the backyard.)

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,080
(There's a door in the backyard.)

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,120
Qin Zhirou.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,760
It's still not too late to go away.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
After tonight,

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,640
the two of us

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,400
can really be together.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
(Thank God the door isn't locked.)

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,560
He's being all mysterious.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Open the door.

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,560
Yes.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
Sihan, don't.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,960
Sihan.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,440
Sihan, don't do this.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,800
That's enough, Sihan.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,960
Please don't be like this, Sihan.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,440
Sihan.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
Sihan.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,320
Don't...

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
What are you doing?

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
Today is grandpa's birthday.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
How can you do this behind our guests?

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Grandpa, Sihan had too much drink.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm taking care of him.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,160
It's okay.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,200
The best gift you can ever send me

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,920
is giving me a great grandson.

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
Dad.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,160
Let's not interrupt them.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Goodbye, grandpa!

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,920
Goodbye. Keep going.

47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,760
Yes.

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,680
This is enough, Sihan.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,400
Sihan.

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,440
After tonight,

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
we can really be together.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
(Thank God the door isn't locked.)

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
Eat this!

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
God!

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
Why am I in your bed?

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
This is not my clothes.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,280
Fu Sihan, you bad man!

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,760
There's not much to look at anyway.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
I already saw you last time.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Last night,

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
you talked in your sleep.

62
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
No way.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
What did I say?

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,440
You said,

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Sihan,

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm falling in love with you.

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
No way!

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,840
I wouldn't say that.

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,360
Did I really say that yesterday?

70
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
It's so embarrassing.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
Yun Xiangxiang, he's your boss.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,600
You are his employee.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
You can't like him.

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,320
What are you looking at?

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,800
Never seen a pretty girl before?
