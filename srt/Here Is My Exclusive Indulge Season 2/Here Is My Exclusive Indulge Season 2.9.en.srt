5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
This is all?

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,600
There are eight rules you need to obey

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,080
while living with me.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,240
First,

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,560
I don't like you.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,680
So don't expect that anything
would happen between us.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,320
You're thinking too much.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,480
Second,

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,960
I don't like nosy woman.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,360
So don't ask me about my private life.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,720
Third,

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,680
I don't like loud woman.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,600
So in this house,

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,960
you can't be louder than 40 decibels.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,120
Four...

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,000
Did you hear that?

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,680
My stomach is protesting.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,200
Then why don't you eat?

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
I don't want to eat grass.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Fourth,

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,960
you have to go along with
my eating habits.

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,680
You can't eat anything I don't like.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,520
You are a funny character...

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,560
Mr. Fu.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
What is it?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
There is a food delivery.

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,200
My river snail rice noodles!

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,760
Fifth...

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,600
Take it here!

34
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm starving.

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,640
Fifth!

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
I don't like being
interrupted while talking.

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,160
What? If I starved to death,

38
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,640
who would be listening to your rules?

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,280
Come on. Bring it here.

40
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,520
Boss.

41
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,280
This must be work injury.

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Yun Xiangxiang.

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,960
Did you forget

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,600
what the fourth rule is?

45
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,120
I forgot to tell you.

46
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I have rules too for living with me.

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,520
But,

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,000
mine is not as tiring as yours.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,720
Just one rule.

50
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Don't try to change who I am.

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm here to look for materials
for my comics.

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,560
I like being nosy
about your private life.

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,520
I like being louder than 40 decibels.

54
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,240
And I also like eating things
that you don't like.

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,760
Don't you forget.

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
We have a contract.

57
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,680
Can you afford the penalty

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,600
if you break the contract?

59
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
But now the chairman is convinced

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,240
that I'm your fiancee.

61
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
If I quit this job,

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
where are you going to
find a daughter of the Yun Group

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,160
who looks exactly like me?

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,680
This is so good.

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Delicious.

66
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,480
Do you want to try?

67
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,760
Hello.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Ma'am.

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,960
This Miss Yun
hasn't given herself away yet.

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Keep your eyes on them.

71
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
The daughter of the Yun Group?

72
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
I'll let them see who you really are

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,040
tomorrow.

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
Hello, mom. I found a new job.

75
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,880
I can only visit you on the weekend.

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,040
Be good and
do what the doctor says, okay?

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Miss Yun.

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
Bye, mom.

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,360
What is it?

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Miss Yun.

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
If there's anything
you are not satisfied with,

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
just tell me.

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,920
I think

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,600
this should work.

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,560
Okay.

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,280
Then I'll leave you to rest.

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
Okay.

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,560
Wow.

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Hello?

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,600
This is so cozy!

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
Mr. Fu really got himself a hard case.
