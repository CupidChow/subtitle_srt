5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Miss Yun.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,960
Who is this?

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,840
He's...

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,440
You want me to pretend
to be your fiancee?

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
After you play the part,

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
not only can I withdraw the appeal
against your comic company,

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,040
but I can also pay you the amount
written on the contract.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,040
Well, Mr. Fu.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,080
It's wrong to lie to people.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,480
Also,

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,480
I'll never agree to
a contract relationship.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,040
Don't you

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,640
want to use this opportunity

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,040
to get to know me?

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,920
I've read your comic.

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,080
You made us a couple in it.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,880
You misunderstood.

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,400
It's a comic based on real life.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,040
It's just imagination.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,640
No need to find excuses.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,240
You don't have to feel
embarrassed for fancying me.

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,880
What a narcissist.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,320
Well, Mr. Fu.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,640
First of all, you are
flattering yourself.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Secondly,

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,440
I chose you as
the protagonist in my comic

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,760
just because you are a famous man.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,400
And that helps attract readers.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Oh.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Is that so?

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,960
But as far as I know,

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,440
you don't really have many readers

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,800
for your comic.

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,640
You can insult me the person.

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
But you can't insult my comics.

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,840
Thank you very much.

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,240
Your comic doesn't do well

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,800
because you don't know me

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
or my real life.

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
If you pretend to be my fiancee,

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,640
you'll be able to have a peek

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,360
of what kind of life I'm living.

47
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't you want to create something

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,040
that really draws the crowds?

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
I also know that

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,120
your mom's illness costs a lot of money.

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,920
I can give her the best treatment.

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
This is my card.

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,800
Call me

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
if you're in.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
Mr. Fu.

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,400
I want to ask you something

57
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,760
before I sign the contract.

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,080
Say it.

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,440
Why did you pick me to be your fiancee?

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
Probably because

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
you are the last woman
I'll fall in love with.

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
You know what?

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,520
The hero and heroine in romance comics
always say the same thing.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,360
And they always have to
eat their own words later.

65
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm the hero, that's right.

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
But are you sure

67
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
you are the heroine?

68
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Fine.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,120
Don't worry.

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
Even if you were the only man
left on this planet,

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
I wouldn't fancy you in a million years.

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Better keep your words then.

73
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Well.

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
Now that both have made their promises,

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,720
we'll see who gets
slapped in the face first.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
Come with me tomorrow

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
to meet my grandpa.

78
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,840
Your grandpa?

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
You mean

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,360
the scariest old man in the Fu Group?
