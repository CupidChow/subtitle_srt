5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,240
Xiangxiang.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,440
Let me go with you.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,480
But I haven't told my mom about you yet.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,640
We have the agreement

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
that no one should
know about our relationship, right?

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,080
If I'm going to bring you to my mom,

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,560
the least I could do
is to tell her beforehand.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,520
Don't worry about it.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
My mom will like you for sure.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
The first woman who doesn't like me

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,560
has yet to be born.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,720
Fine.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,880
I'll be back soon.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,120
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,200
I'm off then.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,880
Be careful.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Yeah.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,320
Sis.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
Your cousin was so good to you
when he was alive.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,120
When you needed money for treatment,

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
we even lent you some money, remember?

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,400
Mom.

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,960
Auntie.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,240
Have some tea.

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,200
Be careful. It's hot.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,320
Bingbing is your cousin's only son.

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,520
Family should always
help each other, right?

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
Your daughter found
a rich husband to marry.

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
And she forgets all about her family.

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
What rich husband?

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, you lent us money.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,600
So much money.

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,680
Xiangxiang.

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,480
Xiangxiang.

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,160
Only five hundred yuan.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,840
And we gave it back the next month.

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
Plus fifty yuan of interest.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,840
Xiangxiang.

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,960
Don't talk to your elder like that.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,680
You shouldn't have said that,
Xiangxiang.

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,720
Five hundred yuan was not
a small sum ten years ago.

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,520
That was for buying a pig to offer
a sacrifice to our god of wealth.

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
But we gave it to your mom.

48
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,920
Now our financial situation
is getting worse and worse.

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,160
What if it's because
we offended our god of wealth?

50
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,120
So you two

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
are both responsible for this.

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
What exactly do you want?

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
I want to make money with you.

54
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Yeah.

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
I have a patent invention.

56
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
American stuff.

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,880
That's right.

58
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
It can turn water

59
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,360
into gasoline.

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,320
That's right.

61
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,520
You believed that?

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Do you know
how much money I've spent on it

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
and how many people I've talked to?

64
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,960
It has to be real.

65
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,320
Xiangxiang.

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
You are the fiancee of Fu Sihan.

67
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,760
Why don't you ask the Fu Group

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,960
to put some money into it for a startup?

69
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,640
We don't need much.

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,960
Just ten or twenty million.

71
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Ten or twenty...

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
Help us a little.

73
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Okay.

74
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,000
Such a good girl, Xiangxiang.

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
Auntie didn't treat you so good

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
for nothing.

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,680
Here. Check this out.

78
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
Why are you calling the police?

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm telling you.

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
Leave right now.

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
Or I'll tell the police
that you're scamming us for money.

82
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,520
Ye Qing.

83
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,320
This is the kind of daughter
you raised up.

84
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,680
She has no conscience.

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
What did you say?

86
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Are you leaving or not?

87
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Do you want me to call the police?

88
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm doing it now.

89
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,120
Just go.

90
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Are you leaving or not? Move it.

91
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
Yun Xiangxiang.

92
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
When I make big money,

93
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
you'll regret this.

94
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,720
You don't appreciate the favor at all.

95
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,680
So ungrateful.

96
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,400
Mom, don't worry.

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,880
I just told the doctors and nurses.

98
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
They won't be here

99
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,240
disturbing you anymore.

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Xiangxiang.

101
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,120
Tell me the truth.

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
The one your auntie mentioned.

103
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
Fu Sihan. Who is he?

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
What rich husband?

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
I...

106
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm in love now.

107
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,240
He's the archetype of my comic,

108
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Fu Sihan.

109
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Xiangxiang.

110
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Are you staying together

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
with someone you don't like

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,080
just for the money
to pay my treatment fees?

113
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,000
If that's the case...

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,400
No no no.

115
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,720
We'll just go home.

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,360
We'll end whatever treatment.

117
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,120
Mom, I really like him.

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
My feelings are sincere.

119
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Truly.

120
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Really?

121
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah.

122
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,080
Then I want to see him.

123
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Mom.

124
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
Mr. Fu.

125
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,720
Some people want to see you.

126
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
They said they're Miss Yun's relatives.

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
Such a big house you have here.

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,920
Your watch is so beautiful.

129
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,920
He's your brother-in-law.

130
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
Brother-in-law.

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,640
What are you doing here?
