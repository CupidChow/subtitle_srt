5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,480
Thin.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,920
Sihan?

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Why are you back?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,680
You are on your own now, Mr. Fu.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,560
Go for it.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,280
I don't think Mr. Fu knows this,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,800
but Yun Xiangxiang
always likes her hotpot spicy.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,640
It's okay.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,080
We can have a two-flavored pot.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,200
Right?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,720
What sauce do you want?

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,800
- Pepper.
- Sesame sauce.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,480
Don't bother.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,720
Xiangxiang prefers pepper too.

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,920
She likes river snails rice noodles.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,600
Stinky tofu.

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,120
Durian.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,240
Sausages.

00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,360
Salty bean curd.

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Chives, but not coriander.

25
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,720
Fried chicken with milk tea.

26
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,800
Large milk tea with full sugar and ice.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,600
How come you know so much about me?

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,520
Your mom told me.

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,480
Mr. Fu.

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
You haven't met her mom, right?

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm so full.

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
This is the free fruit.

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Enjoy.

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,280
Thank you.

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Ah.

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,440
I can do it myself.

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
Feed me.

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Ah.

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,920
You are a grown-up.

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,440
Can't you do it yourself?

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,800
We always do this at home.

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,760
Right, Xiangxiang?

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,200
This is a couple's thing we have.

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,680
You don't understand.

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,320
Ah.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Let me feed you.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,200
Mr. Fu.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiangxiang, for you.

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Xiangxiang, are you okay?

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,600
Are you okay?

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Stop!

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,000
You two are killing me!

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,800
Today is the anniversary
of our restaurant.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
We give you these headwears for couples.

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,360
Thank you.

56
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,680
For couples? I'll have this one.

57
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
Xiangxiang.

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
Send me home.

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you go home by yourself?

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
I can't.

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
No.

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
She's going home with me.

63
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,840
She promised me.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Fine.

65
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Chu He.

66
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,800
Yes.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,720
Prepare the car.

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,640
Are you two serious?
