00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,720
Chu...

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
You can take a bath by yourself?

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,360
I always thought
Chu He would do it for you.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,200
Well...

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,800
Can you please withdraw
your appeal against us?

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
It's just a comic based on real life.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
We can make alterations
if you don't like it.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,720
But you have to promise me
that you won't scream

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,680
after I let go. Blink if you promise.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,080
You promised!

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,320
You liar!

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,040
Why didn't you keep your words?

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,680
You liar!

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,160
What is it?

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,760
My goodness.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,640
Why is it you again?

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,040
No. It's not like that.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
I only did this for our company.

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
Who are you? How did you get in?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
There is no malice, seriously.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
I only did it for our comic company.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,240
Throw her out.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,120
You promised me, didn't you?

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,800
Sihan.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,120
Fu Sihan.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,800
I know you are upstairs.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,720
It's Ms. Fu.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,760
Hiding from me won't work.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,560
What do we do?

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
Go stall her.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,760
Leave this to me.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,640
Okay.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
What do you want?

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Listen.

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,440
You can't have whatever you want
just because you are rich.

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,400
I know some Karate moves.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,960
You came to me

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,520
because of the comic company, right?

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Shut up if you want to save it.

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Really?

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
Help me.

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Push the wheelchair over here.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Okay.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Ma'am.

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,160
Mr. Fu is really asleep.

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Go away.

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Auntie.

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,680
Why do you want to see me at this hour?

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,680
The date I arranged for you,

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,040
why didn't you show up?

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
There is no need.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
That girl waited for you all night.

58
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
She's a big star.

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,160
Do you think
it's polite to stand her up?

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,880
I never agreed to meet her.

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm doing this for your own good.

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
When did you start
to care so much about me, auntie?

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
I'm your auntie, your elder.

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
Please do not make decisions
like that for me anymore, auntie.

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
You...

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Fu Sihan.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
You need to stop

69
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,760
being so stubborn.

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Ever since your parents passed away,

71
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
there's no one around to look after you.

72
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,120
You're old enough
to think about marriage.

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
Your grandpa is getting old.

74
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
He's expecting to see
his great grandson.

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Both your grandpa and I
really like this girl.

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
You are the biggest grandson
in the family.

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
You have to take that responsibility.

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,000
This is not for you to decide.

79
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
I have my reasons

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,360
to say no.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
What reasons?

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Because

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
I already have a girlfriend.

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Hi.

85
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Fu Sihan.

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,640
You can't fool me
just with a random girl.

87
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,520
This is just a couple's thing we have.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,120
(According to my years of experience
making romance comics,)

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,800
(Fu Sihan must be suffering
from the pressure from his family.)

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,400
(As long as I help him now,)

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,760
(then...)

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,360
Sihan and I

93
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,080
had the most romantic
encounter in this world.

94
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Sihan.

95
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
He is the gentlest...

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,560
Throw her out.

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
The most considerate,

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
and the kindest person in the world.

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Put me down!

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,200
Then why haven't I ever heard of her?

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,680
(What now? She doesn't seem to buy it.)

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
Something is kicking me in my stomach.

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Sihan.

104
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,080
I want to eat something sour.

105
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,840
Are you...?

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Yes, it's exactly what you are thinking.

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Fu Sihan.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,080
You bring disgrace on the whole family.
