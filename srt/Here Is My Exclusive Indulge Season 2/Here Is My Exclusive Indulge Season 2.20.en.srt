00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Mr. Chu.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,360
Oh.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,720
You found me at last.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,240
How is your injury, Mr. Chu?

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,440
The president asked us to take you back.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,200
I got out of there

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,160
at the expense of my leg.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,240
Why would I go back with you now?

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,720
Go tell my dad.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
I'm very happy staying here.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
Mr. Chu.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
We have to take you back no matter what.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,240
For what?

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,240
For a life he planned for me?

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,360
What if I say I don't
want to go back today?

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,640
Please don't make this
difficult for us, Mr. Chu.

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,600
Fine. I'll go with you.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,120
What were you doing?

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,920
Why did you have to compete?

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,160
This is the result.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,400
You are so rough with me.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,640
Can't you be gentle?

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,320
I have to disinfect it.

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,120
What if you get an infection?

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
Are you worried about me?

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm just afraid
that if anything happens to you,

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,440
there'll be no one paying me.

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,440
I didn't know

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,520
you know so much about
medical treatment.

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
I've spent more time in the hospital

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,280
than at my own home.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,440
I guess I'm almost a doctor now.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Xiangxiang.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
Trust me.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360
Your mom

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,440
will be okay.

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Boss.

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,480
I didn't see anything.

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
Nothing at all.

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
I've finished wrapping the present.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,800
Please make sure it's okay.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm on my way then.

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Keep going.

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,160
Keep going, you guys.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,720
Mr. Wang.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Great.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,800
Thank you.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,160
Please come inside.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Madam.

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
Welcome. Thank you.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,880
This painting

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,640
is Mr. Guo's proudest work.

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
It took a lot of efforts for me to get.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
The banquet hasn't started yet.

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
She already let everyone
see that painting.

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,160
She wants everyone to know

64
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,640
that she paid handsome money
for that painting.

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,040
Showing off.

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Oh.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
Why hasn't Qin Zhirou come?

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,120
She used the family Fu for popularity.

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
She wouldn't feel comfortable
coming here.

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,240
She must be so embarrassed.

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
I want to thank
all the families and friends

72
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,080
for taking the time to attend
my father's birthday party.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,160
Let's raise our glasses

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,520
and have a toast to my father's health

75
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,640
and longevity.

76
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
To health

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,000
and longevity!

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Thank you.

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,520
This is just a party today.

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,240
Not some serious banquet.

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,480
I want you all to feel at home,

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
and enjoy yourselves.

83
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,480
Have fun.

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,920
Dad, I had a lot of sleepless nights

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,280
just to prepare for this party.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
Oh.

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,760
Sihan, Xiangxiang.

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,480
Why don't you show grandpa

89
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,760
the present you prepared?

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,640
Grandpa is anticipating.

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,640
It doesn't matter
what present you give me.

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
It's the intention that matters.

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Grandpa.

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,080
This is the present
Sihan and I prepared for you.

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
Oh.

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,440
Yun Xiangxiang!

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
I...
