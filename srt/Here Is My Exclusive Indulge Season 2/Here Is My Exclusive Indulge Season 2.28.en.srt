5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Why did you ask Yun Xiangxiang
to pretend as the daughter of Yun Group?

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,240
It's none of your business.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,480
Don't play dumb with me.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,680
Regarding why she stays with you,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
you know it best.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,000
Mr. Chu.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,160
Don't you think

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,520
you are like a kid

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,760
who can't get his favorite toy?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,440
So what?

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,360
I like her
no matter she likes me or not.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,040
You came back in such a hurry

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,480
because you were
worried about this, right?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Mr. Fu.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
I can stand up
to protect her at any time.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
Can you?

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,480
Stop.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,120
Wait.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,800
Leave the headwear.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,840
Xiangxiang.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,480
Don't be mad at me.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Fu Sihan.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,760
How could you just leave me there?

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
Humph!

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,240
Sorry.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
I just don't want to see him with you.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,880
You took it back?

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Because

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
this

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,560
is a couple.

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
Tsk.

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,760
Childish.

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Fu Sihan.

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,240
I've been thinking about it for a while.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,280
And I decided to bring it up.

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,400
I think

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,600
the relationship contract

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
is a bit inappropriate

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
for us

44
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,040
now.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,800
What did he tell you?

46
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Nothing.

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,840
Then why did you bring this up?

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,000
Because

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,200
why would a real couple

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,240
need a relationship contract?

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
Our contract

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
is terminated.

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,200
From now on,

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
you are my real fiancee.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Now...

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,600
It's a bit too soon.

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
For now,

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
you are just an intern boyfriend.

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
It depends on your performance

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
to become the official boyfriend.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,520
Yeah.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Fu Sihan!

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
You are cheating!

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
So...

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,320
Let's sleep

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,320
now!

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay.

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll watch you fall asleep.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
I can't fall asleep
if you are watching me.

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
Then I'll keep my eyes closed.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Yeah.

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm asleep.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Okay.

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Why are you up so early?

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
Why are there dark circles
under your eyes?

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,240
I stayed up.

79
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
Why?

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,360
What do you think?

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
I...

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
I don't know.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,840
Never mind.

84
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
You won't understand anyway.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I'll sleep in my own room

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
tonight.

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Xiangxiang, look who's with us.

88
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,600
Xiangxiang, your auntie and cousin
came to visit me.

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
Hello, Xiangxiang.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I haven't seen you for ages.

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,640
You have to treat me with dinner today.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
Why did they come?
