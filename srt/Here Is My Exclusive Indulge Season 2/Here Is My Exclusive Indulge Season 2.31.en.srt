5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,520
Leave now.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,280
Or I'll tell the police
you are trespassing.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Xiangxiang, why would you do that?

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,320
We are employees here.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,760
Even the police can't do anything to us.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,520
Right?

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,200
Right.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,760
Besides, we...

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Don't touch me.

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,720
Leave right now.

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,440
Hurry up.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
Xiangxiang, Sihan.

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,840
Hide in the kitchen! Come on!

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,440
No.

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,960
We are here to work.

20
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,520
That's right.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,240
Xiangxiang.

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Xiangxiang.

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,120
Grandpa.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Xiangxiang.

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,200
Your auntie told me

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
that your relatives are here.

27
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,080
Where are they?

28
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,600
I want to meet them.

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
They...

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,560
Hello, master.

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm Yun Xiangxiang's auntie.

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,960
This is her cousin.

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
Now we are families.

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,880
Mr. Fu is your grandson.

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
Bingbing is your grandson too.

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,720
Call grandpa, Bingbing.

37
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,840
Hurry.

38
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Grandpa.

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,280
Xiangxiang.

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
What is this?

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,360
Grandpa...

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Boss.

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
You really didn't have to

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
go all the way to buy it this early.

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Their stinky tofu
is the most famous here.

46
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
But they don't have delivery service.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
Xiangxiang will be very happy

48
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
when she sees this.

49
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,680
Boss.

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,960
I really can't

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,360
stand the scent anymore.

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
It stinks so much.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,600
That's everything

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
that happened.

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,960
I'm not the daughter of the Yun family.

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,560
I used that identity

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
to marry into your family.

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
But Sihan,

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,320
he has nothing to do with it.

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
They like each other so much.

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
Nothing else matters.

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
Now that we will be families,

63
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
we won't charge you

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,720
for the patent invention.

65
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,640
We can start the business together.

66
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,440
Wait, mom.

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
You can't do that.

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,600
It's my patent.

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,840
I have to charge for it.

70
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
I have the final say.

71
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,080
No.

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,840
I'm the one to decide...

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,600
Shut up, you two.

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Dad.

75
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't think it's that simple.

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
Yun Xiangxiang is just an ordinary girl.

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,400
It can't be so easy
to pretend to be a high-born.

78
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,880
There must be someone else behind this.

79
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Yun Xiangxiang,

80
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,680
who told you to do this?

81
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,440
I did everything

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
by myself.

83
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,040
Fu Sihan has nothing to do with it.

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
Grandpa.

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,640
Everything she said is true?

86
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Listen to me, grandpa.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
The whole thing

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
started because of me.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
It has nothing to do with Xiangxiang.

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
No, grandpa, it's all because of me.

91
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,240
Not Sihan.

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
Don't say anything, Xiangxiang.

93
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,920
Stop! All of you!

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Don't be mad, grandpa.

95
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

96
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,320
I'm so sorry.

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm tired.

98
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Miss Yun.

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Just go.

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
From now on,

101
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
you are not welcome here.

102
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,480
Grandpa!

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,120
Dad!

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Grandpa!

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Grandpa!

106
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,520
Doctor!

107
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,160
Hurry!

108
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,360
Call the doctor!
