00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,960
Yun Xiangxiang!

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,920
I...

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
I never thought you could get
the seal engraving by Mr. Guo.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,720
This is great.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,440
Everybody thinks

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,080
that Mr. Guo is best at his painting.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,720
But actually, he's
most skilled at seal engraving.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,920
Unfortunately,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,960
he never sells any of his seals.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,760
That's the reason

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,240
why I had to buy his paintings

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
for the seal prints on them.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,560
Xiangxiang.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,160
I never thought
you could get this from him.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,040
The name of the daughter
of the family Yun

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,880
is worthier than mine.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
You are embarrassing me, grandpa.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,840
This present.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,680
I like it very much.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm glad that you like it, grandpa.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,960
Mr. Guo and I had a special encounter.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,480
I asked him

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,800
to engrave the word
"longevity" in Chinese.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,560
I wish grandpa
a wealthy and healthy life,

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,960
and many many offspring to come.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,560
I already have wealth.

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,760
I'll have to count on Sihan and you

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
for the offspring.

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Mr. Fu.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,720
The Chu Group sent someone here
for the Chairman's birthday.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Should we go greet him?

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,920
He's so handsome!

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,320
Is this the young master
of Chu Group, Chu Beiye?

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,400
He looks so handsome!

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,720
Chu Beiye...

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
Mr. Chairman.

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,960
Do you remember me?

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm Chu Beiye.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,960
You are a big man now, Chu.

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
I wish you health and longevity

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
on behalf of the Chu Group.

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
This Sayings of the Confucian School
is hand-copied by my father.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,840
It's a gift for your birthday.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Chu Beiye should know
Yun Xiangxiang's real identity.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,880
My favorite saying is,

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
words must be honest,

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
and deeds must be faithful.

52
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Yes.

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,320
It's also our family motto.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
Yun Xiangxiang is from the family Yun.

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
But you have to keep it
in your heart too

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
after you join our family.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,040
You have to be an honest person,

58
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
and do honest things.

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
I understand, auntie.

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,160
This must be Mr. Fu's fiancee,

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,840
the daughter of Yun Group, Miss Yun.

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,160
Yes, she is.

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
Mr. Chu.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
Nice to meet you.

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
Let's have fun, everyone.

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Enjoy yourselves.

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
No restraints.

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
Miss Yun.

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,240
May I dance with you?

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,800
Xiangxiang.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,520
Mr. Chu is our guest.

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
You should dance with him.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,320
Mr. Fu.

74
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,120
I'll borrow your fiancee for a while.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,360
Mr. Fu.

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,240
I just made this drink for you.

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Please have a taste.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,120
Mr. Fu.

79
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,480
The Chairman has something
to tell you in private.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
He wants to meet you in the guest room.

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
I see.

82
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
You didn't expect

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
to see me here, did you?

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
I didn't expect

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,440
that you are the successor of Chu Group.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
There's a lot you didn't expect.

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
Do you regret now?

89
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
Anyway,

90
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
I have my reasons to do this.

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
I hope

92
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,680
you won't ruin it for me.

93
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
You are so terrified?

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,840
Don't worry.

95
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,160
I won't tell the Chairman or your mom.

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
No matter why you pretend
to be someone else,

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,320
I believe you have your reasons.

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
I also believe

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
you won't use it to hurt others.

100
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
Thank you, Chu Beiye.

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,520
Xiangxiang.

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
Let's have another dance.

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,680
I have to go now.

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,760
Xiangxiang.

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,920
Mr. Chu.

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Have a drink with us.

108
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,040
I've heard so much about you.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's have a drink.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Let's go.

111
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Why are you here?

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
Why can't I be here?

113
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,920
Sihan.

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,960
We've known each other for so long.

115
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Don't you think

116
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
you are a bit too cruel to me?

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Qin Zhirou.

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
You drugged me.
