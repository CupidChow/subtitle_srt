5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,080
How is grandpa?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,400
Thankfully, he is blessed.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,560
Otherwise,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,320
he would've been dead
because of you two.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,320
I'll go see him.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,200
Wait.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,720
He said

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,800
he doesn't want to see you.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,840
Yun Xiangxiang,

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,760
he asked for you.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,640
Fu Sihan,

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,520
why would you do that?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,360
If you didn't like the girls
I introduced to you,

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,680
you could just tell me frankly.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
There's no need to get a fake fiancee.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,720
Now you've made a mess.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,240
I feel so sorry for you.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,880
Feel sorry for me?

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
That's right.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,360
I wound up in this wheelchair

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,160
because you felt sorry for me.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,880
I don't know what you mean.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,840
There's no one else here.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Why bother pretending?

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,560
Fu Sihan.

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,720
You are not trying to get me
to say something, are you?

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,960
You think I'll fall into your trap?

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,760
It's been years since the accident.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
But believe me,

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
the evidence hasn't all gone yet.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,920
Stop trying to sound tough.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,320
What for?

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,560
You can hardly save yourself now.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
Xiangxiang.

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,280
What did grandpa say to you?

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,920
Sihan.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,680
Let's break up.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
What do you mean?

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,520
I'll explain everything to grandpa now.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,320
Don't.

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
I already told him

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
that I lied to you.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,640
I think

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
it's time for me to leave.

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
I won't let you leave.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
I'll go tell him everything right now.

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
This is my own choice.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,080
You...

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
Are you sure you want to leave me?

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,760
Sihan.

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,600
During the time I've spent with you,

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,480
I was really happy.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,200
But grandpa needs you.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,000
This family needs you.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,160
You have your responsibility.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
Forget me.

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
You'll meet someone

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
who's much better.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Miss.

64
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Are you looking for anyone?

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,840
No, no.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
I'm just...

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,640
Enjoying the view.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Is it her?

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,520
You are the last woman
I'll fall in love with.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Don't you worry.

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760
Even if you were the only man
left on this planet,

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,440
I wouldn't fancy you.

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,400
What are you doing?

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Put me down!

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,880
There are eight rules you need to obey

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
while living with me.

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
I have rules too for living with me.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Just one rule.

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't try to change who I am.

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
The dress is nice.

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,960
But you lack some elegance.

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
You...

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
What are you doing?

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
You had a few drops there.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,680
(This is the first time I've seen)

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
(Mr. Fu cares so much about a girl.)

87
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, miss.

88
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,280
What's your relationship with Mr. Fu?

89
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
She's my fiancee.

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Let me have a look.

91
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
Let me see.

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,280
You said,

94
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Sihan,

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm falling in love with you.

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Yun Xiangxiang.

97
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
He's your boss.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
You are his employee.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,480
You can't like him.

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,320
Call me Han.

101
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Whatever you like,

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,280
that is the rule.

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,640
All the dreams you had in your comic,

104
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll realize them for you one by one.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,480
Why would a real couple

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,920
need a relationship contract?
