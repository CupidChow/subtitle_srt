00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,040
If Fu Rong knows

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,360
that there's no copy in the flash disk,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,360
what will she think?

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,720
She has done so many awful things.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,320
The police took her away.

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,440
This is what she deserves.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,120
Well...

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,760
Grandpa must be very sad

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,360
right now.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,960
Then why don't we do something

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,320
that can make him happy?

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,560
Xiangxiang.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,920
Will you marry me?

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,880
Perfect.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,840
Captivating.

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
Beautiful.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Mom.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Why do you smile like that?

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
My daughter is finally getting married.

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,320
At last.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,200
At last.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,880
Everyone else cries
when the daughter gets married.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,520
Only you would look so happy.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Of course I'm happy.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,040
What if Fu Sihan bullies me?

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,640
Only you would bully him.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,600
My little girl.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,360
Why do you take his side, mom?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
He's not your child.

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,520
I am.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, okay.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,120
Sihan.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,840
Grandpa.

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
If your dad

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,840
could live to this day and see this,

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
how nice would that be?

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
Now grandpa wants you two

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
to give me a great-grandson

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,960
in the summer.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,320
This is your mission.

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,280
Grandpa.

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
There's so little time.

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm afraid we won't make it.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
You have to.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Yes, grandpa.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
You have my word.
