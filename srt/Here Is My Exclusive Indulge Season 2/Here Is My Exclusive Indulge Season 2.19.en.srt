5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Chu Beiye.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,920
Actually, I meant

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,920
that it's good too to have no one.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,000
No.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
I didn't mean that.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,520
Don't misunderstand me.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,560
I meant...

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,120
It's fine.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm not overthinking.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,640
Do you prefer Chinese or western food?

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
Your mom asked me to
treat you with a meal.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,320
My mom...

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,120
She always wants to introduce to me

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,400
every available guy.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,240
She overthought when she saw you.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
You don't have to mind her.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,640
What if she's not overthinking?

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
You want to know who I am, right?

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm...

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Xiangxiang.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
Sihan, why are you here?

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
So you are the one

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,760
who's around her a lot recently.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,120
(What's the relationship)

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
(between them?)

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,000
This is a little awkward.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,160
Let me introduce you.

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,880
This is Fu Sihan.

33
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,880
I work for him.

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,720
This is Chu Beiye.

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,120
He's my mom's wardmate.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm a friend of Ms. Ye.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,720
Nice to meet you.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,320
I sense some male competition here.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,640
Okay.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Now you know each other.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,760
Xiangxiang.

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
I already took care of

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,840
the reports.

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,400
Your mom won't see them.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,720
Don't worry.

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,760
What reports?

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
None of your business.

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,240
Xiangxiang.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,400
I will play games with your mom

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,720
and keep her happy.

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't worry.

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,600
That's it for today's encounter.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm leaving now. Bye, guys.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Miss Yun.

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
Look at them.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
You don't know anything about men.

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,120
Mr. Fu.

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's have a duel as men.

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,480
I don't take advantage of the disabled.

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,800
You can use electric wheelchair.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,720
Don't think so highly of yourself.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,240
Whoever reaches the end first wins.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Who do you wish to win the game?

64
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,720
I wish...

65
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't be childish!

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
No!

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
He surpassed our boss!

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,160
No!

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Come on, boss!

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Come on! Keep going!

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
You are always arguing.

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,120
But now you sincerely want him to win.

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
He won!

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,120
Only who stands till the last second

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,280
is the real winner.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,440
It's no fun. I'm out.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Hold on.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
Your legs are fine now?

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,320
Then why were you still in a wheelchair?

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
I think it's fun.

81
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
Can't I?

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Next time,

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
I won't lose.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,760
Why do I feel
that you know each other well?

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
You two knew each other?

86
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,640
He's just a childish guy.

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
You are not any better.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,880
Childish.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
You hurt your hand, boss.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,520
It's nothing.

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,320
M... My hand is bleeding!

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Let me take a look.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
What did you do?

94
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
Why are you so careless?

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
I must be the best matchmaker
in the world.
