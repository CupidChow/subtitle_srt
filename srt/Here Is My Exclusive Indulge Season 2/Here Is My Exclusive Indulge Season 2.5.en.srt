5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,320
How was it? I got the job done, right?

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
I did what you asked.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,080
You have to help our comic company.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,280
You have to keep your promise.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,720
What's wrong with you?

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
My liver hurts.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,880
That's not where your liver is, sir.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,520
What's your name?

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,200
Yun Xiangxiang. Very poetic, isn't it?

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
Miss Yun.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,760
Do you know how many years
in prison awaits you

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,120
for trespassing?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,360
What?

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,000
What do you mean by that?

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,920
But I'll let it pass

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,680
since you helped me just now.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,840
So,

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
you agreed to withdraw your appeal?

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,400
That's another matter.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
Chu He.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,760
Don't let me see your face ever again.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
Otherwise you'll really
have a chat with the police.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,080
Fu Sihan, you liar!

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,720
You bad man! Crook!

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,600
You are a fraud!

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,360
Grandpa.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Sihan.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,160
Do you have anything else to say?

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,480
This is a misunderstanding.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Misunderstanding? No way!

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,320
I saw her on your bed with my own eyes!

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,720
Shut up!

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,040
This is not how you act as an elder!

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
Sit down!

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Sihan.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Keep going.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,760
She is not pregnant.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,200
On that day,

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
she was just feeling ill.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,680
You are the biggest grandson
in the family.

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
You have to always remember who you are.

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,240
And be careful with what you do.

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Yes.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Not every girl is entitled

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,280
to be the wife of
the biggest grandson in our family.

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,880
What's her background?

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
I want to meet her.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Grandpa.

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,520
We just started dating not long ago.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Perhaps...

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
After some more time...

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,120
She's not just a random stranger
you met, is she?

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,240
She's not a random stranger.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,720
She's...

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,400
She's the daughter of the Yun Group.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,640
Yun Group?

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,760
The Yun Group has always been abroad.

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,320
I've only heard of them,

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
but never had the chance to get closer.

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,720
I still think Zhirou is a better choice.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,360
Gentle, intelligent, virtuous.

66
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
And a big star.

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Her dad has worked
for our group for years.

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,560
He's very loyal to our group.

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
To our group,

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,880
or to you?

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Watch your mouth.

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,880
Yes.

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
Well then,

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
just bring that girl here

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
to see me.

76
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,040
No?

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Of course, grandpa.

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,360
Sihan.

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
At the shareholders' meeting today,

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,200
I have announced to everyone

81
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
that I'll decide who will be
the successor of this family

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
in three months.

83
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
I hope you can make every move

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,560
with acumen and discretion.

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
Do not make grandpa

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
disappointed in you.

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Xiangxiang.

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,920
You are here.

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,880
Yeah.

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,160
So miserable...

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,880
Mom!

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,200
What happened?

93
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,560
Did your doctor say anything?

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
Is your condition getting worse?

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Don't be scared, mom.

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,080
I'll be with you no matter what happens.

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
What happened?

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Such a miserable life for the heroine.

99
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Mom, can you stop being so childish?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Don't watch those crappy, childish,
no-good-at-all romance dramas.

101
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
Why don't you read my comics?

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Your melodrama comic

103
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,440
is so unreal.

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,680
You need to find a boyfriend

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,880
and have some real life experience.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
Okay, okay.

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Here.

108
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,920
One more sip.

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,640
What's in the soup? It tastes funny.

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,920
What did you put in there?

111
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,960
This is the best soup
you'll ever get to taste.

112
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
Here we have the creatures

113
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,800
up in the sky, down on the earth,
and deep in the ocean.

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,280
I got all of them in this one pot.

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,880
And they are?

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,400
Chicken, pork, and turtle.

117
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Go get married and learn to cook.

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
This is a nightmare.

119
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,320
You...

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
Mom, I put a lot of efforts into this.

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Another sip.

122
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,680
Come on.

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
Do it for me.

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
What happened to him?

125
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,200
He jumped out of the building.

126
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
He should be
in the orthopedics department nearby.

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
We'll just leave him here for a minute

128
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
until we get a bed for him.

129
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
What are you looking at?

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,880
You...

131
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss Yun.

132
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,200
Who is this?

133
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
He's...
