5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,600
You want to marry Fu Sihan.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,520
So I took you into the family,

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,520
and handed you the opportunity.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
But you messed it up yourself.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,320
Now you came to me again.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,880
What can I do?

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,920
Fu Rong.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,040
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,880
I was reported
on going to the Obstetrics.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,280
My agent had already kept things down.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,120
It was you
who got those reports published again.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,400
But you still worked with me
after knowing that.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,640
You just want to use me
to get rid of Yun Xiangxiang.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,000
So you can marry him.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,840
Of course.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,840
Fu Rong.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,280
You are just an adopted daughter.

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,560
Sihan is the future Chairman.

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,960
And I want to be

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,640
the real

25
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,320
Chairman's wife.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,080
Fu Rong, you just wait.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm not done with you.

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Who does she think she is?

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,520
Wow!

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,400
River snails rice noodles, stinky tofu,

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
and durian layer cake.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm the happiest person in the world!

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,440
There are all for you.

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,200
Go ahead.

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,920
There are eight rules you need to obey
while living with me.

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
You have to go along with
my eating habits.

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
You can't eat anything I don't like.

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,360
From now on,

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,400
there's only one rule.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,840
Whatever you like,

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
that is the rule.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Go ahead.

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Oh, Fu Sihan.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,920
I've always wanted to ask you this.

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Call me Han.

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,880
Just like in your comic.

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
I can't.

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,640
I really can't.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Han.

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
What did you say?

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,320
I didn't hear you.

52
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
Han.

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
OK?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,760
Yes.

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Ask away.

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,120
I want to ask

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
what happened to your legs?

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
My legs.

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,480
They got injured in the car crash
seven years ago.

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
I know.

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Even your father...

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I've been thinking.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,560
If I didn't

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
ask my father to take me on the trip,

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,520
he wouldn't have died.

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
I know I'm difficult to be with.

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
But everything I do

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
is to protect myself.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,240
It's okay.

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,560
In the future,

71
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll be the one to protect you.

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
There's news from the United States.

73
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
Yes.

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,440
Okay.

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Mr. Fu.

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,800
Just like I thought.

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
That car crash

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,880
wasn't an accident at all.

79
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
It was her?

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
So we...

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
I lived under disguise for so long

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
just for today.

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
He said he'll hand me
the evidence in person.

84
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,320
Buy a ticket for me.

85
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm going to the United States.

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
Should we tell Miss Yun

87
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,360
about your legs?

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
No.

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,720
The more she knows,

90
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
the more dangerous it is for her.

91
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,760
That's a risk

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
I cannot take.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,440
You sleep like a little piggy,

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,360
just like yesterday.

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
You don't even know
when you get carried to the bed.

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Xiangxiang.

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,760
All the dreams you had in your comic,

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll realize them for you one by one.
