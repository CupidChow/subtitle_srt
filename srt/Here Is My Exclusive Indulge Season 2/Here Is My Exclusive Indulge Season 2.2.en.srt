Are you okay, Miss?

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,880
Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm sorry.

Here, get up.

It's you again?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,840
Hi.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,200
Such a coincidence, isn't it?

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,320
No, it isn't.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,120
Can't you see what you did to my trunk?

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,560
Are you stalking us again?

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,480
No, I'm not.

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,480
What exactly do you want?

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,040
No, this is pure coincidence.

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,000
I swear.

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,840
Whatever you say,

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,720
stalking plus rear-end collision,

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,680
I'll have to call the police.

22
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,200
No. Don't.

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
I really wasn't stalking you.

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,080
Listen to me.

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
I can pay for the damage.

26
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,480
Let go.

27
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,360
Don't call...

28
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,880
I beg you, sir.

29
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Let go!

30
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,280
I can pay for the damage.

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,280
Chu He.

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,080
We're in a hurry. Let her go.

33
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,800
Yes, Mr. Fu.

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,840
(Fu Sihan is so kind.)

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,360
(He's just as perfect as I imagined.)

36
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,360
Chief.

37
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,600
What happened?

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,320
Oh, Chief.

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,520
Why did you bring your kid here again?

40
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,920
Come here.

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,040
What is it?

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
You made big trouble for us.

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
People will kill me if I dare go out.

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,400
Don't be so dramatic, Chief.

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
What happened on earth?

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,440
You got sued by the Fu family

47
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
for the comic you made.

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
They sued us for infringement. Look.

49
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:45,115
(Lawyer's letter)

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,560
We got sued by such powerful people.

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,400
My dream of publishing national comics

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,920
was nipped in the bud.

53
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,520
Chief.

54
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
How about this?

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
How about

56
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,360
giving me my pay
for the last two months first?

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,040
Are you nuts?

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,400
I...

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
You brought such trouble to my company.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,240
And now you are asking for money?

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,280
It was you who asked me
to make a comic based on him.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,800
How is it all my fault?

63
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,640
I told you to draw based on him.

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,920
It's to make a comic based on his looks.

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't ask you to use his own name!

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Are you stupid?

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,760
Well, I...

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh, my sweetie.

69
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
Here. Have some milk, my baby.

70
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
I'm going broke now.

71
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,320
My wife ran away with another guy.

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
I only got 250 Yuan in my bank card.

73
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't even afford the milk for my kid.

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,880
And it's all because of your comic.

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,880
But what am I supposed to do?

76
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
You have a mom to love you, right?

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
He has none.

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,320
You have a dad to love you too, right?

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
He's going to have none.

80
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
You never had an empty stomach, right?

81
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
This is his last bottle of milk.

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,320
Please help us.

83
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,120
Get up, Chief.

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,600
Don't do this to me. Get up.

85
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,920
I beg you.

86
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
Chief.

87
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
Fine.

88
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll try.

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,960
My savior! Please accept our gratitude.

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
Don't worry, Chief.

91
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll think of something.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
Here is 100 Yuan.

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Take it.

94
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,760
Buy some milk for your son.

95
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
It's not quite enough.

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,600
Hello. Ma'am.

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
Who are you looking for?

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,880
Well...

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm looking for Mr. Fu.

100
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,560
Sihan. That's right.

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,240
I see.

102
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,960
He has brought me in here before.

103
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't you recognize me?

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,640
Oh.

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Well.

106
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Miss.

107
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Do you see that pile of
registration books?

108
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
All the girls who have registered there

109
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,800
said that they knew Mr. Fu.

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,720
Perhaps you can register first.

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Wait in line.

112
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,680
And we'll call you when it's your turn.

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,600
So many?

114
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,760
How long am I expected to wait?

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
About three to five months.

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
Three to five months?

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,080
I really have an emergency.

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Just for this once.

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Listen to me.

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
I just saw him this morning.

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,760
Well, Miss.

122
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
My advice is,

123
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,680
you should go live your own life.

124
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,200
Work hard. Rest well.

125
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,720
And stop having those fantasies.

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
I don't have any fantasies.

127
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,360
I really saw him this morning.

128
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,720
And I...

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
I know.

130
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
Just tell him this is just for once.

131
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I swear I'll be quick.

132
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,720
I swear.

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,320
Let go.

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,960
Let go.

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Goodbye.

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
One more crazy lady.

137
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
Hey.

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,000
Which floor are you going?

139
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
Fifth floor.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Stop.

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
What are you doing?

142
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
You again? How did you get in?

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
I want to see Mr. Fu...

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
For an emergency.
