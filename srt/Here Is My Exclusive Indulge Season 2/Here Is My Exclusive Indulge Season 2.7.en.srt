5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Why are you so tensed up?

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm a little nervous.
I want to go to the toile...

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,920
The bathroom.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,560
Go straight and turn left.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Hurry up.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Grandpa doesn't like waiting.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,200
Yes. I'll be right back.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Mr. Fu.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,120
Do you think Miss Yun can do the job?

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
We'll see.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
I did go through here, didn't I?

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,200
Right. This is the place.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,280
I thought Fu Sihan's house is huge.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,440
But this place is humongous.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,320
Where is it?

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
Is everyone here equipped

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
with a GPS or something?

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,920
They never get lost?

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,640
Where is it?

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Hello, grandpa.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,680
Can you please tell me
how to get to the main hall?

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,000
How do I open this thing?

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,000
Let me help you, grandpa.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,240
I'm an expert in opening durians.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,240
That's great.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,360
Here.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,280
Grandpa, why would they
ask an elder like you

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,680
to do something like this?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
It's outrageous.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,040
This is for you, grandpa.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,320
What is your name, young lady?

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,040
My name is Yun Xiangxiang.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,960
Good name.

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Xiangxiang, come join me.

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
No, grandpa. I think I'll pass.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,040
Thank you though.

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,360
Don't be shy. Just take it.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
Here.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,440
Thank you, grandpa.

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,960
Oh, grandpa.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
How do I get to the main hall?

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,480
I have to get there quickly.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
Ah.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,800
What's the hurry?

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
What's so scary there?

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Grandpa.

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
You don't know it.

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,960
I have to meet someone later.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,080
The Chairman of the Fu Group.

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
I heard

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
that he's very furious.

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Erratic as well.

57
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,680
He's really difficult to deal with.

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Is that

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
what people say about him?

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right.

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,200
Just thinking of him

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
would make me shiver.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
Hey.

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
You are a lovely little girl.

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,520
He will like you.

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Really?

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,520
Don't be nervous. Just be yourself.

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
Great. I'm off then, grandpa.

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,520
Bye.

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh, grandpa.

71
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
How do I get to the main hall again?

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
That way.

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,920
Thank you, grandpa.

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
I'm leaving now. Bye.

75
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,120
Grandpa, too many durians
will do harm to you in your age.

76
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Keep it light.

77
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,680
Bye.

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,920
Okay, I will.

79
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
I will.

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Where did you get this?

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,040
A grandpa in the backyard gave it to me.

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
Grandpa?

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,600
What grandpa?

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,920
Grandpa?!

85
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,720
Xiangxiang, right?

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,920
You have a good taste, Sihan.

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,520
Xiangxiang.

88
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,160
The durians are really good.

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Have a taste.

90
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh, okay.

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,840
It's good. Very good.

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Thank you, grandpa.

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
Dad.

94
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
You know her?

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Yes. Just now.

96
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
Right?

97
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,400
Dad, don't you find it weird?

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,480
Sihan never had a girlfriend.

99
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,360
But now here comes a fiancee.

100
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,160
And she's the daughter of the Yun Group

101
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,680
that rarely shows up here.

102
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,720
What do you mean?

103
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,720
I have a picture of
the real daughter of the Yun Group.

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
Dad.

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Have a look.
