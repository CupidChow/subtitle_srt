5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,560
Grandpa said

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,760
he would appoint me as the chairman.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
But there is a condition.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,160
I can't see you

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,320
for the rest of my life.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,880
You should do

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,800
as he said.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,960
I refused.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,920
Because I can't imagine

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,160
a life

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,080
without you.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Seven years ago,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
my father took me out on a trip

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
and a car accident happened.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,680
My father passed away.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
And my legs

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,680
were heavily injured

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,480
and I wound up in a wheelchair.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
I suspect that

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,440
it was Fu Rong
who messed with the brake.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Because she wanted my father's position.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,240
She would do anything
to get what she wants.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
Nobody could help me back then.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,160
So I had to make myself look weak

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,200
to make her put her guard down.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,200
I pretended
that my cripple was hopeless.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
I moved out of the family house

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,320
to stay away from her.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,000
I had had physical rehab for years

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
until my legs fully recovered.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,200
I went to the US last time

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
to meet my father's
then secretary, Yang Shan.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,840
He told me that it was Fu Rong
who planned the car crash.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,040
But she has destroyed
every piece of evidence.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,160
I have to trick her into
admitting what she's done.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
And I need your help.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
For all these years,

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,840
it's like I live in a huge ice cave.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,280
I couldn't feel any warmth

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
until you showed up.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
You are like sunshine

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
that comes into my life.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
You drove away the darkness

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,600
and melted the ice on my heart.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
Money.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
Power.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,760
Status.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
They all became pointless

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,480
because you came.

54
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,080
Xiangxiang.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm willing to give up everything

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,920
just to be with you.

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,640
This is my biggest secret.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Now,

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
there's no secret between us anymore.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,360
Xiangxiang.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Don't turn me down.

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
And don't leave me anymore.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
Okay?

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
I love you.

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Fu Sihan.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,760
I love you too.

67
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,280
That time

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,080
when we came back from grandpa's house,

69
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,680
did you carry me back to our place?

70
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
Did you

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
change my clothes?

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
Everything I should see

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,360
or shouldn't see,

74
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,160
I've seen them all.

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Sihan.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,280
You bad man.
