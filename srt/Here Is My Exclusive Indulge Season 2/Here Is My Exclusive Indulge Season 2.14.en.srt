(Obstetrics)

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Wow! Isn't this the big star Qin Zhirou?

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
Everybody, come and look!

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
She's so beautiful!

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,840
Run! Run!

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
No one is healing you!

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm dead!

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,560
Again.

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
Mom.

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,520
I lost!

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,120
Ugh! I lost!

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,000
Mom.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,080
Xiangxiang.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,400
I just talked to the doctor
about your new treatment.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
We have settled it.

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,160
Good.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,880
Let me introduce you.

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,920
This is my daughter, Xiangxiang.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
This is Chu, Chu Beiye.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,440
So you were the "mummy" I met before.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,840
Yeah.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,920
But I'm a friend of your mom now.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,240
You can call me uncle.

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,880
Chu.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
Let's have another round.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Sis.

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Do you know how many times we've lost?

32
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
Please spare me.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
I really can't bring you to win.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
You are a bad gamer. Don't blame others.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
What did you say?

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
Who are you to call me bad?

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I said that.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
You are a bad gamer.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
Come, my girl.

40
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Help me restore my dignity.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
You play with him this time.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Let's do it and see who's a bad gamer.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm totally in.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Let's do it.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,320
First blood!

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,880
Double kill!

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,640
Triple kill!

48
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,880
Wow.

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,680
Victory!

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
Who's the bad gamer?

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Great!

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,960
My daughter is amazing.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,760
No way.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,000
Dignity restored!

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Okay, mom.

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,880
I should go now.

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
Work's waiting.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
Please be good.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,680
Eat on time, take your pills,
and listen to the doctors.

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Got it?

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
Okay. I'm leaving now.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
And mister.

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Don't always ask my mom
to play games with you.

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Miss. That's a wildly unfair accusation.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,080
It's your mom
who always asks me to play with her.

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Okay, stop nagging.

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
Back to your work.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
Just go.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
Chu.

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,520
Chu.

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,880
Where's my phone?

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Grandpa! Are you okay?

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,800
Doctor! Nurse!

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
Come! Quick!

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
Get him up first.

78
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
Be careful. Easy.

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Take it easy.

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
Are you okay, grandpa?

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Here.

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,800
Slow down.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,000
Your phone.

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Thanks.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Can I have your WeChat?

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
We can play together next time.

87
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,640
I don't play with a bad gamer.

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
Bye.
