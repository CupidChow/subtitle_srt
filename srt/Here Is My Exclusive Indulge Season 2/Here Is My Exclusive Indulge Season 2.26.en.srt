5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,520
Ms. Fu, I beg you.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,400
Don't ask me to set them up anymore.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,800
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,200
Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
What's the matter with you?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,760
He's not lying.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,160
He's telling the truth.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,400
I shouldn't have switched
the materials for money.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,760
But I had no choice.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,320
Fu Rong threatened me.

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,440
Why did she do that?

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,480
I don't know.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,080
She said

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
all I have to do is to embarrass

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,200
Fu Sihan's fiancee.

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,120
I've worked so many years

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,480
for Chu Group.

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,400
Please forgive me.

24
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,240
I can do that

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
as long as you do exactly what I say.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,560
Okay.

27
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,680
Anything you say.

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,760
Anything.

29
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,640
You madman.

30
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Who are you calling a madman?

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,280
You!

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
You set me up!

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
Guards!

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Throw him out!

35
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,640
Good job.

36
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
You brought such disgrace

37
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,440
on our family.

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Dad.

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
I was wrong.

41
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,360
You did contemptible things
just for power,

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,800
regardless of the reputation
of our family.

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,560
I had so much expectation on you.

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,800
You disappointed me.

45
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
Grandpa.

46
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Are you okay?

47
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
Don't be mad.

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,800
I announce

49
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,200
the revocation of Fu Rong's position

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
as the Vice Chairwoman.

51
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,400
Dad.

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
Effective immediately.

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,720
Dad!

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,480
Dad, I can explain!

55
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Dad!

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Yun Xiangxiang,

57
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,200
I have to get rid of you.

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,880
Chu Beiye, thank you so much,

59
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
this time.

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
I didn't help you for free.

61
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,600
You need to return the favor.

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,520
Okay. Say it.

63
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
What do you want?

64
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
I want something

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,680
you can't give me.

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
What?

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Nothing.

68
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,480
Your mom asked you to
treat me with a meal, remember?

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,880
I want you to have dinner with me,
play with me,

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
and send me home tonight.

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,200
But...

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,440
Look.

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm the fiancee of Fu Sihan now.

74
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,280
What if someone sees us going out?

75
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,840
Fu Sihan.

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
It was Chu Beiye
who helped you this time.

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,400
Oh.

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Your mom doesn't know about
Fu Sihan and you, right?

79
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,040
Maybe I should...

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,040
Chu Beiye, you...

81
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,840
What's wrong with you?

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,640
It's so unbearable
to have dinner with me?

83
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,280
No.

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,200
These dishes are about the same
as in Fu Sihan's place.

85
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,520
I don't like eating these.

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Fu Sihan again.

87
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,840
Can you stop mentioning him
when you are with me?

88
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
What do you want to eat?

89
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,920
Hotpot. I want hotpot.

90
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,400
There's nothing like
hotpot in the winter.

91
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
No problem.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
Wow.

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
Please enjoy.

94
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
This is so great.

95
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,200
You want spicy or thin broth?

96
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,040
Spicy.

97
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Thin.

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
Sihan?

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Why are you back?
