5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,600
Miss Yun still hasn't come?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,880
Never mind her.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,440
I found it out.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,240
Miss Yun's mother had
a new therapeutic scheme

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,040
waiting for her to settle yesterday.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
That's why she went back in a hurry.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,080
So, everything about her mother

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,880
is settled now?

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,560
Chu He.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,240
Do you think

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,000
I've been too strict

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,440
on Xiangxiang today?

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,440
No.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
You made great sacrifice today too,

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,040
boss.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,080
Boss.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,680
You are not reminiscing, are you?

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,040
Chu He!

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,120
How could you?

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
Ah.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,840
Why am I thinking about that?

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
Call me Han.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,160
Han.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
Ay.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,240
Don't think about him anymore!

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
You are so cute.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,720
Why are you here?

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,800
What's your name?

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,080
Do you like it?

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,160
Yeah.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
Why are you here?

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,400
I adopted this cat.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Its name is Nuannuan.

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,920
Just like in your comic.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't know how to keep a cat.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
You should be better at it.

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,200
Can you take care of it for me?

42
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Sure.

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
I really like kittens.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,040
No.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,040
You are being weird today.

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Why are you being so nice to me today?

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
I went too far

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,360
yesterday.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,280
I apologize.

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
No.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,440
It's fine.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
Actually,

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
it's not entirely your fault.

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Well.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,720
Now you have Nuannuan.

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,320
You will take good care of it,

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,720
right?

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Yeah.

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
I definitely will.

60
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,680
Is that right? Nuannuan?

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,040
Well.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Will you take care of me

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
like you do to it?

64
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
Yeah.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Wow.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,440
Boss.

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
I underestimated you.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,240
You know quite well about flirting.

69
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
You are so cute.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,640
Are you taking pictures of me?

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,920
Not you, the cat.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,960
Give it to me.

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,560
No.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
Let me have a look.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,760
No.

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
Give it to me.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Let me look!

78
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,640
Boss.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,880
How are the pictures?

80
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,920
When are we going
to buy presents for the Chairman?

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
Let's go.

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,640
Okay.
