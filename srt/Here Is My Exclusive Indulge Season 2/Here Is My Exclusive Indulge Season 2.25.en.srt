5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,880
Ask your president to come out.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,840
Don't you know
what quality means in construction?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,360
Are you trying to kill people?

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,440
Hello, I'm the acting president
of Fu Group, Yun Xiangxiang.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,840
90 percent of the construction materials

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,280
you provided to us are faulty.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,160
Our group always values honesty the most.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,760
This cannot happen.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,800
We've worked together for so many years.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,040
Let's just terminate the contract,

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,560
and you pay us the damage,

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,160
plus 50 million Yuan of penalty.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
That's my final offer.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,560
Manager Zhao, words count for nothing.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,240
How do we know
you are telling the truth?

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
This is the qualification report
from our Chu group.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,520
Don't try to deny it.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,840
I'll see you in court if you must.

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
President Yun,

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
you don't want
something like this to happen

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,000
on your first day in office, right?

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,160
I wonder where you got
the information from, Manager Zhao.

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
This is my first day
being the president.

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
I don't think the receptionist
can even recognize me.

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,040
But you know everything about me.

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't worry, Manager Zhao.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,040
I'll look into this matter.

32
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,760
If there's anything wrong
with our materials,

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,920
we'll let the court decide
how to settle this.

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,720
But if I find out

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
that someone planted this on us,

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,440
our group

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,160
will never just let it pass.

38
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,920
Anyway, you have to give me
a satisfactory answer.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Otherwise,

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,320
I'll talk to the press.

41
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,160
Humph!

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
I was going to use this
against Fu Sihan.

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,240
Now she got the prize.

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,120
There's nothing wrong
with their qualification report.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,840
We've been supplying

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,000
construction materials

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,480
to the Chu Group all the time.

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
Nothing has ever gone wrong.

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,040
They came to confront us.

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,880
That means they know

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,240
that we won't be able to find anything.

52
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Yeah.

53
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,920
Maybe we should call Mr. Fu

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
and ask about his opinion.

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,880
Yeah.

56
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
Xiangxiang.

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Chu Beiye.

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Why are you here?

59
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,640
I can help you with your company.

60
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,320
Really?

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Your group just
sent someone to set us up,

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,320
and now the young master
of the group is here

63
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,600
offering to help us.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,000
Who would buy that?

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,040
That Manager Zhao

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,200
is not a loyal employee.

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,240
We don't want to keep him.

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
What are you going to do?

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Just leave it to me.

70
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
But you have to promise me.

71
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,640
After it's done,

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
you owe me one.

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
Xiangxiang.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
This is not something
for you to deal with.

75
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,600
Some positions are
only for capable people.

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Don't be too sure about my ability,

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,720
auntie.

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,760
(How can she be so calm?)

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,480
(Did she find anything?)

80
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Guards.

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,960
Hello.

82
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,400
Can you talk about the faulty materials

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Fu Group supplied to Chu Group?

84
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,480
I saw many transport vehicles out there

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
with the mentioned materials.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Are those the faulty ones?

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
I will answer all your questions.

88
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
But at first,

89
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,840
why don't we let Manager Zhao
explain the situation?

90
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah.

91
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,880
Tell the reporters what happened.

92
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm from the Fu Group.

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,280
But I won't be partial.

94
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Ms. Fu.

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
Ms. Fu, I beg you.

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,560
Don't ask me to set them up anymore.
