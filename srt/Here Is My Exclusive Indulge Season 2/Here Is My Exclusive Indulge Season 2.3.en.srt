Let me tell you.

Mr. Fu, I...

Put me down!

You misunderstood, bro.

I'm warning you.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
Stop stalking Mr. Fu.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,000
Or I'll have to tell the police.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
Well. This is a misunderstanding.

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
I just want him to withdraw the appeal
against our company!

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,360
It's a misunderstanding!

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,760
(Fu Sihan will have to come here
to take his car after work.)

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,920
(I will surely meet him if I wait here.)

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,080
Won't she ever give up?

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Stop there.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,440
Don't move.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't move.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm talking to you.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,480
The one in yellow clothes. Don't move.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,880
Right. Stay there. I'm coming over now.

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,840
Stay still.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,040
(To wait for you to catch me?)

Eh?

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Where is she?

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Mr. Fu.

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,520
Did anything happen?

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,440
No. Nothing.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Where did she go?

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
What's the noise in the back?

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,480
The durians for the Chairman.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,040
We just got them airlifted
from Thailand.

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,680
As for the arrangement
Ms. Fu made this afternoon,

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,720
are we going there?

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,600
No. Just go home.

54
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,520
Butler, the lock of the trunk is broken.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
Take the car to the repair shop.

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh,

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,520
and take out the durians
for the Chairman.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Yes.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,320
Wow.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,640
Fu Sihan's house is huge.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Who is it?

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Who is there?
