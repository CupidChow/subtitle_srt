5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,000
Does grandpa really like
traditional Chinese paintings?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,880
Guo Ziming's works
are grandpa's favorite.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,280
It's a good painting. Thank you.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,520
Sihan.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,080
What's she doing here?

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
You are here to buy paintings
for your grandpa too?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,000
You are so good to your grandpa.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,440
You are not bad yourself, auntie.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,640
Mr. Guo's works are his favorite.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
But you are a bit unlucky.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,360
I just bought the last piece.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,640
You are a little late.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm going to leave now.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
Have a look at other pieces.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,640
Hello.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
Do you have any other paintings?

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,000
Only three paintings of my grandpa

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,120
are available to buyers every year.

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,640
And that lady bought the last one.

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,640
Young lady.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
It's you, young lady.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
Grandpa, why are you here?

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,040
Grandpa.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
Grandpa?

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
She is the one I told you about.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,560
My savior.

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,360
Oh.

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,040
I remember that

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,120
there was a young man
on a wheelchair that day as well.

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,960
Was he this young man?

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,640
No.

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,560
So this must be your boyfriend.

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,560
No, he's not.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,600
He's my boss.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't have a boyfriend.

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,200
You don't?

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
My grandson is single too.

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,440
Maybe you two should...

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,240
Mr. Guo.

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,760
We are here today
for one of your paintings.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
I heard what you said.

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,000
But indeed, I don't have
any new paintings left.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,800
But,

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
I can try to think of something.

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
As my gratitude to my little savior.

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Thank you, grandpa.

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
It's alright.

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,880
Mr. Guo just said

55
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,800
that you know another guy
on a wheelchair?

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,920
That's my mom's wardmate.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
What's wrong?

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Nothing.

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,720
I just want to tell you
to be careful about strange men.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,320
The one I should be
careful about the most is you.

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,520
Hello, mom. What is it?

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Ah?

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
I got it, mom.

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay.

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Bye.

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,080
What is it?

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
My mom asked me to
go see her tomorrow morning.

69
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
Do you think

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
she saw the reports about us?

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,400
Xiangxiang.

72
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,160
The most important thing in our life

74
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
is to be sincere.

75
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,040
I know.

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
It's wrong to lie.

77
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,400
Money is not all that matters.

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
People around you

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
are the most important.

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
Yeah.

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
Well, mom.

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
Actually...

83
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,080
Chu is going home soon.

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
He helped me a lot

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,440
when you are away.

86
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,760
Thank him for me.

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
Go treat him with a meal.

88
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
Okay.

89
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Mom asked him.

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,040
He's single.

91
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
Mom.

92
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,880
You asked me to come

93
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,120
only for this?

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,240
Of course.

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
Mom.

96
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,000
Can you stop introducing to me

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
every available guy you met?

98
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Chu is a good man.

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,720
But he hasn't had a single visitor

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,920
ever since he got in the hospital.

101
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
We have no idea who he is.
