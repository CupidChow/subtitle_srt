5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,720
Who is she?

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,720
Never seen her before.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,280
Some gold-digger who
lied her way into here?

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,080
Oh. Why are you so clumsy?

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,080
It slipped in my hand.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,120
What are you doing?

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,200
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,360
Qin Zhirou.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,800
Why are you sticking up for her?

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Apologize when you did something wrong.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Or I'll tell Ms. Fu

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
that you were giving her a hard time.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,040
We'll see who's
bringing shame on herself.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,600
She's a big star.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Always comes to the poor one's aid.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
We can't afford to cross her.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
Let's go then.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,040
We can't afford to go against her.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,440
Are you okay?

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,080
The stain is everywhere.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,400
I'll take you to clean it up.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
Let's go.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,280
I can't get rid of the stain.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
You are Qin Zhirou, right?

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
I really like your TV show.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Xiangxiang, you are too courteous.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,080
Just call me Zhirou.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,120
I've known Si...

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,880
Well, Fu Sihan, Mr. Fu.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
I know him very well.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,360
Just tell me if you need
any help in the future.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Thank you. You are so nice.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,960
The party is beginning soon.

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,880
You can't go out like this.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
Oh, I know. Wait a second.

42
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Take it off.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Okay.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,080
I used this shawl

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,040
when I was on set in France.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,240
You can use it for today.

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
(I am stupid)
It's so pretty.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,440
Mr. Fu, I need you to sign this.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,480
You are not thinking about
Miss Yun, are you?

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,720
Can she manage it on her own?

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,240
She...

52
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
Chu He.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,720
Forget about your bonus this month.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,680
Boss.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Did I hit a nerve or something?

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm worried that she'll
make us look bad.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,200
Fu Rong won't make it easy for her.

58
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
Are we going there to save her?

59
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,680
You are here.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,360
That woman is so stupid.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
What does Fu Sihan see in her?

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,760
Who knows?

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,960
But we make fun of her like this.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,680
What if her family
comes looking for trouble?

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
What do we do then?

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Don't worry. As far as I know,

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,720
the Yun family lives in Quebec, Canada.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
The people speak French over there.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
But that woman

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,440
can't even realize
that the words on the shawl

71
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,400
is an insult.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
She must be an imposter.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Then we have to give her a good lesson.

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,680
Thank you for attending
this party today, ladies.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Today, I'll introduce you
someone special.

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
The daughter of the Yun Group,

77
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Yun Xiangxiang.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
(Thankfully, when I was
gathering information before,)

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
(I specially looked into the details
of Fu Sihan's private life.)

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
(Qin Zhirou.)

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,000
(She has been courting
Fu Sihan for years.)

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
(I didn't even introduce
myself back there,)

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
(and she called me Miss Yun.)

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
(She knew who I am,)

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
(and told me intentionally
that she knows Fu Sihan well.)

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,320
(This is the classic female villain.)

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,640
(So easy to tackle.)
