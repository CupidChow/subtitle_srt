5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,160
You are pretty good at playing innocent.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
You are not that bad yourself either.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,720
Let's have a toast for our encounter.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,640
Why are you so clumsy?

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,200
Here.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Don't panic.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,440
Put this on.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,040
This shawl suits you so well.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,280
It was made for you.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,680
Get in there.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,040
Are you nuts?

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Save her!

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,120
You deserve it!

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,760
Are you cold?

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,440
Yun Xiangxiang.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,320
What did you do?

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
They started it.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,800
I was just returning the favor.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,960
An eye for an eye.

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,280
You went too far, Yun Xiangxiang.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,920
That's right.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,920
I'm getting tired of this act.

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
Some unreasonable women.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm leaving.

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,040
You...

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
Yun Xiangxiang.

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
You treat our guests like this.

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
You bring disgrace on not just me,

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,440
but also the whole Fu family.

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,000
Save it. Do you think you can
threaten me with that?

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,880
Xiangxiang didn't
bring disgrace on the family.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,760
I think she did very well.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
Your previous parties were so boring.

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
The reporters couldn't
find anything to write about.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
But this year, at least
you have a wet party.

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Isn't it?

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,760
You mean I should thank her for that?

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
Are you still cold?

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,960
Your warmth

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,800
drove all the coldness away.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm tired, darling.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Can we go back?

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Let's go.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,920
Ms. Fu.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,400
Why is Sihan so good to her?

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
I told you.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,640
She's not as innocent as she looks.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Why are you guys here?

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,200
Mr. Fu was worried

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
that you couldn't handle it on your own.

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
So we rushed to the party.

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Only to find out
that you managed it beautifully.

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Chu He.

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Do you still want your annual bonus?

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,840
Don't worry about me.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Those are merely child's tricks for me.

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,800
I'm way better at that.

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,080
So? Was I doing fine today?

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Do I get an A plus?

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
More or less.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
What are you doing?

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
You had a few drops there.
