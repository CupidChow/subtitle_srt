5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,040
Ms. Fu.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,880
You said you will invest in our business

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,040
after we meet your dad, didn't you?

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Yeah. You have to
keep your own words, right?

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,920
Liars.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
What are you waiting for?

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,640
Get out.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,040
Or I'll call the police.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,840
But you promised us.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,720
Why are you doing this?

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Throw them out.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,160
Yes.

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,040
Why do you do this?

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,440
You promised us!

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,520
Don't touch my mom!

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,480
Ms. Fu!

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,280
I see!

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,280
You want to take my patent as your own!

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Come back here!

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,840
What's wrong, Xiangxiang?

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm okay.

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm fine.

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,000
Didn't you say you'll bring Fu Sihan

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,840
to see me?

29
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,680
He...

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,160
He's busy lately.

31
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,560
So,

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
he doesn't have the time.

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,400
He didn't...

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,440
He didn't bully you, did he?

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,440
No. I'm fine, mom.

36
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,880
Don't lie to me.

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,520
Look at you.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
No woman in love

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
would look like that.

40
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
I have a friend.

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,160
She's having some trouble

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
with her relationship.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,520
Tell me.

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
You...

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,600
Your friend.

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,120
What kind of trouble is she in?

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,440
She has someone

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,200
that she loves

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,760
very much.

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
But for some reasons,

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,000
they can't be together.

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,440
They are like the bird and the fish.

53
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,600
Even though they love each other,

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,000
they can't be together

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,600
for their whole life.

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
What's the big deal about it?

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
Think about all those TV shows,

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,560
My Love from the Star,

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,240
Ghost,

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
and Descendants of the Sun.

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,560
The boys and girls in them,

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,880
they've gone through so much trouble
and even risked their lives

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,120
just to be together.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,800
And in the end,
they all live happily ever after.

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,280
A happy ending.

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,200
But you know those are all TV dramas.

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
It's not reality.

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
You don't always
get a happy ending in reality.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Xiangxiang.

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,000
Mom knows

71
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
that life is short.

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
If you meet the right one,

73
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,880
you have to overcome all the trouble

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
with courage.

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,640
Don't regret it

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
after you've lost it.

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
Xiangxiang.
