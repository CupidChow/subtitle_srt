5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Chu He, where is Sihan?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,680
I haven't seen him.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,080
Mr. Fu took the earliest flight
to the United States.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,880
The United States? So suddenly?

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,600
There's something he needs
to deal with in person.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,720
Before he left,

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,480
he said that he wants you
to take charge of the company.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
Me? Is he joking?

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,480
It's true.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,640
There's an agreement
you need to sign later.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,560
I'll send you there.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,480
Mr. Fu has already informed the board.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,920
But,

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
I don't know anything.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,880
What should I do?

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,080
Don't worry. I'm here.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,560
I'll help you.

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,200
I asked you here in such a short notice

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,080
as there's a decision we need to make
for an important project.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,000
But Sihan went abroad.

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,000
Business field is like a battle field.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,080
It's ever-changing.

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
Since Sihan is away,

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,520
as the Vice Chairwoman,

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
I'll take his place temporarily.

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Any objection?

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
I object.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Mr. Fu has said,

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
when he is away,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Miss Yun will take his place.

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,360
How can we let an outsider
take charge of our company?

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Outsider?

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
Grandpa said long ago

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,840
that he sees me as family.

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,800
Auntie, if grandpa heard what you said,

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
I don't think

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,920
he would like it.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,040
This is serious business.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Not some children's game.

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,760
If anything goes wrong,

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
who'll take the responsibility?

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,200
I don't have much experience.

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,440
But I can learn from everyone here.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,200
If there's anything I can't figure out,

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I believe

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
auntie will definitely help me.

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,760
Right?

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Dear board members,

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,080
Miss Yun is Mr. Fu's fiancee.

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,600
It's Mr. Fu who wants her

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,280
to take his place for now.

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,600
Don't think that you can
have everything your way

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
just because of the name of Fu Sihan.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,640
I don't agree.

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Of course you can object, auntie.

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,120
But we have to ask the opinions of
all the board members here.

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,920
Everyone,

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,440
please raise your hand

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
if you approve
that I'll be the acting president.

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
That's it, auntie.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
Please give me my seat.

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,280
You haven't won yet.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Humph!

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Yeah.

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Okay.

70
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Just do it

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,880
as the original plan.

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,160
Since you want this position so much,

73
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll give you a full experience.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,040
Did you see that?

75
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,600
Her face looked even darker than
the bottom of a pan.

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,240
Her heart

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,400
is even darker than her face.

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Thankfully, Fu Sihan
left you here with me.

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,680
You can take care of everything.

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,520
I only need to sign some papers.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,120
Oh.

82
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,560
What project did he go to the US for?

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
Something like oil or mines.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
No.

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,400
He doesn't have
an ex-girlfriend, does he?

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,720
How is that possible?

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,360
According to rules for romance comics,

88
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,880
at this point of the story,

89
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,480
the main characters
have confessed their feelings,

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
and there's no obstacle for them.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,880
Then a third person
will come out from nowhere,

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
and bring more trouble

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,760
to the couple.

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Hello?

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
Yeah.

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880
What?

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
What is it?
