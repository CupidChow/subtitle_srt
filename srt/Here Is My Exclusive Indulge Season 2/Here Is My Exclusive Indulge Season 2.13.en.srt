5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,080
Let her take more rest
and she'll be fine.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
Okay.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm leaving then.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,040
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,760
Mr. Fu.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,880
The doctor said it's not serious.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,440
She'll be fine after taking some pills
and having some rest.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,440
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,560
Okay.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,680
It's late now.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,400
Perhaps you can go to rest.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,720
I'll take care of Miss Yun for you.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,960
It's fine. You can go now.

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
Do you want to
look after her by yourself?

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,760
I don't care about her that much.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,920
I just don't want her illness

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
to get in the way of our act.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,200
(This is the first time I've seen)

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
(Mr. Fu cares so much about a girl.)

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,560
I understand.

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,040
I'm a professional private assistant.

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,440
I know when to be there,

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,520
and when to disappear.

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,760
I'll leave now.

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,920
Mom.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm so cold.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Chu He.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
What happened?

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
What's wrong with him?

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
The doctors are still discussing.

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,360
We are waiting for their diagnosis.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,320
After our examination and discussion,

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,840
we are sure that Mr. Fu Sihan has got...

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
He has got...

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Viral influenza.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
A cold?

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,120
You gave me quite a scare.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,720
What kind of sickly boss are you?

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,080
It's not a big deal.
Just give him some ginger tea.

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,960
Is this what rich people do?

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,320
I'll get berated to death
if I put this in my comic.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Ungrateful little...

48
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,680
She is ungrateful indeed.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Why doesn't she think about

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
whom our boss got the virus from?

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
All because of taking care of her.

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Not grateful at all.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
You called me earlier.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,520
What's the matter?

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
(The new therapeutic scheme
for your mother is available.)

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,200
(We need to talk about it in person.)

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
Really?

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
Can I come over on this Saturday?

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,880
(I'm going on a business trip
on Saturday.)

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,480
(I won't be back until next week.)

62
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,200
(You should come as soon as possible.)

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
Now...
