5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,360
Xiangxiang.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,520
We're here to meet your future husband.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,360
It's an elder's obligation
to scrutinize your marital choice.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,560
You are not even close relatives.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
Stop sucking up to me.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
I've made myself clear in the hospital.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,040
Leave. Now.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,640
Xiangxiang.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,560
Don't do this.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
You are the daughter of the Yun family.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,480
Don't be so rude.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,160
I've watched you growing up.

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,800
What if I tell him your real identity?

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,280
Tell me what?

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
Nothing.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,760
Look at your future husband.

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,080
Such a fine young man.

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,000
Even his wheelchair is so different.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
So classy.

24
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,680
My mom meant that Mr. Fu

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
is no ordinary people.

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Even crippled differently
than other people.

27
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,760
Shut it.

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,800
Say it.

29
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,960
What do you want?

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,760
The thing is this.

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,040
I have a high-tech patent invention.

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,360
It turns water

33
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,760
into gasoline.

34
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,920
That's right.

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,440
Don't listen to them, Sihan.
They are all frauds.

36
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,640
Xiangxiang, you...

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
It's okay.

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,800
Investment issues

39
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,560
are always handled by my assistant.

40
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
How about

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,560
having a little chat with him?

42
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,440
So where is the...?

43
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,960
Here.

44
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
You are the assistant.

45
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
I'll treat you two very well.

46
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,160
Thank you.

47
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
Are you okay, son?

48
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,080
Yun Xiangxiang, you are just a fake.

49
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,480
How dare you pretend to be a high-born?

50
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,240
I'll tell the press all about you.

51
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,040
Tell the press.

52
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,960
Blab your mouth one more time,

53
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,560
and we won't go easy on you.

54
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,000
You people are bullying us together.

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Aren't you afraid of karma?

56
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,120
If you dare act up again,

57
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm not sure what'll happen next.

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
Come. Son. Get up.

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,240
You'll regret this, Yun Xiangxiang.

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Let's go.

61
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,040
I don't know
why they came to our doorstep.

62
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Xiangxiang.

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm here.

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,400
I won't let them say one more word
about your identity.

65
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,320
But,

66
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
I feel like

67
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
I shouldn't keep lying to grandpa.

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,200
He's so good to me.

69
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
As for that,

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
I've thought about it.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,080
Grandpa has some heart issues.

72
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm afraid that he won't
be able to take it

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
if we break the news to him suddenly.

74
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,040
We'll tell him

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,560
once we find a better opportunity.

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,360
And you.

77
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
When do you plan

78
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
to take me to mother?

79
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
What mother?

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
My future mother-in-law.

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,560
Well.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
The day after tomorrow.

83
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
Tomorrow.

84
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
We go tomorrow.

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
Where is Sihan?

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,360
I didn't see him.

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
You are up, Xiangxiang.

88
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,880
Auntie made you some porridge.

89
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Have it when it's hot.

90
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
Why are you here?

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
I'm here to serve you.

92
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Here.

93
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,920
We're the new servants in this house.

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,160
And we only serve you, Miss Yun.

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,080
You...

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
How come...?
