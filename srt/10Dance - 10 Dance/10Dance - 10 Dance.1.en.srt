1
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>A dancer once said</i>

2
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,506
<i>that love sometimes takes
an unexpected shape</i>

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>and suddenly appears before you.</i>

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>Hidden longings.</i>

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>Passion without words.</i>

6
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,987
<i>Graceful and serene.</i>

7
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,741
<i>At times, fierce and wild.</i>

8
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,038
<i>With a subtle game of give and take.</i>

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>To whom do we whisper our love?</i>

10
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,687
<i>How do we feel when our hands are joined?</i>

11
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,065
Okay!

12
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>Maybe dance itself
is the vessel we need.</i>

13
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,213
<i>A perfect way to nurture our love.</i>

14
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>The steps are perfect.</i>

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,513
<i>The form, flawless.</i>

16
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:24,727
<i>But this man's dance…
is missing something crucial.</i>

17
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>A year ago,</i>

18
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,653
<i>I found out what it was.</i>

19
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,579
The 31st
All Japan Dance Championships,

20
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,748
Latin American division champions,

21
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,712
Shinya Suzuki and Aki Tajima.

22
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,636
And now, the ballroom division champions,

23
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,474
Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami.

24
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,686
Sugiki-sensei!

25
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,314
Please give
a big round of applause

26
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,774
to our "Emperor of Dance," who won…

27
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,651
<i>I hate this guy.</i>

28
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,990
<i>Just seeing him pisses me off
for no reason.</i>

29
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,207
And now,
our two magnificent champion pairs

30
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,543
will perform an honor dance.

31
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,212
Champions, please.

32
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,215
Bravo, bravo!

33
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,016
<i>In competitive dance,
there are two different styles.</i>

34
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>Ballroom dance,
which Shinya Sugiki specializes in.</i>

35
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:56,944
<i>The waltz, tango, Viennese waltz,
slow foxtrot, and quickstep.</i>

36
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,862
<i>They compete in all five dances.</i>

37
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,406
<i>I specialize in the other styles,
Latin American.</i>

38
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:47,078
<i>Cha-cha-cha, samba,
rumba, paso doble, and jive.</i>

39
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,914
<i>We compete in all five.</i>

40
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>♪ Something broke in me that day ♪</i>

41
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,558
<i>♪ So away ♪</i>

42
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,812
<i>♪ Get back at you ♪</i>

43
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,861
<i>♪ Stood here dying on my feet ♪</i>

44
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,281
<i>♪ Feeling cold ♪</i>

45
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,659
<i>♪ Feeling weak ♪</i>

46
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,204
<i>♪ And it seems right ♪</i>

47
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,666
<i>♪ I only meet you in the moonlight ♪</i>

48
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,293
<i>♪ I know the Devil's inside… ♪</i>

49
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,673
<i>The dancers of these two styles
never compete against each other,</i>

50
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,258
<i>with one exception.</i>

51
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,234
<i>10 Dance.</i>

52
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,332
<i>The World Cup of Dance
is where dancers</i>

53
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,754
<i>who have mastered both ballroom and Latin
compete in all ten dances.</i>

54
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,426
<i>You need to have the stamina
to dance 40 songs in one day,</i>

55
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,138
<i>with completely different
rhythms and steps.</i>

56
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,394
<i>Mentally, you've gotta stay focused
for hours.</i>

57
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,648
<i>Both your body and mind
are pushed to the limit.</i>

58
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>It may look glamorous,
but it's basically a triathlon.</i>

59
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,239
<i>That's the exception.</i>

60
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>10 Dance.</i>

61
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,635
- Top form!
- Bravo!

62
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,554
You were incredible.

63
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,889
It's been a while since
you competed in Japan.

64
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,142
Does it feel good to perform
for a home audience?

65
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,436
Yes, it's very good
to be back home.

66
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,022
And Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami wanted
to show a new side of ourselves.

67
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
He wins as soon as he comes back.
I knew he would.

68
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,530
Shinya Suzuki hardly compares.

69
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,492
- Thank you.
- Shinya Suzuki and Shinya Sugiki.

70
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,577
Congratulations.

71
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,662
Only a two-letter difference
in their names,

72
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,166
but Latin and ballroom
are totally different styles.

73
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,418
And they're in

74
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,336
completely different classes.

75
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,881
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,273
Hello?

77
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,327
<i>What?</i>

78
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,580
What do you mean
Shinya Sugiki invited us to the 10 Dance?

79
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,539
When?

80
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,459
- Just now.
- What?

81
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,044
I said no.

82
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,086
You said no?

83
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,632
Wait, but it means that Shinya Sugiki
is offering to teach us himself, right?

84
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,217
- You care?
- Huh?

85
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,427
What's the big deal?

86
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,181
- Doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

87
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,683
Do you know what
the 10 Dance takes?

88
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,269
Know how many dances you do in a day?

89
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,481
Five ballroom, five Latin,
and you've gotta dance 'em four times.

90
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,025
First round, second round,
semis, and finals.

91
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,569
That's 40 songs.

92
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,323
We usually only dance 20 songs at most.

93
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,867
That's double what we do. Double.

94
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,702
But, you know,
even if it's just practice,

95
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,913
I'd love to be led by Shinya Sugiki
at least once.

96
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,289
I don't care.

97
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,751
I mean, I'm always playing the role
of a slut who gets dumped by a man,

98
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,503
or a cheating woman,
or something like that.

99
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,507
Oh, really? You're the one who said
you can't pull off a princess.

100
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,341
No, I didn't.

101
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,344
Whatever. We're the national champions,
and they're the world champions.

102
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,513
- Second.
- That's it.

103
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,727
We took second in the World Championships.

104
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,858
I've never been first
at the World Championships.

105
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,368
I know why you're always
second place in the world.

106
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,954
Asians can't be number one--

107
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,749
I wonder when they'll finally see you
for who you are.

108
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,128
A champion
who could compete at the Worlds,

109
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,339
and yet gives it up time and again.

110
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,426
I'm just a little fish
who likes being number one.

111
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,343
I'm good.

112
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,097
A little fish
who's king of his little pond.

113
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,770
I guess I was wrong about you.

114
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,318
You have the perfect style and physique,
but that's all.

115
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,620
What is it?

116
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,249
- You wanna fight?
- I thought you had a fighting spirit.

117
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,131
But I see you're not even a rival.

118
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,595
You running away?

119
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,110
All right, I'll do it.

120
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,831
You're not gonna break on me, are ya?

121
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,085
Sure you can handle it?

122
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,926
Don't ditch when I get serious.

123
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,976
Do your worst.

124
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,398
I'll lead you all the way to the final.

125
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,190
Latino.

126
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,918
What did he say? Huh?

127
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,754
Hey, Shinya!

128
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,607
<i>He's right.</i>

129
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,486
<i>I've got Latin blood coursing
through my veins.</i>

130
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,789
<i>Somewhere deep down,
it drives me.</i>

131
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,963
<i>It feeds my dancing, my burning passion…</i>

132
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,376
Hey, wake up.

133
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,961
I said wake up!

134
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,389
Good morning.

135
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,726
- Put some clothes on.
- It's too early.

136
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,813
Wanna catch a cold?
Here, which one's yours? This?

137
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,316
- Thank you.
- Morning. Here, put some clothes on.

138
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,027
- Mm, thanks.
- Come on, let's go!

139
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,862
Jeez.

140
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,781
What a mess.

141
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,537
Put on some fucking clothes!

142
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,957
All right! Let's go!

143
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,542
Hurry!

144
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,219
Hey, buddy.

145
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,911
What the hell is going on with you?

146
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,956
Are you gonna do it or not?

147
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,794
You are going to do it, right?

148
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,632
And sure, you'd be taking a chance,

149
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,054
but they say the true champion
is the one who can win the 10 Dance.

150
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,145
If you teach them the Latin dances

151
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,607
and Sugiki teaches us ballroom in return…

152
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,652
then I think we can compete at the Worlds.

153
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,738
It's not that.

154
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,406
It's not about the Worlds
or any of that crap.

155
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,868
Hmm?

156
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,999
It's those eyes of his, staring at me.

157
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,630
Drives me nuts!

158
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,175
You don't have to shout like that.

159
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,564
Come on! Hurry up!

160
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,400
Faster!

161
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,153
I said hurry up!

162
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,616
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

163
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,118
You know,
I bet Fusako Yagami is a total bitch.

164
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,788
She seems really scary, almost dangerous.

165
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,873
- Dangerous, huh?
- I'm scared!

166
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,793
Come on.

167
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,719
Wow.

168
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,056
This is amazing.

169
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,708
Good evening.

170
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,256
You're more than 30 minutes late.

171
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,551
Get your partner into a skirt. Hurry.

172
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,722
We're sorry.

173
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,058
- I'll show you the dressing room.
- Oh.

174
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,150
Come in.

175
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,235
Whoa, it's huge.

176
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,862
Use anything you like.

177
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,031
Ah, thanks.

178
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,866
Wow.

179
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,246
Okay.

180
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,541
- I can take your coat.
- Oh, that would be great.

181
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,046
Thanks.

182
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,179
So think they'll be able to get along?

183
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,766
I wouldn't worry.

184
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,936
"I really need Mr. Suzuki for Latin."

185
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,773
He kept whining and going on about that.

186
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,026
You're saying he whines all the time too?

187
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,825
Why don't we check your hold
while we're waiting?

188
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,414
Okay.

189
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,752
How familiar are you
with ballroom dancing?

190
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,172
- I am a professional.
- I see.

191
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,510
Then you'll take the lead,
and I'll follow.

192
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,696
Lower your sense of contact.

193
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,990
From the stomach down to the knees.

194
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,993
One, two, three.

195
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,705
One, two, natural turn.

196
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,544
The waltz was originally
a courtship dance,

197
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,797
but the hold is like wearing handcuffs.

198
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,425
Graceful on the surface,
but with restraint and control.

199
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,477
Sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,401
What is it? Something wrong?

201
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,695
He rubbed his dick on me.

202
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,948
I'm so sorry about this.

203
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:19,950
It's fine.

204
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,869
Shall we get started, then?

205
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,787
Yes.

206
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,957
- In ballroom, you're D Class?
- Yes.

207
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,083
Take my contact.

208
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,252
- Let it sink into your body.
- Okay.

209
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,504
What do you wanna do?

210
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,464
Do we stop or continue?

211
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,260
One, two, three. One, two, three.

212
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,178
You can quit if you want.

213
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,180
Running spin turn.

214
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,642
One, two, three.

215
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,352
One… Good.

216
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,024
One, two, and three.

217
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,026
One, two, spin, turn.

218
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,320
One, two, three.

219
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,864
One, whisk.

220
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:04,243
One, two, three.

221
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,498
- Stretch your arm out, like this.
- Two, three, four.

222
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,667
Your shoulder blades
move with your pelvis.

223
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,589
Hockey stick. Two, three, four.

224
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,343
Two, three, New York.

225
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,596
- Catch it inside.
- Two, three, four.

226
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,598
- Shoulder turn.
- Two, and three, and four.

227
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,724
Both arms?

228
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,685
- Two, three, four.
- Yes, like an undulation.

229
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,189
Two, and three, and four.

230
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,233
Two, three, four.

231
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,445
- Pelvis moves too.
- Two, and three, and four.

232
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,738
Okay, that's enough.

233
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
How was it?

234
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,994
- Terrible.
- The same for the left.

235
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,039
Your hip movement is so fake.

236
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,999
Look.

237
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,169
Watch how my body moves.

238
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
Four.

239
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,686
Two, and three, and four.

240
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,563
See that?

241
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,109
It's not just in the hips.

242
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,863
When you do it,
your body's not undulating.

243
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,075
Three and four.

244
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,661
Feel the weight moving.

245
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,080
You've gotta feel it

246
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,915
from the spine

247
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,835
through the shoulder blades…

248
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,590
into the arm movements.

249
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,344
Two, three, four.

250
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,056
Two, three, four.

251
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,643
Two, and three, and four.

252
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,649
See this? It's sweat.

253
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,026
- Yes.
- Do you get it?

254
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,485
Yes, I understand.

255
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,863
Your hip movement is amazing.

256
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,573
It's my job to shake my hips.

257
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,326
- Think you can do it?
- Got it?

258
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,202
- Just copy what I do.
- Right.

259
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,954
Come here. Put your hands right here.

260
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,622
- Shorten it.
- On your hips.

261
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,584
- Make it smaller.
- A little smaller?

262
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,252
That's right.

263
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,671
A bit more. Yeah, like that.

264
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,007
Two, and three, and four.

265
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,135
- Now squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
- Two, three, four.

266
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,346
- Move less.
- That's it.

267
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,431
Two, three, and four.

268
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,599
Mm-hmm.

269
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,144
- Two, three, four.
- That's it. That's it.

270
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,357
Two, three, four.

271
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,361
- Two, three, four.
- Two, three, four.

272
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,198
Two, and three, and four.
Aki, keep counting.

273
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,409
- Two, three, four.
- Three, four.

274
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,954
Two, three, four.

275
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,373
Two, three, four.

276
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,500
If the waltz is an elegant courtship…

277
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,668
Two, three, four.

278
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,587
…then Latin dance is raw eroticism.

279
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,172
…three, four.

280
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,344
Arouse them, seduce them.

281
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,388
Don't stop till you make 'em wet.

282
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,473
Two, three, four.

283
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,808
You're not sexy, guy.

284
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,311
- Two, three, four.
- Four.

285
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,772
Two, and three, and four.

286
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,358
One, two, three.

287
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,987
One, two, three.

288
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,741
<i>Sorry. Suzuki can be
a little rough around the edges.</i>

289
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,827
<i>Don't worry.</i>

290
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
So you two together?

291
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,709
Well, there was something there
at one point, I guess.

292
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,338
But now, I just want to go further
as dance partners.

293
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,760
How about you and Mr. Sugiki?

294
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,846
There's love in your dancing.

295
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,475
Mr. Sugiki took me as a partner
when I was nothing.

296
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,228
He's brought me so far.

297
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,940
I trust him with everything

298
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,526
and just follow his lead.

299
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,698
I've never felt loved by him at all,

300
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,576
and I don't think I need to.

301
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,636
We still have some time
before the first train.

302
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,972
You can rest a little longer.

303
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,061
Do you do this every day?

304
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,988
I can't stand it.

305
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,992
I won't be second again.

306
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:04,669
I'm not the type to try to make
an audience boo judges' decisions.

307
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,259
I recall

308
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,262
you said you liked being number one,
didn't you?

309
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,892
I also like being at the top of the pack.

310
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,731
- I'm only at the top of my turf, right?
- Are you going to go all in?

311
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,193
Doesn't it look like it?

312
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,286
You be the judge of that.

313
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,550
<i>God, it felt like the wind
had gone right through me.</i>

314
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,095
<i>It stirred my soul.</i>

315
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,888
<i>It felt like</i>

316
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,975
<i>that hot wind of Havana.</i>

317
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,950
<i>My soul is still in Havana.</i>

318
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:05,081
<i>It's the kingdom of sun, music, and dance.</i>

319
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,721
<i>Doesn't matter how small
the world may be,</i>

320
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,265
<i>I sure as hell can't see Havana from here.</i>

321
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,225
…four.

322
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,895
- Two, three, four.
- Two, three, four.

323
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,481
- Two, and three, and four.
- Two, three, four.

324
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,734
One, two, three.

325
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,194
One, two, three.

326
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,780
- Face right.
- One, two, three.

327
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,573
One, full count.

328
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:44,828
One, two, three.

329
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,830
One.

330
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,416
Okay, one more time.

331
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,633
Just a minute.

332
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,678
- Can I put some music on?
- You're not ready.

333
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,305
- Let me put some music.
- I said no, you're not ready for it yet.

334
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,766
This thing's not even working.

335
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,185
My method is to drill the counts
into your body,

336
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,771
without even the slightest distraction.

337
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,190
- God, I want music.
- Okay, let's go.

338
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,775
All right.

339
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,402
Two, three.

340
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,821
One, two, three.

341
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,823
One, two, and three.

342
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:25,703
One, two, three.

343
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
What?

344
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,751
Your lead is uncomfortable.

345
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,378
- Your holds are self-centered…
- Hold on.

346
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,504
-…and unreliable.
- Hey.

347
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,925
- Quit complaining. Move the way I steer.
- If I give in, I feel like I'm in danger.

348
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,435
What is it?

349
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,021
You're waltzing like you're a servant.

350
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,698
What does that mean?

351
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,537
The waltz is danced
by ladies and gentlemen.

352
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,750
It looks very elegant,
but it's also relentless.

353
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:18,006
<i>The woman must dance in those high heels,
twisting her waist for hours on end.</i>

354
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,385
<i>The pain is pure torture.</i>

355
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,015
And in such a state,

356
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,186
she will not yield
to a rough and vulgar man.

357
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,118
- What the hell?
- You should try being the woman for once.

358
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,037
Lower your shoulder blades
and turn out your arms.

359
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,872
That part is the same as the man's.

360
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,209
Now, keep your hips there,
but rotate only your chest to the left.

361
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,044
Your shoulders to the right.

362
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,297
Stretch your neck.
Stretch it away from your right.

363
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,217
Up to the left. That's it.

364
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,138
Now, get up on your toes.

365
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,061
Higher.

366
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,273
Hold it right there. Stay.

367
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,578
Your stance is beautiful.

368
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,877
Without me,
just standing is hard, isn't it?

369
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,592
During hardship, the gentleman
offers his hand to support his partner.

370
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,179
That's how it works in ballroom dance.

371
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,865
"Move the way I steer you," right?

372
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,251
Natural turn.

373
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,588
Running spin turn.

374
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,423
Chassé roll.

375
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,303
Left whisk.

376
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,558
Standing spin.

377
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:44,151
Syncopated running finish.

378
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,247
Throwaway.

379
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,584
Oversway.

380
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,302
How was that?

381
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,888
Did you feel like a princess?

382
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,551
Let's go get something to eat.

383
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,231
Hmm?

384
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,650
What's that?

385
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,529
- Thank you.
- This is coronation chicken.

386
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,158
Served at Queen Elizabeth's coronation
in 1953.

387
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,206
Mmm.

388
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,708
The apricots you just tasted

389
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,253
were arranged
to resemble scattered jewels.

390
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,047
Britain was victorious,
but they were still rationing at the time,

391
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,968
and this dish astonished guests
from around the world.

392
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,191
Elbows off the table.
That's how a dog eats.

393
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
I'm eating like this 'cause it's good.

394
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,613
You get it, right?

395
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,323
It's good.

396
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,867
Tastes like curry.

397
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,249
More wine. Mm.

398
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,255
You shouldn't hold the glass
while it's being poured.

399
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,217
When you're at a banquet,
you don't hold it by the bowl

400
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,053
but lower on the stem, like this.

401
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,055
I got it.

402
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,764
Hmm?

403
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:22,018
What does any of this
have to do with ballroom dancing?

404
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,813
I know how to eat, man.

405
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,076
Imagine this scenario.

406
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:43,956
You manage to beat every other 10 dancer
and rise to the top of the world.

407
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,667
After your honor dance,

408
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,047
you get an invitation
from someone who loved your performance.

409
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,966
This is not a wrap party
at a dance school.

410
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,804
Big-time sponsors and patrons
the envy of all dancers

411
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,431
will be waiting for you.

412
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,187
I get it now.

413
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,816
So this is another lesson for me?

414
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,779
Okay, guy.

415
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,536
I have a lesson for you.

416
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,031
So, you like it?

417
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,241
Yes.

418
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,119
It's the real taste of Cuba.

419
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,502
Drink.

420
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,796
Come on, drink!

421
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,339
Break!

422
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,675
Take a break!

423
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,136
He's boring!

424
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,142
- Let's get him drinking!
- So you're the "Emperor," huh?

425
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,269
It's fantastic!

426
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,104
- <i>Salud!
- Salud!</i>

427
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,899
<i>Salud!</i>

428
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,234
- <i>Salud.
- Salud.</i>

429
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,156
Hey, Sugiki, let's go!

430
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,366
- Huh?
- Come on!

431
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,784
- Smile!
- What?

432
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,411
Just smile, man!

433
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,079
Fake it if you have to!

434
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,456
Just smile!

435
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,083
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

436
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,342
Don't think about it! Don't…

437
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,428
Don't count with this. Make some noise!

438
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,890
Latin is about
making your body the instrument.

439
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,074
<i>At around the same time
Queen Elizabeth II</i>

440
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,993
<i>was serving coronation chicken,</i>

441
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>Castro was starting his revolution
in Cuba.</i>

442
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,255
<i>That's probably how big
the difference was between us as well.</i>

443
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,802
SUZUKI DANCE SCHOOL

444
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,553
It's almost like a wave…

445
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,100
…right through his fingertips.

446
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,895
While holding his hand, I can…

447
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,273
I feel his emotions, you know?

448
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,233
You get it?

449
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,737
Like superiority.

450
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,615
Possessiveness.

451
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,034
The urge to control.

452
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,205
And sometimes I can feel gentleness.

453
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,124
Expectation.

454
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,836
I don't even know how
to explain it properly.

455
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,714
I mean, it's like
I can feel everything he's feeling.

456
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,966
You know?

457
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,260
You sound like you're in love.

458
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,387
Huh?

459
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,307
Don't be stupid.

460
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,694
- Look.
- Hmm?

461
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,989
Sugiki.

462
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,826
Hey, what's up?

463
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,288
Are you there?

464
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,584
You there? Can't hear you.

465
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,754
<i>This is
the UK's Best Dance Championships…</i>

466
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,671
The UK's Best?

467
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,175
<i>…Professional Latin semifinal.</i>

468
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,259
<i>The paso doble.</i>

469
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,470
You're in the UK?

470
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,972
Didn't I tell you?
That night we went out,

471
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,517
I thought I mentioned
I was leaving the next day.

472
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,228
<i>- No, you didn't.</i>
- All right.

473
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,898
It's a competition I enter every year.
You must've known.

474
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,274
<i>That's not the point.</i>

475
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,403
I'm next. Gotta go.

476
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,031
<i>Wait, hold on. Hold on.</i>

477
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,949
Yes?

478
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,453
Just come back soon.

479
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,686
What did he say?

480
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,981
This year's Open,
we're gonna move up two in the rankings.

481
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:02,941
Huh?

482
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,026
And keep the All-Japan Champion title.

483
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,446
Then…

484
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,909
in 10 Dance…

485
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,579
we'll beat Sugiki.

486
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,081
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

487
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,876
we now come to
the Professional Ballroom semifinal.

488
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,671
Twelve couples have been recalled.

489
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,132
Please welcome them to the floor.

490
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,777
All present and correct.

491
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,823
Your first dance, the slow waltz.

492
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,215
There's Ms. Martha.

493
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,885
She's the president of the WDL,
isn't she?

494
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,847
She's a mentor devoted
to fostering Asian dancers.

495
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,806
Sugiki's her prize student.

496
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,685
He's indispensable
in their Asian market strategy.

497
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,563
I thought they were extraordinary.
They seem to be flourishing,

498
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,940
although I wonder…
perhaps a different combination.

499
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,323
What is
with that ridiculously exaggerated hold

500
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,117
you seem to insist on doing?

501
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,077
All you are doing
is placing a strain on Fusako.

502
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,706
There is absolutely no unity
in your dancing.

503
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,505
It's best to retire
at the height of your glory.

504
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,341
Have you ever imagined
what it would be like

505
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,009
when the audience grows tired of you?

506
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,178
Martha.

507
00:41:55,888 --> 00:42:00,851
Alberto Boemer has been crowned
World Latin Champion 11 years in a row.

508
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,439
I haven't even been champion once.

509
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,569
Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.

510
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,323
Love is what makes it whole, but

511
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,494
I don't feel any love
in the way you dance.

512
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,375
Hm.

513
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,133
Watch your frame.
Make the adjustment.

514
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,468
Yes, beautiful.

515
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,428
That's it.

516
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,555
Very nice.

517
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,808
Stretch your arms even more.

518
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,269
Yes, very nice.

519
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,771
Yes, that's good.
Good work today.

520
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

521
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,233
When did you get back?

522
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,569
- Thank you for coming.
- See you next time.

523
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,487
Thank you.

524
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,083
Let's try it with music today.

525
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,851
Two, three. One, two, three.

526
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:37,864
One, two, three.

527
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,074
Careful. Two, three.

528
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,286
One, full count.

529
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,372
Two, three. One.

530
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,831
- <i>Can I ask you something?
-</i> <i>Hmm?</i>

531
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,084
<i>Did you grow up
in Martha Milton's house?</i>

532
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,879
Yes.

533
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,508
My mother was
with me, too, at first.

534
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,012
It felt like I had two mothers.

535
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,350
One day,

536
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,645
Martha took me to the Blackpool Tower.

537
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,232
I saw a large framed photograph there.

538
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,613
Martha and a man
who was as dour as the Grim Reaper.

539
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:45,908
They looked like
they were ascending into the heavens.

540
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,252
Do you want to dance like this?

541
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,005
Then,

542
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,382
Shinya,

543
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,719
become a man.

544
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,223
Become the kind of man admired by all.

545
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,144
The finest gentleman.

546
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,488
So you admired him
and wanted to be just like him?

547
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,948
No.

548
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:31,079
I think I wanted to take his place,
to be beautiful and terrifying.

549
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,709
Until I was consumed by fear.

550
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,471
Cuba, what's it really like?

551
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,890
- Cuba?
- Yes.

552
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,434
It's music.

553
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,102
Dance.

554
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,437
Love.

555
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,399
Romance and the sea.

556
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,323
Cubans fall in love so easily.
Then they marry.

557
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,992
My mom was like that.

558
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,538
Every time we moved to a new place,
it happened.

559
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,097
Is the sky blue?

560
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,603
It's so blue.

561
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,731
The beaches are always empty,
so when you fall in love,

562
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,984
you go to the beach.

563
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,737
No one disturbs you there.

564
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,491
It's just the two of you
under the palm trees.

565
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,082
Hm.

00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,360
Slow, slow.

583
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,445
Quick, quick.

584
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,072
Hold it there.

585
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,906
Breathe in.

586
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,616
- Right here.
- Okay.

587
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,784
Like that.

588
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,703
Quick.

589
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,788
That's it.

590
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,666
I just need a drink of water. Sorry.

591
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,002
That's it.

592
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,879
Very good.

593
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,632
A little more open.

594
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,510
That's it.

595
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,302
Very good.

596
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:19,640
You know, Shinya's been crazy
about Mr. Sugiki for a while too.

597
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,642
Yeah?

598
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,980
A few years ago,
he happened to see a video.

599
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,942
He said, "He's the perfect dancer."

600
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,237
But then he said, "It looks
like he's in pain," which is weird.

601
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,281
Keep going like that. Okay.

602
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,450
Quick, quick.

603
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,453
Use your leg for support.

604
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,582
I think you wore a black dress?
You were dancing the tango, right?

605
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:49,171
I don't think that was me.

606
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,381
- Quick, quick.
- Huh?

607
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,468
I've never worn
a black dress in a competition.

608
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,845
And again.

609
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,890
Shall we continue?

610
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,391
Hm.

611
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,393
Support it.

612
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,521
Wide, wide. Quick, quick.

613
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,441
Walk, walk.

614
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,110
Position.

615
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,489
Neck.

616
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,157
Quick.

617
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,660
Don't rush. Don't rush. Don't rush.

618
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,087
Slow.

619
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,839
Frame, frame. Keep your frame.

620
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,008
Don't break it.

621
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,181
Rotation. Rotation.

622
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,435
Together. Do it together.
Don't try to dance on your own!

623
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,737
Take a break.

624
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,284
- Aki, why don't you get some water?
- Okay.

625
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,429
What's different between our leads?

626
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,475
Mm… well…

627
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,479
With Mr. Sugiki,

628
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,732
I know exactly where I should be.

629
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,611
No matter what the movement is,
it never varies.

630
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:42,950
And… the balance
between force and gentleness,

631
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,245
it makes my body want to follow his lead.

632
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,957
And, then, with you,

633
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,918
it's more like,
"I'm having fun, so you must be, too."

634
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,013
Sometimes that works for me,
and sometimes it doesn't.

635
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,389
Hmm?

636
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:12,104
Fusako said that when she and Mr. Sugiki
entered their first competition,

637
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,440
he said to her…

638
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,277
"Ms. Yagami."

639
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,279
- <i>"Now that you're…"</i>
- Now that you're my partner…

640
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,575
I will make you dance
more beautifully than anyone.

641
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,954
Every dancer in the world will say,

642
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,873
"Fusako Yagami is beautiful."

643
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,001
"I want to be Fusako Yagami."

644
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,590
That will be my ultimate joy.

645
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,519
Jeez.

646
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,521
I wish someone would say that to me.

647
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,692
You know, have that kind of caring?

648
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,319
- You don't have it.
- Caring?

649
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,695
- Caring.
- No way.

650
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,532
- You should try it sometime.
- It's sentimental crap.

651
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,580
Oh, hey. By the way…

652
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,208
…that video you sent over to me
the other day?

653
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,501
Yeah?

654
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,337
That wasn't Fusako dancing.

655
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,465
You sure?

656
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,927
She told me
she never wore black while competing.

657
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,974
Or something like that.

658
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,576
Havana salad and a… beer?

659
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,842
- Hey!
- Hey.

660
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,389
I don't know what's going on.

661
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,434
I can't dance anymore.

662
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,981
He's the one in control.

663
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,985
I thought I was the one using him, but

664
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,071
I'm the one being used.

665
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,036
Keeps throwing me off my game
and keeping me on edge.

666
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,331
I mean, what am I to him?

667
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,752
Sounds like love.

668
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,048
What are you talking about?

669
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,302
Do you want him?

670
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,017
Seriously, do you?

671
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,394
Guys can be attracted
to other guys, right?

672
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,731
Ah, come on!

673
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,193
If you're cool
with someone else stealing him, back off.

674
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,778

Will you?

706
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,851
Here.

707
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:06,936
Thank you. Cheers.

708
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,126
Can I ask you something?

709
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,795
Sure.

710
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:39,302
About three years ago,
when you were at the Worlds…

711
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,641
who was the woman
in the black dress you were dancing with?

712
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,479
It wasn't Fusako.

713
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,649
She told Aki it wasn't.

714
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,529
I'm sure she'd rather forget.

715
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:00,907
No.

716
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,911
Maybe she really can't remember

717
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,788
what happened.

718
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:17,340
What you saw, Mr. Suzuki,
was the World Championships in England.

719
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,261
<i>We hadn't been dancing together
for very long.</i>

720
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:31,229
<i>The audience really seemed to be fixated
on my new partner.</i>

721
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,015
<i>That day,
the atmosphere was so tense.</i>

722
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,310
<i>It happened during
the last dance of the semifinals.</i>

723
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,438
<i>- We were dancing the quickstep.</i>

724
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,858
<i>♪ Don't let me snooze
I was born to wear these shoes… ♪</i>

725
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:20,902
Are you okay?

726
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,282
Are you all right?

727
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,325
<i>It's not unusual
for dancers to fall,</i>

728
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,830
<i>but I'd never been associated
with such a bad fall before.</i>

729
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,333
<i>♪ Wake me up to dance, dance ♪</i>

730
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,128
<i>That was when it started.</i>

731
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,385
<i>She began to unravel.</i>

732
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,769
Years earlier, at a different competition,

733
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,146
she was dancing with another partner,

734
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,441
and a similar thing happened.

735
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,069
She began to suffer
from post-traumatic stress.

736
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,784
I knew she was going through that,

737
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,288
but I still got her in that dress
and made her compete in the final.

738
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,851
How did I make her dance, you ask?

739
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,027
I yelled at and berated her relentlessly.

740
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:51,117
<i>Even as her body froze,
her face still reacted to my words,</i>

741
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,080
<i>and her feet did exactly as I commanded.</i>

742
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,374
Your frame, it's loose.

743
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,253
Right side up.

744
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,172
Keep it. I said keep it.
Your frame is loose.

745
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,132
It's too loose!

746
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,060
You're heavy!

747
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,357
Lift your body up. Higher.

748
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,775
Keep it.

749
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:24,986
Keep it.

750
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,322
I kept pushing her
until the end of the competition.

751
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,248
And then,

752
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,418
to my shame,

753
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,006
I found myself liking her in that state.

754
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:54,515
That's the kind of man I am, I suppose.

755
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,269
Not a gentleman.

756
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,147
More of a Grim Reaper.

757
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,699
<i>Why did I ask him about it?</i>

758
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:21,083
I have caused Ms. Yagami so much pain.

759
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,588
Please keep this between us, okay?

760
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,514
<i>Was it a confession I wanted?</i>

761
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,603
<i>Did I wanna hear him reveal weakness?</i>

762
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,622
Lame, man.

763
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,401
I'll stop if you want.

764
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:27,603
<i>Before I knew it,
my body was moving on its own.</i>

765
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,193
<i>All I could do was give in to it.</i>

766
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,279
<i>Surrender to the gods of dance.</i>

767
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,009
Hang onto that persona of yours.

768
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,098
You can be the Grim Reaper.

769
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:56,483
I'll be the angel who defeats
the Grim Reaper of Blackpool.

770
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,428
<i>When I beat you,</i>

771
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,140
<i>you'll finally be free
of all that suffering.</i>

772
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,355
I really admire you, you know.

773
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,880
<i>Let's go overseas together
next time.</i>

774
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,552
<i>We'll enter as two pairs
in the World Championship at Blackpool.</i>

775
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,058
<i>I will unveil you to the world.</i>

776
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,811
<i>It'll be your debut.</i>

777
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,105
How are you?

778
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:29,112
That's Martha, the president of the WDL.

779
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,198
And he's a former world champion
who won the Carl Alan Award.

780
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,909
That's the tournament director,
and that's a big-shot businessman

781
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,038
who got a medal
for his contributions to the dance world.

782
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,457
- Hello.
- Hi.

783
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,876
Hello, Nino.

784
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,254
Fabio, good to see you.

785
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,631
- Fusako.
- Hi.

786
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,633
- Oh, hi, Catherine.
- Nice to see you.

787
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,218
Let me introduce you.

788
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,012
This is our choreographer, Nino,
and our designer, Fabio.

789
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,850
And this is our hair
and makeup artist, Catherine.

790
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,977
They're my European tour team.

791
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,395
Absolutely. Yes.

792
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,312
Hi, guys.

793
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:06,065
So you're the other Shinya?

794
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:09,068
- Very nice to meet you. A real pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

795
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:11,195
So cute.

796
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,947
And that's Aki, I think.

797
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,031
Yes.

798
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,452
- Hi.
- Hi.

799
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,662
- Very nice to meet you.
- Enjoy yourself.

800
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:20,913
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

801
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:22,707
- See you soon.
- Hi.

802
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,375
Alberto!

803
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,668
Alberto!

804
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:27,253
So nice to see you!

805
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:29,465
That's Alberto, the Latin champion.

806
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:38,599
Excuse me.

807
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,684
Shinya.

808
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:47,691
He's the ballroom world champion.

809
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,401
Giulio.

810
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:52,862
It's been a while.

811
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,865
Happy to see you made it.

812
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,743
And that's Giulio's partner,

813
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:01,413
the queen of the dance world, Liana.

814
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:06,418
She's also Mr. Sugiki's ex-girlfriend.

815
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:13,759
I'm here to tell you something.

816
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:17,553
Liana and I

817
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,015
are getting married after the competition.

818
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,687
Thank you for coming over here to tell me.

819
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,898
I have your blessing?

820
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,942
Of course.

821
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,528
Congratulations.

822
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,324
<i>It's okay, Sugiki.</i>

823
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,118
<i>I'll make sure you see no one but me.</i>

824
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,250
Mr. Moretti.

825
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:47,959
Nice to meet you.

826
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,211
My name is Shinya Suzuki,

827
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,713
and I plan on taking
first place in ballroom

828
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,967
at the next world championship.

829
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,138
I've been a fan for a long time.

830
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,225
Make sure you remember my face.

831
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,367
Sugiki, you coming?

832
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:21,910
Yes.

833
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,091
Yeah?

834
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,762
How are you feeling?

835
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,608
Here's the schedule for tomorrow.

836
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,708
I want to try more than Latin.

837
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,836
I wanted to give ballroom a shot.

838
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,423
Look, we've been over this.

839
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:21,094
Keep the fact that you also
do ballroom secret till 10 Dance.

840
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,638
Hmm?

841
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,851
You just wanna settle things
with Giulio, right?

842
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,485
Just do as you're told, okay?

843
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,989
You like pushing people around.

844
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:44,660
Fusako.

845
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:48,997
And me?

846
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,633
Could be you're the fool in the scenario.

847
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,515
That's why your girl was stolen from you.

848
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,320
Just focus on the competition for now.

849
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,117
Understood?

850
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,253
I've decided to stop dancing with you…

851
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,010
and pair up with Giulio instead.

852
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,058
<i>I need to choose the path
that will make me a champion.</i>

853
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:35,145
And if I stay with you,

854
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:39,274
I will never become a world champion.

855
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,736
I'm sure of it.

856
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,786
<i>How could she be so sure</i>

857
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:54,623
<i>that I could never win?</i>

858
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:03,673
<i>If it is true, why do I keep striving?</i>

859
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:30,867
<i>Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.</i>

860
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:35,247
Love is what makes it whole.

861
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,254
Love won't make me win.

862
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,617
Thank you.

863
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,661
- Go on in. Upstairs and to the right.
- Straight up the stairs.

864
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:16,955
Enjoy yourselves.

865
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:18,664
Thank you.

Thanks. You too.

877
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:29,026
You know, Mr. Sugiki
was seriously thinking of retiring

878
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,487
not too long ago.

879
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,241
After he and Liana broke up,

880
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,328
he couldn't find a partner
who was at his level.

881
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:43,166
The ones he did find couldn't keep up
with his strict training.

882
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,253
The only option he had

883
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:50,048
was picking me, the dropout.

884
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,762
He thinks the only way
he can win the title

885
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:59,140
is by pushing himself
to the breaking point.

886
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:07,399
I just want… to see
what we can accomplish together.

887
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:44,453
Our next competition
is the Professional Latin final.

888
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,791
Please welcome our finalists to the floor.

<i>tell stories with their bodies.</i>

902
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:04,367
<i>They can show the strength
and stoicism of an ancient tree,</i>

903
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,578
<i>or they can show lightness and air</i>

904
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:11,582
<i>as if wings had magically sprouted
from their ankles.</i>

905
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,510
Wow, number 23. Who is that?

906
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,512
His name's
Shinya Suzuki, apparently.

907
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,599
- Shinya Suzuki?
- Have you ever heard of this guy?

908
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,601
No, never. Must be an amateur.

909
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,478
- I guess.
- He's really good.

910
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:04,010
<i>The story his body was telling
was pure inspiration.</i>

911
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:10,642
<i>Suddenly,</i>

912
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,062

914
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,910
<i>♪ Long before ♪</i>

915
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:39,086
Oh God, I didn't know
anyone could dance like that.

916
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,421
Who is that?
Is that the Japanese guy?

917
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:42,422
Wow.

918
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:46,051
This is not a dance competition.
It's like a brawl.

919
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:50,931
The judge will likely take marks off,
but it sure is captivating.

920
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:17,582
We come now to the result
of the 73rd World Championship,

921
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,752
ballroom division.

922
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:23,046
Into first place,

923
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:26,801
Giulio Moretti and Liana Javalanka.

924
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:41,189
Into second place,

925
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,818
Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami.

926
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:58,875
Third, Dusan Novak and Valeria Orlova.

927
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,711
I remember
when he and Liana danced together

928
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,629
before he paired up with Fusako.

929
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:09,092
Their tango was so…
…passionate.

930
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:15,516
Uh, I mean, it was obvious
that Shinya was crazy about Liana.

931
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,978
But when he proposed to her,
something got in the way.

932
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:21,313
So I hear.

933
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:24,733
Giulio and Shinya's attack
is very similar.

934
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,777
Their ability is evenly matched,

935
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:31,198
or perhaps maybe there's just
the narrowest of margins between them.

936
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,242
But the one who gets to stand
at the top of the podium is who?

937
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,494
- Giulio.
- Giulio.

938
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:38,663
Shinya doesn't have what it takes
to overcome that slight margin.

939
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:41,583
- I'm sorry, Nino.
- No. I don't agree, Fabio. No, no, no.

940
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:45,504
Everyone is here to see
his obsessive determination.

941
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:46,421
I know.

942
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:49,508
And everyone comes here
to see him valiantly struggle…

943
01:29:50,676 --> 01:29:52,969
…just to end up losing again.

944
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,012
Yes.

945
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:57,140
The only person here
who thinks he has a chance of winning

946
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,852
is probably Shinya himself.

947
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,065
What the hell are you saying?

948
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,525
- Excuse me?
- Don't just say that.

949
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,485
Do something about it!

950
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,362
That "slight margin" you mentioned,

951
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,366
you mean Sugiki's
actually a better dancer, right?

952
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:18,203
- So help him win!
- Easy, calm down. Come on, Shinya, please.

953
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,539
You guys have the power to do that,
don't you?

954
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,540
No, I… I don't know.

955
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:23,792
- I'm telling you, let him fucking win!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa!

956
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,836
- Calm down.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

957
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:27,045
- Easy.
- Sorry…

958
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,505
- That's bullshit!
- I'm sorry.

959
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:32,801
- But there's nothing we can do.
- I… I'm so sorry. So sorry.

960
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,970
Ladies and gentlemen,

961
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:39,391
next we have a very special honor dance.

962
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:42,018
Please welcome to the floor

963
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,689
Liana and Shinya.

964
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,862
- Swapping partners?
- A switch!

965
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:55,366
- Shinya and Liana? That's fantastic!
- That's fantastic!

966
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:12,383
- Shinya!
- Shinya!

967
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:51,046
This is a total charade,
but look at him.

968
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:51,963
Mm.

969
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:54,926
Sugiki plays the part
of the perfect gentleman.

970
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,845
- You know, even I wanna be like him.
- I know what you mean.

971
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:02,307
He's the ideal lover
that everyone wants to be.

972
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,477
So true. So true.

973
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,214
That was a wonderful debut.

974
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,134
Where is Ms. Tajima?

975
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:46,639
- I don't know.
- I see.

976
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,452
Didn't that bug you today?

977
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:11,497
Ah.

978
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:13,499
No, not at all.

979
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,293
Liana and I were done a long time ago.

980
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,463
You haven't moved on though.

981
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:26,929
I can't stand that kinda thing.

982
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:30,599
Being deceived.

983
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,437
Betrayed.

984
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,067
I can't forgive that.

985
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:55,040
So you think I'm still in love with Liana?

986
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,545
That I've never even looked
at another woman?

987
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:03,632
That I've remained totally devoted to her?

988
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,303
Is that what you saw?

989
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:10,556
Well?

990
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,727
If the audience saw a reunion
between two lovers,

991
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:17,980
then tonight's show was a success.

992
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,818
No one was watching Giulio's performance
after that, were they?

993
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:27,448
What do you mean?

994
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,243
What?

995
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:38,417
What the hell are you saying?

996
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,088
You're really okay with it?

997
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,678
I'm asking if that's really good enough…

998
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:51,889
…for you!

999
01:37:04,276 --> 01:37:07,363
You said you wouldn't settle
for anything but first place.

1000
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:02,501
What's wrong?

1001
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:05,796
What is it?

1002
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,954
I can't be with you anymore.

1003
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,583
If we go any further, it could destroy me.

1004
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:47,463
What the fuck?

1005
01:38:50,549 --> 01:38:53,969
- That's not it.
- No, stop! You're my enemy now.

1006
01:38:57,723 --> 01:38:59,308
That's not true.

1007
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:54,446
In the end…

1008
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,249
you and I can never become one.

1009
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:19,448
Shit.

1010
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:33,814
Shinya.

1011
01:43:08,223 --> 01:43:09,141
Shinya.

1012
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:18,025
I realized something.

1013
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,947
I think I can do more for you.

1014
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:31,538
We can do more. I just know it.

1015
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,920
And even if it's just you…

1016
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:42,799
…you can go far!

1017
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,720
You could go as far as you want.

1018
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:14,289
Let's go.

1019
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,291
Huh?

1020
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:18,752
What?

1021
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:27,134
The yellow is very nice.

1022
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:28,803
Isn't is amazing?

1023
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:31,180
This and…

1024
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:32,473
Ah!

1025
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,268
Hmm, no, no, no.

1026
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:35,851
Red.

1027
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:37,562
I wanna see you in red.

1028
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,651
- So you're gonna go with that?
- Yeah. Isn't it cool?

1029
01:44:45,570 --> 01:44:49,156
Now, do we want it parted to this side?
Or to that side?

1030
01:44:49,157 --> 01:44:51,451
Neater and more polished.

1031
01:44:57,916 --> 01:45:00,960
So I want to show you
the beginning of Alemana.

1032
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,421
We're going to do four to six.

1033
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:05,549
Let's do sliding doors.
Just the beginning.

1034
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:54,049
This is the first time
a dance competition in Japan

1035
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:56,093
has gotten this much media attention,
isn't it?

1036
01:47:56,094 --> 01:47:57,554
Yeah, seems so.

1037
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,891
It's too bad Giulio and Alberto
aren't here though.

1038
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,769
They backed out.
Said they had a show to do.

1039
01:48:05,687 --> 01:48:08,523
I say first place will go to Shinya.

1040
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:11,775
He'll place third at best.

1041
01:48:11,776 --> 01:48:12,652
What?

1042
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,405
Well, why do you think the federation
put up the money

1043
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:19,033
and brought in so many foreign dancers?

1044
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:21,745
They're going to want
some kind of payback, you know?

1045
01:48:24,122 --> 01:48:26,791
That's the dance world for ya, huh?

1046
01:48:55,987 --> 01:48:58,907
Mr. Sugiki is the guest, right?

1047
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,411
So, he's here.

1048
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:09,834
I won't ever see him again

1049
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,170
outside of competition.

1050
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,009
When I saw him in Blackpool, it…

1051
01:49:20,303 --> 01:49:22,013
it wasn't just dancing.

1052
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:26,184
The crowd and the other dancers…

1053
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:29,813
they were blown away by it.

1054
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:37,529
I wanna move the audience like that
every time.

1055
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,127
Five-minute call
for the finalists!

1056
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:55,964
Can I get everyone
to come together, please?

1057
01:49:57,507 --> 01:49:59,801
All finalists, please come this way.

1058
01:50:16,443 --> 01:50:22,031
The next event will be
the Professional Latin American final.

1059
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:46,431
So close, and yet so far.

1060
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:40,485
<i>Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.</i>

1061
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,032
<i>Love is what makes it whole.</i>

1062
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:54,039
And once again,

1063
01:51:54,040 --> 01:52:01,088
here are the 2026 Asian Cup
ballroom champions,

1064
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:06,593
