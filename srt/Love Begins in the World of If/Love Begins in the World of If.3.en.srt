1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,190
You can't just delay the delivery like
this. It's causing a lot of problems for us.

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,190
Seriously.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,780
Telling us it'll be a week
late on the original due date?

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,450
Isn't that something you
should've told us sooner?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,040
I am truly sorry.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,070
This is my responsibility.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,010
Don't apologize, Kano.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,940
It's my fault. This happened
because I left it to you.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,030
I...

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,910
What's wrong?

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,030
You look so down.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,040
Don't worry.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,670
Kano.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,710
I for sure know...

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,640
everything about you.

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,250
Ogami.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,640
It was a dream...

19
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,950
It's already been a week

20
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,710
since I've come to this world.

21
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,780
Even though this world
is different in so many ways...

22
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,290
Whoa...

23
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,225
(How to Be an Outstanding Salesperson)

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,980
The me from this world
bought this book too.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,280
But in other ways... it's exactly the same.

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Okay.

27
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,130
Sorry I'm late.

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,400
Oh, it's fine.

29
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,870
Did something happen?

30
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,590
I went to buy some pastries.

31
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,830
You can pick one.

32
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,910
There's one for me?

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,360
I bought extra.

34
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,810
Let's eat them on the bullet train later.

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Thank you.

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790
Alright.

37
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,230
Let's get going.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
A business trip with just the two of us.

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,469
If this were the Ogami from my world,

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,870
I'd be totally miserable right now.

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,810
They're all dessert buns...

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,490
But with this Ogami,

43
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,440
it's so much more relaxing.

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,600
"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 3)

45
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,569
Okay, I'm counting on you to
do your part as we discussed.

46
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,960
Yeah, I'll handle the product description.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm counting on you.

48
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm fully prepared, too.

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,040
I hope I can show Ogami my good side.

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
As you can see, this
system is highly accessible.

51
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,480
It won't interrupt your business
operations, so you can rest assured.

52
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,510
I see.

53
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,979
It's easily customizable with low-code.

54
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,670
And it's very user-friendly.

55
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,609
That's impressive.

56
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,810
You explained it very clearly.

57
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,380
Thank you.

58
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,929
Well then, I'll send you the price quote.

59
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,410
Please take your time to consider it.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,529
This would be really
convenient for us to use.

61
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,530
It would.

62
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,890
Excellent.

63
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Their reaction was good.

64
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,580
We'll be in your care then.

65
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,090
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

66
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,210
Miyoshi-san.

67
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,930
What's that stain on your cuff?

68
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,360
Oh, this?

69
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,428
It's nothing.

70
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,876
I just got it dirty working in
the warehouse a minute ago.

71
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
How embarrassing.

72
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,340
You work on the floor
yourself, Miyoshi-san?

73
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,330
Yeah, there's a lot that
needs to be checked.

74
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,909
It's amazing that you can
handle the fieldwork too.

75
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,620
Oh, come on.

76
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,480
We're just short-staffed.

77
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,220
We're running around like crazy every day.

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Is that so?

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,060
It would be great if you could use some of
that time for product planning, wouldn't it?

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,060
You're telling me.

81
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,609
I saw in an interview on
your company's website...

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,306
that you wanted to
strengthen your private brand.

83
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,490
I believe that's what I read.

84
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,990
- Wow! You even read that?
- Yes.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Of course.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,579
Well... if you don't mind...

87
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,600
would you like a tour of the factory later?

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,080
- Really?
- Of course.

89
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,289
- Then yes, I'd love that.
- Ah.

90
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,290
Let's go then.

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

92
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Great work.

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,270
Great work, everyone.

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,379
When you're constantly
bogged down by operations...

95
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,480
it's hard to stay motivated, isn't it?

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,189
You're absolutely right.

97
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,589
We're buried in
confirmation tasks every day.

98
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,219
In that case, if you pair the
management system from before...

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,969
with another one of our support systems,

100
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,570
you could save a
significant amount of time.

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Really?

102
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,339
Yes. And by increasing your efficiency,

103
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,840
you'll have more time for
what you really want to do.

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,190
Most of all, I'm looking forward
to your new brand, Miyoshi-san.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,330
Ogami-san.

106
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,270
Our philosophy...

107
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,570
is to hopefully move forward
together with our clients.

108
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,260
Right, Kano?

109
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,070
Oh.

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,880
Yes, um...

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,026
I'll include the price quote
for the other system...

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,270
when I send it over.

113
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,220
Thank you.

114
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh, right. Since you're here,

115
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,080
why don't we have dinner tonight?

116
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,840
That's wonderful. I'd love to.

117
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,829
I'll make a reservation then.

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,930
Thank you.

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,380
Then we gratefully accept.

120
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,336
I'll have some of our
younger guys join us, too.

121
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,726
- Great, the more the merrier.
- Let's have some fun tonight.

122
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,950
We're in your hands.

(How to Be an Outstanding Salesperson
by Takeda Yuhei, CEO of Seishin Holdings)

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Thanks.

125
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Here.

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
You're amazing, Ogami.

127
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
What do you mean?

128
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
You hit it off with them instantly.

129
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,789
You didn't just sell the management system,

130
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,680
you managed to upsell
them on another product.

131
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,660
I only sold it because I
genuinely think they need it.

132
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,730
By saving time,
Miyoshi-san can do what he wants to do.

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
And that will be better for his company.

134
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,340
You really think things through.

135
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,750
Well, that's what a salesperson's job is.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,490
I could never do that.

137
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are you so down?

138
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,730
It's only your first year.
You've still got a lot to learn.

139
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,990
But...

140
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,680
But you're studying hard, aren't you?

141
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,770
You read that book, too.

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
No.

143
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,750
No, that's not... um...

144
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,000
I just bought it because I
thought it might be useful...

145
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,120
I've bought it, too.

146
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,840
- Huh?
- That same book.

147
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
You did, Ogami?

148
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,010
You mean you've read such an elementary
book?

149
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,250
Is there a problem with that?

150
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
But...

151
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,170
You don't seem like you'd need it.

152
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,350
That's not true.

153
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,069
When I first started at the company,

154
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,720
I was always getting chewed
out by upper management and clients.

155
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Really?

156
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,310
Yeah.

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,939
I didn't know what to do back then.

158
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,970
So I bought that book on a whim.

159
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,760
It covers all the basics of sales.

160
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,040
And the print is big, so it's easy to read.

161
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,300
I never would've imagined...

162
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Really?

163
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,380
I always thought you were the
type who's perfect at everything.

164
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,580
No one's like that.

165
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,100
Everyone starts at the same place.

166
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,890
I see...

167
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,190
So the Ogami I see today is
the result of all your hard work.

168
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,450
Of course.

169
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,559
You've been working hard too,

170
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,050
which is why you're doing so well in sales.

171
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,470
I'm not doing well at all.

172
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Huh? What?

173
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,270
Don't sell yourself short.

174
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,390
Huh?

175
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
You were forced to transfer, but you didn't
give up. You've been working so hard.

176
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,340
That's incredible.

177
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,390
Those words.

178
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
I'm so glad we could close this deal.

179
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Thanks to you.

180
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,700
Thank you so much for today.

181
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
You've been a huge help.

182
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,890
We look forward to working with you.

183
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,426
I always... wanted to
hear him say that to me.

184
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,270
Let's find another time to pitch to them.

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,250
- Okay.
- I'll keep an eye out.

186
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,510
I'm counting on you.

187
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,890
Thanks.

188
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,030
The work's not over yet.

189
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,210
We still have that dinner with the client.

190
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,910
A client dinner...

191
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,390
What's with that sour face?

192
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,939
It's just that, when I was
in the tech department,

193
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,310
I hardly ever went out
for drinks with anyone.

194
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,566
To be honest, I'm not a
big fan of those situations...

195
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,300
While the tech guys are figuring out
how to write elegant code,

196
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,570
we're at the dinner table
gathering client needs.

197
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,306
That's an impressive
job in its own right, isn't it?

198
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,490
Well, when you put it that way...

199
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,840
It'll be fine.

200
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,190
Don't overthink it. Just enjoy yourself.

201
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,730
Alright, maybe I'll give it a shot.

202
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,220
What's wrong with having a dream?

203
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,680
Miyoshi-san is right.

204
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,860
Oh! You get it, Ogami-san.

205
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,689
I get that it's never too late to start.

206
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,410
We're really on the same page.

207
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,780
Here, here. Drink up, drink up.

208
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,180
- Well, don't mind if I do.
- Right, Tsuchiya-san?

209
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,370
Right? Kano-san.

210
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,410
Yes.

211
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,550
Come on, another toast.

212
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,830
A toast, a toast!

213
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,550
Let's all toast together. Cheers!

214
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,620
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

215
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
Excuse me.

216
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,260
Knowing how to have fun...

217
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,420
is really difficult for me...

218
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,450
Excuse me, Kano-san.

219
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,283
Miyoshi-san can get a
little carried away sometimes.

220
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,430
Oh, not at all.

221
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,400
I think he's just happy to talk with
someone who shares his passion.

222
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,684
Ogami-san is a really
good person, isn't he?

223
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:15,956
Yeah, he is.

224
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,350
He really is...

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Kitagawa-san.

226
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,650
Here, use this.

227
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Huh?

228
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,130
You looked cold.

229
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,390
I'll talk to the staff in a bit

230
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,880
and ask them to turn up the heat.

231
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,850
Thank you.

232
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,970
It's hard to know what to
wear these days, isn't it?

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,430
Yeah, it has gotten a bit chilly.

234
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,890
How is it compared to Tokyo?

235
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,050
Tokyo's probably a little warmer.

236
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,690
I see.

237
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,770
I'm so jealous.

238
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Tsuchiya-san.

239
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,470
Is there anything you don't eat?

240
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,020
- Oh... Sorry! I'll get it!
- It's fine, I'm closer.

241
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,660
My apologies.

242
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:01,385
Thank you.

243
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,670
That's Ogami-san for
you. Always so thoughtful.

244
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,900
- It's hot, so be careful.
- Thanks.

245
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,920
He's good at his job,

246
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,260
and he's considerate of others.

247
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,340
What are you two doing?
Want me to set you up?

248
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,110
No wonder he's so popular.

249
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,950
Anyway,

250
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,050
I don't really care if Ogami is popular.

251
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,360
Kano-san, are you okay?

252
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Hm?

253
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,030
- Should I get you some water?
- Oh... No, I'm fine. It's just...

254
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,850
I'm really sorry.

255
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,250
- I'm really okay.
- Really?

256
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,380
Yeah.

257
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,300
Oh, it's getting late.

258
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,180
I'll call a taxi.

259
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,019
- Sorry for keeping you out so late.
- No, no, thank you for handling it.

260
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,020
Not at all.

261
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Huh?

262
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,000
Is that a Fluffy Bear?

263
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Huh?

264
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,670
You know about them?

265
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,740
Yeah, they're really popular with kids.

266
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,130
Yeah, exactly.

267
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,879
My best friend's kid is obsessed with them.

268
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,420
- That's why I have it.
- Uh-huh.

269
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,050
Oh.

270
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,070
Does that mean...

271
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,050
Kano-san, do you have kids?

272
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,530
Oh, no.

273
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:12,229
- Um... My niece likes them.
- Oh.

274
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,470
Oh, I see.

275
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,090
You just seemed to know a lot about them.

276
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,570
I thought you might be married.

277
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,490
- No, I'm not even seeing anyone.
- I see.

278
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
No, actually...

279
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
This bear...
Hm?

280
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,740
Ah... I'm exhausted.

281
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
(Sorry, running a little late.
(Wanna grab another drink in my room?)

282
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Ah...

283
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,520
I wasn't sure what you liked,
so I bought a bit of everything.

284
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,600
This should last us until morning.

285
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,710
Ah...

286
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,380
I'm dead tired.

287
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,070
Yeah.

288
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,000
Miyoshi-san just wouldn't stop talking.

289
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,420
But thanks to him,
they really opened up to us.

290
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,030
Looks like they'll be a
regular client from now on.

291
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,190
I see.

292
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,229
If it had just been me,

293
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,350
I'm not sure I could have
landed the contract at all.

294
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,590
What are you talking about?

295
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,609
It was your sincere explanation
that laid the groundwork.

296
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,100
That's why they trusted us.

297
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,660
Didn't I say it earlier?

298
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't sell yourself short.

299
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Somehow,

300
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,260
I feel like you're spoiling me.

301
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
You think so?

302
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,670
Yeah, I do.

303
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,020
The Ogami from my original world
would never be like this.

304
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,710
Well,

305
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,230
you did ask for my help before.

306
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,450
What do you mean?

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't you remember?

308
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,980
Back when you first
joined the sales department,

309
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,840
didn't you take on the tech department's
work too and end up missing a deadline?

310
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
Oh...

311
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,970
That incident...

312
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,940
I insisted on doing it all myself,

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,570
but I couldn't finish in time.

314
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,829
It was all my fault.

315
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,660
I made you go apologize
to the client alone, Ogami.

316
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,850
But you were trying so hard back then.

317
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,650
Huh?

318
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,660
When you asked for my help,

319
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,010
you said it when you
apologized to me right after that.

320
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,170
Oh, I apologized...?

321
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,180
After bowing and apologizing to the client.

322
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,180
I'm so sorry things turned
out this way... Ogami.

323
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,850
It's alright.

324
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,650
I share some of the blame.

325
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,930
Thank you.

326
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,600
I still don't know anything about sales.

327
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,230
So...

328
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,020
could you teach me,
starting from the basics?

329
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,980
Please, help me.

330
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,110
You also went to our colleagues in sales.

331
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,520
You asked them to teach
you what you didn't know.

332
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,499
You were hard to approach at first,

333
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,740
but that's when you started to get along
with everyone in the sales department.

334
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,209
I really admired you for that.

335
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,090
I thought you were an honest, good guy.

336
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,460
An honest, good guy...

337
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,080
The me from back then...

338
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,490
Why are you apologizing, Ogami?

339
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,820
It's clearly my fault...

340
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,710
No.

341
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,800
It's my fault. I'm the one
who gave you the work.

342
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm used to apologizing.

343
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,850
If you mess up again in the future,

344
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,090
I'll go apologize with you.

345
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,010
I never asked you to do that.

346
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,760
How could I make you do that?

347
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I see.

348
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,850
I understand.

349
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,890
What's wrong?

350
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Nothing.

351
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,590
I was just thinking about how that's the
reason why everyone is so nice to me.

352
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,820
You say that like it has
nothing to do with you.

353
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,940
This world...

354
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,080
This is great, Tomioka.

355
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,860
- With such a reliable sales engineer here.
- Right!

356
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm really counting on you, Kano-san.

357
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Hey, Kano.

358
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,270
Let's go for a drink today.

359
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:26,220
I thought this was just an "ideal
world where everyone is nice to me."

360
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,610
But...

361
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,620
this world...

362
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,840
is a world that branched off from the
"me who could honestly ask for help."

363
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,260
Is it really okay for me to stay here?

364
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,890
Hm?

365
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,830
Oh, nothing.

366
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,740
Oh, right.

367
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,659
We're taking an early
bullet train tomorrow.

368
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,780
Shouldn't we go look for some souvenirs to
bring back?

369
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,130
Souvenirs...

370
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,240
I don't really have anyone to give them to.

371
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,850
I see.

372
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,050
I'd like to go search for a little bit.

373
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,190
Buying for someone?

374
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,510
Yeah.

375
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
For who?

376
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,110
My mom happens to be visiting Tokyo.

377
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,570
Your mom, huh?

378
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
What is it?

379
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,170
Nothing.

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,260
I was just wondering if
you live with someone.

381
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,950
I was living with my
girlfriend until a year ago.

382
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
But we broke up.

383
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,170
I see...

384
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,370
She said I wasn't thoughtful enough.

385
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,940
That's not true at all.

386
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,280
You're very thoughtful, Ogami.

387
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,810
You think so?

388
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,090
Thanks.

389
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,800
How long have you been single, Kano?

390
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,090
Huh?

391
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Sorry.

392
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,760
I couldn't help but overhear
you back at the restaurant.

393
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Oh.

394
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,210
I had a long-term girlfriend in college.

395
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,579
But we broke up while we
were job hunting after graduating.

396
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,990
I've been single ever since.

397
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,130
Why'd you break up?

398
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,690
She was moving away for a job.

399
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,320
She said she couldn't do a
long-distance relationship.

400
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I see.

401
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
Her loss.

402
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,230
She let a great catch get away.

403
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Alright.

404
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,580
It's about time for bed.

405
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,690
Well then.

406
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,050
Don't you like sweets?

407
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Alright then.

408
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Good night.

409
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,680
My body's so hot.

410
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,830
All this time,

411
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,390
I've been trying so
hard not to think about it.

412
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
But I...

413
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I really...

414
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,840
What is this...?

415
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
(Next Episode)
These feelings I have for Ogami...

416
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:49,506
(The ideal Ogami from the 'If World')
I can't believe I feel this way.

417
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,989
(Torn between the 'If' and 'Real' worlds)
The Ogami from my world was so strict.

418
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,580
(Akihito's true feelings)
So why am I thinking about that Ogami now?

419
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,790
I always wished... we could
just keep laughing together.
