1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,440
Who is it...?

2
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,220
Good morning.

3
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,260
Good morning.

4
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,610
Just as I thought.

5
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,430
I'm back.

6
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,770
The month I spent in that other world...

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,960
is just gone. Like it never happened.

8
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,380
Which means...

9
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,760
the alternative
proposal for Ibushi-san...

10
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:29,648
that's still not resolved.

11
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,352
(Apologize to Ibushi-san from
Route Printing) (Revise Ogami's quote)

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,380
Morning.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,990
Good morning.

14
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,580
Good morning.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,220
Tomioka, good morning.

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,370
Good morning.

17
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,649
Um... about yesterday.

18
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,390
The document you gave me?

19
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,080
I went over it for you.

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,920
All that's left...

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,260
is for you to make
the corrections, Tomioka.

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Oh, okay.

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,440
Did I make that many mistakes?

24
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
Yeah.

25
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,320
Oh... I'm sorry.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,009
If you take the time to
understand them now,

27
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,730
you won't make the same mistakes next time.

28
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,680
Oh... thank you.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,090
Well... it was my fault for just
changing it without saying anything.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,160
You know,

31
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,290
Kano-san, you seem different.

32
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,710
Do I?

33
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,120
How should I put it?

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,540
You used to have this whole
'stay away from me' vibe.

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,040
It was hard to approach you.

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,390
I see.

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,350
- A 'stay away' vibe, huh?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,130
I'll try not to be like
that anymore. Sorry.

39
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,390
Right.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Morn'.

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,010
Morn'.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,050
Ogami, good morning.

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,220
Morning.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,090
Did you get home okay yesterday?

45
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,810
Yeah, sorry for all the trouble.

46
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,390
Um...

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,080
I wanted to talk to you
about the Ibushi-san matter.

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
Talk?

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,240
- With me?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,390
Because you're the only one I can ask.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,880
You know,

52
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,160
you seem like a different person.

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,240
Because I realized I needed to change.

54
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,010
Is that so?

55
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,030
Well...

56
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,530
Let's talk later.

57
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm counting on you.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay.

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:27,000
"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 5)

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,840
I think the alternative
proposal should work as is.

61
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,920
But I don't think the
system itself is the problem.

62
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,730
What do you mean?

63
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,040
This is just a hunch,

64
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,810
but maybe Ibushi-san isn't
very familiar with the system?

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,440
What?

66
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:45,060
But he's the head of
the materials department.

67
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,330
And all the meetings went so smoothly.

68
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,620
- He never asked a single question.
- He didn't, did he?

69
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,870
Wait, no way.

70
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,430
You don't think he was just nodding
along during the explanations...

71
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,650
because he didn't actually
understand any of it?

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,840
He doesn't seem like the type of guy
who'd admit he doesn't get something.

73
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,940
So, because he's in over his head,

74
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,013
he's painted himself into a
corner and is now complaining.

75
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,500
If that's the case, a lot of
things would make sense.

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,980
Thank you, Ogami.

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,750
I never would have reached
that conclusion on my own.

78
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Well...

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm sure you were just being very thorough
when you explained the system, Kano.

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,930
No, my approach as a
salesperson was all wrong.

81
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,920
I didn't try to understand his perspective.

82
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,590
Instead, I just hurt his pride.

83
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,180
You really have changed.

84
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,990
Before I go apologize,

85
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,529
I'm going to figure out the alternative
proposal and how to approach him.

86
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,680
I'll help.

87
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,590
Thank you, but...

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,460
I feel this is something I have
to take responsibility for myself.

89
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,080
That's what being a responsible
salesperson is all about.

90
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,350
I see.

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,750
I understand.

92
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,020
A client just gave me these. Want one?

93
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,450
Oh, great. Yes, please.

94
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
Thanks.

95
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,020
There's more...

96
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,690
Oh.

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,800
Can I have one too?

98
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,330
Huh?

99
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,610
Oh, you want one?

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,770
Great, I'll take one then.

101
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,136
- Sorry about that.
- Here you go.

102
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,800
Don't mind if I do. Thank you.

103
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,580
You know...

104
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,480
did something good happen to you?

105
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,650
No, not really.

106
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:57,715
No, it's just, this is a little surprising.

107
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,640
- You always seem like you don't want to be bothered.
- Yeah.

108
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,540
- I thought you didn't really want to talk to us.
- No, no.

109
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,870
Um... I'm really sorry about that.

110
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,540
I guess...

111
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,729
I didn't want to be a bother to anyone,

112
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,699
but it seems I just made things worse.

113
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,280
Not at all.

114
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,710
- You're doing a great job, Kano.
- Totally.

115
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,469
You just transferred here,

116
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,719
and you're already handling
clients all by yourself.

117
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,989
We were just talking
about how brave you are.

118
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,940
Really?

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Thank you.

120
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,110
Oh, um...

121
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,759
From now on, if there's
anything I don't understand,

122
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,146
would it be okay to ask you guys for help?

123
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,620
Huh?

124
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:32,710
- Oh, of course. Ask us anything.
- You're so cool.

125
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,790
Thank you.

126
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,799
Um... is there anything
I can help you with?

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh, I'm good for now.

128
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,200
- Okay then.
- Thanks. I'll dig in.

129
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,590
In this world too,

130
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,690
if I'm the one who changes,

131
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,390
everything around me changes so much.

132
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,530
Kano.

133
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,250
Yeah?

134
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,250
You're heading over to Ibushi-san's, right?

135
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,180
That's right.

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm going too.

137
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,910
No.

138
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,780
- This time, I'm going alone...
- I know how you feel, Kano.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
But...

140
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,750
at least let me be there to back you up.

141
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Let's go.

142
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,940
Looks like we'll be a little early.

143
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,730
Yeah. We definitely can't be late for this.

144
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,910
We have to do whatever it takes to
stop them from canceling the contract.

145
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,210
Right.

146
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,930
But...

147
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,010
what if he won't even listen
to what we have to say?

148
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Okay.

149
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,350
Let's head in.

150
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,820
What's wrong?

151
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,940
Are you not feeling well?

152
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,470
I'm just a little nervous.

153
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Sorry.

154
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,480
Your hands are freezing.

155
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,630
Are you okay?

156
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,750
It's fine. It's just my constitution.

157
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,010
Your constitution?

158
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,060
That's right.

159
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,150
I forgot. The Ogami in
this world doesn't know yet.

160
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,890
Uh...

161
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,290
When I get nervous, my
body temperature drops.

162
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,890
And I get a little anemic.

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,450
Raising my blood sugar helps.

164
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Oh no.

165
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,500
I never had any symptoms
in that other world,

166
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,090
so I didn't prepare anything.

167
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,320
Sorry.

168
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,840
Can we buy something warm somewhere?

169
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,010
Don't worry.

170
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,180
I came prepared.

171
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,830
It's okay. You've got this.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
(You've got this.)

173
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
Ogami, your hand... it's so warm.

174
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,990
Oh...

175
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,540
Thank you. I feel much better now.

176
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,290
I see.

177
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,570
I'm sorry I have such a troublesome
constitution. Sorry for the trouble.

178
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,010
Not at all.

179
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,650
Alright.

180
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,550
I'm okay now.

181
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,130
Okay.

182
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,310
Are you sure you're okay?

183
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,630
You can rest. I can go in alone.

184
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,700
I'm fine.

185
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,490
I don't want to make you go
apologize by yourself again.

186
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,330
Huh?

187
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,510
Let's go.

188
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,730
I'm truly sorry for what happened.

189
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,080
I have nothing to say to you.

190
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,920
- Um...
- Ibushi-san.

191
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,130
What is it that your factory needs?

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,180
Could you please tell me one more time?

193
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,210
What?

194
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,580
From the very first time
I visited your factory,

195
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,126
I was struck by how
meticulous your employees are.

196
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,480
They're so full of energy,

197
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,906
and the atmosphere is so
cheerful and harmonious.

198
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,410
It's truly wonderful.

199
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
Well...

200
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,720
I think so too.

201
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,090
Everyone always has a smile on their face.

202
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,089
You can tell they love what they do.

203
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,370
It left a deep impression on me.

204
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,980
So, my hope is...

205
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,000
to lighten your workload,
even if just by a little.

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,980
So that everyone who works here...

207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,580
can work with more passion.

208
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,870
What do we need to do to achieve that goal?

209
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,190
Let's rethink this together.

210
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,340
I'm counting on you.

211
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,400
Kano here is also a brilliant
talent from our tech department.

212
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,810
To help all of you find
more fulfillment in your work,

213
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,300
please allow us to offer our support.

214
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I understand.

215
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,850
Thank you very much.

216
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Good work.

217
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Thanks...

218
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
What's this?

219
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,760
Isn't it obvious?

220
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,980
Strawberry milk.

221
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Why?

222
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,930
You said raising your
blood sugar helps, right?

223
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,740
Even so, this is way too cute.

224
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,610
Thank you so much for today.

225
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,410
Honestly, I was pretty surprised.

226
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,960
Surprised by what?

227
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,980
I didn't expect you to approach
Ibushi-san like that.

228
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,800
Was it weird?

229
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,690
No.

230
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,170
I think it was great.

231
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,780
You really put yourself in his shoes.

232
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,587
And Ibushi-san definitely felt it.

233
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,420
I just said what I truly thought.

234
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,090
Because I genuinely
believe it's a good factory.

235
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,430
Besides,

236
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,080
someone taught me that just
talking about the system isn't enough.

237
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,530
Who taught you?

238
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,460
Who indeed...

239
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,570
An overprotective salesman.

240
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,530
An overprotective salesman?

241
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Yeah.

242
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,150
The way you've changed recently, Kano...

243
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
is it all thanks to that guy?

244
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,780
You could say that.

245
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,823
(Apologize to Ibushi-san
from Route Printing)

246
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,800
- Kano, could you check this for me?
- Sure.

247
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,770
Hmm...

248
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,810
Yeah, not bad.

249
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah, it's much easier
to understand than before.

250
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,990
That's great.

251
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,220
- I'm finally starting to get the hang of it.
- That's good.

252
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,980
By the way, do you have
Ito-san's contact info?

253
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Ito-san?

254
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,195
Oh, you mean from Marunobe Electric?

255
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,870
- Yes.
- I have it.

256
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,130
Can you give me his contact info later?

257
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,050
Sure.

258
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,609
I'll send it to you later.

259
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,669
- Thanks.
- No problem.

260
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,240
Kano, are you not using this
business card holder anymore?

261
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,590
Gave up on it. It's such a pain.

262
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,340
You finally realized.

263
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,050
You think so too, Iwase?

264
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,320
Actually, me too.

265
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,840
A little old-fashioned, you think?

266
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,379
No, it's that he's from
the tech department,

267
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,260
but he's super traditional
and old-fashioned.

268
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,829
I know, right? He still
uses coins to buy drinks.

269
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,199
- He's a traditionalist at heart, isn't he?
- Totally.

270
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,599
- Hey, are you guys badmouthing me?
- Not at all~

271
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,069
- Yes, you are.
- I didn't say a thing.

272
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,670
- You totally just did.
- I said nothing.

273
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,290
Can I sit here?

274
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,350
Yeah, sure.

275
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,770
Looks like you're not trying to shoulder
all the work by yourself anymore.

276
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,070
You really thought I was
pushing myself too hard?

277
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,070
The reason you became like that...

278
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,930
it all started back then, didn't it?

279
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,550
Huh?

280
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,250
When you first joined the sales department.

281
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,069
You took on work from
the tech department too,

282
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,630
and ended up missing a deadline, right?

283
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
Ever since then,

284
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,380
I felt like you changed.

285
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,770
You started carrying every burden alone.

286
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,550
And you grew more and more stubborn.

287
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,320
Yeah...

288
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,870
Yeah, that incident might
have been the last straw.

289
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,870
Ogami, you must have been
so disappointed in me back then.

290
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,090
Disappointed?

291
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,290
Back then,

292
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,560
why did you apologize, Ogami?

293
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,060
It was my fault...

294
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,270
No.

295
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,460
It was my fault. I'm the one
who assigned you the work.

296
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,140
I thought you were disappointed in me.

297
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,560
So I decided I could only
rely on myself from then on.

298
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
What?

299
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,240
What's with that look?

300
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
No, it's just...

301
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,910
At that time,

302
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,709
I felt that I'd failed to notice
how burdened you were.

303
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,550
The responsibility was on me.

304
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,040
Huh?

305
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,000
And because I'd heard
how brilliant you were,

306
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,430
I ended up leaving everything to
you. I've also done some reflecting.

307
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
No way...

308
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,240
- I thought...
- Besides,

309
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,580
if you ever make a mistake again,

310
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,540
I'll be there to apologize with you.

311
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,080
I never asked you to do that.

312
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,910
How could I let you?

313
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,570
Because you said that,

314
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,650
I thought I was overstepping.

315
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,679
That's why I decided to
stop meddling in your affairs.

316
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,710
That's because...

317
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
I didn't want my mistakes...

318
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,330
to force you into that kind of
humiliating apology ever again.

319
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,130
I didn't want to do that again.

320
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,520
You don't mean...

321
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,620
What is it?

322
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,250
When you grabbed me back then,

323
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,660
I was surprised because
your hand was so cold.

324
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,820
When you get angry,

325
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,900
does your body temperature drop like that?

326
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,160
No, it's not that dramatic.

327
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,400
You weren't actually angry then, were you?

328
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,830
How could I be angry?

329
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,530
I just didn't want my actions...

330
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,080
to make you feel upset, Ogami.

331
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,820
You were worried about me?

332
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,770
Of course.

333
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,020
Of course I was worried.

334
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
What the heck?

335
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,349
And here I thought you were avoiding me.

336
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,820
Why would I ever avoid you?

337
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
Ah...

338
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
So that's how it was.

339
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,790
I finally saw it.

340
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,300
This world's Ogami...

341
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
and his genuine smile.

342
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,770
Sorry about that.

343
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,630
I was just a little surprised.

344
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,740
So all this time, Ogami...

345
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,650
you were thinking of me.

346
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,510
Ogami.

347
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Yeah?

348
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,020
You know, Ogami,

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,220
both as a salesman

350
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,370
and as a person, I truly respect you.

351
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,940
Where did that come from?

352
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,280
I just felt I needed to tell you properly.

353
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,000
Because you're someone I look up to, Ogami.

354
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
No.

355
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,570
From now on, I'm going
to meddle in your affairs.

356
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
Please do.

357
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,780
Because I've also realized...

358
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:19,760
that sales isn't a one-man job.

359
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Is that also...

360
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,280
advice from that
overprotective salesman?

361
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,200
You could say that.

362
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Yeah.

363
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,450
Maybe it's thanks to him.

364
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,190
I finally understand my own feelings.

365
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,840
The person I truly love is...

366
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,850
the Ogami from this world.

367
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,820
He's so clumsy, yet so gentle.

368
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,690
That's just not fair.

369
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,230
But...

370
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,540
there's no way I can ever tell him.

371
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,790
Is this also...

372
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,880
advice from that
overprotective salesman?

373
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,690
Yeah, you could say that.

374
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,310
Maybe it's thanks to him.

375
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,190
Who is he?

376
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,850
Looking back, since that day,

377
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,540
he's always been someone
I couldn't get off my mind.

378
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,106
(Next Episode)
If it were the Ogami from that world...

379
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,959
(Ogami and Akihito's Missed Feelings)
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

380
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,646
(Akihito, between [if] and [reality])
Can't I be a substitute for him?

381
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,030
(Wavering Heart)
I'm such an idiot.

382
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,220
That was my last chance.

383
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,016
(What future will the two choose?!)
Is it... okay for me to...?

384
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,320
The one I love...

385
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,540
is the Ogami who's here.
