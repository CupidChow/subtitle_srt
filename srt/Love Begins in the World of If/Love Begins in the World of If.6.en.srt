"Love Begins in the World of If"
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,400
(One year ago)

3
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
About him...

4
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,520
To be honest, I didn't know him that well.

5
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,690
Kano.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,280
You look worried.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Huh?

8
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,770
Oh... thanks.

9
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,950
Okami?

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,360
Wrong.

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,950
It's pronounced Ogami.

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,890
You don't even know
your own colleague's name.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,740
Guess you really aren't
interested in other people.

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,990
I know this is sudden,
and you might not be happy about it,

15
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,090
but starting today, you're in sales.

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Let's work well together.

17
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,290
I wanted to help him.

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,100
That's what I thought at the time.

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,710
Kano.

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,450
About that project we had
a meeting for yesterday,

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,690
want to work on the materials together?

22
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,340
Oh, I'm already working
on them. Almost done.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Huh?

24
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,740
I can go to the next meeting by myself.

25
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,750
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I'll be fine.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,340
All right.

28
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,850
He just kept handling
everything on his own, quietly.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,010
He worked himself to the bone.

30
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,330
And because of that...

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,170
I didn't realize he'd already
reached his breaking point.

32
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,279
You can't just delay
the deadline like this.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
It's causing a lot of trouble for us.

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
I'm very sorry.

35
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,900
Why is Ogami apologizing?

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,380
It's my fault...

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,130
Kano, so completely cornered...

38
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,620
It was the first time I'd
ever seen him like that.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,500
As his colleague, I
had to look out for him.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
No.

41
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,660
It's my fault. I left the work to you.

42
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,350
I'll go with you to apologize.

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,500
His hand... it was ice-cold.

44
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,920
I never asked you to do that.

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,540
How could I let you go?

46
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,480
I hurt Kano's pride.

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,990
So, from then on,

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,380
I decided to just watch
over him from a distance.

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,180
That's what I decided.

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,960
And Kano-san doesn't seem
to have any sales targets.

51
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,600
That sales tech position...

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,820
seems pretty easy.

53
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,233
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,210
Huh?

55
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,520
You think he has it easy?

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,489
He was transferred on short notice,

57
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,890
but he handles all his work
by himself and does a great job.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,260
He works much harder than you think.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
But...

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,960
the number of people who
understand that about him...

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,770
is far too small.

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,900
I heard there was some
trouble with Ibushi-san.

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,090
It's my responsibility.

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,000
It has nothing to do with you, Ogami.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,520
He was so down, which is rare for him...

67
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,420
Even if it was just for comfort...

68
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,540
I just wanted to help him relax a little.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
(You'll be fine.)

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,660
Didn't you go straight home?

71
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,830
I could ask you the same thing.

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,770
What are you still doing here so late?

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,330
Did you change Tomioka's
materials without telling him again?

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,280
You're shouldering someone
else's burden all by yourself again.

75
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,390
Stop trying to carry
everything on your own.

76
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,110
You're going to burn
yourself out at this rate.

77
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,620
If you say you don't need it,

78
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,640
I'll just eat it myself.

79
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
This is for you.

80
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,590
It's chocolate.

81
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,830
Chocolate...

82
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,970
You like it, right?

83
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,790
You have a ton of it at your desk.

84
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,690
Well, I'm heading out.

85
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,710
You should head home soon, too.

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,530
Even if it was just a little,

87
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,340
I hoped that stubbornness
of his would change.

88
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,210
That's what I was hoping for.

89
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,070
Who was it...

90
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,970
who changed him?

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,556
Was it the advice from that
overprotective sales rep?

92
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,980
Maybe I have that person to thank.

93
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,200
Excuse me.

94
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,921
Are there any changes that need to be made?

95
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,810
- Let me see.
- Okay.

96
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,250
The person I truly love is...

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,280
this Ogami.

98
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,510
I've realized it now,

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,500
but what am I supposed to do?

100
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,260
Thank you.

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,420
What's wrong?

102
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,640
No, it's nothing.

103
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,070
I see.

104
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,850
There's no way I could confess to him.

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,740
Besides...

106
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,940
there's no way Ogami
would be interested in me.

107
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,020
Good work.

108
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,470
You too.

109
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Oh, Kano-san.

110
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:13,860
Did you hear?

111
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,320
Hear what?

112
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,221
Starting in April, besides you, Kano-san,

113
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,010
they're adding more
sales tech staff.

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,660
Huh? Seriously?

115
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,420
Yeah, the department head said so.

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,950
Apparently, Ogami-san pushed for it.

117
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,609
He said that having only you, Kano-san,
handle sales tech

118
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,000
was too much of a burden.

119
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,080
And that they should transfer
more people to the department.

120
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,990
I can't believe Ogami
would do something like that.

121
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,820
Is this what they call camaraderie?

122
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,960
No, that's not it.

123
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,350
Right.

124
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,250
I should do something to thank him.

125
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,630
Here are your items.

126
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,030
This is the first time I've
ever stood in a line like this.

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,290
Since he knows about a place like this,

128
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,230
maybe this Ogami...

129
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,810
has a sweet tooth, too?

130
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,600
If he's just like the other Ogami...

131
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,020
I want to be with you forever.

132
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,020
I guess this means I'm pursuing you.

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,380
No way.

134
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,099
Okay, Irisawa-san will be in
charge of the product explanation,

135
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,380
and Nagata-san, you'll manage
the schedule. Is that okay?

136
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,780
- No problem.
- Got it.

137
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,580
Then let's proceed with this plan.

138
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,659
All right, I'll be counting
on you all tomorrow.

139
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,940
- Right.
- Good work.

140
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Good work today.

141
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,986
Oh, right.

142
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,480
I just got some dorayaki.

143
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,030
These are from that super
delicious place in Asakusa.

144
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,460
Wow, Mitsuno-san, you
really know your stuff.

145
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,040
I'll have to look it up.

146
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,750
Huh? But Ogami-san doesn't
really eat sweets, does he?

147
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,590
He doesn't. These are a gift for a client.

148
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,690
Let's go to a cake shop next week.

149
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,310
I'm craving some Christmas cake.

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,100
Sounds good.

151
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:52,126
I'll just enjoy watching you eat with
that happy look on your face, Mitsuno-san.

152
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,349
You're making me blush.

153
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,559
Well then, I'll be sure to eat a lot!

154
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,680
Wait, then I should be
the one treating, right?

155
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Kano.

156
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh, good.

157
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
You're still here.

158
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,380
Yeah, just...

159
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,690
some personal business.

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,180
I see.

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,540
Are you free this weekend?

162
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,040
Why?

163
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,360
A lot has happened
with the Ibushi-san case,

164
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,660
so the two of us should have a debriefing.

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,540
A debriefing...

166
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,210
Don't look so scared.

167
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,760
It is the end of the year, after all.

168
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,481
Let's go out for a nice meal, the two of us.

169
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:43,272
I'm craving some Christmas cake.

170
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Sounds good.

171
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,540
I'll just enjoy watching you eat with
that happy look on your face, Mitsuno-san.

172
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,060
Don't waste your time on someone like me.

173
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,770
You should just focus on things
that make you happy, Ogami.

174
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,890
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
So cold.

176
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I...

177
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,550
I really am in love with him.

178
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,810
If it were the other Ogami,

179
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,560
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

180
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Huh?

181
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,570
Kano.

182
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,730
Ogami?

183
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Why are you...

184
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,210
I should be asking you that.

185
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,300
We were having drinks,
and you just disappeared.

186
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,980
So I came looking for you.

187
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,520
Having drinks...

188
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
You're...

189
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,090
the other Ogami?

190
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,020
Don't make me worry like that.

191
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,800
It's okay.

192
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,430
I'm here for you.

193
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,200
It's fine. You've got this.

194
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm so sorry.

195
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,690
Thank you, Ogami.

196
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
But...

197
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,260
the person you love isn't me.

198
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,950
Huh...?

199
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,730
And the person I love is...

200
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,860
I'm such an idiot.

201
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,260
This was my last chance...

202
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:33,640
Kano.

203
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,440
Ogami?

204
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Huh?

205
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,500
You're the Ogami from here?

206
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,030
You're so cold.

207
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,820
Are you crying?

208
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,450
No.

209
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Hey, wait.

210
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,410
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,023
You seemed off, so I followed you.

212
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
And then...

213
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,410
I heard you talking to some guy.

214
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,320
Were you two fighting?

215
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,030
No.

216
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,366
It wasn't like that.

217
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,660
It's just...

218
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,740
Who made you cry?

219
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,290
Is it someone I know?

220
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,740
Don't tell me...

221
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,490
It was that overprotective
sales rep, wasn't it?

222
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,180
Um, well...

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
I guess you could say that...?

224
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,970
Forget about a guy like that.

225
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,680
You might feel grateful to him.

226
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,360
But compared to someone
who makes you cry...

227
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,720
I can cherish you so much more.

228
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,210
Can't I...

229
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,850
take his place?

230
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
W-Wait a minute.

231
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,790
Are you... really the
Ogami from this world?

232
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,540
What do you mean, "from this world"?

233
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Oh, no...

234
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,370
I meant...

235
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,395
I thought you and
Mitsuno-san were hitting it off.

236
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,700
If that's the case, then this is...

237
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:55,933
Mitsuno-san?

238
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Yeah.

239
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,580
I just asked her for a big favor at work.

240
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,510
So I offered to treat her
to a meal to thank her.

241
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,210
Oh, I see...

242
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,000
So if there's nothing going on between me and
Mitsuno-san... does that mean you'll accept me?

243
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
Huh?

244
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,220
It's not a matter of
accepting you or not...

245
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,510
It's just... why so suddenly?

246
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,670
I've always been worried about you.

247
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,476
Always shouldering everything by yourself,

248
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,980
always pushing yourself to the limit.

249
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,740
But I knew how hard you were trying.

250
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,346
So I figured if you insisted
on doing things that way,

251
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,570
I would just quietly watch
over you from the sidelines.

252
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,140
But then you suddenly changed,
like you were a different person.

253
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,100
You used to be so stubborn,

254
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,250
but you became so much more flexible.

255
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,400
I was genuinely happy for you.

256
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,880
But...

257
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,260
I didn't want the person who
changed you... to be someone else.

258
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,010
I don't even understand
these feelings myself.

259
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
That's why...

260
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,510
I think I must have
fallen in love with you.

261
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
All this time,

262
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,200
I've wanted you to acknowledge me.

263
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,560
I worked so hard because
I wanted to be your equal.

264
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,310
It's because when it comes to you, Ogami,

265
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,070
I'm in love.

266
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,950
The one I love...

267
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,606
is the you who's standing right here.

268
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,710
Are you sure you want to choose me?

269
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,870
You're the only one I want.

270
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,010
More than that overprotective guy?

271
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,280
Well...

272
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,530
he might have been a little too doting.

273
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,560
You don't like being doted on?

274
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,780
That's not it... if it's you, Ogami,

275
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,580
I might be interested.

276
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,610
But...

277
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,550
Okay.

278
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Okay?

279
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
W-Wait...

280
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Hm?

281
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,580
Why all of a sudden...?

282
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,240
Why?

283
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,320
Didn't you say you
wanted me to dote on you?

284
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,590
Your hands are cold.

285
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,083
Are you nervous?

286
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
Of course I am.

287
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,110
Should I stop?

288
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm nervous,

289
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,890
but if it's with you, it's okay.

290
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,270
W-Wait, I'm not ready for this...

291
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,110
I can't wait any longer.

292
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,860
Wait... no... not there...

293
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,800
You're so cute when you keep saying no.

294
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,170
I could just eat you up.

295
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Ogami.

296
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Hm?

297
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,970
You really are a big, bad wolf.

298
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,690
I'll take that as a compliment.

299
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,110
As you wish. I'll dote on you all you want.

300
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,630
Thank you, Ogami.

301
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,760
Thank you for always watching over me.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,340
But from now on, you
have to tell me everything.

303
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,790
The good things,

304
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,700
and the things that make you anxious.

305
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,449
Anything and everything about you...

306
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,740
I want to know it all.

307
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,190
Okay.

308
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
And...

309
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,280
thanks for this, too.

310
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,100
But I thought you didn't like sweets.

311
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
I don't.

312
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,790
But...

313
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,830
it's delicious when I eat it like this.

314
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,720
You're not cold anymore.

315
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,370
"Reflects your ideal self"?

316
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,239
It doesn't just reflect you.

317
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,980
It can take you to another world.

318
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,000
Another world?

319
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,270
Yeah. An ideal world
where your ideal self exists.

320
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,250
What's that supposed to mean?
