Ha Jun

Missing: The Other Side

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,020
I'll try to buy some time, so you only have a moment.

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,500
It's so unfair.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,400
That guy took twenty-seven years away from me, but I only get a moment.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,540
It's a moment you've been waiting 27 years for.

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,690
You are working hard.

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,770
- I'm lieutenant Sin Jun Ho.
Calling: Wook

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,410
- Have you eaten?
- No, not yet.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,770
What, they aren't even feeding you? Go ahead and have dinner.

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,740
Calling: Wook - Recording

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,670
Go get it.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,150
Do you know Kim Su Yeon?

19
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,470
Of course, I know her.

20
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,500
You killed her.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,430
I saw it all.

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,500
You were wearing a grey suit, weren't you?

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,740
What were you doing there then?

24
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,270
My mom used to be a housemaid at that house.

25
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,310
So I used to play there every day.

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,520
Even on the day you killed Aunt Su Yeon.

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,350
That's why you grew up ignorant.

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,550
Since you grew up without a mom.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,640
What did you just say?

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,790
How did you know I grew up without a mom?

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,350
Because I killed her.

32
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,120
Su Yeon, your mom, the three people from the orphanage, and even Han Sang Gil.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
I killed them all.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,880
If you had stayed quiet that day, the maid wouldn't have needed to die ...

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm saying your mom died ... because of you.

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,680
I should just tear up that scum's trap!

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,380
Why did you kill her? Why?!

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
Get out. Get out!

39
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,170
Wook, don't do this.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,430
- Don't do it.
- Hurry and drag him out.

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,930
Hurry up, get out of here.

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,260
What did you do to Choi Yeo Na?

43
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,120
What did you do to Choi Yeo Na, you scumbag!

44
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,370
Tell me. Say it!

45
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,990
- You can't do this.
- Let go.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,560
Were you here the whole night?

47
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,350
Yesterday...

48
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm sorry for losing my temper.

49
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,330
I did that more often than you during all these times. It's alright.

50
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:14,530
For resenting and hating you all those times...

51
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,790
I would have done the same.

53
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,570
If my mom disappeared without a word when I was seven years old, I would have been scared.

54
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,400
If, when I was so scared,

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,560
my mom wouldn't come no matter how long I waited, I would have hated her too.

56
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,580
But still, because of me...

57
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,850
Wook. Do you remember Tan (TN: "Coal")?

58
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,950
You know, the black dog who lived on our alley?

59
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,620
You said he was black like a coal briquette, so you gave him that name.

60
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,870
You said he was pitiful because he didn't have a home,

61
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,590
so you would save your snacks given from kindergarten to give it to him.

62
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,960
At that time, I knew.

63
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,420
That you would be someone who brightens the world around you, just like your name.

64
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,210
That you would never ignore the ones who are struggling.

65
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,400
That you are someone the world absolutely needs,

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,540
so it's a relief I came here instead of you.

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,980
It's my fault that I brought you here.

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,930
I left alone a seven-year-old boy,

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,760
and ultimately didn't keep my promise to return.

70
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,420
I'm sorry for not keeping my promise.

72
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,620
Missing: The Other Side

73
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,330
Kang Myeong Jin, currently incarcerated on charges of murdering Ms. Kim last June,

74
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,110
has been revealed to have committed additional offenses.

75
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,190
- Seonbae, take a look at this.
- While the police were inspecting Mr. Kang's belongings,

76
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,190
they found numerous articles believed to belong to other victims.

77
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,420
The results of the analysis by the National Forensics Services...
[While serving for murder, additional offenses discovered]

78
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,460
Bring me that guy right now.

79
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,060
The prison is worried about security, so I think we need to interrogate him there.

80
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,820
Really?

81
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,780
Let's go. Every hour counts.

82
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,790
- We'll be back!
- See you later.

83
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,420
Next applicant.

84
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,270
You're here again? He'll reject your visit request anyway.

85
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,860
Process it anyway, please.

86
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,600
Yes.

87
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,530
Number 4821. You have a visitor.

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,370
Where is my Hyeon Ji?

89
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,660
So it was you.

90
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,420
Yes, I'm Hyeon Ji's dad!

91
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,260
So bring me back my daughter.

92
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,190
There's a rabbit, look!

93
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,180
- Hi, hi!
- Hi!

94
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,210
Dad, I want ice-cream.

95
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,110
Stay here and wait for me.

96
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,130
If you see her, please let us know.

97
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,810
You are working hard.

98
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
My Hyeon Ji...

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,310
[Searching for the missing Jang Hyeon Ji]

100
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,800
We've seen each other before, haven't we?

101
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Yes! I followed you

102
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
and found Mi Ok in that freezer. So don't try to say otherwise,

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,610
and just tell me where our Hyeon Ji is. Okay?

104
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,750
Please!

105
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,490
You haven't changed one bit.

106
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,140
Do Not Enter - Entry to this place is forbidden due to safety risks

Kang Myeong Jin

108
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,150
Why are you acting mute? Tell me what you did with our Hyeon Ji, you jerk!

109
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,440
Number 4821, your visit time is over.

110
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,590
No, it's not over, wait! I haven't heard his answer yet!

111
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,090
Where is our Hyeon Ji? Just, please, just tell me that!

112
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,010
Not changed one bit.

113
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,430
Tell me! How can you just leave!

114
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,650
Hey you bastard, what did you do to my Hyeon Ji?

115
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,130
Give me back my daughter!

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,730
Why did you want to meet me at a place like here?

117
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,090
I found out where Yeo Na is.

118
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,620
Where is she?

119
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,230
I don't know the exact location yet.

120
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,850
I was going to find out it first, then tell you.

121
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,950
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier. The timing was never right.

122
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,750
Make sure to fine her.

123
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,580
I'll let the Yeo Na who is at the village know.

124
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,890
Oy, Mr. Kim. Why do you come without a warning?

125
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,300
They say there's a typhoon coming, so we can't set sail for a while.

126
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,310
Who is he?

127
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,080
Someone who knows where Yeo Na is.

128
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,780
Manager Wang's henchmen kidnapped Yeo Na and put her on his boat.

129
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,210
He was the one steering it.

130
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,610
What nonsense are you saying?

131
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,740
- Is that true?
- No!

132
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,950
Mr. Kim! You said you wanted to rent a boat for some leisure time, but what is happening here?

133
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm asking if that's true.

134
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,580
This guy's a detective,

135
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,120
and the person you threw in the sea that day, was his fiancee.

136
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
This is all I know.

137
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Where did you throw her?

138
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,220
Where did you throw her?

139
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,190
I'm asking you where you threw her!

140
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,460
Did you hire and order Manager Wang to murder

141
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,000
Jang Myeon Gyu, Kim Nam Gook, and Choi Yeo Na?

142
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,730
It's true that you ordered it.

143
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,270
This is a picture from a surveillance camera near Seongmi Park.

144
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,240
You and Manager Wang.

145
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,990
And this is the hair left from the DNA analysis.

146
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,560
And this is the result of the DNA analysis.
Report on DNA Analysis Results

147
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,780
We know you're trying hard to not look like a serial murderer, but the police aren't idiots.

150

Why exactly did you kill all these people?

153
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,710
Lee Dong Min, that jerk.

154
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,730
Now that I think about it,

155
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,620
He came home with the Chairwoman a few times.

156
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,470
Why did he do something like this?

157
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,830
Both to me and this person...

158
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,230
Why did he have to go this far?

159
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,980
That detective was going around prying into my business.

160
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,620
The house keeper saw Su Yeon getting killed.

161
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,420
That's what I thought.

162
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,640
Do you know what's the best thing you did? Staying alive.

163
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,310
It's good enough even with that.

164
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,520
For coming to us like this,

165
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,900
thank you.

166
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,730
That's right.

167
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,790
I agree too.

168
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,830
- Me too. 
 - But still ...

169
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,840
It's all because of that jerk.

170
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,690
Even tearing him into pieces wouldn't make us feel better.

171
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,500
Even prison is too sweet a punishment for him.

172
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,400
He should be executed on the spot.

173
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
It feels so futile.

174
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,970
I can't believe that happened to us

175
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,240
because of some stranger's greed.

176
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,960
Why did you kill Choi Yeo Na, Jang Myeong Gyu and Kim Nam Gook?

177
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,490
It was enough to just do the DNA analysis, so why on earth did you kill them?

178
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,300
Those three lived a bonus life all that time

179
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,350
since they managed to survive that fire.

180
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,730
You set the orphanage on fire.

181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,450
That was also you're doing?

182
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,200
To be more clear, I ordered it and paid money.

183
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,150
Don't get dragged into his game. He's not worth it.

184
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,590
This guy's a total psychopath.

185
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,580
Sharing with them because they're your bloodline, or because they've had tough lives...

186
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,930
A company is not like a pizza you would share among everyone.

187
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,290
Thirty years. I put no less than thirty years of hard work into it.

188
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,320
It's the moment my long-time plan is finally coming to fruition,

189
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
so there can't be a hitch now.

190
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
That's why I got the obstacles out of the way.

191
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,800
Did I do something wrong?

192
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,120
Are people obstacles to you?

193
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,610
I'm saying that all they were just obstacles to me.

194
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,610
Why? Do I seem crazy?

195
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,170
No.

196
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,810
I'm just someone whose basic desire is a bit stronger than other's.

197
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,630
There are three of Lee Dong Min's victims in this village alone.

198
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,390
So after he killed so many people,

199
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,080
did he find the heir?

200
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,640
No. Not yet.

201
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,520
Does the heir even exist?

202
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,650
Is this woman ... your fiancee?

203
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,560
- Go out, go out.
- Let go!

204
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,600
- Go out.
- Let me go!

205
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,230
Get out!

206
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,430
Stay outside!

207
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,880
Detective Sin caught the the culprit and is interrogating him.

208
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
But Ms. Yeon Na...

209
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
He must not have found me yet.

210
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,280
Seeing that I'm still here.

211
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,020
Detective Sin will definitely find you.

212
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,900
You seeing us must be because your mom is here, right?

213
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,170
I don't know.

214
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,460
Mr. Jang sees the villagers even though Hyeon Ji isn't here.

215
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,550
On the day of our wedding, Oppa came to the hill.

216
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,340
I was sitting next to him, but he didn't see me even till the end.

217
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,300
I favor to ask of you, ...

218
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,380
Can I see Oppa one last time?

219
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,480
Did you meet him?

220
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,250
What did he say? Where is Hyeon Ji?

221
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,070
Still, maybe he felt some guilt after meeting you.

222
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,300
Because of that, his attitude did change a little bit.

223
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,810
For now, there are five victims confirmed. We need to continue probing into it.

224
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,680
Earlier that guy said to me that I haven't changed a bit.

225
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,910
- What does that mean?
- I thought about that a long time too.

226
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,700
After that guy took Hyeon Ji from the amusement park,

227
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,690
I think he saw me because I went there looking for her everyday

228
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,270
He said that to you?

229
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,540
I'm going to be back again tomorrow and ask.

230
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,250
He wouldn't budge all this time, but now he accepted my visit and started to talk.

231
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,080
Won't he say where Hyeon Ji is?

232
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,810
Yes.

233
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,220
Let's have a cocktail.

234
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,510
Cocktail?

235
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,140
I only know one or two simple ones, so...

236
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,270
Sit down for a minute. I'll make a delicious cocktail.

237
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,350
The color looks mysterious. What is this alcohol called?

238
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,680
You're owner of Cafe Hawaii in title, but you don't know the color Blue Hawaii?

239
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,740
- Blue Hawaii?
- Yeah

240
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,350
This cocktail was made in Hawaii.

241
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,640
Ah, I see.

242
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
Here.

243
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,590
How is it?

244
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,950
How shall I say, it tastes of Hawaii.

245
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,110
You're the owner of Cafe Hawaii, but you don't know what Blue Hawaii is.

246
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,370
You have blonde hair but speak like in a historical drama.

247
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,780
You've been here for 100 years. Who are you?

248
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,110
What will you do if I tell?

249
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,310
Is our relationship like that? You upset me.

250
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,120
And do you think you'll be living here for a thousand or ten thousand years?

251
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,480
If you really want to know, then all right.

252
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,670
Here.

253
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,330
What's with this solemn pose?

254
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,980
My real name is Cha Geon Muk. I'm from the 34th generation of the Guryeong Cha clan's Hwngyeolgong branch.

255
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,200
My family was affluent so in my youth I dreamt of studying abroad, but then gave up.

256
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,680
Why? If you went to study abroad at that time, you'd have been highly regarded as an intellectual.

257
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,490
I didn't have a country, so what would I have used my learnings gained abroad for?

258
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,890
Then...

259
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,840
Did you participate in the independence movement?

260
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,220
Do you appear in textbooks?

261
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,670
I would probably be recorded as my family's scoundrel.

262
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,840
Enemies were everywhere, so I even hid it from my family.

263
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,990
I pretended to be addicted to alcohol and gambling, and took our fortune to supply military funds.

264
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,010
Later, I even sold off my family's land.

265
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,570
Anyway, with the money I collected that way, I went back and forth the Amnok River around five times.

266
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,480
And I supported the establishment of the provisional government, albeit in a humble way.

267
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,370
It was the best thing I'd done in my life.

268
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,370
So how did you come here?

269
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,980
After the establishment of the provisional government, the oppression by the Japanese Empire worsened.

270
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,350
And the following year, I met Japanese soldiers while crossing the Amnok River.

271
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,070
When I regained consciousness, I was there.

272
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,180
At first, I thought I was caught by the Japanese.

273
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,730
And then I realized,

274
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,950
"Ah, this place is not for the living."

275
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,180
Like that, I opened up a cafe here and mastered the ways of living as a deceased person.

276
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,430
Why the Amnok River, of all places? How can I go there?
(T/N: Amnok River is on the North Korea - China border)

277
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:02,250
Isn't it ironic? The people who wanted to protect the country, were divided in half.

278
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,870
If I meet my comrades, I have a lot to tell them.

279
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,900
Were there other independence fighters with you when you were attacked by the Japanese soldiers?

280
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,410
My comrades were shot too.

281
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,090
Then those people didn't come here? If their bodies were not found,—

282
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,220
Only I came here.

283
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,670
However, do you think this is the only place where missing deceased live?

284
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,090
You mean there's another place like this?

285
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,550
I don't know that either.

286
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,070
I just had that thought.

287
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,340
There isn't a question I haven't asked myself in my hundred years here.

288
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,300
And here I thought you were just an immature youngster in your twenties.

289
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,090
So why would you change your hair to blonde and create a misunderstanding?

290
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,580
This? Was it done about seven or eight years ago?

291
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,130
A hairdresser from Apgujeong came and dyed it for me.

292
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,720
It looked quite nice, so I'm keeping it.

293
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,660
What do you think? Doesn't it look like I'm about to go surfing in Hawaii?

294
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,570
- What about Hawaii then? This has nothing to do with Hawaii?
- Yeah.

295
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,670
Wow, you really, seriously!

296
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,060
Please return my belongings.

297
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,060
You crazy bastard. How are they yours? They belong to the victims.

298
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,180
They're mine.

299
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,350
Those are my treasures.

300
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,030
Return them. Please.

301
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,390
I can't live without them.

302
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,440
I'd rather rot in prison, so please... My treasures...

303
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Please return my treasures to me...

304
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,350
Please!

305
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,450
It's been stolen.

306
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,280
It's over.

307
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,520
Nothing's left.

308
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,620
What? Who died?

309
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,560
Excuse me, you can't visit Kang Myeong Jin.

310
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,960
- What's the reason?
- He died. Early this morning.

311
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,370
No. Then...

312
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,920
Then... Our Hyeon Ji...

313
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,400
Sir!

314
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,990
Sir, are you okay? Are you okay?

315
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,690
Please get up! Someone call an ambulance.

316
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,790
The coast guard said they would contact us when they're able to go in and search!

317
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,550
The typhoon is over now, so when? If they can't go, I'm going to take a boat out myself.

318
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,450
Are you going to enter the water? Get your head on straight, Sin Jun Ho!

319
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,260
What is it?

320
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,880
Yeo Na wants me to bring you.

321
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,020
Did Yeo Na really call me?

322
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,080
She did. How many times do I have to tell you?

323
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,680
Where is she? Where is Yeo Na?

324
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,460
There.

325
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,930
I've brought him.

326
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,760
Thank you, Wook.

327
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,160
What are you doing now?

328
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,390
Is Yeo Na really here?

329
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,660
She's here.

330
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,010
She's wearing a white dress and has her hair half-tied in the back.

331
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,110
I bought her that dress.

332
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,430
You bought it when you proposed.

333
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,220
Did you buy it when you proposed?

334
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:42,320
Your face looks worse than when you came on our wedding day.

335
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,580
She's saying, your face looks worse than when you came on your wedding day.

336
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,100
She was here then too?

337
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,980
That day, she was sitting next to you.

338
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,900
Please tell him that I've been doing well since that day.

339
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,960
She been doing well after seeing you that day.

340
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,630
♫ When the cold wind brushed me ♫

341
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,580
If Yeo Na is really here,
♫ Like the day ♫

342
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,730
and is doing well like you said,
♫ we walked together ♫

343
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,180
What should I do if I can keep talking to Yeo Na like this?
♫  I still ♫

344
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,700
If I don't look for her, will she continuously remain here?
♫ remember it clearly ♫

345
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,830
No.

346

♫ Only the warmth of the time ♫

347
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,550
You should do what you have to.
♫ when it was warm ♫

348
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,670
That is what Yeo Na wants.
♫ can't return again ♫

349
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,960
Then what about me?

350
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,690
What I want is to be together with Yeo Na.
♫ As it was then. In the memory of ♫

351
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,380
I hate opening my eyes every morning,

352
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,870
and can't even bring myself to imagine a future. What am I supposed to do?

353
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,380
Yeo Na, are you listening?
♫ I will be there, be there ♫

354
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,950
Why does he see you but I can't?

356
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,850
Oppa.
♫ Be there, be there ♫

357
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,190
Please help me. How can I be with Yeo Na?
♫ I don't need to ♫

358
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,700
Oppa, you should keep your promise.

359
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,290
You promised that you would definitely find me.

360
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,230
You should keep your promise. Definitely.

361
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,800
She wants you to look for her.

362
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:47,100
♫ Like that day through one memory brilliant as sunshine ♫

363
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,980
♫ Our times  ♫

364
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,290
In my life,

365
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,560
I never had anyone on my side.

366
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,690
Oppa, you were the only one on my side.
♫ No matter how many seasons have passed ♫

367
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,790
Even when I threw a fuss,

368
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,020
even when your mother didn't like me and was against me.

369
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,190
You never wavered.

370
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,610
That's why I was really happy.
♫  be there ♫

371
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,230
I also wish...

372
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,760
you wouldn't forget me soon.

373
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,890
So please find me

374
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,780
and be very sad,

375
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,470
and then,

376
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,180
And then, forget everything.

377
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:44,190
♫ I will be there, be there ♫

378
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,320

382
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,530
Ajussi.

383
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
What happened?

384
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,980
Let's go out and talk.

385
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,960
Kang Myeong Jin committed suicide?

386
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,920
He didn't say where Hyeon Ji is till the end.

387
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,080
What do we do about Ahjusshi?

388
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,900
Where did Kang Myeong Jin use to live before enlisting?

389
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,100
Jihyeon-dong, Janghyeon-gu.

390
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,270
Look into his parents, grandparents, cousins, even distant ones.

391
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,080
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,590
We confirmed the location through the V-Pass system, but we'll only be sure once we go in.

393
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,520
It could've traveled a bit with the waves.

394
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,270
- Let's go
- I will come along too.

395
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:25,120
I know the bag that Captain Kang mentioned. I won't interfere you and will be careful.

396
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,570
Stay here. That will be helpful.

397
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,150
- I'll request this of you.
- I understand.

398
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,650
Ready? Let's go.

399
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,390
Thank you, I'm relying on you.

400
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,820
Yeo Na, I'm always grateful and I love you. I'll do better.

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,290
I don't think this coffee tastes of this world.

410
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:15,070
Of course it isn't. It's not something you can taste before dying.

♫ Just remembering that ♫

412

Goodbye, Yeo Na.

438
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,880
Jjong Ah, haven't found it yet?

439
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,180
Yeah, I'm done. The business is thriving, so it's really busy.

440
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,890
Kang Dae Seong, this punk, I can't see him since he started recording his album.

441
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,020
Oh, right. Ahjussi, the car you mentioned last time? 352-0829.

442
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,300
Did you find it?

443
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,620
Yes. It's a car that was sold as a new in 2015 and the owner hasn't changed.

444
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,720
Here. Their name, address, and phone number.

445
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,290
Damn hit and run murderer. How can we catch him?

446
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,850
I'm going to report a hit and run.

447
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,030
Done! Let's go.

448
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,290
Yeo Na probably left in peace because you kept your promise.

449
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:24,120
Thomas... Oh, you don't know Thomas.

450
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,810
The person who was with Yeo Na told me that they parted ways while she was smiling.

451
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,820
Thank you. I was able to find her thanks to you.

452
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,060
I didn't do much. It was all you.

453
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,360
You're here?

454
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,690
I'm... sorry.

455
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,570
I treated Yeo Na poorly.

456
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,820
Our poor Yeo Na.

457
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,220
What do we do?

458
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,340
I didn't get a second of sleep yesterday, look.

459
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,540
Just a minute.

460
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,750
Mr. Jang, what brings you here?

461
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,830
You probably don't know Choi Yeo Na... But do you know Detective Sin?

462
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,010
I...

463
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,310
I asked him to come, since Mr. Jang hasn't been eating well these days.

464
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,180
I said, let's go eat some spicy beef stew! And brought him here.

465
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,650
You came to a funeral... to eat spicy beef stew?

466
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,720
Sure, sure! Good thing you came. Get some fresh air while you're here.

467
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,600
I looked more into Kang Myeong Jin,

468
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,390
and apparently his maternal family owns mountain land near Duon village.

469
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,160
We'll start investigating in that area.

470
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,550
Then was Hyeon Ji...

471
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,750
I'm sorry.

472
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:43,060
My greed has cost many innocent lives.

473
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,130
It's not your fault, Chairwoman. It was all Lee Dong Min's work.

474
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,900
It's so pretty. Mom, does it suit me?

475
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,710
"S" (for Su Yeon)

476
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,020
What is this? Who is it?

477
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,520
I think he's a hit and run victim.

478
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,850
As you know, I've been attending every missing family group meeting.

479
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:47,020
I'm not sure if you've heard of a Beom Su?

480
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,830
He's a boy with a developmental disorder who disappeared 3 years ago.

481
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:56,280
Anyway, I heard a few things from his parents after a meeting.

482
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,490
I looked into it,

483
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,950
but I think it might have been a hit and run.

484
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,260
You should go and meet his parents.

485
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,790
- It is a bit suspicious.
- What is?

486
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,000
You.

487
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Last month, a body was found on the Muchang Expressway's reconstruction site.

488
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,620
It was the person you mentioned 10 years ago.

489
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,590
You said you thought the wife killed him for something to do with land compensation.

490
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,870
Did I? I don't... remember that.

491
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:37,670
Park Byeong Hoon. His wife was caught this time.

492
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:42,090
She planned it together with her affair partner, killed her husband, and buried him in the ground.

493
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,290
As the expressway was being developed, it was found coincidentally.

494
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,850
And... The USB you left us last time. We caught the culprit that killed Jang Mi last time.

495
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,660
Some man... asked me... to deliver that to you.

496
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,650
Sure, sure. Some man.

497
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,230
I've looked through all the CCTV's near the station,

498
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,690
but haven't been able to find that 'man'.

499
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,740
You can't just trust CCTVs. There are so many blind spots.

500
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,460
Okay. Let me try meeting the parents.

501
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,900
This punk... I think I can already smell the hit and run.

502
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,100
Huh? Hit and run.

503
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,630
Anyway, my heart was racing so much.

504
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,740
If you think about it,

505
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,990
Detective Baek is quite keen like a fox, a core fox.

506
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,690
Of course that'd be the case.

507
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,660
How long has he been a detective, after all?

508
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,990
He's had a quite good hunch ever since he was a police officer.

509
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:55,730
Ahjusshi, you made me a crazy man and pretended not to know anything.

510
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,260
You're really a fox if you really think about it.

511
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,020
If you compare your nosiness to mine, mine is just a joke.

512
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,860
Thanks to the two of you, Yeo Na left, and Beom Su will be at ease soon.

513
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,500
Jun Su's mother and you, Detective Park, will see good ends too, since the culprit was caught.

514
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,820
It's an another issue the statute of limitations passed.

515
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,910
Is it possible to find a body that was abandoned 27 years ago?

516
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,230
My wife and I aren't expecting much.

517
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,070
We can live here happily with you, Thomas. Three of us.

518
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:27,530
I'll be going.

519
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,600
Live happily, the three of you?

520
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,040
Do you think Wook wants to keep his mom here forever?

521
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,940
Why do you have no sense?

522
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,430
Why did you say that?

523
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,340
Are you sure you're a police officer?

524
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,430
Be careful.

525
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,300
- You're here.
- HI.

526
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,160
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I ate.

527
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,340
Thanks to Mr. Jang, I had organic, country-side meal.

528
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,430
That's nice. You used to be such a picky eater when you were younger.

529
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,360
Never ate carrots or peas. Liked meat but not vegetables.

530
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,400
I mean, Mr. Jang only gives me vegetables.

531
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,910
Oh, right. What happened to Hyeon Ji?

532
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,880
Are the police still looking for her?

533
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,920
Apparently the gravesite of the culprit's maternal family is near here.

534
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,270
I think we'll find her soon.

535
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,940
I hope so.

536
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,440
A few days ago, Yeo Na said

537
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,110
that I see the dead because my mom is here.

538
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,570
Hyeon Ji isn't here.

539
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,590
I think... Hyeon Ji

540
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,610
is in this vicinity.

541
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,240
Hyung!

542
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,640
Why the good mood? Did something good happen?

543
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,610
Beom Su is going to see Mom, Dad, and Grandma.

544
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,110
What do you mean?

545
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:06,280
What that means is... so ...

546
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,400
Goodbye, our Beom Su.

547
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,800
Goodbye.

548
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,620
Bye!

549
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,150
That's good.

550
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
I'm glad he was able to leave.

551
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,150
You... will also leave, one day.

552
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,270
I want to live with you for a long time.

553
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,240
No...

554
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,100
I don't want you tied down here.

555
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,090
I just... want you to live a normal life, like others.

556
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,850
Now that Beom Su's gone, Jun Su must be lonely.

557
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:14,950
I'll be sure to find Jun Su's body.

558
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,740
I'm good at things like that.

559
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,590
You saw me find Ha Neul last time.

560
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,690
This is all because of this useless sense of justice of mine.

561
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,210
You must take after me.

562
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:34,860
I couldn't stand injustice. Have Mr. Jang and Thomas never mentioned that?

563
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,380
I think Thomas has told me before.

564
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,850
That you have the temperament of fire, and you use you fists before your brain.

565
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,640
What?

566
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,890
I wondered why I had such a short temper.

567
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,880
Come over to eat dinner with Mr. Jang later.

568
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,580
Detective Park does all the cooking.

569
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,440
Who cares who does it? You just need to enjoy the meal.

570
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,450
Have a seat.

571
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,490
Thanks for coming to the funeral.

572
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,080
Lee Dong Min has been transferred to the prosecution.

573
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,720
Since we have undeniable evidence for his crimes, he'll probably be in jail for life.

574
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,850
He killed all those people,

575
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,260
but will be alive in jail.

576
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,070
Lee Dong Min is a sociopath.

577
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:42,110
Being placed in confinement, where he can't control anything,

578
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,400
could be a greater punishment than death for him.

579
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,250
He should pay for his crimes.

580
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:55,510
In addition to that, I asked to meet because I had something I wanted to ask you.

581
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:00,740
The necklace your fiancee was wearing...

582
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,360
I gave it to her when I proposed.

583
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,220
It's something my mother gave me when I was younger.

584
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,650
She told me to give it to someone I loved.

585
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:21,850
Could I see that necklace?

586
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,910
S...

587
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,400
How did you know?

588
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:43,250
It's a custom-made birthstone necklace I gifted to Su Yeon on her 20th birthday.

589
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,960
I'm... your grandson?

590
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,420
I have a mother at home...

591
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,350
There's no need to rush. Take your time ...

592
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,350
I'm sorry.

593
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,440
I-I'm sorry.

594
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,510
Su Yeon!

595
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,320
Your birth mother gave it to me.

596
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:13,470
I went to the Catholic church because the orphanage got contacted someone was going to entrust a baby to us.

597
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,630
I held the baby,

598
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,120
but the baby held on to my finger and wouldn't let go.

599
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:26,290
At not even 100 days old, his eyes sparkled.

600
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:32,340
Your father said you were our child as soon as he saw you.

601
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:40,880
The next day, I told the director and brought you home after stopping by the family registry office.

602
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,910
You never told me I was adopted.

603
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,760
On the family register... you reported my birth.

604
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,480
I didn't want you to get hurt or bullied as you were growing up.

605
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,660
I was planning on telling you eventually...

606
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:06,020
But after the fire at the orphanage and your father's bed-ridden death...

607
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,220
I didn't have a room to bring myself to do it.

608
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:14,430
Still, when Yeo Na disappeared.

609
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,000
You should have told me at least then.

610
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,190
All the kids from that orphanage died. How could I tell you?

611
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,410
If they were really doing those things to look for you,

612
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,150
you're in the most danger. How could I tell you?

613
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:29,150
When I heard the door opening at night, I wondered if it was you.

614
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,590
When you were not here next morning, I wondered if something had happened.

615
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,700
I lived like that, in constant worry.

616
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:42,200
Before I saw that diary in your room,

617
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,430
I didn't know your birth mother was Chairwoman Han's daughter.

618
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,410
After all,

619
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,780
Yeo Na died

620
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,800
because of me.

621
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:04,410
Jang Myeong Gyu, Kim Nam Gook,

622
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,080
and all the kids from the fire.

623
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,110
They all died because of me.

624
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,510
Because of me

625
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,970
all those people died.

626
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,900
Jun Ho!

627
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Jun Ho, you didn't do anything wrong.

628
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,750
Why is that your fault? You were all children.

629
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,150
It was the adults who were wrong.

630
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,170
Out of fear that my child would be hurt,

631
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:11,120
I stayed quiet when others got hurt. It's my fault.

632
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,160
Yeo Na...

633
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,170
because of me...

634
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,040
in that cold ocean...

635
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,960
She suffocated to death.

636
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,910
How can I breathe?

637
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,330
I'm sorry.

638
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,120
You didn't do anything wrong.

639
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,720
It's all my fault.

640
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,450
Search carefully under there.

641
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,280
Yes, sir.

642
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,200
Ahjusshi!

643
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,790
What's up with it now? How come you don't stay still, even for a second?

644
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,820
There's somewhere we need to go together, right now.

645
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,540
The police are here to search this area right now!

646
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,970
What?

647
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:32,550
Come on, hurry!

648
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,540
What are they looking for?

649
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,370
It's over here!

650
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,250
- Where?
- Let's go.

651
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,880
- Where is it?
- Over here!

652
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,720
Detective Baek!

653
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,280
Policeman Son, wait. Let me just...

654
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,540
You can't enter.

655
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,920
Just a moment. Let me just go there for a minute.

656
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,770
It's not just one person. When are the forensic team getting here?

657
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,810
Detective Baek!

658
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,780
It's me!

659
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,750
- Keep digging.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,070
Come on, see? I told you I knew one of them well.

661
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,750
When can we know their identities?

662
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:42,480
We'll send the finding to forensics, but it seems like at least 3-4 people.

663
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,770
I'll call you as soon as the results come out.

664
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,390
Sure.

665
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,070
We found... our Hyeon Ji.

666
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,440
What are you talking about?

667
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,830
I can't see the village. I can't see anything.

668
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,900
You found Hyeon Ji? Where?

669
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,210
In the forest.

670
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,580
I hoped that she was living well, somewhere.

671
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,600
Where's Mr. Jang? Why didn't he come?

672
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:22,140
He can't... see this place anymore.

673
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,370
Why not?

674
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,550
If I had known that,

675
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,890
I should've said goodbye to him beforehand.

676
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:39,450
He must not be able to see us anymore

677
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,020
because Hyeon Ji was found...

678
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,550
It's good that happened.

679
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,030
He lived like the dead for the past 10 years.

680
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:57,080
Now that he's found Hyeon Ji, Mr. Jang should live his life.

681
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,950
Searching for Hyeon Ji

682
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,260
I feel so bad for Ahjusshi.

683
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,940
Does that mean you won't be able to see the village after you find your mother?

684
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,630
I guess so.

685
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,020
We better hurry then.

686
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,240
We need to find all those people.

687
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,480
Yes, we should.

688
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,590
You're right.

689
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:00,130
I promised her I'd find Jun Su, too.

690
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,590
We have to find them.

691
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,800
Honey,

692
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,390
I promised to come with Hyeon Ji,

693
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,720
but sorry I brought her like this.

694
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,350
The late Oh Yun Kyeong
The late Jang Hyeon Ji

695
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:26,870
Still, the three of us are together now.

696
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:34,560
Hyeon Ji, you're not scared now that you're next to Mom, right?

697
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:40,070
Honey, please take good care of Hyeon Ji.

698
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,300
Cherish her.

699
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,800
Don't resent your mother too much.

700
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,780
She's an incredible person who lived her whole life worried about you.

701
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,180
I'm aware.

702
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,940
That's why I'm even more upset.

703
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,490
My Su Yeon and your mother

704
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,010
did it in order to protect their child, after all.

705
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,610
We still have time.

706
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,750
The time to resent and forgive.

707
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,710
My Su Yeon, even as she suffered,

708
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,000
protected her young child.

709
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,970
But I...

710
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:54,680
wasn't able to protect my child.

711
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:59,950
As a mother, I've been ruined.

712
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:04,120
But to you, who Su Yeon gave her life to protect,

713
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,460
I want to do as much as I can.

714
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,630
You've already given me enough.

715
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:16,220
Since I've found you, Grandma, I don't need anything else.

716
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:21,070
I'll visit you often.

717
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,440
with my mother.

718
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,410
Sure. Thank you.

719
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,990
But ...

720
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,490
What brings you here?

721
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,510
Yeo Na isn't here anymore.

722
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:50,820
It's still the same for me, then and now.

723
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,620
I can't see anything anyway.

724
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:03,120
Kim Hyeon Mi, Park Yeong Ho. There are no whereabouts on these two.

725
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,850
I know, I've been looking.

726
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:11,830
27 years ago, Choi Seung Construction built an apartment.

727
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:16,800
At the time, Lee Dong Min gave money to the person in charge of the foundation making.

728
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,710
It's a highly probable location of the body burial.

729
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,670
It's under reconstruction, so they're going to blow it up next week.

730
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,210
I plan on going on site.

731
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,530
- Is the construction taking place today?
- Yes.

732
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:42,940
I want to ask you for a favor.

733
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,550
Sure. Anything.

734
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:51,080
When my mom and Detective Park disappear,

735
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:55,070
please take good care of Jun Su.

736
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,870
I'll find him no matter what, so just until then.

737
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,450
Sounds good. I'll do that.

738
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,480
As for you...

739
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,960
I'm alright.

740
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,720
Someone needs to protect the village.

741
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,030
Thanks for everything you've done until now.

742
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,030
I mean it.

743
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,810
I... I'm more grateful.

744
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:27,990
Thanks to you, I'm living in the Republic of Korea.

745
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,790
Here.

746
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,530
Ice Americano, extra shot.

747
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,410
This coffee was quite delicious.

748
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,590
Thanks.

At least you got to say goodbye to Thomas.

780
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,470
I couldn't even say goodbye to him, because I couldn't see the village so suddenly.

781
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,040
Do you remember, Ahjusshi?

782
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,390
When I first told the detectives Ha Neul was there,

783
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,440
they treated me like I was crazy.

784
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,100
Of course, I remember it. I was pretending to agree with them.

785
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,400
But now,

786
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:39,300
I think I understand how those detectives must have felt.

787
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,320
I kept insisting that there was a village in that forest.

788
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,360
Right.

789
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,850
What are you doing?

790
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:59,440
I can't see them, but they can see us. I'm saying hi to Thomas.

791
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:04,610
If you want to say hi, you need to do it toward that way, where Hawaii is.

792
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:07,340
I've lived here for more than 10 years.

793
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,430
Your argument doesn't even make sense. It's definitely over there!

794
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:16,070
I'm telling you, it's over there! I made a mark there.

795
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,500
Look, look. Right there.

796
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,910
Wook that shines like the sun? My foot. You're Wook that is as stubborn as a whale tendon, goodness.

797
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,700
It's over there you punk!

798
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,630
This is something that becomes true just with your insistence!

799
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:29,000
- For 10 years—
- That's in that direction!

800
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,540
It's over there! I made a mark here!

801
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,630
While I went back and forth every day, I made a mark!

802
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,700
I've lived here over 10 years.

803
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:41,390
I tracked the IP address, and it was the driver from the academy you mentioned last time.

804
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,360
Then this punk, Kim Geun Wu, did kill Jun Su.

805
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,540
Nope.

806
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,590
A different person who lives in that house.

807
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,770
I knew that would be the case. As expected, Jjong Ah.

808
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:55,270
You're gotten much better.

809
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:58,310
It seems like yesterday you were scammed on the streets.

810
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,540
You've been scammed before?

811
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,550
No? When did I get scammed?

812
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:07,950
It was you. And true.

813
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:11,510
Yes, mom. Did you send the money?

814
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:15,590
Okay. I'll take care of it myself.

815
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:23,040
Yoo Yeong Min.

816
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,200
You shouldn't do that.

817
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:29,240
Who are you?

818
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,410
You're pushing your nose into someone else's business again.

819
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,770
Check who this is for.

820
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,370
The names on this note and that form are different, right?

821
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,590
Let me take a look.

822
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,120
You're right, the names are different.

823
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,340
The real estate agent told me he got a power of attorney and showed it to me.

824
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:54,890
He got a power of attorney. Did he get the house deed?

825
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,020
If you signed the lease, you should send the money to the homeowner,

826
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,640
not some random person.

827
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,500
You seem smart, but you're actually ignorant.

828
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Lady, consider yourself lucky today.

829
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,810
It's because I have a useless sense of justice that I can't just ignore these things.

830
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,810
He's right. That did happen.

831
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:17,970
It has happened in the past.

832
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,720
Oh right, I have something to give you.

833
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,790
What is it?

834
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,700
Ta-da!

835
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,690
Now, you're one of us the four musketeers.

836
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,740
Four musketeers?

837
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,610
The three of us and Nam Gook.

838
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,140
We are the four musketeers.

839
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,780
I'm going to retire. I can't do this anymore.

840
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,700
How cheeky, trying to get out of it yourself.

841
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,290
Once you enter this group, you can never leave.

842
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,500
Hand.

843
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,360
Give me your hand!

844
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,250
I custom ordered this.

845
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,500
What's the point of living all alone?

846
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,100
Nobody is there. Come out and do some work, here and there.

847
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:58,220
Eat a few meals together, hang out.

848
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,220
You still... shouldn't have forced it on me.

849
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,930
Here. Like this.

850
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,860
We welcome you into the four musketeers.

851
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,270
This bracelet never comes off.

♫ Bearing sad tears  ♫

853
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:20,620
Hello. I'm Sin Jun Ho, who has been officially appointed to the Missing Person Department

854
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,480
I look forward to working with you.

855
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,620

856
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,290
Why the cheesy intro?

857
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:33,510
This is your original position, just act in the way you always have.

858
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:41,050
But you really can't get any results here. Will you be okay with that?

859
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,910
I think you must not be aware,

860
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:47,470
that robbery, murder, these are all a step behind.

861
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,910
Because we find the criminal after the incident has happened.

862
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:56,330
But 'missing' is present-tense.

863
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:00,640
We're a team that looks for people.

864

01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,840

868
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,570
The person who killed Jun Su is moving today.

869
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:30,700
The evidence is on the computer, so make sure to get that.

870
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,040
Wait a minute. Be quiet.

871
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,980
The good news from the site of searching for the deceased during the Korean war near Amnok River was delivered.

872
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,200
Based on the joint release of the North and South excavation team

873
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,380
7 bodies, who are presumed to belong to independence fighters

874
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:49,350
as well as their clothes and belongings have been found near the Amnok River.

875
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:54,680
The place of the bodies found, that are presumed to belong to independence fighters is the downstream area of Amnok River.

876
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,350
The Ministry of Defense announced that they found 9 bodies including these 7 so far...

877
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:59,280
Let me see. It's Thomas.

878
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,870
Wait, wait.

879
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:03,020
Do you think they'll really find Thomas in this excavation?

880
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,770
Anyway, somewhere, Thomas is there.

881
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,850
I really hope they'll find him.

882
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:14,380
I hope so.
The body found

883
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:17,910
will be passed on to forensics for identification purposes.

884
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,200
I'm glad Jun Su was able to leave.

885
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,230
- Especially since Thomas isn't there anymore.
- That's what I'm saying.

886
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,440
Who's going to protect the village?

887
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,660
Someone else will show up, I'm sure.

888
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,660
Who was that?

889
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,300
Who is it? Where was that from?

890
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,450
Please give me the ball. It's mine.

891
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,710
There's a lot of cars here. It's dangerous, so be careful.

892
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:26,220
- Be careful, okay?
- Thank you.

893
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,610
Even little girls play soccer these days.

894
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:34,950
Jjong Ah is also quite good.

895
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,880
- Really?
- She isn't bad at anything.

896
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,110
Wow...

897
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:42,050
But that little kid looks familiar, I wonder where from.

898
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,930
Let's go. We're late!

899
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,440
Guys!

900
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,220
I just met Hyeon Ji's dad.

901
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,580
Really? Hyeon Ji's dad? Where?

902
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,640
Over there. Let's go!

903
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,240
Okay.
