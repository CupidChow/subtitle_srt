00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,818
"Episode 23"

3
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:08,943
Wu Xie.

4
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:10,623
What now?

5
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,303
Well...

6
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,503
What do we do now?

7
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:31,463
We can't just stay here....

8
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,463
and wait.

9
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:34,903
We have to find a way...

10
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:35,943
to get out of here.

11
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,783
The Chi beetles are ridiculous!

12
00:02:38,863 --> 00:02:39,823
Look.

13
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,343
Stop nagging.

14
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,343
Sit still if you have no bright ideas.

15
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:58,103
Thanks.

16
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:00,903
Look.

17
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:02,063
It's only been a while...

18
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,743
and they're already here.

19
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:08,863
Forcing our way through won't work.

20
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,223
Let me think.

21
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,743
How about we climb up?

22
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:16,103
No.

23
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,423
It won't take long...

24
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,503
for the Chi beetles to reach us.

25
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:19,823
Climbing takes too long.

26
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:20,823
We won't make it.

27
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:28,823
Look.

28
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,143
There's no beetles on the cliff ahead.

29
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:32,983
The only way out...

30
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,143
is to get across.

31
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,503
That's too far.

32
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:38,063
How are we going to get there?

33
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,343
Fly?

34
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,223
Exactly because it's far.

35
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:43,103
That's why the beetles
can't get across.

36
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,263
If they can't get across,

37
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,343
so can't we.

38
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:48,263
This...

39
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,823
Where did you get the rope from?

40
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,383
We found a body on a tree...

41
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:07,903
and got it from his bag.

42
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:10,983
A 20-something guy?

43
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,663
He was with you?

44
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:18,423
My underling.

45
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:21,063
This rope is one of the best,

46
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:22,743
used by special ops.

47
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,983
Its bearing capacity is 3 tons.

48
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:26,423
So...

49
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,263
it should be no problem
for the four of us.

50
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:34,903
The problem is that it might be...

51
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:35,823
too short.

52
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,383
Fifteen meters.

53
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,943
That's not long enough.

54
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,623
This is a 16 millimeter
double-stranded rope.

55
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,023
We can split it...

56
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:48,183
and turn it into a single strand.

57
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:49,263
Split it?

58
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,183
Won't it be too thin?

59
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,743
Don't get ahead of yourself.

60
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:53,543
No.

61
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,743
An 8 millimeter
reinforced nylon rope...

62
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:56,463
is good enough...

63
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,383
for mountaineering.

64
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,263
As long as there's no big avalanche,

65
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:00,903
this will work.

66
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,823
Wu Xie, that's...

67
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:04,663
That's only the outer braid.

68
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:05,903
Will it work without the inner braid?

69
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,503
What you can do now...

70
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:08,703
are two things.

71
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:09,863
One is to believe...

72
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:10,783
that the rope won't break,

73
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,743
and two, to trust my judgment.

74
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,223
Let's do it.

75
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,023
Your blood...

76
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,383
sure is the best insect repellant.

77
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:20,543
Let me try it.

78
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:33,583
That doesn't look stable at all.

79
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,783
Wu Xie, that's...

80
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:43,743
I'll do it.

81
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:02,743
Great.

82
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:04,863
Wu Xie.

83
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,183
Your girlfriend...

84
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,663
is so much better than you.

85
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:08,223
Hey.

86
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:09,383
That's nonsense.

87
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,503
Who are you calling "my girlfriend"?

88
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:12,423
You better watch your mouth.

89
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,983
-All right, just shut it.
-I was just...

90
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,183
Now's not the time...

91
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,623
for you to be cracking jokes.

92
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,783
Now you're not stuttering?

93
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,023
I'll do it.

94
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,423
I'll go first.

95
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:37,543
Be careful.

96
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:38,743
I'll watch them.

97
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,783
Be careful, little lifesaver.

98
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:51,463
Be extra careful.

99
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:52,423
Wu Xie.

100
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,383
Will this work?

101
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:57,023
There's only one way to find out.

102
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:58,663
Wait...

103
00:07:58,783 --> 00:07:59,743
What now?

104
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:03,103
Take the gun.

105
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:07,221
You can protect yourself...

106
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:09,023
in case there's something over there.

107
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,103
Let's not waste time.

108
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:22,863
My goodness.

109
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,183
How is it, little lifesaver?

110
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:22,583
You guys can come!

111
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,063
One by one!

112
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,343
I'll go first.

113
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:30,463
I don't know if the rope will hold.

114
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,503
I'll test it out first.

115
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,143
Amitabha...

116
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,663
Watch yourself, old man.

117
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,183
What do you think is inside?

118
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,543
I've realized...

119
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,503
that this place is not
just a big earth pit.

120
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:20,423
I definitely...

121
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,063
didn't come here for nothing.

122
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:27,343
Hurry up.

123
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:38,863
Let me catch my breath.

124
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:48,983
My little lifesaver,

125
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:50,343
thank goodness for you.

126
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:52,863
Teacher Liang made it!

127
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:53,863
Next one!

128
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:55,903
Okay.

129
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,463
Ladies first. You go.

130
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:00,623
I'll take the rear.

131
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:03,583
You go first.

132
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:04,503
I'll take the rear.

133
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,263
No.

134
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,623
I'll worry if you go last.

135
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,423
I'd feel uneasy.

136
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,263
The least trustworthy of us four...

137
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:13,023
is you.

138
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,183
Guess I worried for nothing.

139
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,543
Okay, I'll go first.

140
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:44,303
Ning, watch out!

141
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:45,863
There are beetles behind you!

142
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,263
Ning, get on the rope!

143
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,343
Get over here, quick!

144
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,223
You can't do that.

145
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,503
The rope is too thin.

146
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,943
It won't hold for two.

147
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:07,743
Ning!

148
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:08,783
Stop dallying!

149
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:09,783
Get on the rope!

150
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:17,863
Wu Xie!

151
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,223
She can't get on!

152
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,503
The rope won't be able...

153
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:22,903
to bear the load!

154
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,103
Ning, get over here!

155
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:56,823
Ning, behind you!

156
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,583
The beetles are on the rope.

157
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,543
Are you guys okay?

158
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:41,063
Wu Xie!

159
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,543
Pull us up!

160
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:43,463
Quick!

161
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:00,543
Your hand.

162
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:30,343
Lao Yang!

163
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,383
Help me pull her up!

164
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:33,903
No way, I'm not going to.

165
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,943
Enough talk!

166
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,663
We came together,
we're getting out together!

167
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:37,863
No one gets left behind!

168
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,103
Ning, give me your hand!

169
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,703
You okay?

170
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:26,143
My goodness!

171
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:27,743
We need to get out of here.

172
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,983
Those beetles are catching up!

173
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:50,863
My little lifesaver.

174
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:52,823
You surprised me again.

175
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:57,303
The Dragon's blood
actually flows within you!

176
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,183
How amazing.

177
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:01,343
Anyway,

178
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,223
little lifesaver.

179
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,703
I have this specialized, leave-on...

180
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,303
antibacterial lotion.

181
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,103
Let's go, Ning.

182
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:28,183
Wu Xie!

183
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,383
They're here but not coming close.

184
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:51,583
Is this the spot?

185
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:52,703
I'm fine.

186
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:01,383
Don't move.

187
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:02,543
Let me take a look.

188
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:11,623
With that injury,

189
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:13,903
we can no longer climb.

190
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:16,063
Scared?

191
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,183
Get lost if you're scared.

192
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,343
No one's stopping you.

193
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,863
I'm only worried about the young lady.

194
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:22,863
Young man,

195
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,183
an injury is no big deal.

196
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,943
But it might lead to
a life-threatening situation.

197
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,503
You needn't worry over
someone else's girlfriend.

198
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:31,823
You...

199
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:35,543
It's a contusion.

200
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,303
I'll help you secure the arm.

201
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:39,903
Look at that.

202
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:42,343
Look at the condition she's in,

203
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:44,823
and take a look
at those beetles around.

204
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,583
How tall is this bronze tree?

205
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:47,503
Do you even know?

206
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:49,463
What else is up there?

207
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,463
Do you know?

208
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:50,943
This is all I've got.

209
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,423
Is it worth sacrificing your life for?

210
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,783
Have you thought about that?

211
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:55,743
I don't know.

212
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:56,623
Move it.

213
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,423
I'll take you down.

214
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,223
What are you doing?

215
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,463
Enough!

216
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:00,743
We're caught between
a rock and a hard place.

217
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,223
Bickering won't solve anything!

218
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,543
Can you...

219
00:19:35,223 --> 00:19:36,303
Can you be more gentle?

220
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:55,703
I was talking to Mr. Naive...

221
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,463
about this being a futile trip.

222
00:19:58,743 --> 00:19:59,863
We've got apes.

223
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:02,823
We've got bugs.

224
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:05,943
Not a futile trip at all.

225
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,783
The God of Prosperity is knocking.

226
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,583
Money is coming.

227
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:15,063
Aren't you tired from killing
monkeys and bugs?

228
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:15,903
Come.

229
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,183
Sit and take a rest.

230
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,023
Come on, now.

231
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:19,823
Have something to eat.

232
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:20,543
Take a break.

233
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:23,943
Did you see Chi beetles...

234
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:25,143
the last time you came?

235
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:27,903
I don't remember.

236
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,943
Well, you're here this time
to recover your memories.

237
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,743
So the last time was for treasures?

238
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:38,183
I don't remember.

239
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,343
Wait, you can't...

240
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,623
just eat and not recall anything.

241
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,143
I've no idea where Mr. Naive is now.

242
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,543
Did he also find Chi beetles?

243
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,223
I think I saw Wu Xie.

244
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:56,543
It's not an illusion.

245
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,103
A recording?

246
00:20:58,183 --> 00:20:59,343
Like before?

247
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,423
Why didn't I see it?

248
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,663
Little Master,

249
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,423
I'm going to take a look there.

250
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:25,783
Ning.

251
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:28,303
Lao Yang.

252
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:32,463
Lao Yang!

253
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,543
Scoundrel!

254
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:41,183
Young people should learn
proper manners.

255
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:44,543
Speak in a civilized manner.

256
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,463
What do you want?

257
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:49,863
See for yourself.

258
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,423
Look who's here?

259
00:21:59,143 --> 00:21:59,743
Don't move.

260
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:01,263
Stay out of this.

261
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:05,223
Boy,

262
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:08,503
I didn't think you
would've eaten Dragon's blood.

263
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,503
It's already come to this,

264
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:15,503
just kill me if you want
and cut the crap!

265
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,303
He's a young shoot indeed.

266
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:21,023
He has no idea
what situation we're in.

267
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:23,263
Boy,

268
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:24,943
you guys are still alive...

269
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,703
because we have no plans to kill you.

270
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:29,583
With your attitude,

271
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:31,543
if it had been someone short-tempered,

272
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:34,463
you'd be digging your own grave.

273
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:36,983
Teacher Liang,

274
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,343
I've saved you countless times!

275
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,303
Now, you not only injured my friend,

276
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:42,343
you're pointing a gun at me?

277
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:43,743
Why would I even work with you?

278
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,423
In the present situation,

279
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:48,143
we're stronger together...

280
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:49,503
and weaker apart.

281
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:50,663
Ponder over it,

282
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,223
decide if you wish to work with me.

283
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,823
I promise you won't lose out.

284
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,863
Maybe even benefit from it.

285
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,663
Why do these words....

286
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:00,503
sound so familiar?

287
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,983
Don't even think about it.

288
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:06,863
Don't touch her!

289
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:07,863
You stay put.

290
00:23:09,143 --> 00:23:10,823
Fortune's wheel is ever turning.

291
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:14,823
It's about time
I get to call the shots.

292
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,103
You have two injured people
tagging along now.

293
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,023
Do you go up or down...

294
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:24,703
from here on?

295
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,183
Have you thought about it?

296
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:39,703
Mr. Wang.

297
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,503
After all the small talk,

298
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:44,503
what you really meant...

299
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,103
by working together
is to use my blood...

300
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,743
against the Chi venom, right?

301
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:50,023
Moreover, I must not die.

302
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,343
Because once I'm dead,
my blood will solidify...

303
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:53,903
and you're not sure...

304
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,463
if it would still work
against the beetles.

305
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:58,183
Fact is, I have the tools...

306
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,463
and you have the Dragon's blood.

307
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:02,583
We are all here for relics
to make a buck.

308
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:08,703
Okay.

309
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,343
Now, listen carefully to what I say.

310
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,863
After Mr. Li's death,

311
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:16,863
we pored over...

312
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:18,823
the contents of
the Tombs Collection...

313
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:21,103
that described this grave.

314
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,863
But the notes in the collection...

315
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:24,903
aren't standardized.

316
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,144
Sometimes, it would be written
in the Han language.

317
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:29,983
Sometimes in Braille.

318
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:31,543
There are even parts...

319
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:32,463
which use letters...

320
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:34,223
nobody has ever seen.

321
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:36,383
When it comes to this place,

322
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:39,223
most notes were written in Braille.

323
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,103
Presently in all of China,

324
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,623
there are less than 20 people...

325
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:45,663
who can read Braille.

326
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:46,903
Just so happens...

327
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,223
that I'm one of them.

328
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,383
According to the Braille excerpts,

329
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,783
during the Northern Wei period,

330
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:57,023
a supervisor of an official mine
in Mount Taibai made a report.

331
00:24:57,263 --> 00:25:00,143
Saying that they found
a bronze pillar.

332
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:03,343
The pillar went deep down
into the mountain.

333
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,983
They couldn't reach the end
no matter how they dug.

334
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:07,623
Some say that...

335
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,623
it was a nail struck...

336
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,663
by the Jade Emperor.

337
00:25:11,863 --> 00:25:13,303
The purpose was...

338
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:16,983
to pin down
the dragon's veins of Qinling.

339
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:18,063
If not,

340
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:20,583
the earthen dragon
would've flown to the heavens.

341
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:22,143
The truth is...

342
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,583
it was all folklore.

343
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,663
But the legend circulated...

344
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,463
and reached the palace...

345
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,383
and the emperor heard it.

346
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:31,903
He became interested.

347
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,663
And so, he sent
a troop of Mute Army...

348
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,783
to conduct an investigation here.

349
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:38,383
The Mute Army...

350
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:40,383
not only found the bronze tree,

351
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:42,303
they also discovered...

352
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:45,543
a mysterious grave nearby.

353
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:48,543
They even fought a battle
with the native tribe...

354
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:49,743
protecting the area.

355
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:51,383
At the same time,

356
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:54,303
the Mute Army also found...

357
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,983
a dragon engraved stone box.

358
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,583
It was hollow
and had something inside.

359
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:03,303
But there were no gaps anywhere...

360
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:05,063
and they couldn't open it.

361
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:06,943
The Mute Army didn't dare
try anything else...

362
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:08,503
so they brought it back to the palace.

363
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:11,663
The emperor was delighted to see it.

364
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,943
He rewarded the soldiers handsomely...

365
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:18,943
and they all had a merry time drinking
until they lost their minds.

366
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,583
A few of the soldiers...

367
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:24,783
made a bet in a drunken stupor.

368
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,303
They said they would
climb the bronze tree.

369
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:31,423
Unfortunately,

370
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:33,103
the rest of the excerpts...

371
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,703
in the Tombs Collection...

372
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:38,823
was written in the unknown language.

373
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:41,663
We have no idea...

374
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,863
if it contained any special meaning.

375
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,143
I couldn't read it.

376
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:48,063
We don't know what happened...

377
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:49,863
after they climbed up the tree.

378
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,823
Since nobody knows what happened,

379
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:54,783
we should find out.

380
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:56,903
That won't do.

381
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,263
We don't know...

382
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:00,823
what's up there.

383
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,103
What else could it be?

384
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:03,303
Apart from...

385
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,383
finding a bunch of wild monkeys
possessed by Chi venom.

386
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:08,503
We all got here by climbing the tree.

387
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,223
Listen when I say,
we can't be too careful.

388
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:17,183
As the saying goes,

389
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:21,023
better safe than sorry,

390
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:21,703
you know?

391
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:24,263
How many did we start out with?

392
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:25,983
How many are still here?

393
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,383
Think about it.

394
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:31,023
The risk is too high.
Lives are at stake.

395
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:31,663
Ning.

396
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,783
I'm going up there with him.

397
00:27:34,343 --> 00:27:36,423
Look after my friend for me.

398
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,663
Little lifesaver.

399
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,943
You've had your chance
to say your farewell.

400
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:42,383
Time to go.

401
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,343
Teacher Liang.

402
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,943
I'm leaving my two friends
in your hands.

403
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,303
Don't worry.

404
00:27:53,343 --> 00:27:54,943
If anything were to happen to them,

405
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,463
you can forget
about getting out alive.

406
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:05,583
No need to scare me.

407
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:07,063
I have this.

408
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:31,503
You, go first.

409
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,463
Using the walkways...

410
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,743
will save us a lot of work.

411
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:31,223
It was built back in the day...

412
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:32,423
for the emperor.

413
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,783
I'm sure they used the best materials.

414
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:36,063
See,

415
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,463
Tianjin's Dule Temple,

416
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:38,503
Pagoda of Fogong Temple...

417
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:40,063
and the Anji Bridge...

418
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:42,423
are all structures with up to
a thousand years history.

419
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:43,743
After years of wind and rain...

420
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:44,743
and several earthquakes,

421
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,343
they are still standing tall.

422
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,063
Did you just compare
these dilapidated walkways...

423
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:50,983
to the mega temple structures?

424
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,583
If push comes to shove,

425
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,183
we still have the rope.

426
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:55,183
Together with the walkways,

427
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:57,103
it'll surely be easier than climbing.

428
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:00,983
Mr. Wang.

429
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:03,543
You seem to know this place well.

430
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,263
Have you been here?

431
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:08,343
Enough talk.

432
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:09,423
After you.

433
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:36,383
Hey.

434
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,023
Wu Xie.

435
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,743
I'm done drinking.

436
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,543
Do you want some?

437
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,583
Wu Xie!

438
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,423
Wu Xie!

439
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:16,863
Watch out!

440
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,223
Thanks.

441
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:55,223
What's this?

442
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:56,903
Aerial roots made from bronze.

443
00:32:57,623 --> 00:32:58,743
Can't take them with me.

444
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:02,223
Come and look at this.

445
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:30,343
What a spectacular coffin.

446
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:39,383
This must belong...

447
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,543
to some important Serpent.

448
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,503
But the gaps between
the roots are minimal.

449
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:46,783
How did they...

450
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,903
move the coffin here?

451
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,983
The tree must have been here...

452
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,583
before the coffin.

453
00:33:58,343 --> 00:34:00,823
The bronze tree provides good shade.

454
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:03,903
A great spot.

455
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,303
This is like a kid in a candy store,

456
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:26,703
not knowing where to start.

457
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:27,783
You've been here, right?

458
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:28,783
Any catch?

459
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,463
Why do I hear...

460
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,023
the sound of static?

461
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:39,263
Don't tell me the guy inside
is listening to a podcast.

462
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:41,583
Or perhaps using a walkie-talkie?

463
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,103
Damn.

464
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:07,103
Watch out!

465
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,183
I thought I've seen everything.

466
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,103
But you got me this time.

467
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:46,943
Even the ethnic tribe...

468
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:47,943
had some tricks up their sleeve.

469
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:51,623
What next?

470
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:03,223
Why do the rocks keep falling?

471
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,063
We're close to the surface.

472
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:07,663
That's why the root system
is extensive.

473
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:09,623
It's because of the roots...

474
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:10,863
that the rocks are unstable.

475
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:12,503
That's why they are crumbling.

476
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,583
We need to watch below us...

477
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:14,823
and also above us.

478
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:16,103
Danger everywhere.

479
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,183
We need to pass this section...

480
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:21,423
while there are no falling rocks.

481
00:37:10,383 --> 00:37:11,103
You okay?

482
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:28,663
Let's go.

483
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:30,983
Let me take a break first.

484
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:46,463
What's that?

485
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:48,583
I can't tell.

486
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:51,383
Let's trying seeing
from a different spot.

487
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,183
Looks like it's the same
bronze sculpture...

488
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,063
ahead of us.

489
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:12,823
Let's get closer.

490
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:42,903
I still can't see.

491
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:49,183
How do we get over?

492
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:50,383
It's too far.

493
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:51,463
Let's climb.

494
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:52,143
Okay.

495
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:56,823
Hurry up.

496
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,143
I'm doing it.

497
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:06,343
Let me.

498
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:08,303
I'll do it. I know how!

499
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,103
Move it.

500
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:19,383
I know. Don't rush me.

501
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:20,183
Let me!

502
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:21,303
Give it to me!

503
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:22,543
I'll check what danger lies ahead!

504
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:23,383
I'll go first!

505
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:25,103
Give it to me!

506
00:39:26,223 --> 00:39:26,983
Step aside!

507
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:29,183
Me first!

508
00:39:32,063 --> 00:39:32,863
Me first.

509
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:33,463
You...
