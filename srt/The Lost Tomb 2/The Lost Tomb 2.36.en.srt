3
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,417
Uncle San Xing,

4
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,834
why are you here?

5
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,501
Why are you here?

6
00:04:59,125 --> 00:04:59,709
Uncle San Xing.

7
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,000
Tell me.

8
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,834
What happened?

9
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,918
Nothing happened.

10
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:06,501
Hurry back, boy.

11
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,792
Your friends are waiting.

12
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,250
Uncle San Xing,

13
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,167
why?

14
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:17,083
Why are you still...

15
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,542
hiding the truth from me?

16
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,751
I'm Wu Xie, Uncle.

17
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,250
I'm Wu Xie!

18
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,709
If you don't go back now,

19
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,501
your friends are
definitely going to die!

20
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:49,626
Kids,

21
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,459
where is this?

22
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,834
Kids!

23
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,417
Kids!

24
00:10:58,417 --> 00:10:59,334
Come in, quick.

25
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:00,959
Kids!

26
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,000
Kids!

27
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,042
Quick!

28
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,292
Who is he?

29
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,626
We have to tell the chief.

30
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,125
Excuse me.

31
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,959
Excuse me!

32
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,834
Go! Go quickly!

33
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,083
Take a seat.

34
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:47,876
Who are you?

35
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,417
How should I address you?

36
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,959
I'm Jin Yang.

37
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,584
Besides me,

38
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:53,959
no one else will let you stay.

39
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,751
Why?

40
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,459
What is this place?

41
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why did you save me?

42
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,876
You came from a place
where you shouldn't have.

43
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:04,999
People here don't welcome you.

44
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,375
Check if you're missing anything.

45
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,167
If there isn't then...

46
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:12,667
leave quickly.

47
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:15,667
Thank you.

48
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:01,999
You really don't remember...

49
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,000
how you...

50
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:04,167
came to this place?

51
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,125
I really don't remember.

52
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,042
Also, once I think about it...

53
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:10,459
my head starts to ache.

54
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,042
How did I wake up to...

55
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,167
a snow mountain?

56
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,667
What is this place?

57
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:18,918
This is Dongbei,

58
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:20,292
Changbai Mountain.

59
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,209
Changbai Mountain?

60
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:26,792
Do you have a phone?

61
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,125
I'd like to make a call.

62
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,584
The chief has one at his place...

63
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,459
but the heavy snow has...

64
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,834
damaged the signal tower.

65
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:35,918
What about a computer?

66
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:48,959
You really don't remember...

67
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:50,000
how you...

68
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,250
came down from above?

69
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:54,834
Came from where?

70
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,626
Where you were from.

71
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,417
The Forbidden Land on
the edge of the mountain.

72
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,209
As far as I know,

73
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,042
no one...

74
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,667
lives or comes back from there.

75
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,334
What Forbidden Land?

76
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,125
Isn't that just a snowfield?

77
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:09,375
Besides snow,

78
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,667
there's nothing else there.

79
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,042
On the way here,

80
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,542
did you find anything?

81
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,792
Tell me,

82
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,417
how can I leave here?

83
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,542
How far away is
the closest train station?

84
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,959
Wait for the supply truck to come,

85
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,417
it'll be here next Tuesday.

86
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:08,626
It's so pretty.

87
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,751
That was shot by my sister.

88
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,125
She's the best huntress of
our village in these recent years.

89
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,501
Where is she?

90
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,000
Our village has a rule...

91
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,042
that women can't hunt.

92
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:26,292
So, she stole...

93
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:27,459
my dad's hunting riffle and...

94
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,709
went deep into the mountains.

95
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,417
She stayed there for a week...

96
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,751
and finally...

97
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
she hunted down this rare snow cattle.

98
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,083
This horn...

99
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,626
was her coming of age present to me.

100
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,584
As she gets better,

101
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,959
she gets braver.

102
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,959
She doesn't believe the myth
of the Forbidden Land.

103
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,042
She insisted to venture there.

104
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,334
As a result...

105
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,375
She never came back again.

106
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:05,709
I don't believe that...

107
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:06,876
she was ever stuck there.

108
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,501
But even if she comes back alive,

109
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,386
there's...

110
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,627
no place for her here anymore.

111
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,334
Your family...

112
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,417
didn't go looking for her?

113
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,709
There's only the two
of us in the family.

114
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,292
I've tried looking for her...

115
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,542
but before I could enter the paddock,

116
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,751
they caught me and took me home.

117
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,083
That place is not clean.

118
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,792
Once you go there and...

119
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:48,459
come back,

120
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,584
you are no longer yourself.

121
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:56,959
All right,

122
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:58,667
it's getting late.

123
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,334
You should get some rest.

124
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,250
The room is in there.

125
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,593
"Forbidden Land"

126
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,292
Wu Xie's diary.

127
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,375
Changsha?

128
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:18,792
Ning!

129
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:31,876
Ning!

130
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,209
Drink some ginger soup.

131
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:11,417
It'll warm your body.

132
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,375
Spending a night in the snow...

133
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:14,626
will make you sick.

134
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:17,542
Thank you.

135
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,160
This...

136
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,240
looks rather precious.

137
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,899
This is my...

138
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
most prized possession.

139
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:48,959
Do you need help?

140
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,584
It's fine.

141
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:06,042
Can you tell me about...

142
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,250
the Forbidden Land?

143
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,459
The Forbidden Land...

144
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:18,292
is Changbai Mountain's...

145
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,459
root to the Dragon Vein.

146
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,626
Dragon Vein?

147
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,584
That's right,

148
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:29,250
Dragon Vein.

149
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:35,292
This is passed on from generation
to generation in our village.

150
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:36,999
It seems...

151
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,959
so noble and mysterious.

152
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:40,792
But to us,

153
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,125
it's very scary.

154
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:48,667
Due to it being the
root to the Dragon Vein.

155
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,736
Besides...

156
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
where the root lies,

157
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,542
everywhere else...

158
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:57,918
is a deathtrap of bad feng shui.

159
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,167
Barren mountains and unruly rivers,

160
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,501
evil spirited land form.

161
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,834
Not one blade of grass grows.

162
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,751
Once a wild beast enters,

163
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,375
it'll suffer magnetic interference,

164
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,292
triggering it's primal instincts,

165
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:14,876
losing all senses...

166
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,792
and lastly die from madness.

167
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:18,834
Same goes for humans.

168
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,292
If you're lucky enough...

169
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,709
to come back alive,

170
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:26,083
you'll still be infected
by an odd disease.

171
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,915
And...

172
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:30,919
it's infectious.

173
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:33,999
Many years ago,

174
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,417
a mountaineering team
once made a big offer...

175
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:38,000
to look for a guide.

176
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,792
But, no one dared to accept.

177
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,880
"2013, Fall"

178
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,083
Who is it?

179
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,751
Who is it?

180
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:31,375
Sir,

181
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,167
the man is on the move.

182
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,501
Anything we should do?

183
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:35,792
Ning,

184
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:38,584
aren't you a little too
concerned about Wu Xie.

185
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,501
You should know the affect of...

186
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,250
that Wu San Xing on him.

187
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,042
Wu Xie hasn't recovered yet,

188
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,000
he's not going anywhere.

189
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,292
You need to stay put.

190
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,417
Shun Zi on the other hand,

191
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:52,447
is a dubious character.

192
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:53,835
Keep an eye on him...

193
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:55,083
and report to me...

194
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,709
whenever there are new developments.

195
00:32:58,417 --> 00:32:59,751
I understand, sir.

196
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:37,584
Little Master?

197
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:17,751
If I hadn't noticed you in time,

198
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:18,681
I would have...

199
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,240
shot you in the head.

200
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:21,751
Wait!

201
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:23,292
How did you...

202
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:25,083
Stop following me.

203
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,266
You may not have...

204
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:28,376
such good luck next time.

205
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,417
Little Master,

206
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,209
what's wrong with you?

207
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,375
I'm Wu Xie.

208
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:35,834
Don't you recognize me?

209
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,542
Little Master!

210
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,042
Save me!

211
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,751
Little Master! Watch out!

212
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,792
Little Master! In front of you!

213
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:09,167
Little Master!

214
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,792
Three more are coming up!

215
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,167
Let me down!

216
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:12,501
Little Master!

217
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:16,417
Little Master!

218
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:17,834
Let me down!

219
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,876
Don't go!

220
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,083
Little Master!

221
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,125
Here.

222
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,417
Are you hurt?

223
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:57,209
I'm fine.

224
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,417
This is the hunting grounds,

225
00:39:58,626 --> 00:39:59,876
why are you here?

226
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,411
I saw someone I know,

227
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,800
so I followed him here.

228
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,667
You have someone you know here?

229
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:10,834
His name is Kylin Zhang.

230
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,334
He wears all black,

231
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,125
tall and skinny,

232
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,459
and doesn't talk much.

233
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,125
You're talking about...

234
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,042
that weirdo?

235
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,999
You know him?

236
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,000
I don't know him.

237
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:28,501
He's not from our village.

238
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,209
He came here three months ago.

239
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,792
Three months ago?

240
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:15,292
Hey pal!

241
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,542
Hey pal!

242
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,209
Hey pal!

243
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,417
You're being too unreasonable.

244
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,834
This car fare is too little.

245
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:23,542
Unreasonable?

246
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,626
The money I gave is more than enough.

247
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,626
This bit of money...

248
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:28,918
barely covers for gas.

249
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,459
Don't you know how far I've driven?

250
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:31,918
Brother,

251
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
quit bluffing.

252
00:41:33,042 --> 00:41:35,042
As if I don't know
where Snow Village is.

253
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,667
This is my home!

254
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:37,751
I used to live here!

255
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,083
I'm just coming home from Beijing!

256
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,292
You went round and round...

257
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,042
showing off...

258
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,417
your driving skills,
twisting and turning there!

259
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,999
Obviously, that'll waste your gas.

260
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,167
Only because the snow 
sealed up the road.

261
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,250
Hurry and pay up!

262
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,542
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

263
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:54,250
Let me tell you,

264
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,375
I'll go wherever I please.

265
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,083
I shoot bears with my eyes shut.

266
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,709
I'm telling you,
you're playing a fool's game here.

267
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:00,918
I've got money,

268
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:02,250
but I'm not giving you.

269
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:03,918
Come punch me if you dare!

270
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:04,918
Stand still!

271
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:05,751
Come back here!
