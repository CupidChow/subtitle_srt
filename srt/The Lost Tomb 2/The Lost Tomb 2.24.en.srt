"Episode 24"

3
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,317
Fall off.

4
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:38,844
Fall off.

5
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,233
Oh my god.

6
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,609
Fall off. Fall off.

7
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,650
Wu Xie! Wu Xie!

8
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:01,775
Come take a look.

9
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:03,775
Come.

10
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:04,983
Get a closer look here.

11
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,108
There's more than one statue here.

12
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,609
God knows what they are.

13
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:16,901
Come, quick!

14
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:47,650
This could be...

15
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:49,734
the table for sacrificial ceremonies.

16
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,983
These roots are harder than rocks.

17
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,982
The intervals between the sounds...

18
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:56,817
are equally long.

19
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,192
Like a monk knocking on a wooden fish.

20
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,484
Like the sound of a running mechanism.

21
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,108
There must be something in here.

22
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,525
We just don't know
if it's dead or alive.

23
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,275
This should be it.

24
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:33,233
One of us...

25
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,859
must go and scout around first.

26
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:35,982
I'll go first.

27
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,233
This root system cave is complex.

28
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:49,650
More complex than...

29
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,609
the Karst caves.

30
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:51,901
Plus we don't know...

31
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,525
if these bronze trunks are hollow.

32
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:55,108
It could very dangerous...

33
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:56,609
if we go in haste.

34
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,442
You're right.

35
00:06:58,734 --> 00:06:59,650
So we can't...

36
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,692
both go in together.

37
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:01,775
One of us...

38
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,484
must go and scout around first.

39
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:10,650
Mr. Wang,

40
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,817
I see that you are back to normal now?

41
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,982
This hole is...

42
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:23,108
too narrow for me.

43
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,484
You're thinner.

44
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,942
So, you go first.

45
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,025
I'll be right behind.

46
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:27,692
Don't worry,

47
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:28,692
it'll be fine.

48
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:29,859
I know.

49
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,775
I'm just saying that...

50
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,817
don't you think it was weird just now?

51
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:38,775
Why did we...

52
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,692
rush here so hastily?

53
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:41,982
What are you saying?

54
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:42,942
You see,

55
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,317
you asked me to scout around for you,

56
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:47,442
yet you wanted
to be the first to go in,

57
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:48,609
does that make sense?

58
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,525
What are you trying to say here?

59
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,358
Nothing.

60
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:55,066
Stop rambling then.

61
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,066
Just go in.

62
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't try to stall.

63
00:07:58,484 --> 00:07:59,025
Fine.

64
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,192
I'll just be honest with you then.

65
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:03,484
Since you're asking me...

66
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,650
to risk my life for you,

67
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,317
and I don't have any
equipment with me now,

68
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:07,942
if I die in there...

69
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,275
you'll get nothing.

70
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:19,484
Take it.

71
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:21,901
Torchlight.

72
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,025
Hold on.

73
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,734
If it's deep in there,

74
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,233
communicate through this.

75
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,982
The channel is set.

76
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,982
Kid, you've got a bright future ahead.

77
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:35,817
I'll wait here.

78
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:24,859
Hey, kid.

79
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,275
Are you at the bottom?

80
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,859
How does it look like down there?

81
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:28,775
Reply.

82
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:30,982
I'm looking at crossroads here.

83
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:32,775
There are two entrances.

84
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,609
Two entrances?

85
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:36,233
Yes.

86
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,150
One is bright and one is dark.

87
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:41,692
Which one should I go?

88
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,275
How would I know?

89
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,567
I've never been down before.

90
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,275
Which way are you going?

91
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:49,192
Hello?

92
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:50,358
Hello?

93
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:51,817
Hello?

94
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,775
Hey, kid?

95
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:21,108
Reply.

96
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,066
Hello?

97
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,066
Can you hear me?

98
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:31,983
Speak to me.

99
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:33,734
There are two roads here.

100
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,358
Which did you pick?

101
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:42,983
Hey, kid?

102
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,025
Can you hear me?

103
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:47,233
I'm listening.

104
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,484
Where are you now?

105
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,609
I walked out the entrance.

106
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:53,983
I'm seeing a bridge...

107
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,233
and a coffin.

108
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:56,025
Hey, wait.

109
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:57,567
There were two entrances.

110
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:58,983
Which way did you pick?

111
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:00,692
The dark one.

112
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:01,525
Okay.

113
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,901
Stay there and don't move.

114
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:04,066
I'm coming to you.

115
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:54,982
Kid!

116
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,358
I told you not to move.

117
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,692
Why are you there?

118
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:37,859
This is the coffin.

119
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:43,400
What's wrong with you?

120
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,442
Mr. Wang.

121
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:50,817
Mr. Wang.

122
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,025
Mr. Wang, what's wrong?

123
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,150
Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang!

124
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,233
Mr. Wang, are you okay?

125
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:01,567
Mr. Wang.

126
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,025
Mr. Wang, snap out of it!

127
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,317
What you're seeing is an illusion.

128
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,400
Where am I?

129
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,982
What happened?

130
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:33,192
What is this?

131
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:36,817
Can't you see?

132
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:38,233
All the vines...

133
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,317
are creeping down the coffin.

134
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,066
So?

135
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,609
If I'm not wrong,

136
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:48,859
down below...

137
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,358
is our destination.

138
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:53,983
What do you mean?

139
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,233
What do I mean?

140
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,400
We'll know once we're down.

141
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,609
I'll climb down the iron chain.

142
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,150
Don't touch it!

143
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:16,025
Keep in mind that...

144
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:17,901
you mustn't touch...

145
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,192
all vines and branches.

146
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,525
Okay.

147
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:25,983
Be careful.

148
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,442
Why are you so slow? Faster!

149
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,901
Three layers inside and three outside.

150
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,650
Just like Russian dolls.

151
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,942
Now what, Little Master?

152
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,150
Are there any more traps?

153
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,983
Can I just push it open now?

154
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,692
You're not answering?

155
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,817
Then, don't blame me
if anything happens.

156
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,317
Don't move.

157
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:28,192
Stop it.

158
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,609
Little Master?

159
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:43,066
Wait.

160
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,066
Who are you talking to?

161
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:48,775
Wu Xie.

162
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:50,650
Be careful.

163
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:51,942
Mr. Naive?

164
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:53,233
Where?

165
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:54,901
Little Master.

166
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,108
I can see you.

167
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:57,525
Why are you here?

168
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:58,859
How are you?

169
00:18:59,192 --> 00:18:59,817
We are in the...

170
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:01,275
Serpent leader's burial chamber.

171
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,358
Where are you?

172
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:03,901
I'm on the bronze tree.

173
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,484
Seems like a well tomb.

174
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:06,358
The coffin with the body...

175
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:07,525
should be down there.

176
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,442
Are you in a hysteria episode again?

177
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,275
Stop joking around.

178
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,484
Where is Mr. Naive?

179
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:12,901
Little Master,

180
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,275
are you alone?

181
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:15,609
Is Fatty with you?

182
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:16,442
Yes.

183
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,192
He's with me.

184
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,983
How did you find Fatty?

185
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,192
I'm talking to you.

186
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,400
Fatty, come here.

187
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,901
Put your hand on this.

188
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,025
Can you see him?

189
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:47,982
Little Master,

190
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:49,775
why can't I see Fatty?

191
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,650
What am I supposed to see?

192
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,066
Mr. Naive?

193
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,400
Mr. Naive, Mr. Naive!

194
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,275
You...

195
00:19:58,817 --> 00:19:59,942
Are you seeing him...

196
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:00,901
and talking to him?

197
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,192
Remember,

198
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,983
don't tell him about Ning.

199
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,525
Or else he'll be upset...

200
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:07,817
knowing his little wife is dead.

201
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,525
Little Master, Little Master.

202
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:11,983
Did you hear...

203
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,650
any strange sounds?

204
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,025
I get a headache and
ringing in my ears...

205
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,275
whenever I hear it.

206
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,358
And it's always intense.

207
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,150
Have you heard it over there?

208
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:21,609
No.

209
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,192
We don't hear it here.

210
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:26,358
Wu Xie.

211
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,484
How are you doing over there?

212
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,150
My situation is rather complicated.

213
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,692
Long story short,

214
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,400
after Fatty and I got separated...

215
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,525
during the attack
of the Siberian taimen,

216
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,066
I bumped into my childhood friend.

217
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,108
He's called Lao Yang.

218
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:39,734
He was the one...

219
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,275
who came here with Mr. Ma
three years ago.

220
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,066
Then, we met some treasure hunters.

221
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,859
The same group that
Fatty and I followed...

222
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:45,901
when we came into the mountains.

223
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,484
Due to some mishaps,

224
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,358
the ones left were
just me, Lao Yang...

225
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:50,775
and a man called Teacher Liang.

226
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:51,982
As we reached the bronze tree,

227
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,567
we climbed up together.

228
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,400
We were attacked by Chi venom halfway.

229
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,692
It was then,
Ning showed up and saved us.

230
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:00,901
Ning is still alive.

231
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:03,609
Great, that's great.

232
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,525
After the Chi beetles dispersed,

233
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:06,734
Ning was injured.

234
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,983
Teacher Liang was quick
to conspire with Mr. Wang.

235
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,983
They threatened me
to scout around for them.

236
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm now...

237
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,567
scouting with Mr. Wang.

238
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,734
We found a shining coffin.

239
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,233
We're following the light.

240
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,692
Just now,

241
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,275
I don't know what happened.

242
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,358
There was a slight tremor.

243
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,233
I touched the bronze tree,

244
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:24,650
and then I saw you.

245
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,567
What about Mr. Wang?

246
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,942
Mr. Wang? Who?

247
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:29,275
Mr. Wang...

248
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:33,525
He's looking for
the shining object below.

249
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,484
But I can't tell from here.

250
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:40,442
Little Master,

251
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,775
I see the bronze branches around you.

252
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,192
That means we're close by.

253
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:48,484
Don't worry,

254
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,901
I'll find the closest path to you.

255
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,275
Be careful.

256
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,734
I'm much at ease...

257
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:57,734
seeing you and Fatty are safe.

258
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,692
Dilute it.

259
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,982
I've finally found it.

260
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,275
This should be the place.

261
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,817
Kid!

262
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:38,609
Come down!

263
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,567
We're here!

264
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:41,358
What did you find?

265
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,025
The target.

266
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,442
Come on down! Hurry!

267
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:46,358
Little Master,

268
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:47,567
I should go now.

269
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:48,734
You be careful too.

270
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,150
Tell him Fatty Wang will
be right there for him.

271
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:57,817
Fatty Wang will...

272
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,567
be right there,
tell him not to worry.

273
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,358
Hey, tell him that!

274
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,609
Hey, what else did he tell you?

275
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,066
You better tell me all of it.

276
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,066
Don't act dumb.

277
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:08,817
Mr. Naive...

278
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,650
Mr. Naive...

279
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:11,859
Mr...

280
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:18,567
Wu Xie.

281
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,942
Wu Xie!

282
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,233
You look so sad,

283
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,317
my little girl.

284
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:30,775
Wu Xie.

285
00:24:35,983 --> 00:24:36,484
Father

286
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,734
where is Wu Xie?

287
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,567
He was pushed down the tree.

288
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:50,734
Is Wu Xie really dead?

289
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,567
Yes.

290
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,358
Looks like we need to
reorganize our plan.

291
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:58,525
Ning,

292
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:01,484
are you feeling sad because of Wu Xie?

293
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,567
I don't know what's got into me.

294
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:08,650
Father.

295
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,025
Death is just like a shadow,

296
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,609
it's been keeping itself close to us.

297
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:18,066
Even at the brightest places,

298
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,983
it just hides itself,

299
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,066
it's never gone far away from us.

300
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:24,775
When our closed ones...

301
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,150
are taken away by death,

302
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,692
we're bound to feel sad.

303
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:29,817
Which is why...

304
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:31,650
we have been working hard on this.

305
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:34,233
Ning,

306
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:36,734
if I'm the one who was dead...

307
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:37,400
No,

308
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,525
I'll never let it happen.

309
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,442
Never.

310
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,692
Although I dislike death,

311
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,233
but I'm not scared of it.

312
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,525
I've been taking care of you...

313
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,108
since you were a baby.

314
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,150
I've watched you...

315
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,817
grow from a fragile little girl...

316
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,859
to a strong woman.

317
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,942
But you rely too much on me.

318
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,525
I'm worried that if ever I'm not here,

319
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,775
will you continue to
fulfill the mission?

320
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:25,859
Who are you?

321
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:29,192
Who do you wish me to be?

322
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,358
My little girl,

323
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:56,400
you've accomplished your mission,

324
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:58,484
farewell.

325
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:07,775
Come, come down.

326
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:08,775
It's safe here.

327
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,066
This is what you're looking for?

328
00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:24,775
It looks like amber.

329
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:25,734
You know nothing.

330
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:26,609
This is no amber.

331
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:27,901
This is a corpse cocoon.

332
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:43,025
What's inside...

333
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:44,734
this corpse cocoon...

334
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,982
that made you...

335
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:47,484
go through all this effort?

336
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,192
Is...

337
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,859
the Serpent tomb inside it?

338
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:04,817
It's impossible to look inside...

339
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:05,817
with our eyes and torchlight.

340
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:08,567
Unless if we had x-ray scanners.

341
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:12,567
Fine.

342
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,400
As long as Mr. Naive is safe.

343
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,108
But this place is way too strange.

344
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:31,650
He wasn't even physically here,

345
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:33,817
and you were in two totally
different places.

346
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:34,692
Yet,

347
00:28:34,775 --> 00:28:36,982
you could still chat via video call.

348
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:38,692
And only you could.

349
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:39,734
But I couldn't.

350
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,901
Why is that?

351
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,692
This corpse is
extraordinarily well-preserved.

352
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:58,775
I've seen a...

353
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,525
well-preserved ancient corpse before.

354
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:02,734
But that was because
it was soaked in...

355
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,442
embalming herbs and liquid.

356
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,275
Still, that was covered in wax,

357
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:07,400
and all wrinkly...

358
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:08,817
looking like an ugly creature.

359
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:09,692
It was hideous.

360
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:10,692
Look at this one here.

361
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,817
Little Master, would you buy...

362
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:14,859
if I said his time of death...

363
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:15,983
was no more than two hours?

364
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:17,983
I've seen him before.

365
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:19,192
Who?

366
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,066
That recording.

367
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:23,317
The army.

368
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,734
Ghost soldiers?

369
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,859
Mute Riders.

370
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,400
Kid,

371
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,609
do you know how...

372
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:57,484
the corpse cocoon is made?

373
00:29:58,108 --> 00:29:59,400
According to ancient books,

374
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,859
the corpse cocoon
was actually an enhancer...

375
00:30:01,982 --> 00:30:03,609
used by alchemist
during pre-Qin dynasty.

376
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,400
They drowned pregnant woman...

377
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:07,233
in herbs till they died.

378
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,525
Her body was then placed
in a crock and buried.

379
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,358
When they dug it out 17 years later,

380
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:12,775
the baby inside the belly...

381
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,233
would turn into a corpse cocoon.

382
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:15,692
This outer layer here...

383
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:17,066
is the petrified material...

384
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:17,982
of the baby's placenta.

385
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,650
The amber color that you see...

386
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,192
is actually...

387
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:23,275
the solidified amniotic fluid.

388
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,567
I've heard about...

389
00:30:27,982 --> 00:30:29,066
the corpse cocoon before.

390
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,275
In the early years,

391
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,983
some were found in
Southern Sichuan and Inner Mongolia.

392
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:33,692
But they were just
as big as a washbowl.

393
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,066
Some of the textures
were like turquoise,

394
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,317
some were like amber.

395
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:37,484
It contained...

396
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,358
either a child or an animal.

397
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:41,066
It's the first time I've seen...

398
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,025
such big corpse cocoon.

399
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,567
Emperor Qin Shi Huang...

400
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,817
had killed all the alchemists.

401
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,241
No one knows...

402
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:49,484
how they made it.

403
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,192
But there was a saying...

404
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:53,108
that it was a technique...

405
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:54,025
to prevent putrefaction.

406
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:56,901
The corpse was covered
with a special resin...

407
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:58,192
mixed with Chinese herbs,

408
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,233
stopping the decay and dehydration.

409
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,983
During war periods,

410
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:03,400
many who escaped...

411
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:04,734
willingly offered their treasures...

412
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:05,567
to pawn shops.

413
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:07,192
My great-grandfather was the...

414
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:08,609
head appraiser in Hong Kong back then.

415
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:10,108
He had seen quite a bit.

416
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,817
This amber corpse cocoon
was one of it.

417
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,108
Unacceptable.

418
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,484
Your price is too low.

419
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,192
Listen to me,

420
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:19,734
this thing...

421
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,108
is worth more than that.

422
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,108
This is a rare treasure.

423
00:31:23,192 --> 00:31:24,025
Take a closer look at it.

424
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:24,983
I'll take a look at it.

425
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,025
I'll offer 10 percent more at most.

426
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,317
Don't worry.

427
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:28,692
No one will enter
without my permission.

428
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,400
Feast your eyes.

429
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,734
This thing here is a rare treasure.

430
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,817
All who comes to pawn...

431
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:49,025
says the same thing.

432
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:51,066
This is from my ancestors.

433
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:53,108
If you get the right prescription,

434
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:55,734
it can be made into
the elixir of life.

435
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:56,983
In the worst case,

436
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,442
if it's buried as sacrifice,

437
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,275
the tomb owner would become a deity.

438
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,609
This is a sin.

439
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:29,982
A living person was
made into a corpse cocoon.

440
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,233
A sin.

441
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:44,942
You must be full of grudge...

442
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:46,734
when you were dying.

443
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:50,233
To be trapped forever here...

444
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:51,901
even after death.

445
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,983
I'll send you on your
final journey today.

446
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:56,775
Relieve you from pain.

447
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,525
At least...

448
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:01,275
I've done a good deed.

449
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,317
Wu...Wu Xie.

450
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:27,108
You're standing so close
to this corpse cocoon,

451
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,859
do you feel anything?

452
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,275
Anything?

453
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:32,567
Feel what?

454
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,567
Nothing?

455
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:36,942
Put your hand on top of it.

456
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:38,317
Feel it.

457
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,358
Do you feel anything now?

458
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,942
Anything?

459
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,150
What do you mean?

460
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,025
I...I...

461
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,150
What do you desire now?

462
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:52,650
What are you dreams?

463
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:53,484
Just give it a whirl.

464
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:54,567
Whatever you want.

465
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:55,525
Okay?

466
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:56,692
Come on, Wu Xie.

467
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:58,108
Just do it?

468
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,192
I'm thinking.

469
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:02,983
Still nothing?

470
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:05,567
Nothing?

471
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:08,859
It can't be.

472
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:11,734
Tombs Collection can't
be wrong about this.

473
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:14,668
"Tombs Collection"

474
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:16,442
Mr. Wang,

475
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,025
you went through all the hardships...

476
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,609
just for this corpse cocoon?

477
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,066
Here it is.

478
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,192
As a treasure hunter,

479
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:27,901
shouldn't burial objects
excite you more?

480
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:29,108
Besides,

481
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,609
this corpse cocoon is too big.

482
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:31,650
You can't take it out.

483
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,066
Forget the treasures.

484
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,108
We can have anything...

485
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,442
with this corpse cocoon.

486
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:37,525
This doesn't make sense.

487
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,275
It's not true.

488
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:48,567
It can't be wrong.

489
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,025
What's going on?

490
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:02,692
I thought this Tombs Collection...

491
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:04,400
was in Mr. Li's possession?

492
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,358
Why is it with you...

493
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:15,484
Mr. Wang.

494
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:18,233
Where did you get this...

495
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,692
cylinder of blood from?

496
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:27,692
Teacher Liang told me...

497
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,525
you're not into culture.

498
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,108
But you seem to know a lot...

499
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:31,358
about corpse cocoon.

500
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:32,025
Plus,

501
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,817
how is my blood...

502
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,150
going to effect the corpse cocoon?

503
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,775
Perhaps...

504
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:42,025
Mr. Wang...

505
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:47,275
or should I call you Lao Yang?

506
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:37,066
Hey.

507
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,066
Wu Xie.

508
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,275
Wu Xie!

509
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:05,859
Father.

510
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:10,775
Lao Yang.

511
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:13,775
Lao Yang!

512
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:22,400
What's the matter?

513
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:04,108
What's going on, young lady?

514
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:05,817
Where is Lao Yang?

515
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:10,066
Lao Yang?

516
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:11,400
Where is Lao Yang?

517
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:16,400
Lao Yang... he...

518
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:19,942
He killed Mr. Wang.

519
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:22,442
He drugged you all...

520
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:26,734
with hallucinogen
when you were asleep.

521
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,859
He said he'd take me
to find the treasure.

522
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,358
But turned out he was lying too!

523
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,192
