"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:07,217
"Episode 14"

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,200
Xie Lian Huan had
little diving experience.

4
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
That brat...

5
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
had no control of his
oxygen consumption.

6
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
It was terrifying.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
He could've died from it.

8
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,400
What's the matter?

9
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,120
San Xing, look. Look at this!

10
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,240
This should be the
coffin of the tomb owner.

11
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,360
I wonder who lies in it.

12
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
This is just a figurine.

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,120
Xie Lian Huan,

14
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
you coward.

15
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,720
Figurine?

16
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,680
I was scared to death!

17
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,360
But this figurine...

18
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,960
looks so weird.

19
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,120
It looks like it was
screaming while being tortured.

20
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,480
San Xing,

21
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,440
this is a metal coffin.

22
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,760
This hole extends to the
interior of the coffin, I guess.

23
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,920
This is a Whistle Coffin.

24
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
What?

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,960
It was sealed with metal
and contains a hole.

26
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,960
It is definitely a Whistle Coffin.

27
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,360
So, something terrible must be inside.

28
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,280
It may even be a zombie or a demon.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,720
That is why it was sealed with
molten iron from the outside,

30
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
with nothing but an opening.

31
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Allowing someone skilful to
reach for the treasure inside.

32
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,360
If his hand was bitten
by the thing inside,

33
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,680
he must cut his arm
off from the outside.

34
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, that's an interesting story.

35
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
But this is impossible.

36
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,760
The story passed on from...

37
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
our ancestors must have its purpose.

38
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,720
San Xing,

39
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,600
aren't you curious about
the thing inside?

40
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Let's go back...

41
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
to get the black donkey
hoof and some candles,

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,400
and return tomorrow.

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,800
The coffin won't run away.

44
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,960
No need to rush.

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
You'd better just look at it.
Don't touch it.

46
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm going there.

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
What should I do?

48
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,760
What is going on?

49
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,560
San Xing,

50
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I just threw a burning kindling
inside to take a clearer look.

51
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,000
I didn't expect this to happen!

52
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
You're insane!

53
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Where did you learn
this cheap trick from?

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,280
It didn't even work!

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,513
Under a dry condition,
the clothes on the corpse will burn,

56
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,886
let alone the body itself!

57
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
Can you use your brain?

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
San Xing, stop scolding me!

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
Let's put out the fire first!

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,880
You're really a trouble maker!

61
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,000
Why are you standing there?

62
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,880
Get some water!

63
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Water.

64
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,200
I found it, I found it.

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
San Xing, calm down.

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
-The water's here.
-Pour it in!

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,840
You brought wine instead of
water when raiding a tomb?

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
Are you out of your mind?

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Water.

70
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,480
Where can I find water?

71
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,080
Give it to me!

72
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
I'll deal with you later!

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
You brat.

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,400
What should I do?

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Are you crazy?

76
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
It's out, it's out.

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,600
The fire's out.

78
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,520
Ghost whistling in a Whistle Coffin.

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,720
It's ominous.

80
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
You set it on fire,
and then peed on it.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
You're now officially its enemy.

82
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
San Xing, please don't scare me.

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Demons and zombies
are just creepy bluffs.

84
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,160
This is nothing but
a coffin with a funny design.

85
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,680
Maybe the tomb owner was an artist.

86
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
He designed the coffin
like this on purpose.

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,800
Never mind.

88
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
What's done is done anyway.

89
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,320
But nothing happened.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe it's an empty coffin.

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,440
Consider yourself lucky.

92
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,600
San Xing,

93
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,720
isn't that gross?

94
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,200
You want to talk
about hygiene in a tomb?

95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
Just go home then.

96
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
What did you feel?

97
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
A ring!

98
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
It's a jade weight on its tongue.

99
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,880
-It won't burn easily!
-Really?

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,720
Take it out then!

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,640
Come on.

102
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,560
Take it, quick.

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh no, it's a trap!

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,760
Stay there, Xie Lian Huan!

105
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,960
Don't you move!

106
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll take a look.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Don't go anywhere.
Stay there.

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,280
San Xing, come back
as soon as you can!

109
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
What trap is this?

110
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,680
How can it still
move with all this rust?

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
Lian Huan.

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Lian Huan!

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Lian Huan!

114
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,000
Lian Huan.

115
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
Lian Huan, Lian Huan!

116
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,840
Lian Huan, Lian Huan!

117
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,520
Come out,

118
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
Show yourself if you dare!

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,240
Come out!

120
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Come out!

121
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,560
That wretch!

122
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,560
That wretch!

123
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Darn it!

124
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm not afraid!

125
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
Either live free or die hard.

126
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm not afraid to die at all!

127
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
There's not enough
oxygen till we resurface.

128
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
But my stamina is better than yours.

129
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
Maybe I can get out alive.

130
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,400
As soon as I get out of here,

131
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll send people for you right away.

132
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,400
But if I fail,

133
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,960
I'll stay in the water as fish food.

134
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
And you...

135
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
You can rest in the tomb.

136
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,920
Wait for me.

137
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
I swam in the dark ocean.

138
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,840
I kept swimming upward.

139
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,440
Just as I got out of the tomb,

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
the oxygen ran out.

141
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,080
I thought that was the end of it.

142
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,080
I was going to die.

143
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,160
And at that moment,

144
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I saw a lot of ancient corpses...

145
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,840
passing before me.

146
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
As they were very near to me,

147
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,840
I saw that the corpses were...

148
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
mannequins made of bamboo.

149
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,200
They were coated with plaster,

150
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
and there was air within.

151
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,600
So,

152
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
I poked a hole...

153
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,560
and inhaled the oxygen.

154
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,280
I kept inhaling and inhaling...

155
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,240
until I managed to swim out of it.

156
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,280
I was thinking to myself,

157
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,080
who was it...

158
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,400
who was it that wanted me dead.

159
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,520
Under that circumstance,

160
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
other than your aunt,

161
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,960
I believed no one else.

162
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
What happened after that?

163
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,200
Well,

164
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
after that,

165
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
we found...

166
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,040
the body of Xie Lian Huan on the reef.

167
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Maybe,

168
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,400
he wouldn't have died...

169
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,920
if you had rescued him right away.

170
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
What are you talking about?

171
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Rescue him?

172
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,400
I was barely alive!

173
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
Tell me, how could I save him?

174
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,360
Tell me!

175
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,800
All right,

176
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
I was the one who caused his death,

177
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,480
happy now?

178
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Uncle San Xing,

179
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,680
can you remember...

180
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
who attacked you?

181
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,760
Could it be Little Master?

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,360
Pardon me?

183
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,560
Little Master,

184
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
Kylin Zhang.

185
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Uncle San Xing,

186
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
look at this.

187
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,160
Didn't he go down the
underwater tomb with you?

188
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,880
Well, this guy.

189
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,320
He hasn't aged at all.

190
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,120
According to him,

191
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,120
he passed out in the underwater tomb.

192
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
And lost his memory afterward.

193
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Something happened to his body too.

194
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,320
Until recently,

195
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,720
he recalled part of...

196
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
his memory in the underwater tomb.

197
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,160
Did he tell you the
whereabouts of Wen Jin?

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,640
All you care about is Aunt Wen Jin!

199
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
He only mentioned...

200
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
that he passed out in a passage...

201
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,280
with a group of archaeologists.

202
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Then he woke up in a hospital.

203
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,760
Nobody was beside him.

204
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
As for how he got out,

205
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,720
or reached the shore,

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,920
he remembered nothing of those.

207
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
It can't be him.

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
He's stronger than me,

209
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
he would've been
able to kill me easily.

210
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,840
Shouldn't be him.

211
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,720
That makes sense.

212
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,480
It's still the same,

213
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,760
I suspect everyone...

214
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
except Wen Jin.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
I believe no one else.

216
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,760
Uncle San Xing,

217
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,480
according to Little Master,

218
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,560
you imitated a woman combing hair...

219
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,240
in front of the monument...

220
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,840
in attempt to unlock Qimen Dunjia.

221
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Is that true?

222
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,440
What?

223
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Me?

224
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,240
Imitating a woman?

225
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,600
How's that possible?

226
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,520
Xie Zi,

227
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,800
whenever you keep a straight face,

228
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
you'll look fierce.

229
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,920
I suppose your follower...

230
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,840
must have been
scared off by you.

231
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,680
He doesn't want his
followers to be nervous,

232
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,920
so he always wears
soft colors like pink,

233
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,880
claiming that it's about psychology.

234
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,080
To me, it's not very effective.

235
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,320
Those who are in charge...

236
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,520
need to be tough.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,280
You should learn a thing
or two from Xiao Hua.

238
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
He cultivated this
toughness since young.

239
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
I couldn't do it.

240
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm just a little
gold fish by your side.

241
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,720
My mission is to blow bubbles
and make you happy!

242
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,000
How many times did I tell you?

243
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,040
Your brain is like
the gold fish indeed,

244
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
you forget everything
I tell you in a blink.

245
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,880
Granny,

246
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,800
we've gained a lot while overseas.

247
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,960
Right?

248
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,200
Right.

249
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,560
Granny,

250
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,520
we've brought back the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

251
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,240
Please take a look.

252
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,520
Is this the one from
the underwater tomb?

253
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,560
Yes.

254
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,778
When Gou Wu Ye brought
along Uncle San Xing...

255
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:16,720
to apologize at our home,

256
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,160
this is what they offered.

257
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,520
Gou Wu Ye...

258
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,320
is best at these tricks.

259
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
Back then,

260
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,320
he brought his son along...

261
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,600
and got on his knees right away.

262
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,680
That attitude was sincere.

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,080
But what's the use of that?

264
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,080
It's been a long time ever since,

265
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,040
and there's still no leads on...

266
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,240
your aunt's whereabouts!

267
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
At least we found the copper fish.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
Isn't this a lead?

269
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,640
Furthermore,

270
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Wu Xie knows something
about the underwater tomb too.

271
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,000
If we work together,

272
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,800
eventually we'll have a clue.

273
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,480
Silly girl.

274
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,040
Not all mysteries have an answer.

275
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
And the answers
are not always the truth.

276
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,360
You all...

277
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,520
are young,

278
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
hopeful,

279
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760
and ambitious.

280
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can be persistent.

281
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
If not, you'll become like me,

282
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,440
I'm already one foot in the grave.

283
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm no use to anybody.

284
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
That's nonsense, granny.

285
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,560
How can someone as
beautiful as you ever age?

286
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,680
Enough with your flattery.

287
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,400
Just go ahead with the investigation.

288
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,480
However,

289
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,592
you have to keep your
distance with Wu family,

290
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,200
don't get too close with them.

291
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,080
One more thing,

292
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,560
don't endanger yourself,

293
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,640
are you clear?

294
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
Xie Zi,

295
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,320
I'm old.

296
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm... really old.

297
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm worried that someday,

298
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
my granddaughter...

299
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
My granddaughter...

300
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,560
Granny Huo,

301
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,280
rest assured.

302
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,960
I'll do my very best.

303
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,880
No,

304
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,200
he's lying.

305
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,720
Little Master?

306
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Back then,

307
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,440
I was following them.

308
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,000
But it was too foggy,

309
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,880
I couldn't see what
they were doing at all!

310
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,480
But Little Master had
no reason to lie to me.

311
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
However,

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,640
I was discussing something with Fatty.

313
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
Little Master didn't actually see you.

314
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,760
He merely heard it from Huo Ling.

315
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
It was also Huo Ling
who shouted out your name.

316
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,920
In that case,

317
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,680
either there really was a
person who looked like you,

318
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,760
if not,

319
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
then Huo Ling must be...

320
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,680
What's that?

321
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
What about her?

322
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,320
It was so foggy,

323
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
anyone could look like me.

324
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,920
Why would she call my name?

325
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,200
So you also think
that it's her problem?

326
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,760
My nephew,

327
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
for all the teachings I've given you,

328
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,760
what do you think is
the worst in the world?

329
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,160
It's people's hearts.

330
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,720
You might think you've been
through thick and thin together.

331
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,360
Nonsense!

332
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
Little Master has a lot of secrets.

333
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't see through
them even until now.

334
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Uncle San Xing,

335
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,000
Little Master really has
no reason to lie to me.

336
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,520
Are you trying to imply that...

337
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm lying to you,

338
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,280
aren't you?

339
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,840
Look at me,

340
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm going to ask you again.

341
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,480
Am I the one who's lying to you?

342
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,280
Uncle San Xing,

343
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,080
I really thought the person
in the photo was you.

344
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,520
But Xiao Hua told me
that he's Xie Lian Huan.

345
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,440
You look just like
Xie Lian Huan, don't you?

346
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,400
They must've thought Xie Lian Huan
was you due to the dim lighting.

347
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
Isn't that right?

348
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,240
No.

349
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,920
At that time,

350
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,560
Xie Lian Huan had already died!

351
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,280
If that's the case,

352
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,040
you still think that...

353
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,800
the problem lies in Huo Ling?

354
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,840
But she went missing too after that.

355
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,080
And Huo family couldn't find her
after searching for so long.

356
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,840
That is why, dear nephew.

357
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,080
This will only
cause more confusion...

358
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
the more you think about it.

359
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,400
Moreover,

360
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
you look clever,

361
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,160
but you're naive.

362
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,160
You believe anything that anyone says.

363
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,720
All right,

364
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
even if I wanted to
prepare a back up plan...

365
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,600
and made you the scapegoat,

366
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,000
would that work?

367
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,760
What's the use of that?

368
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,920
Uncle San Xing,

369
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
making me a scapegoat?

370
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,160
That's just appalling.

371
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,960
I'm your nephew after all.

372
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,240
Me? A scapegoat?

373
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,320
Please,

374
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
just don't cause me any trouble.

375
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,120
It's been a while now,

376
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
it's time for you to leave.

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,760
How can you treat me like that?

378
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,680
What do you mean?

379
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Do I need to prepare dinner for you?

380
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,280
Or let you smash
another bowl of mine?

381
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,800
Isn't our relationship...

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,360
more valuable than these bowls?

383
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,280
Well said, very well!

384
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
Give me that porcelain vase.

385
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,000
I exchanged that with my own money.

386
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,760
I'll re-sell it for you.

387
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,200
Uncle San Xing,

388
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,364
I can't do that.

389
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:18,400
It needs to belong to the country.

390
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
You can visit the museum
if you want to see it.

391
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Why would Wu family...

392
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,360
raise a failure like you?

393
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,160
Uncle San Xing,

394
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
you must live long enough.

395
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
If not,

396
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,360
you ought to raise some cousins now.

397
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,920
You better not leave me...

398
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,520
with all your treasures.

399
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,160
If you give them to me,

400
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,600
I'll submit them all to the country!

401
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
What did you say?

402
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,720
Submit them to the country.

403
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,200
It hurts!

404
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,920
It hurts!

405
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,000
You're even thinking of...

406
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,280
getting my treasures now!

407
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,240
That's not it!

408
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm telling you.

409
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,640
If I die,

410
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,600
I'd rather spend all the money,

411
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
even break all my treasures...

412
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
-than give them to you!
-All right.

413
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,840
Scram!

414
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,680
You rascal.

415
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,840
Go up!

416
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,520
Why are you crouching?

417
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,280
Get under cover!

418
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,040
You scared the crap out of me!

419
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,360
No more hide-and-seek?
Finally showing up, I see.

420
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,760
That's quick.

421
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I have an uncle, you see.

422
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh no,

423
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,800
you really donated it?

424
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,880
Look at your stubbornness!

425
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,440
You're really patriotic, aren't you?

426
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,440
If you put that porcelain vase here,

427
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,600
the price would at least double.

428
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,200
Oh my.

429
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,120
My interest...

430
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,680
is not on these relics.

431
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,000
On the contrary,

432
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,480
I like studying the story behind them.

433
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
Did you have a good
talk with your uncle?

434
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,360
It's like I was in "Rashomon".

435
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,160
There are Tiananmen, Di'anmen,

436
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,480
Chaoyangmen and Guanganmen.

437
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,920
What's that Rashomon?

438
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
What my uncle told me...

439
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,560
and what Qiu De Kao said...

440
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
contradict each other.

441
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,600
Qiu De Kao said...

442
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,800
Uncle San Xing led him
into the blood zombie tomb.

443
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,640
But Uncle San Xing said...

444
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,720
it was Xie Lian Huan
who led Qiu De Kao there.

445
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,040
Qiu De Kao said...

446
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,760
he let Uncle San Xing
sneak into the archeology team.

447
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,600
While Xie Lian Huan
was already on the team.

448
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
But Uncle San Xing said...

449
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,760
Xie Lian Huan asked for
his help to join the team.

450
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,360
And,

451
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,360
about the death of Xie Lian Huan,

452
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,880
this is what my uncle said.

453
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,920
He followed Xie Lian Huan
to the underwater tomb...

454
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,440
and was attacked by a mystery man.

455
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,840
All of their oxygen
in the tanks were released.

456
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,000
Xie Lian Huan was
injured and passed out,

457
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,240
and was left underwater.

458
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
My uncle swam with his life...

459
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,640
and finally made it out alive.

460
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,800
But when he was about to rescue
Xie Lian Huan the next day,

461
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,560
Xie Lian Huan was...

462
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,560
found dead on the shore.

463
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,880
Who do you think is telling the truth?

464
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Emotionally speaking,

465
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,600
I would believe my uncle.

466
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,880
That means you
don't really believe him.

467
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,680
There's one more thing.

468
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,480
I think that...

469
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,680
the Xie Lian Huan
described by my uncle...

470
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,800
is an ambitious but mediocre man...

471
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,360
who aims only on petty profits.

472
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
But this isn't like
the Xie family I know.

473
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,160
Bear in mind...

474
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,800
that if Xie Lian Huan
didn't die back then,

475
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,120
he'd have been the
master of Xie family now.

476
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,600
But...

477
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,400
based on what your uncle said,

478
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,800
we can't prove if
he's telling the truth.

479
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,680
The man is dead,

480
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,680
isn't it?

481
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,840
The dead can't give an alibi!

482
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,600
Not necessarily.

483
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,880
If we insist on
investigating Xie Lian Huan,

484
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,360
there are still many who know him.

485
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,520
If you want to keep on investigating,

486
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,920
the relationship with
your uncle will be gone.

487
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,480
You're only getting
yourself into trouble.

488
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,400
What's this for?

489
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,400
Why must you investigate
something that's so long in the past?

490
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm not trying to ruin my
relationship with my uncle.

491
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,840
I just need to know...

492
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,160
the relationship between
him and Qiu De Kao.

493
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
While we were overseas,

494
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,520
Qiu De Kao told me
the incident of my grandpa...

495
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,920
in the blood zombie tomb.

496
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,040
But if those details...

497
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,680
weren't told by
my grandfather himself,

498
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,200
he wouldn't have known that.

499
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,640
But as far as I know of grandpa,

500
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,960
he wouldn't have told Qiu De Kao this
secret even if they were good friends.

501
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,640
Because...

502
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,920
that was a trauma to my grandpa.

503
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,320
He didn't even tell me that.

504
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,520
So, you're jealous because
he told a stranger instead of you?

505
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,280
Yes.

506
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Yes, that's it.

507
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,600
That's not it,

508
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,680
I'm serious.

509
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,400
There's another possibility,

510
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,080
my uncle was drunk and...

511
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,240
told him everything about my grandpa.

512
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,400
This seems like something he
would do when he was young.

513
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
But if that's true,

514
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,920
that would prove...

515
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,400
Qiu De Kao was indeed
working with my uncle,

516
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,600
not Xie Lian Huan.

517
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,040
That explains...

518
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,640
why Uncle San Xing...

519
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
met Qiu De Kao overseas.

520
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,000
It's because after all these years
they still kept in touch,

521
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,240
and still work together.

522
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm starting to feel bad
for Xie Lian Huan now.

523
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,840
Died so young and with no body found.

524
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,920
And still lives to be
your uncle's scapegoat.

525
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,360
Then again, your uncle
might be telling the truth too.

526
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,240
In that case,

527
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,160
I would feel bad for your uncle.

528
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,840
Can I smack you?

529
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,120
What's the matter?

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,800
Fatty,

531
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,120
I came all the way to
have a discussion with you.

532
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,880
But you've said
every single contradiction.

533
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,120
What do you want me to say then?

534
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,800
Uncle San Xing is innocent?

535
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,120
All right then!

536
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
He's innocent,

537
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120
he didn't do it.

538
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Are you happy now?

539
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,880
All right.

540
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,880
I was wrong,

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,080
I won't cause trouble anymore, okay?

542
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,680
Cool it down.

543
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,480
Do you still have anymore
of this self-heating hotpot?

544
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,480
Get me one.

545
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,800
I can't share this with you.

546
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,400
I stock these up for myself.

547
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,600
I'll share with you
when new stock arrives.

548
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,320
I'll treat you to
a Beijing specialty.

549
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Come! Let's drink!

550
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,440
You barely drank any!

551
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,520
Come on, catch up!

552
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,880
Who's that, we're closed!

553
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,400
Is Fatty Wang there?

554
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,680
Fatty Wang of Panjiayuan.

555
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,800
Yes, I am!
Come earlier tomorrow!

556
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,920
Fatty Wang,

557
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,680
I'm a friend of Guo Guo's.

558
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,000
He introduced me here.

559
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,520
He told me that you buy in
things at a competitive price.

560
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,560
-Guo Guo?
-And this is urgent.

561
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,560
Go ahead without me.

562
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,040
Fatty Wang.

563
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,760
What's the matter? Tell me.

564
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,280
Fatty Wang.

565
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,720
Come on in!

566
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,000
Close the door!

567
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,000
Mr. Naive,

568
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,920
get ready to feast your eyes on this.

569
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
Bronze bell!

570
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,120
Whose is this?

571
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Come on,

572
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,080
sit down!

573
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,280
-Sit down!
-Hello there.

574
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
-Sit.
-Thank you, Fatty Wang!

575
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,000
It's all right.

576
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Have you eaten?

577
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
Have some if you haven't eaten!

578
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Thank you, Fatty Wang.

579
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
What's your name?

580
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,640
My surname is Ma,

581
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,080
you can call me Mr. Ma.

582
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,480
Mr. Ma? Sounds like you're our elder!

583
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,320
Ma will do!

584
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,560
Well,

585
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,480
you said Guo Guo introduced you here?

586
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Guo Guo is my best friend.

587
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,960
Since you were introduced by him,

588
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,680
I will treat this seriously.

589
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,600
I'll buy this.

590
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,360
But I have to know its origin.

591
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,520
Well,

592
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
there's not much to talk about.

593
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
I retrieved this from a village.

594
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,040
There's no point brushing me off.

595
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,760
Fatty Wang,

596
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,560
this is definitely valuable!

597
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,920
Indeed it is.

598
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,360
But I have to know where you got it.

599
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,600
First, I have to know its origin.

600
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
With that in mind,

601
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,147
I'd be able to source
a buyer for you...

602
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,400
if I can't keep it myself.

603
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,200
Secondly,

604
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
my friend here likes stories.

605
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Here,

606
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
this is my offer.

607
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,400
-Really?
-Let's begin!

608
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,840
All right,

609
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,960
I'll start then.

610
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,480
It's quite straightforward.

611
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,400
Three years ago,

612
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,520
I went to Qinling Mountains...

613
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,960
with one of my distant relatives.

614
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,080
We didn't have much
experience on field survival.

615
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,280
And it was our first time
trekking the natural forest.

616
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,080
In the end,

617
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,560
we walked in this remote forest...

618
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,840
for more than 10 days.

619
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,000
We were pretty lost,

620
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
and we had almost
finished our rations.

621
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,360
I was about to break down.

622
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,040
As we kept on walking,

623
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,280
we reached a cliff.

624
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,360
Fatty Wang,

625
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm not exaggerating it,

626
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,400
but the cliff was incredibly high!

627
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
It was more than 100 meters!

628
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,320
Lao Yang,

629
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,800
slow down.

630
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,720
Wait...

631
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,600
it doesn't feel right in here.

632
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
It gives me the creeps.

633
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,960
Could this place be haunted?

634
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,960
Stop scaring yourself!

635
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,920
There are only...

636
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,360
owls and monkeys here.

637
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,640
Nothing else.

638
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,040
Let...

639
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,560
let's head back now,

640
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,640
shall we?

641
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,880
There...

642
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,600
There's something up ahead.

643
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,960
Let's go!

644
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
Tell us a story, not make one up.

645
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,080
Fatty Wang,

646
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm telling the truth.

647
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,120
Back at the cliff,

648
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,640
we also found...

649
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,440
a sacrificial altar from
God knows which era.

650
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,680
There was a bronze tree on the altar.

651
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,840
The tree seemed like...

652
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,960
it grew out from underground.

653
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,600
I still feel creepy thinking back now.

654
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,720
I looked downward through the gap.

655
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,480
I swear I couldn't see the end of it.

656
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,320
As for the bronze tree,

657
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,360
it was roughly...

658
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,520
a 100 meters high.

659
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,400
Lao Yang,

660
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
look at the shape of these stones.

661
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,120
and...

662
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
the design of that flag.

663
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This looks like...

664
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
Tibetan style.

665
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,080
That's nonsense.

666
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,520
We're on Qinling Mountains,

667
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,440
why would there be
Tibetan-styled items?

668
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,960
Look at this,

669
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,280
the arrangement of the stones.

670
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,240
This must've been a stone gate.

671
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Stone gate?

672
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,280
There must be something good in there.

673
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Maybe.

674
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,080
Lao Yang.

675
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,880
What are these?

676
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,080
Lao Yang,

677
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,120
there's nothing good here.

678
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,480
Lao Yang.

679
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,120
What are you looking at?

680
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
This might be...

681
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,400
the sacrificial totem
of a minority tribe.

682
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,240
Sacrifice?

683
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,400
Then there must be sacrificial tools!

684
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,360
That's a big altar!

685
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,920
Lao Yang,

686
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
we've found ourselves a fortune!

687
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh.

688
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,280
Come on, let's have a look around!

689
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,120
We've found real treasures this time!

690
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,400
The treasures must be down there!

691
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,520
These past few days of
sufferings are worth it now!

692
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,400
Lao Yang,

693
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,720
why did you touch that stupid tree?

694
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,800
Don't leave me digging alone!

695
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,440
We're going to split the gains,

696
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,840
help me out here!

697
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,880
Okay.

698
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,880
Lao Yang!

699
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
Get over here, quick!

700
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,000
Told you there'd be good things.

701
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,880
There must be more down there.

702
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,680
Let's dig them out!

703
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,520
There's one more. Hurry.

704
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,920
Must be more of where that came from!

705
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,320
Lao Yang, be quick.

706
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm exhausted.

707
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,600
What's this?

708
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,520
Lao Yang,

709
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,240
what did you hit just now?

710
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,720
What's with the smoke?

711
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,720
I'll take a look inside.

712
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,800
No, stay put!

713
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,760
Do you want to die?

714
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,240
It might be dangerous in there!

715
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,240
I'll take a look inside.

716
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,200
Stay there!

717
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,400
The treasures we've gotten
are enough to last us a lifetime!

718
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,400
We must go now!

719
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,600
You're not leaving, are you?

720
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,000
I can't stop you then.

721
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Don't say that I
didn't have your back.

722
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,480
I'm going now!
