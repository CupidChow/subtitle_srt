"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,959
"Episode 29"

3
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:08,523
Master Wu.

4
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:10,763
Isn't it better...

5
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:12,523
to nip them in the bud?

6
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:15,763
I'm afraid troubles will follow suit.

7
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:19,843
How's about the Xies?

8
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:21,923
The Xies are having
some problems lately.

9
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:23,483
They were set up by Lao Kang,

10
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:24,766
six of their men died.

11
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:28,806
Lao Kang is a good-for-nothing.

12
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,126
He thought there was
no one left in the Xies.

13
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:35,886
After Xie Jiu Ye passed away,

14
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,246
many thought that
the Xies have fallen.

15
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:42,126
Even though Xie Yu Chen is around,

16
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,326
some idiots look down on him.

17
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:51,646
Why do you think Lao Kang
would even dare to do this?

18
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:55,206
It would seem like he's stepping
on the face of the Xies,

19
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:56,686
but in fact,

20
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,126
he's  looking down on the Mystic Nine.

21
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,246
Luckily, Xie Yu Chen wouldn't
stand such humiliation.

22
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:04,406
You're right.

23
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,646
Master Hua is not a normal Joe.

24
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:08,846
He's executed the traitors,

25
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,726
taken over Lao Kang's business,

26
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,926
and now Lao Kang is gone.

27
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:14,886
If we were in the old days,

28
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,966
his decisiveness and  boldness...

29
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,886
would make him a hero.

30
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,486
Did his works end clean?

31
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:25,566
Very clean.

32
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:27,526
Good then.

33
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,246
Take a rest, Master Wu.

34
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,486
I'll bring you some snacks.

35
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:32,366
Okay.

36
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:44,886
"Library"

37
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:10,566
Fatty.

38
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:14,446
Fatty.

39
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,606
Who was that?

40
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,646
Who was that?

41
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:30,606
I think...

42
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,166
you better sleep at home.

43
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,526
I'll just stay here with you.

44
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,646
I could help if they ambush you again.

45
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:43,366
Just look at your injured arm.

46
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:46,686
You should rest and
let your body recover.

47
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:50,126
I'm still able to protect
and shield you from danger.

48
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:52,846
Cut the crap.
How's your investigation?

49
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:54,726
-Look.
-No, I won't.

50
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,126
Tell me the story.

51
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,366
Young Yang Guo.

52
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,006
The map on the silk book.

53
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,606
I'm almost done investigating on them.

54
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:06,406
They should be in Guizhou.

55
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,126
Why do I have a feeling
that I've seen the place...

56
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:16,766
-recorded in my grandpa's notebook.
-So...

57
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,646
it's a site that Wu Ye had been to?

58
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:22,486
Not necessarily.

59
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:25,486
There are some tombs
recorded in his notebook.

60
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,126
But he knew about most
of them through others,

61
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:29,966
he's never been there before.

62
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:34,966
These old folks leave
us with no choice.

63
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:38,566
They are always ahead of us
to arrive at any valuable sites.

64
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,686
Leaving me with only their leftovers.

65
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,046
Whatever it is,

66
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:45,486
we'll have to retrieve
my grandpa's notebook now.

67
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:46,806
I'll look into it.

68
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:47,686
Let's do it.

69
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:48,486
It's so boring here.

70
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,606
Let's go.

71
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:11,766
Master Hua.

72
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,806
You've spent a day here at our place.

73
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,606
You haven't been
eating and drinking.

74
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:18,006
I'm telling you the truth.
Master Wu isn't in.

75
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,606
I don't know where he went.

76
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,046
Neither do I know when he'll be back.

77
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,646
Please come back again another day.

78
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:24,326
Master Wu San Xing.

79
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,046
You must be Yu Chen.

80
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:34,006
It's been a long time.

81
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,046
You're all grown up.

82
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:41,766
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

83
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:46,126
Did Jiu Ye give it away
before he passed on?

84
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,326
I've been with my grandpa
up till the day he died.

85
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,566
To train me,

86
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,726
he'd tell me all about the Xies.

87
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,566
Snake Eye Copper Fish
was a remnant of my uncle.

88
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,726
Grandpa would never
give it away to anybody.

89
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:02,766
Let alone hiding it from me.

90
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,406
Uncle San Xing.

91
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:14,806
What happened back then?

92
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,606
Since you grandpa...

93
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,486
didn't tell you about this,

94
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:24,806
that simply means that
he didn't want you to know.

95
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,406
I won't tell you either.

96
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:33,006
Grandpa told me...

97
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:37,366
that you went to discover the
underwater tomb at Paracel Islands.

98
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,806
The morning before
you entered the tomb,

99
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,246
you found out that
my uncle was missing.

100
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,966
So you looked around
for him on the sea surface.

101
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,206
And you finally found
his body lying on a rock.

102
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:51,246
And he was holding the
Snake Eye Copper Fish in his hand.

103
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,046
Yes. That's what happened.

104
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,406
Grandpa said that...

105
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:00,726
you assumed there
was a reason for him...

106
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,526
to sneak in alone the night before.

107
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:07,726
And the copper fish was
taken by him from the tomb.

108
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:16,046
But even to the day he died,
grandpa never did understand...

109
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,166
why my uncle chose to do that.

110
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,406
What was it...

111
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:24,966
or who was it...

112
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,046
that caused his death?

113
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,566
There are many things...

114
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:40,606
I myself couldn't comprehend.

115
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:42,966
You're right.

116
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,406
I was close to Lian Huan.

117
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,246
And we knew
each other's ability very well.

118
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,446
It's impossible for him
to enter the tomb without telling me.

119
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,086
There is too much
mystery behind this.

120
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,566
The entire archeology
team has gone missing.

121
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:04,686
Your uncle's body is
nowhere to be found.

122
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,006
But there's one thing I'll tell you.

123
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:09,806
Your uncle is dead!

124
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,046
He's dead!

125
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,766
And this is the truth!

126
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,126
Am I not sad?

127
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:17,646
Am I not?

128
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,526
It stings my heart like a
needle every single day.

129
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,526
Shall there be any clues, I promise...

130
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,446
you’ll be the first to know.

131
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:37,366
Uncle San Xing.

132
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:43,126
Time is the best tool
in covering up the truth.

133
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,126
The longer it takes,

134
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,326
the lesser the clues remain.

135
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:53,126
I'll find out the truth
before the clues fade completely.

136
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:03,846
You've grown up.

137
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,886
You're of the same age as Wu Xie.

138
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:15,526
Looking at you makes
me thinking of Wu Xie.

139
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,206
Wu Xie?

140
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:26,646
What's he doing?

141
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:29,566
Just like his father.

142
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:31,206
Brilliant brain.

143
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:32,686
Overthinking.

144
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:34,286
Worries about everything.

145
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:36,366
I even think that...

146
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,806
he's never taken off the red scarf
he wore in primary school.

147
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,566
Good for him.

148
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,286
He doesn't have to be like us.

149
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:05,606
Not bad.

150
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,286
The analysis report from
the headquarters is out.

151
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:26,726
Send it to me.

152
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:42,686
The report is the same as
the information given by Wu Xie.

153
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:48,886
He's researching on something
related to Northern Wei dynasty.

154
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:52,926
It's similar to the information
in the silk book.

155
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,366
According to both our inference
and the records on silk book,

156
00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:02,046
Mute Riders, the treasure troop,
might just be in a huge cave.

157
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:06,086
No wonder Qiu De Kao regards
the Wus with special respect.

158
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,526
Wu Xie.

159
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:12,206
A family outcast like him...

160
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,046
has gotten hold of so much secrets.

161
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,326
Interesting.

162
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,126
Actually,

163
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:21,926
the simplest way...

164
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,046
is to invite Wu Xie over.

165
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:28,806
Invite?

166
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:32,926
You mean...

167
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,046
to get him abducted, right?

168
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,806
The car accident...

169
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,286
has attracted attention
from the police.

170
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,766
We better be careful.

171
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,046
We're not trying to
get Wu Xie killed after all.

172
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:52,206
We want his secrets.

173
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,566
Listen up people.

174
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,526
We have to get
ahead of them this time.

175
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:03,406
This is a battle with time.

176
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,926
What's with all this
rubbish in the house?

177
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,766
The valuables aren't here.

178
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,886
You're still awake, grandaunt?

179
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,166
How can I sleep when
there's a rat in my house?

180
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,046
Keep a cat then.

181
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,006
Tortoiseshell cat is great.

182
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,606
I'll send you two right away.

183
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:33,926
Uncle Si.

184
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:36,486
You're leaving just like that?

185
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:38,886
Why don't you put down
the things in your pocket?

186
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,886
It's none of your business.

187
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:43,206
Fine.

188
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,886
Since I'm here today,

189
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:48,566
let's sort things out.

190
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:53,886
Grandaunt.

191
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:58,206
I was just a kid when my parents died.

192
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,166
My dad handed me to you.

193
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,726
You were very busy.

194
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:04,126
Though I did have everything
to eat and wear,

195
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,766
frankly,

196
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,126
you've wasted no energy on me.

197
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,566
-Right?
-Really?

198
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,766
You are such an ingrate.

199
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:18,006
You think you'd have grown so big
if I didn't care of you?

200
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:20,646
Did you grow by consuming air?

201
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:22,046
What do you think?

202
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,486
You are the head of the household.

203
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:25,486
There are so many
people to take care of,

204
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,726
there must be something you've missed.

205
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:31,206
You have no idea about
how I suffered as a kid.

206
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,766
Of course I do.

207
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,806
You are such a cunning kid.

208
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,806
I know every bad thing you've done.

209
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:42,886
Fine.

210
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,846
My parents' heirloom is with you.

211
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:50,086
I don't see you handing it back
as I came to age.

212
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:52,366
Why are you so impatient?

213
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:53,526
Uncle Si.

214
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,406
I've seen our family accounts.

215
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,886
Uncle Liu committed fraud in business,

216
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:00,006
and granny compensated
with a huge sum.

217
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,526
There's no heirloom left.

218
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:04,126
Why wasn't I informed about
such a serious incident?

219
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,166
Anyway, I didn't come
to rake up the past.

220
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:08,406
But,

221
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,286
the company that I've poured in
so much heart and soul for...

222
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:13,966
should be mine.

223
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,446
What do you mean?

224
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:17,246
Divide the family property.

225
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:19,166
That's what I meant.

226
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,326
I couldn't care less
about people's business.

227
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,886
But the house and
company should be mine.

228
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:28,206
You've no problem with that, right?

229
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,726
They were always yours.

230
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,966
And the antiques of the Huos.

231
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,046
They are passed down by our ancestors.

232
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:38,806
You should give me my portion.

233
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:39,846
Si.

234
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,326
Not only are you greedy,

235
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,846
you're stupid too.

236
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:48,606
You can say whatever you like.

237
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,406
I appreciate you, grandaunt.

238
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,926
But what is mine is mine.

239
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,966
You can't claim them as yours
just because you're the elder.

240
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,286
I think that's what
everybody thinks too.

241
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:03,966
Everybody?

242
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:08,686
You mean to gather
all the Huos together...

243
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:10,126
to split the property?

244
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,726
It should've long been done.

245
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:18,046
We're too modern to play
your ancestral altar game.

246
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:22,046
Even if you were to
play the ancestor card,

247
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,366
you don't have to do it like the Huos.

248
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:26,886
Xiu Xiu.

249
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,526
What do you think?

250
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:29,966
Grandaunt.

251
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:33,526
Why are you asking
a little girl like her?

252
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:34,886
She knows nothing.

253
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,726
It's your call.

254
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,446
The Huos can never
be separated, granny.

255
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,206
Well said.

256
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:44,806
My thoughts exactly.

257
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,926
You know what, Si?

258
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:52,006
I'll give you a last chance.

259
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,926
I hope that you'll know what to do.

260
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:57,446
Fine.

261
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,486
I've said what I wanted to say.

262
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:04,086
Do ponder.

263
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,526
I'm used to going to court.

264
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:09,846
I know the suffer.

265
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:13,126
But I don't wish all of you
the same suffer, you see?

266
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,126
Think about it.

267
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:32,726
Granny.

268
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,366
Why has Uncle Si changed so much?

269
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,886
I've been careless.

270
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:41,606
This is what you can do.

271
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:46,006
Find out who he's been
mixing with all these years.

272
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:49,086
Especially around the
time we bought the land.

273
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:51,246
You mean someone out
there is manipulating him?

274
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:54,206
The predator will prey on the weak.

275
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,446
If a flower has rotten,

276
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,726
aren't you throwing it away?

277
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,806
It'll wither sooner or later.

278
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,246
Jiahai 317.

279
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,646
What have you been
looking for all day?

280
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,446
Guizhou. Fog Village?

281
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,486
Is the village on the map of China?

282
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,446
If it was,

283
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,166
anyone could access it, no?

284
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:59,166
Didn't you say that your grandpa
had never been to the tomb?

285
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,046
Is the map reliable then?

286
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,766
We'll find out once we get there.

287
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,806
"Wu Residence"

288
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:16,606
No, wait.

289
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,046
Young Master Wu.

290
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:20,006
The things you requested...

291
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:22,606
You're going to a tomb again?

292
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:24,006
Yes.

293
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:26,846
I told you that I've
found a Han's tomb.

294
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,326
Wait.

295
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,286
I thought you said
it was a Chu's tomb?

296
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:33,686
Yes, that's right.
I mentioned about Chu's tomb.

297
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,206
But it could be Chu's or Han's.

298
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,286
We'll find out when we get there.

299
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,206
Didn't Master Wu forbid you
from going to tombs?

300
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:41,246
Why don't you listen to him?

301
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:43,766
My grandpa wanted him to get married,

302
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:44,606
did he do that?

303
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,006
He's still single now.

304
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,406
Right.

305
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,206
Please remind my uncle on my behalf...

306
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:50,726
that he's not young anymore.

307
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:51,566
He should stop fooling.

308
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:52,766
He has not much time left.

309
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:58,846
I'll leave this matter to
both of you to settle.

310
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:00,166
I'm out of this.

311
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:01,686
Pick up, Uncle San Xing.

312
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:03,206
Uncle San Xing?

313
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:04,886
He...

314
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,606
Master Wu is not with me.

315
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,326
I'll tell him when I see him, okay?

316
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:11,686
Fine.

317
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:12,566
Pan Zi.

318
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:15,686
-Please get the things I need ready.
-Shall I do that?

319
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:21,006
Okay. No problem. I'll do it.

320
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,806
You nearly sold me out, Master Wu.

321
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,566
You have to take care of it.

322
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:28,486
Can't you see?

323
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:29,806
How?

324
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:30,766
He's a grown-up.

325
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:33,086
I can't tie him down at home, can I?

326
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,566
Shall I prepare his things then?

327
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:37,566
Yes.

328
00:22:38,486 --> 00:22:40,886
We'll charge 20 percent
higher than normal price.

329
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,926
I only accept cash.

330
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,806
That IOU...

331
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:47,566
no!

332
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:48,326
It's on you.

333
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,566
He may be my nephew,

Hello, Xiu Xiu.

Nothing particular.

359
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,806
I'm just checking on the houses you
observed on my behalf two days ago.

360
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:34,846
I've chosen a few good ones.

361
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,486
When will you be free?

362
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:40,526
Let's have a look
at the houses together.

363
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:42,646
Sure.

364
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,326
I'll go with you
when you feel like going.

365
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:49,606
I haven't decided yet.

366
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:51,606
It's okay.

367
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:52,766

369
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:58,406
Is there anything you want to tell me?

370
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:02,606
No.

371
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,166
I missed you.

372
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:07,526
I just wanted you
to go look at houses with me.

373
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:08,526
Nothing else.

374
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:11,806
Right.

375
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,926
Back when you...

376
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,686
I... nothing.

377
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:23,886
I just really admire you sometimes.

378
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:25,566
Xiu Xiu.

379
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:27,326
Madam asks to see you.

380
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:29,926
My granny wants to see me.

381
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:31,806
-Let's talk later.
-Okay.

382
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:33,366
Bye.

383
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,606
Find out what's happened
to the Huos recently.

384
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,766
The Huos are kind of
in trouble recently.

385
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,486
But I don't think it's
something disastrous.

386
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,526
You wanted to see me, granny?

387
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:53,286
It looks like...

388
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:55,526
you've grown up.

389
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:57,366
Just now...

390
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,766
you wanted to tell Xie Zi something,

391
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,326
but you stopped yourself.

392
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:04,406
I'm not a child anymore, granny.

393
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:07,326
No, you aren't. You're an adult now.

394
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,326
Right?

395
00:27:08,406 --> 00:27:09,966
Then you should do things
like an adult.

396
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:11,206
Yes.

397
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,886
But you're still inexperienced.

398
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,526
Look.

399
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:18,646
You are always around Xie Zi.

400
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,846
And you refuse
to be with us old folks.

401
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:25,086
This has been
happening for generations.

402
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:26,646
But there's one thing.

403
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:29,206
You should know...

404
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:32,046
Xie Zi is an outsider.

405
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:35,126
He can never interfere with
what happens in the Huos.

406
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,006
I...

407
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,166
I know.

408
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,886
Good.

409
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:46,566
In the future,

410
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:48,246
shall there be...

411
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,126
any misfortune,

412
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:56,926
you have to uphold the good
name of the Huos no matter what.

413
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,046
I understand.

414
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:02,006
The Huo Lao Si from Changsha...

415
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:03,766
wanted to get a hold of the land.

416
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,766
But out of nowhere,

417
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,966
a competitor barged in in between.

418
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,886
Hence, they started to duel.

419
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:13,366
I heard that Si even
went to Beijing for this,

420
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,646
but Madam Huo refused to help him.

421
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,046
Thereafter Huo Lao Si
found someone with money,

422
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,206
and got hold of the land.

423
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:20,486
But no one expected...

424
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,286
an accident to happen
during demolition.

425
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:23,806
People died.

426
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:25,846
It became serious.

427
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,166
His subordinate is now arrested,

428
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,846
and he's being sued.

429
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:33,886
Huo Lao Si.

430
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,086
I heard Madam Huo is
casting off her nephew.

431
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:39,926
Or he won't have
been arrested so soon.

432
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,846
I heard the proceedings
of the case was swift

433
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:44,126
Also,

434
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:45,406
he is guilty of one more thing.

435
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:46,966
Bribery.

436
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:53,286
I heard that his men is looking for
people all over the world to help him.

437
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,646
No wonder Xiu Xiu
was so hesitant to speak.

438
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:02,006
Do we help them?

439
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:05,526
If we help Huo Lao Si,

440
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:06,766
we'll offend Madam Huo.

441
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:10,646
I think this is absurd too.

442
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:11,966
However,

443
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,006
Ms. Huo must be dying to help him.

444
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,486
The old skin has to be shed,

445
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,046
before the new one can come.

446
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:27,766
Madam Huo has such strong character.

447
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,486
If Xiu Xiu passed the test,

448
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:33,006
she'll benefit from it.

449
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:36,886
Get in the car, quick!

450
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:38,646
Let's go!

451
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,206
You know what, that Pan Zi...

452
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:24,566
must've charged you an arm and a leg
because of your uncle.

453
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:26,566
He thinks that...

454
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:28,806
if you don't have money
for the equipment,

455
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,446
you'll give up exploring the tomb.

456
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:32,966
The expedition...

457
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:35,366
is costing burning a hole.

458
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,206
Obviously, you keep spending for it,

459
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:39,286
but you never take
anything from the tombs.

460
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,046
It's no wonder you're broke.

461
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:45,326
You're right.

462
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,046
I'm really broke.

463
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,166
Or I wouldn't sell my car...

464
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:51,806
for this second-hand Jinbei.

465
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:54,886
It's worth it anyway.

466
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:56,806
We have Wu Xie's notebook after all.

467
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,086
By the look of this car,

468
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:03,166
it definitely isn't a second-hand.

469
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,366
Mr. Naive,

470
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:08,406
can't you think things
the other way round?

471
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,966
Let's not take anything
huge from the tomb,

472
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:14,126
some little burial treasure will do.

473
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,686
You don't have to worry,

474
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,206
-I'll...
-I'm calling.

475
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:19,286
We're not discussing this.

476
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,406
You never change.

477
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:27,486
All right.

478
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,046
Let's stop somewhere ahead.

479
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:31,806
My butt is numb from sitting.

480
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:33,566
I'll be disabled if I stay seated.

481
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,526

Aunty, let's eat mushrooms.

-Shall we?
-These go well with chicken stew.

488

These are vegetables
we planted on our own.

489

Okay.

492

I'll prepare the food now.

493
00:32:55,086 --> 00:32:56,046
Okay. Off you go.

494
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,166
I've paid too much for this.

495
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:03,486

496
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:04,886
sorry for the bother.

497
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:06,606
Not at all.

498
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:08,246
Can I ask you a question?

499
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,646
Is Fog Village far from here?

500
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:13,966
Fog Village.

501
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:15,766
Never heard of it.

502
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,246
Fog Village.

503
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:20,566
Fog as in misty, smoky fog.

504
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:22,006
And there's a lake beside the village.

505
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:24,646
Lake.

506
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,926
There are lakes at both
banksides of Xiaokang Village.

507
00:33:29,726 --> 00:33:31,166
Which one are you referring to?

508
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,606
There's a mountain beside the lake.

509
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:36,086
A mountain?

510
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:38,846
I think I remember.

511
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:43,406
You may not get anything
out of anybody else.

512
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:45,846
The Fog Village you meant...

513
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:49,606
existed while Yuan Shi Kai was king.

514
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,806
It's disappeared now.

515
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:53,326
Disappeared?

516
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,646
The villagers vanished.

517
00:33:57,926 --> 00:33:59,126
Did they move away?

518
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,326
Move away?

519
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,566
Tell us then, sir.

520
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:10,126
The year when
Yuan Shi Kai passed away,

521
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,126
it was chaos everywhere.

522
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:16,446
The people suffered so much.

523
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:19,766
All the refugees, bandits, soldiers,

524
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,086
and the Caucasians,

525
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:23,646
they left the people
no way to survive.

526
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:25,806
I've strayed too far.

527
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:33,406
The only business
that was doing well in town...

528
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:35,286
was the pawn shop.

529
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:37,966
In the pawn shop,

530
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:41,086
you could only see people
pawning their possessions...

531
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,686
but never redeeming them.

532
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,646
In the Fog Village you mentioned,

533
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,646
there was a man called Zhang Da Zhu.

534
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,166
He'd pawned a few
good items in the shop.

535
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:51,606
How good were they?

536
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,366
Don't ask me.

537
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:54,566
I've never seen them.

538
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,966
I heard there was a Red Iron Pass.

539
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:01,286
You know what it is?

540
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:07,166
A death-exemption plate.

541
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,006
Zhang Da Zhu didn't
know about all these.

542
00:35:10,126 --> 00:35:11,766
He pawned it for a few silver dollars.

543
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,246
And he was happy about it.

544
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:18,246
But I heard that in the village
that Zhang Da Zhu lived,

545
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:20,486
someone discovered an ancient tomb.

546
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:24,566
It was a tomb of an officer
from an unknown dynasty.

547
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:29,566
The tomb was filled
with valuable stuff.

548
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,886
Every single one of them.

549
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:36,406
But the village is
hidden in the mountain.

550
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:39,326
It's faraway and the route is rough.

551
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:44,566
Even the vendors goes there
only once in 3 months.

552
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,966
The last time the vendor went there,

553
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,046
they were shocked to death.

554
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:54,406
Brother.

555
00:35:54,646 --> 00:35:55,486
Where are all of the people?

556
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:58,766
Perhaps they are all at the
tomb looking for treasures.

557
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:00,686
But the children and elders
should be home, right?

558
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,486
They probably went together.

559
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:05,406
But they can't have all gone.

560
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:06,686
It's totally deserted here.

561
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:14,486
Uncle Lao Mo!

562
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,206
Nobody’s in.

563
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:20,366
Da Zhu!

564
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:21,966
Brother Da Zhu!

565
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,766
Brother Da Zhu!

566
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:27,126
Aunt San!

567
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:28,526
Xiao Hua!

568
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:29,966
Xiao Bao!

569
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:31,206
Xiao Bao!

570
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:35,246
Uncle Lao Mo!

571
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:39,566
Xiao Fang!

572
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:41,326
Anybody here?

573
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:42,766
Answer us if you're in.

574
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:43,646
Da Zhu!

575
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,046
Xiao Bao!

576
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:46,686
Uncle Lao Mo!

577
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:48,286
Here you go, sir.

578
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,486
Have a taste of Beijing wine.

579
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:51,686
Sir.

580
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:52,926
Please carry on.

581
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:58,806
All the people and animals
in the village had vanished.

582
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,846
Not a soul in sight.

583
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:03,726
-There was a rumor that...
-Here you go.

584
00:37:04,366 --> 00:37:08,766
the villagers were
engulfed by the ancient tomb.

585
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:10,206
Engulfed by the tomb?

586
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,486
Well, rumor has it.

587
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:17,046
Perhaps while they were
taking stuff from the tomb,

588
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:18,486
they fell into the trap.

589
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,766
So they took all the chickens,
ducks and geese to the tomb?

590
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,686
Chicken is here.

591
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,966
Stewed chicken with mushroom.

592
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:27,886
Nonsense.

593
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:29,606
That's not what happened.

594
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:33,446
I heard that a bandit
who passed by...

595
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:35,686
killed them all.

596
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:37,246
Is that so, aunty?

597
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:38,966
My only question is...

598
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,886
why is the chicken
separated from the mushroom?

599
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,286
Isn't it stewed chicken with mushroom?

600
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:44,166
The mushrooms should be in here,

601
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,366
they must be cooked together.

602
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,806
I've forgotten about that.

603
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:49,406
It's fine. Please sit.

604
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:50,206
I was just kidding.

605
00:37:51,446 --> 00:37:54,286
Some said they were
abducted by the army,

606
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:55,606
and joined the defense force.

607
00:37:56,566 --> 00:38:01,046
There was a General named Zhang
who passed by the village right then.

608
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,486
I still remember him.

609
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:04,486
His name is Zhang Gao Yuan.

610
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:09,046
How old were you then?

611
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:11,206
You weren't even born yet.

612
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,366
Look at how vividly
you remember the story.

613
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:15,766
I wasn't.

614
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:16,686
But you were.

615
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:20,406
Didn't you hear the
story from your dad too?

616
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:21,926
Seriously.

617
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:22,686
Sir,

618
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:26,446
has anyone been to Fog Village so far?

619
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,366
Yes.

620
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:31,006
They went for the ancient tomb.

621
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,686
But none of them ever found it.

622
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,246
Then, some said
the tomb was a made-up story.

623
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:39,686
No such thing as an ancient tomb.

624
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,366
Moreover,

625
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:45,486
nobody's ever seen
anyone from the village...

626
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:47,766
selling treasures
from the ancient tomb.

627
00:38:48,686 --> 00:38:49,486
I say,

628
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,726
it's just a made-up story.

629
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:54,526
The villagers were
all killed by a bandit.

630
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,126
Nobody has stepped foot there since.

631
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:00,686
I bet now...

632
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,686
it must be covered in thick woods.

633
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:04,966
Nothing left.

634
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:06,486
Here, cheers.

635
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:07,646
Come, cheers.

636
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:10,966
You are such good story tellers.

637
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:12,246
We enjoyed it very much.

638
00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:58,766
The mushrooms were delicious.

639
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:01,126
Mr. Naive.

640
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,326
How true do you think the story was?

641
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:09,926
At least we know that
Fog Village is now abandoned.

642
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:13,206
And the villagers had
discovered the ancient tomb.

643
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:15,406
That's strange then.

644
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:18,286
There must be more than
100 people in the village.

645
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:21,006
How could they vanish just like that?

646
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,766
Nothing was impossible
back in that era.

647
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:27,926
Homicide by an army or a bandit.

648
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:30,366
People's lives...

649
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:32,126
were like weeds.

650
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:36,406
Since the entire
village was slaughtered,

651
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,326
would the tomb be emptied too?

652
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:39,726
Great.

653
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:41,326
My efforts are wasted yet again.

654
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:43,766
Now,

655
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,286
I'm more concerned about
the Red Iron Pass.

656
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,006
According to history,

657
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:51,366
the pass originated
from Liu Bang, Emperor Gaozu.

658
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:56,286
But back then the pass
couldn't exempt any death sentence.

659
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:58,326
It was just an honorary item.

660
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,766
If the pass was really
found in the tomb.

661
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,246
The tomb just might be a Han's.

662
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,446
I wonder...

663
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,246
which awesome dude from
the Han dynasty sleeps in it.
