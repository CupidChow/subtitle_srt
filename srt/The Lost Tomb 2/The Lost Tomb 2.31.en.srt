"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,780
"Episode 31"

3
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,571
Fatty!

4
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,066
Wake up, Fatty!

5
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,390
You leave me no choice.

6
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:18,378
Fatty!

7
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:20,358
You're awake.

8
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:21,593
Why are you here?

9
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,034
How did I poop...

10
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,535
my way here?

11
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,285
Be gentle.

12
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't worry. It's nothing serious.

13
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,260
They excavated me at my most...

14
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:38,333
vulnerable moment.

15
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,596
How dare you excavate
the Excavators of the '90s.

16
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,609
Take me upfront...

17
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,398
if you dare.

18
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,063
How did you get here?

19
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,154
Well...

20
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,418
I guess I pooped too hard...

21
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,520
and teleported here.

22
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,901
I remember now.

23
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,123
Mr. Naive.

24
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,556
Go on!

25
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:58,935
What happened?

26
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,580
Come on.

27
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,864
Stop with the suspense.

28
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,380
I was struck from behind.

29
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:12,068
After I fell, I heard people talking.

30
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:13,797
They sounded familiar.

31
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:15,658
Guess who?

32
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
It was Pan Zi's voice.

33
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,260
In his exact words he says,

34
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:22,556
"Master Wu,

35
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,220
should I end him?"

36
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,300
That's all I remember.

37
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:29,993
You mean...

38
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,873
Uncle San Xing and Pan Zi
knocked you out?

39
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Well, it was Pan Zi's voice,

40
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,222
and his words.

41
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,642
I bet your uncle...

42
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,240
was standing right by him.

43
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,021
Fatty.

44
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:49,626
I believe what you say is true,

45
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:50,985
but you were knocked out.

46
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,691
Maybe it was a hallucination?

47
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,760
I know what you're saying.

48
00:05:55,097 --> 00:05:56,813
Whoever it was,

49
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:57,999
he's a psycho.

50
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,100
He could've carved me up,

51
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,860
threw me into wilderness,
and left me to die.

52
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:04,157
Why put me in a tomb?

53
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:05,781
He even got me a coffin.

54
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:08,057
Is he worried I'd be a wandering soul,

55
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,460
that he even settled my funeral?

56
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,832
When I was looking for you last night,

57
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,019
a mannequin tried to kill me.

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
All of our equipment is gone.

59
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:21,777
Is it the same one who ambushed us,

60
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,379
and stole your notebook?

61
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,120
Someone who's after the tombs.

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
Maybe.

63
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,019
What a shameless coward.

64
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:31,337
He doesn't fight me upfront,

65
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,820
but sent a mannequin instead!

66
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
Mannequin?

67
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,211
Mannequin...

68
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,460
I got it.

69
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,346
There's someone in our field,

70
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,420
called the Puppeteer﻿.

71
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,345
His ancestors used to
send away the dead.

72
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,893
He uses atypical methods...

73
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,840
to control corpses.

74
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,437
As the business died down,

75
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,018
he created an army of puppets.

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,980
Rumor has it, the best one made...

77
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:56,545
could steal things
kept on your body...

78
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,578
without you noticing.

79
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:02,018
Some say the puppets
are made from corpses,

80
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,595
some say they are marionettes,

81
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:04,758
or even machines.

82
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,182
You name it.

83
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:08,771
From what you say,

84
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,832
it sounds very plausible.

85
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,300
Besides, this Puppeteer...

86
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,135
is involved in
that foreign antique dealer.

87
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:20,244
Foreign antique dealer.

88
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,900
Mr. Naive.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,140
Besides Mr. Qiu De Kao,

90
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
who else is there?

91
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:31,118
His shadow lingers.

92
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,286
I have only one question.

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,057
Is the coffin really just...

94
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,310
an economical grave for me?

95
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,206
Where's the body?

96
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,940
Was there no one before me?

97
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:52,438
It feels too clean in here.

98
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,800
You're right.

99
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:56,426
It's too clean.

100
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:00,874
Is this your bag?

101
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,507
Done.

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,569
We'll take it.

103
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,920
Torchlight.

104
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,100
Energy bar.

105
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
Pocketknife.

106
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:16,914
Lighter.

107
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,960
Mr. Naive.

108
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:20,836
Going into the kill zone...

109
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,407
with just these?

110
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,440
His head must be filled with crap.

111
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,860
Fatty.

112
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,436
Don't joke about the dead.

113
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:38,814
Mr. Naive.

114
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,180
We've put so much effort
to find this tomb.

115
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,174
Now that we've gotten in so easily,

116
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,441
it feels too surreal.

117
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,074
Surreal is fine.

118
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,354
Someone's been here before us,

119
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,394
we have to be alert.

120
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:56,994
It's like PUBG,

121
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,674
someone's always ahead of us...

122
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,900
in escaping the blue zone.

123
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,894
Once they enter the kill zone,

124
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:04,934
they better pray!

125
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,029
I hope the one in front
is your Uncle San Xing.

126
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,288
At the very least,

127
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,132
your uncle can't hurt...

128
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,778
his own nephew.

129
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:20,484
Here, use this.

130
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:21,384
The big one.

131
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:28,879
This hasn't been entered.

132
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,242
Someone must've been in already.

133
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:31,752
But the door's shut now.

134
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:32,792
If we're going in,

135
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:33,943
we best be prepared.

136
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,460
Let's go.

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,420
Count off.

138
00:10:59,099 --> 00:10:59,512
One.

139
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,862
They are all dead.

140
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,492
Who's the enemy?

141
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:11,172
Since we stepped in Fog Village,

142
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,230
they've been targeting us.

143
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,880
I see someone...

144
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,060
doesn't want us following
Wu Xie to the tomb.

145
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,120
Could it be...

146
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,235
Wu Xie's friend?

147
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,186
His friend...

148
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,528
would never be so criminal.

149
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,260
This attack looks familiar.

150
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:27,997
Come with me.

151
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,169
Ning,

152
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,260
someone's at your nine o'clock.

153
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,141
Ning has skills.

154
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,879
But her men are rubbish.

155
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,621
That party has two pros.

156
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,941
Their sneak attack seems fluid.

157
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:29,432
Ning is doomed.

158
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,980
If she dies,

159
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,840
Qiu De Kao would've lost a limb.

160
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,964
Who are these people?

161
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,024
We should've questioned the fellow...

162
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,020
who ambushed Fatty Wang yesterday.

163
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,108
Let them play.

164
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,052
The more intense the better.

165
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,431
Let's make bulletproof vests...

166
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,512
for ourselves.

167
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,440
Did you hear the gunshots?

168
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:02,700
They were point shots.

169
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:03,786
not sighted fire.

170
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,820
They may have come across something.

171
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:09,192
It could be a human battle.

172
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,101
It's quiet now.

173
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:14,943
Let's go in.

174
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:15,903
No.

175
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,183
What if they are there...

176
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:18,463
waiting for us?

177
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,023
Why are you scared?

178
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:20,982
We've fought...

179
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,424
sea monkeys and zombie creatures.

180
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,619
Humans are nothing.

181
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:24,897
We can take them down.

182
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,025
Humans are what scare me.

183
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,572
Then what?

184
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,890
We go back?

185
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,412
I don't know the way back.

186
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,030
I do.

187
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,970
Go straight.

188
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,090
Turn left at the exit.

189
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,980
There'll be a corridor,

190
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:36,925
where I fell...

191
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,780
from a hole above.

192
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:39,411
Read my lips,

193
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,371
"scram".

194
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,251
Careful.

195
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,331
3P backpack?

196
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,291
There's good stuff in here.

197
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,300
Even a satellite phone.

198
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,791
But no gun.

199
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:54,867
Fatty.

200
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,140
They aren't on the same team,

201
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,589
and were all killed by bullets.

202
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,380
Didn't I tell you?

203
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:02,834
A human battle.

204
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,985
A crossfire between
two treasure hunting teams.

205
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:06,891
What?

206
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,840
What?

207
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,131
I thought you had no gun?

208
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:11,271
Don't worry.

209
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:12,711
I'll be your bulletproof vest,

210
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,371
you stay behind me...

211
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,991
and gun down whoever comes.

212
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:15,886
Besides,

213
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:16,909
a scaredy-cat like you...

214
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,181
should be hiding at home.

215
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,037
Don't you know the sniper's shot?

216
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,331
How many people...

217
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,836
do you think is in the chamber?

218
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,695
Who cares?

219
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:33,248
Three of them are already dead.

220
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,285
What I mean is...

221
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,071
this chamber looks average.

222
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,965
If I'm not mistaken,

223
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,371
that should be the main chamber.

224
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,030
They should all be inside.

225
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,191
Let's wait for the final strike.

226
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:45,370
Let them...

227
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:46,391
have a good fight,

228
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,451
and shoot it out.

229
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,460
If we're lucky, there'll be...

230
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,180
only one team left when we go in.

231
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,611
Get it? Let's go.

232
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,400
What?

233
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,923
Where's everyone?

234
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,420
Who knows?

235
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,091
Here.

236
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,200
Fatty, look.

237
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,160
There's another body up there.

238
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,764
They were probably killed...

239
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:53,482
while trying to ambush.

240
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,351
Went for wool and came home shorn.

241
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,311
Suckers.

242
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,380
It's empty.

243
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,015
Look here.

244
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,561
With this big guy,

245
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,568
we'll be fine.

246
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,744
So long as we watch out,

247
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,798
and no one attacks from behind,

248
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:27,898
we'll be fine.

249
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:29,805
The one who ambushed them...

250
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:31,272
must still be alive.

251
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:33,177
If they aren't...

252
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,060
in this chamber,

253
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:35,366
there must be...

254
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:36,896
a secret chamber.

255
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:39,165
I like secret chambers.

256
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:41,805
Treasures are where
the secret chamber is.

257
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,980
Fatty.

258
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,093
We missed out something.

259
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,713
We followed the Mute Riders map here.

260
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:56,193
That means,

261
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,960
they were here a thousand years ago.

262
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,820
But,

263
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,499
there's no trace...

264
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,726
of them at all.

265
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,160
Maybe they were hunted down halfway,

266
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,940
so they never made it.

267
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:11,818
Now, you're being naive.

268
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:04,247
Fatty.

269
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,740
What now?

270
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:09,873
When they were in the crossfire,

271
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,252
when did they find time...

272
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,693
to light the torches?

273
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,127
There must be a reason...

274
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,001
for the placement...

275
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:18,786
of these torches and mirrors.

276
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Fatty, look!

277
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,760
There's a secret chamber after all.

278
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,880
Xiao Hua?

279
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,060
Gotcha.

280
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,461
Watch out!

281
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,440
Save the explosives.

282
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:01,481
Swordsman.

283
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:03,772
When Sam is done with Ning,

284
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:04,761
get him to gather.

285
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,940
Sam.

286
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,037
Sam?

287
00:24:10,077 --> 00:24:10,897
Respond.

288
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,897
No reply.

289
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:13,504
Boss,

290
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
we underestimated the enemies.

291
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:16,713
Both Jie Yu Hua and Ning...

292
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,975
were stronger than expected.

293
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,857
These kids are trying to
blast the tomb to ashes!

294
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,780
Burying us alive!

295
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,298
How many bullets left?

296
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,280
None.

297
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:42,257
You?

298
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,157
One.

299
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,460
The bag.

300
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,508
Give me a clip.

301
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:35,957
How many of them left?

302
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:37,177
I think, three.

303
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,010
The puppeteer causes most damage.

304
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,961
He's top priority.

305
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,820
That guy is sneaky.

306
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:43,054
He hides behind his puppets,

307
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:44,337
and plants bombs on them.

308
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:12,197
"Woodcutter and His Fox Wife"?

309
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,140
Move!

310
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,560
He's fast! Is he on hot wheels?

311
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,160
Who's that?

312
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:34,466
A puppet.

313
00:26:35,197 --> 00:26:36,197
Probably scouting.

314
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,857
My first time seeing
a geek out exploring.

315
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,100
Cool toy.

316
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:43,473
I've only had toy cars as a kid,

317
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,898
never a toy mannequin.

318
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,696
Do you think...

319
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:49,749
Did he see us?

320
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:51,498
Not sure.

321
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,560
It'd be a pity to die abruptly.

322
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:58,622
What are you doing?

323
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:02,496
-Cover me!
-Fatty!

324
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:03,657
Fatty!

325
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:09,663
Who are you?

326
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,491
One of you!

327
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,480
Xiao Hua?

328
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:14,245
Go.

329
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:15,237
There's a bomb on him.

330
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,277
Fatty, let's go.

331
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:17,921
Why?

332
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,460
Why not kill it?

333
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:53,335
"Woodcutter and His Fox Wife".

334
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:54,635
Only you'd think of that.

335
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:55,355
Why?

336
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,020
You could tell it was me?

337
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,144
Why are you running?

338
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,093
Why not just kill it?

339
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:05,315
Who's behind this?

340
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,335
No clue.

341
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:07,607
He's peculiar.

342
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,300
He kills on sight.

343
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:10,915
Leaves no chance to negotiate.

344
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,320
On our way here,

345
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,980
he catapulted massive rocks...

346
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,106
and killed one of us.

347
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,500
After we came in,

348
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,108
they killed a few more of my brothers.

349
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:19,875
That puppet you saw...

350
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,237
is their walking bomb.

351
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:22,275
Killer explosives.

352
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,860
That means,

353
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:25,395
the explosion before...

354
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,255
Yes.

355
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:28,035
Which is why...

356
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:30,015
we are avoiding contact.

357
00:28:33,687 --> 00:28:34,727
The explosion before...

358
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,340
had shaken the chamber.

359
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,215
If another one explodes,

360
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,800
we may not get out...

361
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:40,995
even if we beat it.

362
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,009
There'd be no exit.

363
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:45,584
Xiao Hua,

364
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,195
was it you...

365
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:49,777
who dumped me in the coffin?

366
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,063
Is that your fetish?

367
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,460
There's plenty of coffins here.

368
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:53,521
Take your pick.

369
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,945
Wait.

370
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,441
Just now...

371
00:28:58,808 --> 00:28:59,848
did any of you see...

372
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:02,237
a very strange coffin?

373
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:03,976
Why didn't I see it?

374
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,296
That's your fetish too?

375
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,200
No.

376
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:09,033
Look around.

377
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,620
The coffins here...

378
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:12,206
are made of wood,

379
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,560
and unpainted.

380
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,140
When I walked in,

381
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:16,596
I saw a coffin...

382
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,740
that wasn't only painted,

383
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,229
but larger than the rest.

384
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:20,696
Perhaps, we might...

385
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,760
find some clues within.

386
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,580
Go. Follow me.

387
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,520
Wait.

388
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
The ones inside are Republicans.

389
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,086
There's no way.

390
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,480
This tomb is from the Han dynasty.

391
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,000
How are people...

392
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,508
from a later era buried here?

393
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,160
Fatty.

394
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,531
They were shot.

395
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,500
Forget the fact that they are
from 2,000 years ago,

396
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:11,266
they even have firearms
of a different age.

397
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,380
Those in the coffins...

398
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,350
can't all be Republicans.

399
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,240
Perhaps,

400
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:16,716
there's another possibility.

401
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:19,242
They could be villagers
from Fog Village.

402
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,620
It's possible.

403
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,354
If the villagers were massacred,

404
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:26,462
why did the killer...

405
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,050
kill them, then placed them...

406
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:30,125
in the coffins of this ancient tomb.

407
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:31,686
That's extra effort.

408
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:33,302
There's another possibility.

409
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,260
They weren't together
in the first place.

410
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,518
Over there.

411
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,840
This is the one.

412
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:06,086
Open it!

413
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm going to get you!

414
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:17,324
Fatty!

415
00:31:18,306 --> 00:31:18,977
Wu Xie!

416
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,340
Let me go first.

417
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:48,126
♪ Spring is here
with a window of green. ♪

418
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:54,126
♪ As the lady weaves
the mandarin duck by the window. ♪

419
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:59,266
♪ Suddenly, a ruthless club... ♪

420
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:01,166
Come on in.

421
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,500
Listen.

422
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,980
This is the "Golden Voice",

423
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,840
Zhou Xuan.

424
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:11,144
I'm sure you know.

425
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:15,826
It was popular throughout China.

426
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:19,957
Queen of the music world.

427
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:22,106
Granny.

428
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:24,046
Uncle Si's sentence
has been pronounced.

429
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:29,226
You don't have to tell me the verdict.

430
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:30,706
From today on,

431
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:34,729
he's as good as dead.

432
00:32:35,032 --> 00:32:36,052
Uncle Si was going on...

433
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,360
about taking the family down.

434
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,416
But he said nothing of the kind,

435
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:40,768
and confessed like a honest man.

436
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,920
You think he was being merciful?

437
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,682
I had someone speak to him.

438
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:49,296
About what he could do,

439
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,259
and what...

440
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,840
would cost him his life.

441
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,360
He was smart for once.

442
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:01,606
Granny.

443
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,020
I've found aunt's work archives.

444
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,820
Those archives are top secret.

445
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:08,915
I found them.

446
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,236
But the notes on them...

447
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:12,718
were tampered with.

448
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,740
Granny.

449
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:17,092
Was that you?

450
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:23,166
So what if it was?

451
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:26,539
Granny.

452
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,303
You saw those archives long ago,

453
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,060
why did you tamper them?

454
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,697
Granny, you...

455
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,520
never did want to...

456
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:37,293
find my aunt, did you?

457
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,226
Where's Fatty?

458
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,162
There must have...

459
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,306
been others in this tomb before us.

460
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,940
They even read foreign language?

461
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,386
Among Granduncle Er's remnants...

462
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:06,828
was a map of this place.

463
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,015
It was noted that...

464
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,930
this tomb was discovered...

465
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,860
during the Republican rule.

466
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,340
There are two floors here.

467
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,106
Looks like the second floor...

468
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:14,785
has been modified.

469
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,199
It wasn't just modified.

470
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:18,920
This whole tomb was cleaned.

471
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,386
That's why it's so clean.

472
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,529
Not bad.

473
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:23,673
You're sharp.

474
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,160
Who is this man?

475
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,260
Don't know.

476
00:37:31,194 --> 00:37:32,146
I only know it was...

477
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,980
a lieutenant named Zhang
who modified it.

478
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,958
Who this person is,

479
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:37,366
I have no clue.

480
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:38,986
Why's a lieutenant not at war...

481
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,880
but in a tomb?

482
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:43,446
He turned this place into
an underground command center.

483
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,810
When we were fighting crime,

484
00:38:14,898 --> 00:38:16,018
you'd never believe this,

485
00:38:16,262 --> 00:38:17,682
Lao Chen was amazing!

486
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,980
He took down all the bandits...

487
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,860
by himself!

488
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:21,551
For real?

489
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,592
No way!

490
00:38:22,963 --> 00:38:23,983
Everyone saw.

491
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,060
He said he'll buy drinks for everyone!

492
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:27,417
That's nice!

493
00:38:27,983 --> 00:38:29,739
We need reinforcement
in these two spots.

494
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,720
That small wine shop...

495
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,380
How was the deployment?

496
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:32,795
was it called the Zuixiang Restaurant?

497
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:33,815
Yes! Their food is good.

498
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,517
You know...

499
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,740
their yellow wine is top notch!

500
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,375
Seriously though,

501
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,220
let's ask Lao Wang to join too.

502
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:41,415
Sounds good.

503
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,646
It's been a while since.

504
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,420
Exactly, let's hang out soon.

505
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:46,535
I'll say,

506
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:48,395
we've been so busy lately,

507
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:49,111
with so much work.

508
00:38:49,146 --> 00:38:50,486
More reason why we should go out.

509
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,040
What do you do?

510
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:53,147
Reporting, Chief!

511
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:54,158
I was ordered here...

512
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,532
as part of Lieutenant Zhang's troop!

513
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:57,515
Lieutenant Zhang Bu Xun?

514
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:58,307
Yes!

515
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:00,216
Aren't you lucky?

516
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:02,306
Lieutenant Zhang treats his men well!

517
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,720
This must be his diary.

518
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:19,199
But there’s no time to read now.

519
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,280
Let's find Fatty.

520
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,020
Sure.

521
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:24,199
Let's go.

522
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,840
By the looks of it,

523
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
this should be the soldier quarters.

524
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,660
But why did they convert a tomb...

525
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:52,886
into living quarters?

526
00:39:53,806 --> 00:39:54,174
Go.

527
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,540
Let's check the main chamber.

528
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:57,801
Let's.

529
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,380
Mirrors.

530
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:07,331
There's likely...

531
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,970
only one way out of here.

532
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,760
So the people who ambushed us,

533
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:11,886
must still be nearby.

534
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,920
Stay on high alert.
