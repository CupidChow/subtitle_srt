"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,820
"Episode 30"

3
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:10,284
Here.

4
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,992
Give me one too.

5
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:14,991
Master Hua,

6
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:15,784
let's join the others.

7
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,159
Master Hua is being serious.

8
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,451
I wonder what he's doing
with the phone.

9
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:24,493
What else,

10
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,493
flirting with girls.

11
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:26,159
Precisely.

12
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,201
Get me a bottle.

13
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,034
Do you still want it?

14
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:33,910
Give me one.

15
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,075
Come on, let's drink!

16
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:41,576
Come on, cheers!

17
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:42,826
Don't drink too much!

18
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,117
Or you'll end up like last time.

19
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,159
Get your groove on!

20
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,826
-You call that singing?
-All right!

21
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:00,951
That's something!

22
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,159
Let's dance!

23
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:05,493
Come on,

24
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,117
drink up!

25
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:10,493
Slow down!

26
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:14,174
Keep drinking!

27
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,409
Thirty degrees east.

28
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:09,701
Found it!

29
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:17,117
Let's go!

30
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:30,534
Look at that.

31
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,991
The lotus here
seems like they were planted.

32
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,367
Fog Village must be nearby.

33
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:12,992
Let's go.

34
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:14,991
Can't we rest for a while?

35
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,367
Hurry up.

36
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:18,743
We just need to cross the river.

37
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:19,784
Quick.

38
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:21,951
Move it.

39
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,784
Come on, let's go.

40
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:27,159
Don't you fool me.

41
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:28,367
Why don't you cross it first?

42
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,472
Didn't you say to
cross the river?

43
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:33,202
Go on!

44
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,367
The magnetic field is strange here.

45
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,991
Could there be another
bronze tree underneath?

46
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,034
You think they sprout everywhere?

47
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:01,284
It's so stuffy.

48
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:03,034
And I feel uneasy.

49
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,117
Indeed,

50
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,868
it does feel stuffy here.

51
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,493
The weather is about to change.

52
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,451
What's that smell?

53
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:18,951
There's something.

54
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:21,409
It's swamp.

55
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,701
This place is surrounded by mountains.

56
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,992
The land here is like a basin.

57
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,201
There are rivers, lakes, and swamps.

58
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,991
We're like pests,

59
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,159
we'll either be drowned
or suffocated here.

60
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,075
Just you wait.

61
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:37,701
Drink some water.

62
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:40,992
It's too bland.

63
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:03,951
Hold my hand.

64
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:06,367
Give me your hand!

65
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:12,242
You all right?

66
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:13,951
I'm fine.

67
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:27,992
There's a pit here too!

68
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,992
With stone!

69
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,034
It's about 5 meters wide.

70
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,284
Let's have a look around!

71
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:46,201
I found something!

72
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:48,951
Boss,

73
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:49,784
there's a pit.

74
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:51,576
Here too!

75
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:52,534
Here as well!

76
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,951
What's with all these pits here?

77
00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:56,367
Were they natural or man-made?

78
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,326
There are lots of rocks too.

79
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:00,534
Are these pits caused by the rocks?

80
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:01,826
They would be meteors then.

81
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,075
With this intensity,

82
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,576
when the meteors rain down,

83
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,034
people underneath would be crushed.

84
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:32,743
Surprisingly,

85
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,159
those catapults are still functional.

86
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,743
They seem to have been
repaired decades ago.

87
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,201
Some metal components...

88
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,576
are from the republic nation.

89
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:46,075
Republic nation?

90
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,784
Someone was here way earlier than us.

91
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:53,618
There are tomb guarding traps,

92
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:55,910
and swamp filled with miasma.

93
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,534
In ancient times,

94
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,493
this would've been highly advanced.

95
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,991
If the Fog Village is here,

96
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,493
the villagers must be the
descendants of tomb guardians.

97
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,242
It's been a long time,

98
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:08,034
the villagers wouldn't know
the secret of their ancestors.

99
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,991
Then let's try these traps out,

100
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:13,951
and see if they still work.

101
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,075
That's a loud thunder,

102
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:13,534
looks like it'll rain.

103
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,534
What's going on?

104
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:18,991
Maybe it's raining soon.

105
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:22,991
What do we do?

106
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:28,409
Run!

107
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,117
Quick, run!

108
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,910
What is this?

109
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,951
Hurry up!

110
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:01,826
It's thundering.

111
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:04,659
But there's no rain clouds.

112
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,201
A landslide?

113
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:07,951
We're not affected anyway.

114
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:08,784
Let's go.

115
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:21,451
They're lucky...

116
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:22,992
for not being smashed.

117
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,034
Let's go.

118
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:25,743
Let's get prepared...

119
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,493
to welcome our guests.

120
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:41,242
Well,

121
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,534
it's over, right?

122
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,409
How many of us are injured?

123
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:58,493
One dead, one severely injured.

124
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,075
Another two were slightly injured.

125
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:05,493
Xiao Zhu.

126
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:07,951
Let the two with minor injuries...

127
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,034
send out the severely wounded one.

128
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:10,534
For our friend who died,

129
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,868
dig out his body
and make a grave here.

130
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,242
When we're back,

131
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:15,576
we'll bring him home.

132
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:16,618
Got it.

133
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:23,743
This is my fault,

134
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:25,951
I should've sought the fortune teller.

135
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,534
The rocks...

136
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,868
were launched down from the mountains.

137
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:31,991
Launched?

138
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:33,242
Like a lever.

139
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:35,576
The rocks rolled down
from the mountain,

140
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,284
lifted by something,

141
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,659
and projected...

142
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:39,992
in a certain angle...

143
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,951
and landed around us.

144
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:43,868
Is there a trap somewhere?

145
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:44,991
Our location just now...

146
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,659
was a blind spot
to the mountain in front.

147
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,075
The place those rocks landed...

148
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,201
was obviously designed.

149
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,451
Do you mean that
someone set us up?

150
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:56,159
The rocks on a mountain...

151
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,576
isn't infinite.

152
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:00,951
And rocks don't just like that.

153
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,409
I assume...

154
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,576
someone must have seen us entering.

155
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,326
Hence, they triggered the traps.

156
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,951
Tomb guardians perhaps?

157
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,034
They might be tomb guardians,

158
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,659
or someone like us,

159
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,075
who came to explore.

160
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:22,826
There's a slope, watch out.

161
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:37,534
There sure are lots of mosquitoes.

162
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:40,201
Didn't you get bitten?

163
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,451
The Dragon's Blood
is effective indeed.

164
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,075
You're like a walking repellant.

165
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:51,910
Stop scratching,

166
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:52,991
it'll get infected.

167
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,659
It's itchy!

168
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:57,201
In that case.

169
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,618
What?

170
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,701
There's no need for that!

171
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,868
It's just a minor thing,
no need to bleed.

172
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,034
I have this.

173
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:09,701
My, my,

174
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,159
you had this all along?

175
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:17,951
Are you done?

176
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,409
Let me see.

177
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:22,242
It's all right.

178
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,201
All right?

179
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,326
This must be the Fog Village.

180
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,701
It's bleak.

181
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,784
The village is small to begin with.

182
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:10,951
The houses are scarce too.

183
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,242
To think they became so run down...

184
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,034
after all these years.

185
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,284
This isn't your home,

186
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,326
what's with the sentiment?

187
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,409
Let's look inside.

188
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,534
There's still water in the well.

189
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:07,618
This is a low-lying area.

190
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,117
The water resource should be abundant.

191
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:10,618
All right,

192
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,576
this seems like a decent place.

193
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,659
Let's take a break here.

194
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:15,534
It's getting late.

195
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:17,659
Let's go!

196
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,201
This house is slightly better...

197
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,242
than the others.

198
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,618
There's a doll here.

199
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,451
It seems that this family
had a baby before.

200
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:52,159
Go to sleep.

201
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,991
-My dear.
-Cut it out.

202
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:55,784
Let's take a look upstairs.

203
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,117
Master of the house,

204
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,075
we've surveyed the whole village.

205
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,117
This is the most decent place.

206
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:29,367
A beautiful place.

207
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,659
This house is great.

208
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,242
We just want to stay for a night.

209
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:34,618
Please excuse us.

210
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:37,868
Cut it out.

211
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:38,910
Stop fooling around.

212
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:39,826
Let's tidy up the place.

213
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:40,868
Are you going to sleep in the dust?

214
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,034
All right.

215
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:05,201
You do the cleaning,

216
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,576
I'll get water from the well.

217
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,075
If you don't want to clean,
just say it.

218
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:15,910
All right.

219
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:18,743
Why do you need a gun to get water?

220
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,951
I'm going to see if I can get...

221
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,451
some wild game or chicken to eat.

222
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:25,326
-That's a must.
-Unbelievable.

223
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,201
You're thinking of chicken
in this wilderness?

224
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:29,284
You can choose not to eat,

225
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,117
I'm not going to starve myself.

226
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:46,534
What now?

227
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,159
Well, I have been...

228
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,991
going to the toilet several times...

229
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,618
before you woke up.

230
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,826
For my stomachache.

231
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,618
What did you eat?

232
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:01,367
I'm not going to admit that
it was the mushroom I plucked myself.

233
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,242
I'll be back soon.

234
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,784
Dream on...

235
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:10,117
going on a hunt like this.

236
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,659
Mr. Naive.

237
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:29,992
Mr. Naive?

238
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:05,201
Fatty.

239
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,117
Fatty?

240
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,992
Fatty, why aren't you back yet?

241
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:19,826
Fatty.

242
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:21,784
Can you hear me?

243
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,534
Fatty.

244
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,743
Fatty!

245
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:43,743
The well is right here.

246
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,826
Where did he go to get water?

247
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:48,367
Fatty,

248
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,201
You went really far to poop.

249
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:55,159
Fatty!

250
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,868
I wonder where he went
to drop that bomb.

251
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:10,159
So unreliable.

252
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:11,992
Fatty,

253
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:13,493
come back soon, it's getting dark.

254
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:18,409
Was it Jie Yu Hua's people
who ambushed them?

255
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,034
Jie Yu Hua's people are still outside.

256
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:23,991
Couldn't be them.

257
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:26,159
Could it be Ning?

258
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,826
She was following Wu Xie before this.

259
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,075
And she vanished...

260
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,242
when we reached here.

261
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
When she saw what we did to Fatty,

262
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,242
she...

263
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:36,159
No, she won't.

264
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:37,743
This isn't her style.

265
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,367
There's another group of people.

266
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:47,534
This Fog Village...

267
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,826
is getting more lively.

268
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:51,992
Now that we're exposed,

269
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:53,242
while the opponent is hidden,

270
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,075
what shall we do?

271
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:59,201
The person is obviously
protecting Wu Xie.

272
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:00,868
If we keep our eyes on Wu Xie,

273
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:02,659
they will expose themselves.

274
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,242
As for Jie Yu Hua,

275
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,826
that gang is full of veterans.

276
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:11,117
We have to be more careful.

277
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,242
Roger that.

278
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,534
Do we go according to plan tonight?

279
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:16,618
No.

280
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,659
Let them find Wu Xie.

281
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:22,367
Anyone protecting Wu Xie...

282
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,326
will be our enemy.

283
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,034
Roger that.

284
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:56,992
Fatty.

285
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:58,951
Fatty?

286
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:06,409
Fatty.

287
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,992
Looks like the one
you're waiting for isn't coming.

288
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,117
Let's kill him.

289
00:28:57,992 --> 00:28:59,201
They might be here already.

290
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,451
Maybe they just evaded us.

291
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,784
Sounds formidable.

292
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:08,242
I got the bags.

293
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:10,868
Well done.

294
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:14,409
Didn't you get all of their gear?

295
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:15,743
I got all the bags.

296
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,075
Idiot!

297
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:06,284
Fatty!

298
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:09,159
Fatty!

299
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:23,743
Fatty.

300
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:02,992
Fatty!

301
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:07,075
Fatty!

302
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:11,868
This is the place.

303
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,618
This technique is ancient.

304
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,534
Should be from Warring States period.

305
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,910
But this stone stopper
should be from Ming dynasty.

306
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:19,991
Unless, this mechanism...

307
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,493
existed way before?

308
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:23,826
Or maybe this tomb...

309
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:27,242
had been modified too.
