"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,888
"Episode 22"

3
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,120
It's really a museum.

4
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
Which section are we in now?

5
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Stone figure section?

6
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Sculpture section?

7
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,720
Why are there so many stone figures?

8
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,760
For exhibition?

9
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,080
Here.

10
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,600
Give me your hand.

11
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Careful.

12
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
Are you all right, Lao Yang?

13
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm all right.

14
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Be careful.

15
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,400
This way.

16
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,000
What's going on there?

17
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
My torch! My torch is out!

18
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,040
Let down the rope now!

19
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Here.

20
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Lao Yang.

21
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,200
My torch is out!

22
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,240
How's the situation up there?

23
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,040
Here.

24
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,760
Please hurry!

25
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
Teacher Liang!

26
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,480
Do you see the rope?

27
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes, I see it!

28
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
The rope is secured up here!

29
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,400
Tie it around yourself!

30
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,200
Okay!

31
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,200
You can pull me up now!

32
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,760
Pull it now!

33
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm ready!

34
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
One, two, three.

35
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
One, two, three.

36
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Don't you let go!

37
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
Or I'm going to die!

38
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,000
What's wrong?

39
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
You scared me to death.

40
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
-Don't you let go!
-I saw something.

41
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,520
But it disappeared!

42
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,920
Pull!

43
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480
Quick! Pull!

44
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Harder.

45
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,040
One, two, three.

46
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,600
One, two, three.

47
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Lao Yang.

48
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
What's that?

49
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
I can't see it clearly.

50
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
Why did you stop pulling?

51
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,400
Pull.

52
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Pull harder.

53
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
Pull. Quick!

54
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Quick.

55
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,400
Give me your hand, Teacher Liang.

56
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,600
Help me up.

57
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,920
Help me up.

58
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,160
Calm down.

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,000
Let me undo the buckle.

60
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Stop dragging us down, old man.

61
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
I've never done this before.

62
00:06:59,280 --> 00:06:59,880
Quick!

63
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,880
Move.

64
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,320
Get down!

65
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,640
Hurry!

66
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,960
Run!

67
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,080
Be careful.

68
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
Wait for the old man.

69
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,240
This old fellow.

70
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
God.

71
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
Ghost! Ghost!

72
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,520
Teacher Liang!

73
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Run, Lao Yang!

74
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Ghost.

75
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Ghost.

76
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,360
Ghost.

77
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,480
Ghost.

78
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,000
Fatty!

79
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Come on!

80
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Wu Xie.

81
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,200
Are they humans or apes?

82
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,240
How do I know? Run!

83
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,840
Watch out, Fatty!

84
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,560
Are you all right, Wu Xie?

85
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,880
Who is she?

86
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,880
Why are you here?

87
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,880
Wu Xie.

88
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,280
Is she your friend?

89
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,520
We're not friends.

90
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,520
Right.

91
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,840
I've read a novel about
ancient civilization...

92
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,120
training apes to guard their mines.

93
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,160
Perhaps the Serpents have trained
their own apes for the same purpose.

94
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,800
It's dangerous here.

95
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go.

96
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Let's go.

97
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
Let's check on Teacher Liang.

98
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,040
How can it still absorb blood?

99
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,760
What is this?

100
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,000
Is this the legendary bronze tree?

101
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,640
Wu Xie.

102
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,840
Why are we still dragging
along this useless creature?

103
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,240
He's totally useless.

104
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,760
And he's a traitor.

105
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
Since he can't move a muscle now,

106
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
we'll take a rest here.

107
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,040
Is that okay?

108
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,160
It scared me to death.

109
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,000
It scared me to death.

110
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Where's that monster?

111
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
Where's that ape?

112
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,680
Where is it?

113
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,480
Where has it gone?

114
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,200
-Here.
-It's okay.

115
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
I got it. I got it.

116
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,480
I'll light my torch, don't worry.

117
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,320
Do we march on?

118
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,080
Little Master?

119
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,520
There's something behind, Wu Xie.

120
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,640
I thought I saw a friend of mine.

121
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,160
You must be exhausted.

122
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,560
Here, drink some water.

123
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,120
I brought my own.

124
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,800
I see you did.

125
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,360
-Lao Yang.
-I'll rest under that tree.

126
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,640
Little Master.

127
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,480
Little Master!

128
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,000
I thought I saw Wu Xie.

129
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Where?

130
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,760
Where is he?

131
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,680
Where is he?

132
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,200
But he's not here.

133
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,080
You saw him but he's not here?

134
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,600
What's wrong with you?

135
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Are you clairvoyant?

136
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,720
Or delusional just like us?

137
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,560
We've gotten rid of
the apes, haven't we?

138
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,640
Wu Xie.

139
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,960
Wu Xie.

140
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,760
Let's move.

141
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm afraid that the golden apes
might catch up to us.

142
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,320
I don't feel easy.

143
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,320
Can't we rest for a little while more?

144
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,520
I've used up all my strength.

145
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
You troublesome old man.

146
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,600
Have pity on this old man.

147
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
-A little while.
-What do you say, Ning?

148
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Let's rest for a little while more.

149
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
I'll fight the golden ape if it comes.

150
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,360
Thank you, young lady.

151
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,680
Thank you very much.

152
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,520
What's that?

153
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,840
Do you see it?

154
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
What was that?

155
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
I didn't see it clearly.

156
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,600
Could it be the apes again?

157
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,080
No.

158
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,520
They are not that fast.

159
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,880
What was that?

160
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,720
You...

161
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,520
That's...

162
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,760
blood?

163
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,080
Wu Xie.

164
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
What's wrong?

165
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,840
It's blood.

166
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
What's going on?

167
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,440
Quit resting.

168
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,000
Move!

169
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,280
-Quick!
-Let's move.

170
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's go.

171
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,200
Uncle Tai!

172
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Don't go.

173
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,360
Uncle Tai only has
his upper body left.

174
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
The another half of
his body has fallen off.

175
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Who... who did this?

176
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
Who could be so cruel!

177
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,520
These branches may look blunt.

178
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,000
But if a person is falling from
an optimum height and speed,

179
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,160
these branches could
become sharp blades.

180
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,040
Then how tall can this tree be?

181
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,640
For that, we'll have to ask Lao Yang.

182
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,000
I... Why are you asking
me questions again?

183
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,960
I really don't know.

184
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,920
You've been enigmatic all the way.

185
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,360
Tell us the truth.

186
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,960
I really don't know.

187
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,840
Let's not fight among
ourselves at a time like this.

188
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,480
It's a dead end.

189
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,160
Look for another route.

190
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,400
Look.

191
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,600
There's blood stains on the trunk.

192
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
Look! Here too!

193
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,240
Here! Look!

194
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,680
Actually,

195
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,960
There's been a question on my mind.

196
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
What's the use of such
a gigantic bronze tree?

197
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,360
It has something to do with the
altar you discovered 3 years ago.

198
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,360
And the human head figures we
saw when we first entered this place.

199
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
And the Serpent coffins
that we failed to find out.

200
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,640
I speculate that...

201
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,200
these ...

202
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,520
are the items for a ritual.

203
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,240
But there's one thing.

204
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,240
Bronze tree is an item
from Western Zhou dynasty,

205
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,760
but the tomb was built by
the Serpents in the Han dynasty.

206
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,255
Logically speaking,

207
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,039
the way the Serpents used it...

208
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,000
didn't prove its natural function.

209
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,813
You mean...

210
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,440
the Serpents discovered
the bronze tree,

211
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,157
became inspired with awe,

212
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,120
and included it in their ritual?

213
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,600
But the bronze tree wasn't used for
rituals during Western Zhou dynasty.

214
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,360
Right?

215
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,120
Yes.

216
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,640
But from the pattern,

217
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,440
I have a feeling that they
were originally used for rituals.

218
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
Even though rituals in
Western Zhou dynasty...

219
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,160
weren't as cruel as
that of Shang dynasty,

220
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,360
they still often used
humans as sacrifice.

221
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,320
The difference between
rituals of both dynasties...

222
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,680
were merely based on
the way they sacrificed people.

223
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
If they were worshiping the earth,

224
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,280
humans were buried alive.

225
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,720
For the Fire Deity,

226
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,320
humans were burnt alive.

227
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
For the River Deity,

228
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
humans were thrown into the river.

229
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,600
I think...

230
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,560
with a huge bronze tree like this,

231
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,707
they must've taken it...

232
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,040
as a sacred tree just
like the Tree of Life.

233
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,840
Maybe it's for worshiping
the Tree Deity, Gou Mang.

234
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Blood rituals are normally
used to worship deities like these.

235
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,240
Look, the blood is
flowing down so smoothly.

236
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,560
It wouldn't be this smooth if
it wasn't designed this way.

237
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,080
And the blood grooves on the trunk...

238
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,320
I think it was really
used for blood rituals.

239
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,520
That means humans had to
be nailed on to the tree alive,

240
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,800
until their blood ran dry.

241
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,720
The blood flows all
the way to the root,

242
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,920
to show the deity their dedication.

243
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,680
So there's no wonder that
the stain would run so deep.

244
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,160
But how many people were needed
to fill all these grooves with blood?

245
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,560
Out off my way.

246
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,520
Teacher Liang.

247
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,440
-Why did he do that to me?
-Have some water.

248
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,120
Thanks.

249
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,920
Wu Xie!

250
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Yes, you haven't introduced
me to the pretty lady here.

251
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,720
She's Ning.

252
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
Ning.

253
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,800
Such a lovely name.

254
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,720
How do you know each other?

255
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,490
The path ahead is
getting more diverged.

256
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,440
It's going to be tricky.

257
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,240
Some parts up there are
dense while some are loose.

258
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,000
It's easier for us to
ascend if it's dense.

259
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,086
It's about 2 meters in between.

260
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:34,360
So, we'll have to do a
human pyramid to get there.

261
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,145
If it's so easy to ascend.

262
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,800
Why would Uncle Tai
have fallen down then?

263
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm not sure if he
fell down by accident...

264
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,360
or someone deliberately
pushed him down.

265
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,960
Isn't Mr. Wang up there?

266
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,619
No way.

267
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,000
That's impossible.

268
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,640
I've seen many like you.

269
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,684
It's nothing new...

270
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,440
to see you fight among each other.

271
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,040
The treasure hasn't
even been found yet.

272
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,080
Why would we fight each other?

273
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm sure that the
treasure is on the tree.

274
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,720
What?

275
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Aren't we supposed
to ascend after all?

276
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,760
It's too much trouble
ascending and descending.

277
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Let's look for another way out.

278
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,040
Let's work in groups then.

279
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
I'll pair up with Wu Xie.

280
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,960
Freeze.

281
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,880
Wu Xie will go with me.

282
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,720
You'll take him.

283
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,400
Fine.

284
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,440
You go find a way then.

285
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
I'll take a rest over here.

286
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,120
Ning.

287
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Did you see Little Master just now?

288
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,960
Weren't you here together?

289
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,600
No.

290
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,760
Perhaps I saw wrong.

291
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,440
I've been wanting
to ask you a question.

292
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
After we got out from
the underwater tomb,

293
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
why did you disappear
without a single word?

294
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,520
We're of different leagues.

295
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Then why did you send an
empty ship to save me?

296
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,120
I don't know what
you're talking about.

297
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Aren't you going to
admit that we're friends?

298
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
Come, give me a hand.

299
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,080
Quick.

300
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
You're so slow.

301
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,200
The torch.

302
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,560
-Hold it.
-Where is it?

303
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,320
-Slow down.
-You're blocking my way.

304
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,480
I'm so unfortunate to
be paired up with you.

305
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
Let me catch my breath.

306
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,880
Let me catch my breath.

307
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,120
Where are you trying to go?

308
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,560
Keep you mouth shut, old man.

309
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,440
I would have killed you
if it wasn't for Wu Xie.

310
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,000
Quick!

311
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,440
What happened?

312
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,120
Save me, old man.

313
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
How unexpected?

314
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,160
The table has turned.

315
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,160
And now you're begging me for help.

316
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Cut the crap.

317
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,200
Save me, hurry!

318
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,760
Save you?

319
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,607
All along the way,

320
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:24,529
you've been bullying me...

321
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,280
time and time again!

322
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,280
You can just hold on for a while more!

323
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,560
Quick, old man!

324
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,640
You want me to save you?

325
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Fine.

326
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,520
I'll do it if you agree this one term.

327
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,560
Fine. Say it.

328
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,219
If you tell me every
secret behind this tree,

329
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,280
I'll save you right away.

330
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,560
Fine.

331
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,360
I'll tell you.

332
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,760
All of you will have to die here.

333
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,581
Very well.

334
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,080
If you insist on being stubborn,

335
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,000
good bye then!

336
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,080
Don't go!

337
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll tell you everything!

338
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,360
I wanted to save him.

339
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,120
I mean it.

340
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,000
But I was hesitant.

341
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,320
I was afraid that my body
was too fragile to save him,

342
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,200
and would hurt myself in the process.

343
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,480
Lao Yang.

344
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,920
Calm down.

345
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm fine.

346
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm really fine.

347
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Wu Xie.

348
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm just trying to
talk to Teacher Liang.

349
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,520
Teacher Liang.

350
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,960
You're the only one
who knows about this.

351
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
Please don't tell anyone about it.

352
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
What is that?

353
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,400
Teacher Liang.

354
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What did he tell you?

355
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,440
He...

356
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,040
He...

357
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
He didn't tell me anything.

358
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,040
I mean it.

359
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,600
God knows what he has up his sleeves.

360
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,160
Hurry, go.

361
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,240
What's this?

362
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,760
The hair on the body
falls for a reason.

363
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,120
It looks like some skin disease.

364
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,320
That's disgusting.

365
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,960
God! What is this?

366
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,440
Is it a mask?

367
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,095
Why is it stuck to the flesh?

368
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,960
It's even become one with the face.

369
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,240
It looks like there's a
respirator in the mouth.

370
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,960
It must've been suffocating.

371
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,280
The mask must've grown
from within their flesh.

372
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,880
The mouth and eyes
are totally blocked.

373
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,000
I bet they eat and see
in their own particular way.

374
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,160
Look at the pattern.

375
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
It resembles the
patterns on the trunk.

376
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,560
It must have something to do with
the person who made the bronze tree.

377
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
Put it down!

378
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,960
What's wrong?

379
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,640
It's still alive.

380
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,040
What was that, Teacher Liang?

381
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,080
It's such a shame.

382
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,160
Why didn't I realise it?

383
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,880
The bronze tree,

384
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,240
and the ritual method,

385
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,720
they obviously do not belong...

386
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,400
they don't belong to the Hans.

387
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm such an idiot.

388
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,240
Just say whatever you want to say.

389
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,040
That...

390
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,960
You...

391
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,400
Please listen to me patiently.

392
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,280
I'll tell you everything.

393
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,160
Where...

394
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,720
Where shall I begin?

395
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,720
Don't panic, Teacher Liang.

396
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,800
Think slowly.

397
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,280
All right.

398
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,240
Let me put it this way.

399
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,640
Massive blood ritual was not
recorded in the history of the Hans.

400
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,515
But it was found sporadically
in the historical sites...

401
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,960
of the ethnic tribes.

402
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,629
During the Western Zhou dynasty,

403
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,040
it was a society where slaves existed.

404
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,051
But they did also learn...

405
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,000
the modern culture of the
Western Zhou dynasty.

406
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,160
That includes the
metallurgical technology.

407
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,600
Therefore among the unearthed
artifacts of the minority,

408
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,880
the bronze wares embody the
features of Western Zhou dynasty.

409
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,240
You mean the bronze
tree wasn't made by...

410
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,600
the conqueror of Western Zhou dynasty,

411
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,920
but the leader of a minority tribe?

412
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,800
That's right.

413
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,480
The rituals of ethnic
tribes are a mystery.

414
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:20,259
Rumor has it that some priests...

415
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,120
will apply traditional
tribal taming skill...

416
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,000
to protect their leader from
being attacked by the outsiders.

417
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
The apes that were
attacking us just now,

418
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:33,872
was tamed by using parasitic bugs...

419
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:34,887
to control their nervous system...

420
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
and attack intruders.

421
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,760
That's weird then.

422
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,480
Say, if the mask is
air tight on their heads,

423
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
how did they put it on?

424
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,824
How do they even eat with the mask?

425
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:45,920
Or breathe?

426
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,440
That's disgusting.

427
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
What is that?

428
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
This is Chi venom.

429
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
Chi venom is a taming method...

430
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,000
that lives with the
host parasitically.

431
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,000
It controls the nervous
system of the host animal.

432
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,360
The venom will flourish until
its host is completely dead,

433
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
and then turn into an empty vessel.

434
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,040
So meaning, the ape was long dead?

435
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,040
The blood is fresh.

436
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,920
It was freshly infested.

437
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,520
I guess the apes were practically
housing the coal, waiting to be burnt.

438
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,080
It even messed up their nest.

439
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,000
Looking for a new host, eh?

440
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
There are only 2 of us.

441
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,880
It's not even enough
for all of you to share!

442
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Go away!

443
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,200
This is the first time I
heard about Chi venom.

444
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,640
The bug was dry like a raisin,

445
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
yet it was still alive.

446
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,920
It's nothing new.

447
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,680
There are many kinds of bugs.

448
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,440
Some of them are capable
of getting into thanatosis.

449
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,920
They will resurrect under
optimal circumstances.

450
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,280
It's almost impossible
to remove Chi venom.

451
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,040
It would be trouble
once we get attacked.

452
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,520
We best prevent it from happening.

453
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,080
Best to stay as far as
possible from the corpses.

454
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,200
Wu Xie.

455
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,560
I'll go scout the path ahead.

456
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,120
Don't you forget.

457
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Uncle Tai fell down from the top.

458
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
Perhaps Mr. Wang is still around.

459
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,720
Be careful.

460
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll be fine.

461
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,120
It's dark here, Wu Xie.

462
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm firing a signal flare.

463
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
What's going on?

464
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,000
Over here!

465
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
What's this?

466
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,640
Lao Yang.

467
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,400
Wu Xie.

468
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,000
Over here.

469
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,800
What's wrong, Lao Yang?

470
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,600
There's something there.

471
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,000
Look.

472
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,560
They are all alive.

473
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,680
What shall we do?

474
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,440
How do we get through?

475
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,880
Calm down.

476
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,480
Look at their reaction.

477
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,000
I think they are afraid
of light and heat.

478
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,000
They wouldn't get near us
if we lit our torches up.

479
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,960
Signal flare is bright and blinding.

480
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,160
It's different from the torch.

481
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,880
Don't you forget that the apes weren't
afraid of the signal flare at all.

482
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,440
And they merely moved
an inch in front of the torch.

483
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
That's right.

484
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,440
If we don't make it through here,

485
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,160
we'll all be surrounded by them.

486
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,000
We'll be so dead then.

487
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,480
What shall we do?

488
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,080
Wu Xie.

489
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,720
What shall we do?

490
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,080
This...
