"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:05,115
"Episode 39"

3
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Everybody, keep up!

4
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,560
Miss Ning.

5
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
Can we trust Jin Yang?

6
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
For now.

7
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
He's the mole...

8
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,720
our boss intercepted
in the snow mountains.

9
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,759
Don't go head on with him.

10
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,359
Find Wu Xie first.

11
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,599
Okay.

12
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,920
Look!

13
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,360
This mountain!

14
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Fatty,

15
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
do you remember that mural?

16
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,040
It's this mountain.

17
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,400
The same mountain...

18
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,040
on the murals we saw...

19
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,800
in the underwater tomb.

20
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,840
Shun Zi,

21
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,440
what is it called?

22
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
How can we get there?

23
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
This is Mount Tri-Holy.

24
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
Only a small part of it...

25
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,640
is within our borders.

26
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,000
The remainder is in North Korea.

27
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,320
We can't go over.

28
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Besides,

29
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,280
there's only a few paths
to the mountain.

30
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
All highly guarded.

31
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
One searchlight every ten miles.

32
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Military barriers are set from
the foot of the mountain.

33
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,080
Not many guards,

34
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,040
but packed with sentry posts.

35
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Forget crossing the borders,

36
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,400
we can't even get close.

37
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
When I was serving, we were told to...

38
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
fire at the sky as warning...

39
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
if anyone gets close.

40
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,160
If they don't back down,

41
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
a second shot to the legs.

42
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
No dilly dally.

43
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Is it that scary?

44
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
The Maginot Line was crossed.

45
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
Why not this one?

46
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,680
Sure.

47
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Bring the Special Force with you.

48
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Maybe you can pass.

49
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
I say, Shun Zi.

50
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,720
What about that mountain?

51
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,280
That's the Mount Mini Holy.

52
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,760
It's in our borders.

53
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Together with Mount Tri-Holy...

54
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
and Mount Major Holy,

55
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
they make up The Five Holies.

56
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Then can we get on...

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Mount Mini Holy from here?

58
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,520
Yes.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
In one day's time.

60
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
And the sceneries are amazing.

61
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
It's away from the sentry posts too.

62
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,440
But the path is a tough.

63
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,080
All right.

64
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,200
We'll go there.

65
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,840
But why, Master?

66
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a waste of time.

67
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
We haven't...

68
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
much food to stand that long.

69
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,880
Look at that.

70
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,880
The mountains stretch far and wide.

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
It's constantly buried with snow
and surrounded on three sides.

72
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,840
This is what is known as...

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,400
a rare three-headed dragon.

74
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,440
From theories of feng shui,

75
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,120
this is the so-called dragons' seat.

76
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,440
These three mountain peaks...

77
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
are the dragons' heads.

78
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
Perfect for hiding treasures.

79
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Let's say if...

80
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,800
the ancient ruins of Dongxia...

81
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
lies in the deep valleys...

82
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,040
within Mount Tri-Holy,

83
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,079
the two dragon heads beside it...

84
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,559
may likely contain the royalty's...

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,000
and courtiers' great treasures.

86
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,040
Three-headed dragon?

87
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Are there such treasures, Mr. Naive?

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Yes.

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,480
Like the three burials of Mangshan
during the Warring States...

90
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,120
discovered in 1987.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
There were three linked treasures.

92
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,200
Distributed to three mountain peaks...

93
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
on the same mountain range.

94
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,040
The treasures on two sides...

95
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,720
both have...

96
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
a half-mile passage...

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,560
leading towards the main chamber.

98
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
But alas during the excavation,

99
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
the passage collapsed.

100
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,400
The archeology team didn't know...

101
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,160
if the passages...

102
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
were really connected...

103
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,360
or just a symbolic pattern.

104
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Any other explanations?

105
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,640
The three-headed dragon pattern...

106
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
is very unique.

107
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,040
The heads must be connected.

108
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,960
If not,
the three dragons will fly off.

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Without direction,

110
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
their dragon tails will entangle.

111
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Those buried here...

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,840
will bring tragedy to
their descendants.

113
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
So if there are treasures,

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,040
the path to the main chamber...

115
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,640
must be there...

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
under the treasures.

117
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
Then, that means...

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
we can reach Mount Tri-Holy...

119
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
from underground.

120
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,720
We don't have to...

121
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
get through the sentry posts.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm done. My legs are wobbly.

123
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Be content.

124
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,280
This may be the only mountain...

125
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,320
in the world...

126
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,760
that we can walk up to.

127
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,840
Compared to...

128
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,160
the glaciers of Kunlun Mountains,

129
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,800
this is better.

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,080
At least, there's nothing like...

131
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,720
big cracked ice sheets.

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
We don't have to worry
about falling into it.

133
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
It's not that much better.

134
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,880
The mountains here
are not too coherent.

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
There are certain occurrences like...

136
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
glacial erosion,

137
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,520
glacial pothole,

138
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,600
or large cirques.

139
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,000
In conclusion,

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,320
we'll likely walk on...

141
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
and come to a dead end.

142
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,520
In other cases,

143
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
there might be a large pit...

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,680
beneath the snow.

145
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,720
Can you two scholars...

146
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,320
just shut up?

147
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,600
I can't push...

148
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
nor pull any further!

149
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,880
What should I do...

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,720
if you keep talking?

151
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,560
Are there any...

152
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,920
encouraging news?

153
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,440
Encouraging?

154
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
You want some encouraging news?

155
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
In front of us,

156
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,280
is the world's greatest treasure!

157
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,600
That treasure!

158
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Let's...

159
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
run towards the treasure!

160
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,880
Is this encouraging enough?

161
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,200
Lower your voice, Fatty.

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,280
You'll trigger an avalanche.

163
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,520
It's all right!

164
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
For the great treasure!

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,080
Charge!

166
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,880
Go!

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,080
Go!

168
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Great Si,

169
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,560
eat something.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,920
Take a rest.

171
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,120
Great Si,

172
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
give me your opinion.

173
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
I've been to see...

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,720
the murals in the Sky Palace.

175
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,720
It's a magnificent palace.

176
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,520
But...

177
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
Though Dongxia...

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,200
only existed for 70 years,

179
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
their descendants were few.

180
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,960
And most of them...

181
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,920
had secluded themselves...

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
into hills and forests.

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,040
Where would there be...

184
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,960
such manpower and resources...

185
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,640
to build such a great project?

186
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,640
Kiddo.

187
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
You're here to set me up.

188
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,080
Right?

189
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
If you can't make assumptions...

190
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
on your own,

191
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,880
how can you be...

192
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,320
the grandchild of Wu Lao Gou?

193
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,920
Actually,

194
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,960
I have an assumption.

195
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,360
But it may not be right.

196
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
That's why I'm here...

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
to ask for your opinion.

198
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm guessing...

199
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
that the Sky Palace...

200
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
may have existed long ago.

201
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
It was not made during Dongxia.

202
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Maybe...

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,880
King Wan Nu...

204
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
thought this was a great place...

205
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,120
and took it for himself...

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,240
as his territory.

207
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
But here's a question.

208
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,640
Who built...

209
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,480
the Sky Palace?

210
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
What are you rushing for?

211
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
You'll know when you get there.

212
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,200
By the way,

213
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,160
I remember that my uncle told me...

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,120
you have a copper fish,

215
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,720
It's a...

216
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,920
very vital key.

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
How did you get it?

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,960
Could that place...

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
be related...

220
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
to the Sky Palace?

221
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,240
This is no secret.

222
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,960
Back then,
I came across a stone tower...

223
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,720
at the Sleeping Buddha Ridge
in Guangxi.

224
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,760
But in that stone tower,

225
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
everything was worthless...

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,280
besides the stone statues.

227
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,880
There was one thing
of some worth though.

228
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,640
It was the Paragon Chest.

229
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
In the Paragon Chest...

230
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,480
was the snake eye copper fish.

231
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,600
Did the whole process go smooth?

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,840
What do you mean?

233
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
I mean,

234
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,360
wouldn't there be traps...

235
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,640
surrounding prized treasures?

236
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,280
That stone tower...

237
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,360
That stone tower...

238
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,840
was in the valley.

239
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,960
It was difficult enough...

240
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,280
to get down there.

241
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,400
It itself served as...

242
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,640
a natural shield.

243
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,160
Great Si,

244
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,200
is it okay...

245
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
for you to tell me...

246
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
the whole process...

247
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,160
of you obtaining the copper fish?

248
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,920
Maybe there are clues...

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
in the process...

250
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,400
which you could've missed?

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,880
Kiddo.

252
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,040
Are you...

253
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,240
underestimating me?

254
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,960
No, I'm not.

255
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I would never.

256
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
You're bold.

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
This...

258
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
is the characteristic of the Wus.

259
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,320
He didn't say.

260
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,920
Maybe he's...

261
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,880
avoiding the topic.

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,040
But it also seems...

263
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,160
like he's unclear of the details,

264
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,520
and didn't want to lie.

265
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,320
Perhaps when we reach,

266
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
all the mysteries...

267
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
will unravel.

268
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,280
Shun Zi.

269
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,560
Here.

270
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,799
Drink some hot water.

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,600
Thanks.

272
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,960
I can't sleep either.

273
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,840
I'll take the shift.

274
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Go take a rest.

275
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
It's fine, I got this.

276
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,080
I heard that...

277
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,920
you were in the military.

278
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,360
For how long?

279
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Seven years.

280
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
But I was a reservist for four years.

281
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
What did you do...

282
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,960
before you joined the army?

283
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,080
Collecting herbs...

284
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,840
and hunting.

285
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,880
Like my father.

286
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,840
I've been in the mountains
with him since young.

287
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm familiar with the area.

288
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,280
Then,

289
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,520
I stayed here as a soldier.

290
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,560
My comrades call me Alang Cai

291
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,280
Alang Cai?

292
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
As in the son of the snow mountain.

293
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,360
Wu Xie.

294
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,680
Actually...

295
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,720
My father...

296
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,240
led a team of visitors uphill before.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,440
And,

298
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,000
they took the same route as you guys.

299
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,040
But then,

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
none of them ever returned.

301
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,680
I remember clearly...

302
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,160
that the visitors...

303
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,120
also insisted to climb...

304
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,320
the mountain in the harsh winter.

305
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,560
So when I saw you guys,

306
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,440
I decided...

307
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,680
to bring all of you here.

308
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
It may be childish,

309
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,720
but I think I'll know...

310
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,440
what happened...

311
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,800
to my father if I followed you guys.

312
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,160
So,

313
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,080
you're more anxious than us...

314
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,480
to get into the mountains.

315
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
You'll never understand the feeling...

316
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,920
of knowing that your father...

317
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
is eternally asleep
in Changbai Mountain,

318
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,680
but can never...

319
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
ever see him.

320
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
Actually,

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
I understand.

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,640
Family is more important
than anything.

323
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,680
Come.

324
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Master.

325
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
This is the dragon head
treasure cave...

326
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
you've mentioned?

327
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,560
Heavenly guards watching
over the holy gates.

328
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,000
It's a good place.

329
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,520
In terms of feng shui,

330
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,880
the holy gates by the two peaks...

331
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
are strategically situated.

332
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,480
It's limitless and breathtaking.

333
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,160
If this wasn't the border,

334
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
it would've been the land of dispute.

335
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,120
This must be...

336
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
where royalty and aristocrats...

337
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,720
kept their treasures.

338
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
The topography here is unique.

339
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,040
It beams with royal aura.

340
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
There must be treasures here!

341
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,400
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

342
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Go!

343
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,800
Let's go, Little Master.

344
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,240
To Fatty Wang,

345
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,360
this is a small step.

346
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,920
But to the past generations
of tomb raiders,

347
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,960
this is a huge leap!

348
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,800
So beautiful!

349
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
No wonder people say...

350
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,920
rather than the Penglai fairyland...

351
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
better yet visit Changbai!

352
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,920
This was worth the climb.

353
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,280
Hey, ugly.

354
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,240
Don't block my view.

355
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,200
Get up!

356
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,160
Chen Si Ye!

357
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,000
Are you okay?

358
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Why aren't we there yet?

359
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
Did you navigate wrongly, Shun Zi?

360
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,400
I remember a sentry post was here.

361
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,600
Why can't I find it?

362
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,680
You navigated wrongly.

363
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,600
Impossible.

364
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,600
I know.

365
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,560
The snow haven't stopped
in these two days.

366
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,720
The sentry post must be
buried underneath.

367
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,160
It's below us.

368
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,200
What should we do now?

369
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,920
We can't go back.

370
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
Are we going to freeze to death?

371
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,000
There's another way.

372
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,160
I know a hot spring...

373
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,160
in the vicinity.

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
If we can find it,

375
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,200
we can stand longer.

376
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
The altitude of the
hot spring is higher.

377
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,280
It won't get buried.

378
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,240
And if we can't find it?

379
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Then we'll have to pray
to the Mountain Deity.

380
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,200
Come.

381
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,560
Tie the ropes up.

382
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,440
Connect one another.

383
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,320
So, no one will be left behind.

384
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,080
Here.

385
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,280
Little Master!

386
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
Are you calling me?

387
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
I thought you'd left the team.

388
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,200
Don't worry.

389
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,240
Even in the worst conditions,

390
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,200
I'll keep you alive.

391
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,040
Chen Si Ye! Si Ye!

392
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,240
-Great Si!
-Young Master Wu!

393
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,160
Young Master Wu!

394
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,120
Great Si!

395
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,360
-Young Master Wu!
-What happened to him?

396
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,400
Great Si! Wake up!

397
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Young Master Wu!

398
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,440
Chen Si Ye fainted! Young Master Wu!

399
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Why don't we split up?

400
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,840
That hot spring...

401
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,480
must be around us.

402
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,680
Sure.

403
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
How about this?

404
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,840
We keep our ropes tied...

405
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,120
and walk in different directions.

406
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
Return when the ropes start to pull.

407
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Come.

408
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,960
Lend a hand.

409
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,520
Come.

410
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,640
Come.

411
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
-Place Si Ye beside the tree.
-One, two...

412
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,280
Come!

413
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,080
What's the matter?

414
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,680
It's hypoxia.

415
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,400
I can't sleep.

416
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,480
Wu Xie.

417
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,720
Don't fall asleep.

418
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,520
If you fall asleep,

419
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,320
you won't wake up again.

420
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,960
Don't sleep.

421
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,000
Don't sleep.

422
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,400
You!

423
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,160
Who are you?

424
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,320
Why are you here?

425
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,320
It's me.

426
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Kiddo.

427
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,239
Uncle San Xing?

428
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,359
Why are you here?

429
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,280
You're tired.

430
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,359
Come over.

431
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,679
Come to me.

432
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Come here. Come here.

433
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,520
Uncle San Xing.

434
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,880
I...

435
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,520
Uncle San Xing.

436
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,320
I can't go back anymore.

437
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,560
I...

438
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,800
I can't walk.

439
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,960
Come here.

440
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,840
Come to me, come.

441
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,560
Hurry.

442
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Come to me.

443
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,119
Hurry up.

444
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,080
Uncle San Xing.

445
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,000
I remember.

446
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,440
When one has hypoxia
due to extreme cold,

447
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
one not only feels lethargic,

448
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,440
but illusions will appear.

449
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,400
Kiddo.

450
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,400
You think I'm an illusion?

451
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,480
No.

452
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,360
You're not Uncle San Xing.

453
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Even if I'm hallucinating...

454
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,200
and short of breath,

455
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,760
my uncle won't be...

456
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,400
in a dive suit on a snow mountain.

457
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,280
Kiddo.

458
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,360
Why aren't you coming over?

459
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,240
No.

460
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,520
Impossible.

461
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,240
You're not my uncle!

462
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,680
What's the matter?

463
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
Come to me.

464
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
You're Xie Lian Huan?

465
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,560
No!

466
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,040
Impossible!

467
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,600
How can you be Xie Lian Huan?

468
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,800
Wu San Xing owes me a life.

469
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,200
No!

470
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,840
When will he pay?

471
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,000
Impossible.

472
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,160
Impossible!

473
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,760
No!

474
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,720
What happened?

475
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,400
What...

476
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
What the hell?

477
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,400
Are you all right?

478
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,880
Fatty Wang fell down.

479
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
Be careful, everyone!

480
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,320
Take a look, guys!

481
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,280
What is that tray?

482
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,480
I'll have a look.

483
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,000
What is this?

484
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,160
This looks like...

485
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,320
that piece of black stone.

486
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,240
Is this a dragon?

487
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,880
Why is there so many feet?

488
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,000
Like a centipede.

489
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,720
So ugly.

490
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,960
It's uglier than the one...

491
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,000
at the Forbidden Palace.

492
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,120
Is this a defective...

493
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,040
thrown away?

494
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,520
Don't spout nonsense.

495
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,280
This is a hundred-limb dragon,

496
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,080
not a coiled dragon.

497
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,040
The old dragon carvings in Dongxia...

498
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,840
were all like this.

499
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,680
In early China,

500
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
ancient Chinese dragons...

501
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,280
have unique forms.

502
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,080
Some of them even had pig noses...

503
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,160
or centipede-like feet.

504
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,160
It's not peculiar.

505
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,440
The evolution of dragons in China...

506
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,480
is historic.

507
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
From the beginning,

508
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,720
dragons crawled on ground.

509
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,120
Simply find an animal head...

510
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,240
and place it on a snake,

511
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,680
you'll have a dragon.

512
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,840
Back then,

513
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
each tribe...

514
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
had their own totem of dragons.

515
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,600
Their forms changed as
the tribes evolved.

516
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,520
All in different forms.

517
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
When the Han culture spread.

518
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,760
The Yi and Xia culture combined.

519
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
The Han Dragon...

520
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,600
began to mix...

521
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
with other tribal impressions...

522
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,960
of dragons.

523
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Lastly it became...

524
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,120
the form as we all know,

525
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,120
the coiled dragon.

526
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,640
Then this Dongxia...

527
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,240
existed quite early.

528
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,360
What now, monk?

529
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Tell us about Dongxia.

530
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,800
Dongxia...

531
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,440
Oh shoot!

532
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,440
I forgot about Master!

533
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,880
Master!

534
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,120
There's something here!

535
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,440
Please have a look!

536
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,240
We can hide...

537
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,360
from the snow too!

538
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,760
Take a night off!

539
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,480
What happened?

540
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,800
Miss Ning.

541
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,760
We can't go further.

542
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,120
It's too dangerous to journey...

543
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,040
in such heavy snow.

544
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,920
We're not afraid to suffer.

545
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,080
It's really too dangerous.

546
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,160
The scouts say...

547
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,800
there's a big range of
avalanche up ahead.

548
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,400
The snow is loose,

549
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
with air bubbles beneath.

550
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,160
If we fall or sprain ourselves,

551
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,000
that's our luck.

552
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,320
But if we fall into a pit,

553
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,040
we may not get up.

554
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
Or may trigger a chain reaction...

555
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
to another avalanche.

556
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,760
All dozens of us...

557
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
will be goners in just a few seconds.

558
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,480
How long more till we get to Wu Xie?

559
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,280
If we don't rest tonight,

560
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,760
we'll definitely make it.

561
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,200
With the looks of this path,

562
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,120
they/ll need to rest for a day.

563
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,000
Let's delay a day.

564
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,720
If it's dangerous,

565
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,960
let's rest for a night.

566
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,480
Don't worry.

567
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,440
We'll find them.

568
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,320
Set up tents and rest.

569
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,160
Okay.

570
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,200
Set up the tents for rest!

571
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,640
Yes, sir!

572
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,640
Ning.

573
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,200
What's the status?

574
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,400
Sir,

575
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,640
we are on our way.

576
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,800
Jin Yang insisted to navigate,

577
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,960
claiming he's the only one...

578
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,480
who knows the place.

579
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Follow him.

580
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,600
Your priority is finding Wu Xie.

581
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,040
It's possible that...

582
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,280
he's got the black stone...

583
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,920
that is immune to the
magnetic field disturbance.

584
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,160
You will get lost...

585
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,040
without him.

586
00:41:05,520 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir.
