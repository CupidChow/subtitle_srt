00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,165
"30 years ago"

4
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:22,792
Don't worry,

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,042
Mr. Joan.

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,876
Then I hope you're as accomplished...

7
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,167
as how you're so passionate.

8
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:32,501
Damn it.

9
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,250
I have to find a way.

10
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,125
Eat and drink all you can.

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,959
I'm going down for some treasures.

12
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,667
Everyone's clothes
were ragged and torn.

13
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,250
I couldn't distinguish them.

14
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,999
So I took all the bones
out and buried them.

15
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,667
I'm not sure if...

16
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:39,959
they were your great-grandfather's
or great-great-grandfather's.

17
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,667
Why did they give me a gun?

18
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,125
So many things had happened,

19
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:32,042
but the old man's notes
were short and simple.

20
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,167
Do you know why?

21
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,125
He hoped...

22
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,751
that these stories...

23
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,709
can be kept buried forever.

24
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,918
But back then,

25
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,667
maybe Granduncle Er obtained the
silk book of Warring States period.

26
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:08,542
When he got it,

27
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,501
something happened...

28
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,709
and caused everything
to turn out this way.

29
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:11,918
Maybe himself...

30
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,709
or maybe my great-grandfather...

31
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,542
shot at its hand and it broke.

32
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,209
Then my great-grandfather and
great-great-grandfather...

33
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,125
may have been implicated...

34
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:19,751
and died beside the coffin.

35
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:21,584
And not knowing the reason,

36
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:22,626
Granduncle Er died in the tomb too.

37
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:23,709
His body was manipulated...

38
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:24,792
and some sort of device was installed.

39
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:25,667
Uncle San Xing,

40
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:26,375
what actually happened...

41
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,501
Shut your mouth!

42
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,918
All these years,

43
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,250
don't you understand my reasons...

44
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,417
for doing all this?

45
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:39,876
Yes,

46
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,751
this occupation is our destiny.

47
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,584
We can't escape it!

48
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:44,959
But I wished that...

49
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it can end at your turn!

50
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,042
Stop meddling in it.

51
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,751
Isn't it better to live a decent life?

52
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,167
You're the only heir to the Wu Family.

53
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,125
I wish that you can...

54
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:05,751
live well.

55
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,042
Live happily,

56
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,918
live decently...

57
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,876
with a simple life.

58
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,125
For the Wu Family.

59
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,584
Within Wu Xie's body...

60
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,709
flows the family's blood.

61
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:37,876
Of course he knows...

62
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,918
it was all those horrible memories...

63
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,209
that agitated his uncle.

64
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,751
But could the pain of the past...

65
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,584
be the reason that has
distanced his uncle from him?

66
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,584
Have you found Wu San Xing?

67
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,000
Xiao Yu,

68
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,125
it's all thanks to you.

69
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,125
We've promised to not disturb you.

70
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,250
Thanks for helping us.

71
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,501
You guys are different...

72
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,125
from the grave robbers
who only care for their gains.

73
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:19,834
Otherwise, why would I help?

74
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,959
Don't worry.

75
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:22,792
If there's a chance,

76
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,834
I'll find out about...

77
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:24,709
your father's whereabouts.

78
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:26,918
Wu San Xing...

79
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,167
may not know where my father is.

80
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,584
But this isn't important anymore.

81
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:36,834
In this world,

82
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,292
the person who misses
my father the most...

83
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,918
can barely remember him now.

84
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,959
Is Aunt Xiao still unwell?

85
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:47,459
I have something to tell you.

86
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,501
I've sold...

87
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,834
the Taraxacum's shares entirely.

88
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,167
Next month,

89
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,959
I'm bringing my mom to Switzerland.

90
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,375
Their medical facilities are better.

91
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,167
And my mom likes the north.

92
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:00,792
You're not coming back?

93
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,000
I may not be back for a while.

94
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,000
But don't worry.

95
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,834
Don't we still have an agreement?

96
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,751
I've even signed one more term...

97
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:09,709
in the equity transfer contract...

98
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,167
as information sharing.

99
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,876
Someone will help.

100
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,125
Thank you.

101
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,250
Stop thanking me.

102
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,292
Or you'll miss your flight.

103
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:20,501
Go ahead.

104
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,751
Have a safe journey.

105
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:22,626
Xiao Yu,

106
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,999
you're different from us.

107
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,375
But we are somehow alike.

108
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,584
I hope we can meet again.

109
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:30,626
I hope so.

110
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:50,542
Did you see?

111
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,959
I'm trending online.

112
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:09,709
Uncle San Xing.

113
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,334
I need some nicotine.

114
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm going for a smoke.

115
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:19,959
Hey, watch this.

116
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:21,876
Hey, watch this.

117
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:24,292
Patriots protecting artifacts
with their fortune.

118
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,250
We're trending online now.

119
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,125
I'm telling you,

120
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,083
half of it's my efforts.

121
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,250
I've contributed my whole house in it.

122
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,959
Hurry up and...

123
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,250
forward it.

124
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:34,167
Remember to tag me.

125
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,125
I've tagged you.

126
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,792
I know.

127
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,959
Darn Fatty, he stole my red packet!

128
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,042
I'll drag you home to clean my toilet.

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,834
You're playing Pai Pai again?

130
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm dragging Fatty to work for me.

131
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,542
Let's look for Xiao Yu.

132
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:04,999
We only got out once in a while.

133
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,167
I'm not done playing.

134
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:08,250
Xiao Yu is going to Switzerland.

135
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,459
Aunt Xiao is going for a treatment.

136
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:10,417
You,

137
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,250
should stop thinking of playing.

138
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,918
Hurry and report yourself back home.

139
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,542
Master Wu.

140
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:39,834
This kiddo...

141
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:40,959
is so clingy.

142
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,292
I did everything to shake him off.

143
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:43,999
Uncle San Xing!

144
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,626
Sorry for tiring you.

145
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,751
Let's go, Pan Zi.

146
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,250
Granny is coming down.

147
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,250
Do you know what to say?

148
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,834
Stop pulling that face.

149
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,209
When I kneel later,

150
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,334
we'll be just fine.

151
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:15,417
She's here.

152
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:36,667
Granny Huo.

153
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,459
Master Xie.

154
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,501
Granny Huo,

155
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,250
just call me Xie Zi...

156
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:47,626
like you did before.

157
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,999
You are the leader of the Xie family.

158
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,501
I'm the leader of the Huo family.

159
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,959
Based on ranks,

160
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,375
we're the same, aren't we?

161
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:58,876
I'm of younger generation.

162
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,501
How can I...

163
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,584
behave rudely before you?

164
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,125
Even though the Xie and Huo families...

165
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,250
are old friends,

166
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,125
but we are two different families.

167
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,584
That's why we should be equals.

168
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,501
As leader of Xie family
you'll not have to...

169
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,334
lower yourself in front of me.

170
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,000
If not,

171
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,501
I would look like an old lady...

172
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,083
who bullies the youngsters.

173
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,375
If Xie Jiu was alive,

174
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,834
he'd be shouting at me
with a finger to my nose.

175
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:30,876
No, he won't.

176
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,584
Grandpa always used to
tell me when he was alive...

177
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,167
that you're the only
woman in the Mystic Nine.

178
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,584
Also the one he respects the most too.

179
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,918
Xie Jiu would never say
something like this.

180
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:43,792
He...

181
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,292
He thinks he's so smart.

182
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,584
Those he acknowledges can be
counted on the fingers of one hand.

183
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,000
Let alone those that
could gain his respect.

184
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,792
But I just don't understand.

185
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,959
You youngsters these days...

186
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:00,250
have not the slightest sense
of respect for your elders.

187
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,751
I remember that you learned acting...

188
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,584
with Master Er when you were young.

189
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,292
Then,

190
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,292
Xie Jiu brought you back
and taught you about life.

191
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,083
But you didn't learn anything...

192
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,000
from neither their expertise.

193
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,042
But not entirely.

194
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,959
You've learned how to smart talk...

195
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:22,125
just like Xie Jiu's true nature.

196
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,042
Am I right?

197
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,584
Granny,

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,667
don't be so hard on him.

199
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,209
This time abroad,

200
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,292
I insisted to follow Brother Xiao Hua.

201
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,709
If someone's to blame, it should me.

202
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,667
You keep going on and on.

203
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,042
You didn't give him a chance to speak.

204
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,876
And you said you weren't
bullying him with your age.

205
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,417
You'll get your turn later.

206
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:44,209
Granny,

207
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,042
I've been kneeling all day.

208
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,876
Plus, he's still injured.

209
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,459
My knees hurt too.

210
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,250
Can't we sit and talk...

211
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,626
if you have things to tell us?

212
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:52,626
Come, come.

213
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:55,083
I've spoiled you...

214
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,584
so much so that you
won't listen to me anymore.

215
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:00,918
Granny,

216
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,792
I am obedient.

217
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,125
I never thought that...

218
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,751
so much would happen on this trip.

219
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,792
You went all the way
to someone else's country.

220
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,626
Stealing and robbing...

221
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,000
on their land.

222
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,334
Aren't you embarrassed?

223
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:14,876
Just you two?

224
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,459
Without any help?

225
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:19,501
It's lucky that you're still alive.

226
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:20,999
We had help.

227
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:22,334
Brother Wu Xie was there,

228
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,417
Fatty Wang too.

229
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:24,751
Uncle San Xing as well.

230
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,709
How many times did I tell you...

231
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,792
to stop contacting the Wu Family?

232
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,667
We met by coincidence.

233
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:33,959
Granny,

234
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,417
you and Gou Wu Ye were old buddies.

235
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,125
Why are you so cold
to his descendants?

236
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,042
Me and Gou Wu Ye's friendship...

237
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,918
is between us adults.

238
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:44,083
You...

239
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,042
had your own relationships
in your generation.

240
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,334
Well, so do we.

241
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:49,751
Besides,

242
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,834
I won't believe you if you say...

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,626
you wouldn't help
Xie Jiu Ye or Gou Wu Ye...

244
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:54,876
if something had happened to them...

245
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,334
back when you were younger.

246
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,584
I've really spoiled you too much.

247
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:06,792
Look at how insolent you are.

248
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:11,292
You know how to
shut me up with words now.

249
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:12,417
No.

250
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,626
I followed Brother Xiao Hua abroad...

251
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,125
was not just to help him.

252
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,334
When Uncle Lian Huan
was in danger back then,

253
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,751
didn't auntie also...

254
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:21,792
Not another word!

255
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,292
What are you gawking at?

256
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:42,626
This place is yours?

257
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:43,999
Hold your thoughts.

258
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,626
If I depended on you,

259
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,751
I'd be homeless!

260
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,751
Uncle San Xing,

261
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,250
you're richer than I thought.

262
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:52,292
You want to lend money?

263
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,167
Not a chance.

264
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:55,999
I have money.

265
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:02,667
I have money.

266
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,959
No snooping around.

267
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,584
All these toys here...

268
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:14,667
You can look, but you can't touch.

269
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,918
Uncle San Xing,

270
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,834
this tea set isn't a full set, right?

271
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,667
You had this cover replaced afterward?

272
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,959
Be careful.

273
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,334
That's from the Qing dynasty.

274
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,000
If I accidentally...

275
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,334
chipped it in my hands,

276
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,959
will you be heartbroken?

277
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,876
How dare you!

278
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:45,042
Kiddo,

279
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:46,167
if you break it,

280
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:47,501
you're paying double.

281
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:50,918
I know.

282
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,584
My Uncle San Xing isn't
one to be taken advantage of.

283
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,083
Crap, I'm done for!

284
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:01,918
You've done it.

285
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:03,375
You've done it.

286
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,209
You did it on purpose.

287
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,667
I didn't mean it.

288
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:09,584
You meant it!

289
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:10,918
I really didn't mean it!

290
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:11,834
I've told you,

291
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,042
and you know me.

292
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,375
I'm not one to be to
be taken advantage of.

293
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:15,792
Pay up.

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,083
I'm broke.

295
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,959
Uncle San Xing,

296
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,083
I've spent all my money...

297
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,918
on the antiques I bought abroad.

298
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,167
It's true.

299
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,042
I even owe Fatty a huge sum.

300
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,417
You don't care do you?

301
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,167
Then I'll go borrow from Uncle Er Bai.

302
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:40,792
I'm leaving!

303
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,125
Stop your nonsense.

304
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:43,459
Clean up.

305
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,209
It's done.

306
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,584
It was an old piece of junk.

307
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:49,834
Uncle,

308
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,999
looking at all these replicates,

309
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:55,751
is any one of it real?

310
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,375
Never mind that.

311
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,292
These are some
high quality counterfeits.

312
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:02,459
What are you talking about?

313
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:03,292
I'll kill you!

314
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,751
If you find someone
with good skills...

315
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:09,083
to fix it for you,

316
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:11,626
this can really pass off as
an item from the grounds.

317
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:12,751
Kiddo.

318
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,876
You really think I have nothing?

319
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,042
Don't break this.

320
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,292
If you break it,

321
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,459
we'll really be dead.

322
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,125
I'll hold it for you to see.

323
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:28,334
You really think I have
nothing with me?

324
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,334
Isn't this just a stone?

325
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,876
Look closely.

326
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:45,626
Back then, I thought...

327
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,417
it was a stone too.

328
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:23,751
Bless me, my ancestors.

329
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,000
So you're saying that the sculpture...

330
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,626
had a human head and a bird's body?

331
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,584
Could it be the legendary goddess,

332
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:12,999
Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens?

333
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:13,792
Yes.

334
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:14,959
I thought the same too.

335
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,292
What about the eyes?

336
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:19,792
It's obvious.

337
00:25:20,834 --> 00:25:21,834
There were 4 of them.

338
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:23,999
Two of them disappeared.

339
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:25,792
I was guessing...

340
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,501
maybe your great-grandfather took it.

341
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:30,584
Then why did they...

342
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,417
only took two from the four?

343
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:37,334
Think about it.

344
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,751
I'm wondering...

345
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,459
if the stone was so precious,

346
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,918
maybe something happened to him...

347
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,959
that he couldn't take the other two.

348
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,792
If not, it's unreasonable.

349
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:51,959
Uncle San Xing,

350
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,459
you're really courageous.

351
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,375
Knowing you could end up...

352
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,125
like Granduncle Er by taking the stone.

353
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,501
Yet you still...

354
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:00,584
I was thinking,

355
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:03,709
maybe the secret...

356
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,584
lies behind the stones.

357
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,250
What's that bug?

358
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:30,375
It's a zombie beetle.

359
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,334
A red zombie beetle?

360
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:35,417
A red zombie beetle.

361
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,999
The zombie creature
that we encountered...

362
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,209
at the King Lu's Seven Star Palace
were rare enough.

363
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:42,792
These were red zombie beetles.

364
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:44,167
Kiddo,

365
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:47,042
it's extremely poisonous and
will cause imminent death.

366
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:48,751
Kiddo,

367
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,876
it's a miracle that you
can still see me...

368
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:54,709
alive.

369
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,501
So creepy.

370
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,417
Could it be...

371
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,584
that the stones all contain...

372
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,292
these types of zombie beetle?

373
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,083
Such rare bugs...

374
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,584
with 4 of them at a time.

375
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,083
How did they survive?

376
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:19,709
Then,

377
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,375
I consulted a Taoist master.

378
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,709
He told me that...

379
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,000
this isn't a stone.

380
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:27,417
Then what is it?

381
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,459
A pill.

382
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,626
Pill?

383
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,999
The ones cultivated by Taoist masters?

384
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:35,792
Longevity pills?

385
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:45,042
If that is so,

386
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,792
Granduncle Er must've faced...

387
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,999
the same situation as you did.

388
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,042
They accidentally
released a zombie beetle,

389
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,417
got poisoned,

390
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,250
and ended up like that.

391
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:55,999
Uncle San Xing,

392
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,083
what happened then?

393
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,209
Then?

394
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:01,999
I'm but a human.

395
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,709
I was frightened to the bone.

396
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:06,792
Do you think I had the
mood to treasure hunt?

397
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:08,584
Hurriedly,

398
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,584
I carried out the corpses
of our ancestors...

399
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:11,959
and buried them.

400
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,167
Beloved ancestors,

401
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,584
and dear seniors,

402
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,292
may you rest in peace.

403
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,792
Run!

404
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,876
Xie Lian Huan and Qiu De Kao
managed to escape.

405
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,792
Others were stung to death.

406
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,250
But the zombie beetle...

407
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:57,792
wasn't able to escape and
was buried under the ground.

408
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,417
That was lucky for us.

409
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:14,999
Your Uncle San Xing
was my contact in China.

410
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,375
He was a big help to me.

411
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:18,999
The expedition that time...

412
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,918
built a solid foundation
for our partnership.

413
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:23,209
Not long after,

414
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:24,959
we heard about an
archaeological team......

415
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,375
that had plans to uncover
the Paracel Islands Underwater Tomb.

416
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,209
And thus, I asked Wu San Xing...

417
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,125
to sneak into the team.

418
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,959
You said that Xie Lian Huan
joined forces with Qiu De Kao.

419
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:36,999
Then why was Xie Lian Huan there...

420
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,125
in the explore team?

421
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,792
I had my pride.

422
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,209
I can't ignore it.

423
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:43,709
Kiddo,

424
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,959
if only you knew.

425
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,375
We've never conducted any
operation on marine archeology.

426
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:50,417
Everything was
harvested by foreigners.

427
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:51,876
How could our country just sit by?

428
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,000
What can we do then?

429
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:54,834
We teamed up temporarily.

430
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:56,876
We gathered 7 or 8 teams
of archaeologists.

431
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,459
One of the teams...

432
00:31:58,792 --> 00:31:59,709
was sent to the Paracel.

433
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,042
Yes.

434
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,626
The team that Wen Jin was leading.

435
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:06,667
That's right.

436
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,167
It was the team that Wen Jin led.

437
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:15,667
Are you...

438
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:18,042
secretly investigating...

439
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,584
your aunt's case behind my back?

440
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:22,542
Granny,

441
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,334
Auntie has been missing for so long.

442
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,292
Yet it's always been bothering you.

443
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:27,959
I just can't bear to see you...

444
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,417
constantly sighing in
the middle of the night.

445
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,417
When Uncle Lian Huan was in danger,

446
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,584
Auntie and the whole
archeology team...

447
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:36,584
went missing.

448
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,999
You've always forbid us...

449
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,334
from contacting Uncle San Xing.

450
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,542
It's because you can't help...

451
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,626
but think of her when
you see him, right?

452
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,667
No matter what happens,

453
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:48,709
I want to know...

454
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:51,167
what happened to my aunt.

455
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,292
Whether she's dead or alive.

456
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,417
Why are you the same...

457
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,209
as your aunt?

458
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,999
It's like you're made
from the same mold.

459
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,584
Always acting coy...

460
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,626
like a little princess.

461
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:09,959
But,

462
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,751
both of you...

463
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:16,792
won't budge until
you've reached a dead end.

464
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:18,876
I thought that...

465
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,459
sending her to the
Culture Department...

466
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,834
would be good for her.

467
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,584
It's a stable job,

468
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:26,918
with a good salary.

469
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:31,083
It was also an escape from
the Huos traditional field of work,

470
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,209
while she could still pursue
her passion in archeology.

471
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,459
That's why I never objected.

472
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:38,792
Right?

473
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,292
But alas,

474
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,417
she joined that archeology team!

475
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:47,834
I'm sorry, Granny.

476
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,083
It's all my fault.

477
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:50,792
I shouldn't have talked about my aunt.

478
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,459
Don't be sad.

479
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:53,709
It's all my fault.

480
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:54,918
Blame it all on me.

481
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,501
We bought all these equipments
with our own money.

482
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,167
This your chance to impress Wen Jin.

483
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,292
You know that?

484
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,584
I'd like to see...

485
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,667
who's more capable than me.

486
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,918
Go on, keep bragging.

487
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,542
We're both from the
Mystic Nine families.

488
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:12,751
Even if I...

489
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:13,918
Alright, alright.

490
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,751
Keep your voices down.

491
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:15,999
Should I give you some loudspeakers...

492
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:16,792
to yell at each other?

493
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,834
If you want to travel,
go somewhere else.

494
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,876
It's no fun following
an archaeological team.

495
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,918
San Xing.

496
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,125
Help me talk to Wen Jin.

497
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:30,375
Tell me.

498
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,000
What is your real intention?

499
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:34,584
I...

500
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,792
I was commissioned by a person.

501
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:37,667
Who?

502
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,000
What do you want?

503
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:42,125
A foreigner.

504
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,292
The one who went...

505
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,542
to Baoziling with you?

506
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,542
San Xing,

507
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:53,667
how did you know?

508
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,542
You don't have to worry about that.

509
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,167
Tell me.

510
00:34:59,375 --> 00:34:59,918
How did you know...

511
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:01,125
about the blood zombie tomb?

512
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:08,876
Qiu De Kao took me there.

513
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,209
Qiu De Kao?

514
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:12,250
The foreigner I just said.

515
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,542
He's been living in
Changsha for a long time.

516
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,125
I know him.

517
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,167
Wen Jin.

518
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,042
San Xing.

519
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:30,250
Without your help,

520
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,667
I could've never made it to the team.

521
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:32,999
Thank you so much!

522
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:33,792
Lian Huan?

523
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:34,709
Lian Huan!

524
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,999
Carry the boxes for me, will you?

525
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:40,959
Sure.

526
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:41,792
I'll go right away.

527
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:42,501
Thanks.

528
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:43,751
San Xing.

529
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,292
-I'm go help them with the boxes.
-Thanks!

530
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,334
Be careful.

531
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,792
If you thought
Xie Lian Huan seemed fishy,

532
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,626
and you didn't want to
get involved with Qiu De Kao,

533
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,167
then why did you let Xie Lian Huan...

534
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,167
into the team?

535
00:35:58,918 --> 00:35:59,417
Kiddo,

536
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,250
would it matter if you disagreed?

537
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:02,792
Would it?

538
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,501
But I was thinking,

539
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,334
if he's here...

540
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,959
under my watch,

541
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,459
he won't escape me...

542
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,167
if he tried to do something.

543
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:17,292
Wen Jin,

544
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:18,709
when you go down,

545
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:19,501
remember to be careful.

546
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,667
I'm worried about you.

547
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,584
Don't you trust my skills?

548
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,459
Don't worry.

549
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:25,918
I'll take care of myself.

550
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,459
So,

551
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,083
I followed him underwater.

552
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,250
Looking at Xie Lian Huan's dumb face,

553
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:26,209
I stopped worrying...

554
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,501
when I saw him so afraid!

555
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,751
Do you know?

556
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,250
In the sea,

557
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,459
all those corpses...

558
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,209
were shaped in strange poses,

559
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,459
just like...

560
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,167
Just like the Dunhuang Murals!

561
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:40,083
Like this, like that.

562
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,250
Playing the zither
in a twisted form.

563
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,042
It's beautiful yet creepy.

564
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,792
Horribly creepy.

565
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,292
So the owner of the tomb...

566
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,292
wasn't satisfied with
the handcrafted paintings,

567
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:52,959
so he made the corpses
into one instead?

568
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:01,375
But how did Xie Lian Huan...

569
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,667
know about the secret?

570
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:08,083
Qiu De Kao told him.

571
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:10,918
He dragged Xie Lian Huan
into the scene.

572
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,959
I was so mad about it.

573
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,626
I wanted to finish him off...

574
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,751
once we got onshore!

575
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:22,959
Now that he's gone,

576
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:25,375
what's the use of it?

577
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,959
If according to what you said,

578
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,334
you were forced...

579
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,834
to join Xie Lian Huan into the tomb?

580
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,083
What an idiot.

581
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:48,709
You removed your mask
without even testing...

582
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:49,542
for oxygen here.

583
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,417
If this was a stuffy cave,

584
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,250
you would be dead.

585
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,584
But I'm fine, aren't I?

586
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:02,667
I can't believe there's air...

587
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:03,792
in such deep waters.

588
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,667
This sure is amazing.

589
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:24,876
Why is there so little air left?

590
00:40:26,876 --> 00:40:27,667
Xie Lian Huan.

591
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,000
Xie Lian Huan!

592
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,501
Xie Lian Huan had
little diving experience.

593
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:42,584
This brat...

594
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,999
had no control of his
oxygen consumption.

595
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,584
It was terrifying.

596
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,000
He could've died from it.
