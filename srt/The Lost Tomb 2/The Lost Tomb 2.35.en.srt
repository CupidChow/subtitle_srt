"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,880
"Episode 35"

3
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:09,542
Qi,

4
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:10,918
what do you know about this place?

5
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,042
Not much.

6
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:13,501
But I heard that there's...

7
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,959
a Snake Eye Copper Fish here.

8
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,751
That's why the tomb
has a mezzanine design.

9
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,626
Because the Mute Riders...

10
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,083
wanted to protect the copper fish.

11
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,375
Hence, the illusion of immortality...

12
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,417
on the third floor of the tomb.

13
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,834
It was so that those
in search of immortality...

14
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:32,042
could understand that
the spell doesn't exist.

15
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:33,999
And Lieutenant Zhang...

16
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,292
was the first person to get it.

17
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:38,834
Qi,

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,834
what do you know
about Lieutenant Zhang?

19
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,209
Not much too.

20
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,999
But I heard a rumor...

21
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,042
regarding his death.

22
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,501
Back then, he didn't believe
that General Zhang...

23
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,292
would actually destroy the secret
of the immortality spell.

24
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:51,999
But he still wanted to
protect the two siblings.

25
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,042
So he came up with a plan...

26
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,918
to make both of them give up.

27
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:00,876
General.

28
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:02,876
Forgive me for being blunt.

29
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:04,792
Ms. Qing Ping has been gone...

30
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:05,918
Qing Ping is my sister.

31
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,083
I trust her.

32
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,375
But they are husband
and wife after all.

33
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:12,959
She's a woman.

34
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,626
They tend to be blinded by love.

35
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,167
What if she took advantage...

36
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,083
Come with me.

37
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,584
Bu Xun.

38
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:57,375
You appeared without a sound.

39
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,626
I almost got a heart attack.

40
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,542
Did I wake you up?

41
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,459
No.

42
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,209
What are you looking for?

43
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,334
I couldn't sleep too.

44
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,000
I was looking for something to read.

45
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:14,751
What's wrong?

46
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,209
Why are you looking at me like that?

47
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:19,334
Bu Xun.

48
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,792
You're still the same.

49
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,334
You always keep
your thoughts to yourself...

50
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,000
and never share them with me.

51
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:27,999
We've been married a long time.

52
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:29,584
But I still feel...

53
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,000
like I'm an outsider.

54
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,792
Were you looking for
the immortality spell for Gao Yuan?

55
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,667
You said there's no such thing, right?

56
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,375
I believe you.

57
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,083
You don't.

58
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,167
You came to see me..

59
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,876
so you could look for it.

60
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:00,501
Bu Xun.

61
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,626
You know how Gao Yuan is.

62
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:05,876
When he wants something,

63
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,083
he gets it.

64
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,542
Why must you...

65
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,542
butt heads with him?

66
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,542
I've already told you.

67
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,250
Don't you remember?

68
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,292
He's my older brother.

69
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,083
With our parents dead,

70
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,542
he's the only family I have left,

71
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:22,709
aside from you.

72
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,167
Back then,
he suggested that I marry you...

73
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,083
and I did.

74
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:28,792
Because I know...

75
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,584
that he wouldn't harm me.

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,459
So whatever Gao Yuan asks of you,

77
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,584
be it wrong,

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,959
immoral,

79
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,542
something against your will,

80
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,125
you would still do it?

81
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:51,375
Yes.

82
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,999
I don't wish to defy him.

83
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,584
But it's my own wish...

84
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,417
to get married to you.

85
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,083
But, Bu Xun,

86
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,083
why did you marry me?

87
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,167
It wasn't for power,

88
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,250
so why?

89
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,083
Gao Yuan relies on you.

90
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,042
His trust for you from the start...

91
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,459
was always beyond me.

92
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:12,999
His willingness
to marry me off to you...

93
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,167
is proof of everything.

94
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,125
He wouldn't harm me, nor you!

95
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,334
Don't you get it?

96
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,501
All he wants...

97
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,751
is for the good of this family.

98
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,876
He wants us to be together forever!

99
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,125
Is he wrong?

100
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,584
Qing Ping.

101
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,834
I realised...

102
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,375
I know nothing...

103
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,876
about you and Gao Yuan.

104
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:41,999
That's because...

105
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,834
you never made an effort
to understand us.

106
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,542
You can't let go...

107
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,250
of the sense of nobility.

108
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:50,918
The bit of ideal...

109
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,876
that won't get you
even a spoonful of rice.

110
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:53,959
Zhang Bu Xun.

111
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,834
You're the one...

112
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,083
that wishes to be immortal.

113
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:00,375
No living person...

114
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,542
is without desire.

115
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,459
Gao Yuan is talented in all areas.

116
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:04,542
He's brave and ambitious.

117
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:05,626
He has more verve...

118
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,125
and ability than many people!

119
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:08,417
But, you?

120
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,999
The worldly things you speak of...

121
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:14,375
are nothing more...

122
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,125
than ideals from
having the upper hand.

123
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,292
Bu Xun.

124
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,083
Do you know...

125
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,375
what human sentiments are?

126
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,334
Do you know what love is?

127
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:32,792
You don't know.

128
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,501
Because I never once felt...

129
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:36,542
your concern for me,

130
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,209
nor your love!

131
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,375
And yet now,

132
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:42,000
you're trying to take
Gao Yuan's love away too.

133
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,292
Don't you think you're being cruel?

134
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:55,918
Right here.

135
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,083
It was here where someone had found...

136
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,417
the immortality spell...

137
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,542
more than a thousand years ago.

138
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,209
Master Wang.

139
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,375
Born in a prominent family,

140
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,584
high and mighty.

141
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,751
He wasn't even 18 years old.

142
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,334
An age of youthful energy.

143
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,209
But he gave it up.

144
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you know why?

145
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,792
Because he was a wimp,

146
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:17,501
a coward!

147
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,459
Wrong!

148
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,292
Because the longevity
of human sentiments and love...

149
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,417
is not built upon time.

150
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:30,584
Qing Ping.

151
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,959
I have to tell you I'm sorry.

152
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,959
You chose me...

153
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,083
but I couldn't give you happiness.

154
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,751
Perhaps I am too weak.

155
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:43,000
Because...

156
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,167
Because I really don't want...

157
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,375
to go against someone...

158
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,209
I respect and care about so much.

159
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:52,125
Now I'm watching Gao Yuan...

160
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,792
heading on a path of no return.

161
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,042
Right now...

162
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:57,584
Right now, I can no longer...

163
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,167
let him continue on.

164
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,918
What are you doing?

165
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,751
I'm sending you back to your brother.

166
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:08,918
Tell him...

167
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,334
I've destroyed everything I have here.

168
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,959
You should forget about me too.

169
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,459
Our relationship ends here.

170
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:16,959
My only wish is for you...

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,125
to find happiness.

172
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,375
What do you mean by that?

173
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,501
What exactly are you doing?

174
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:23,834
Once you're gone,

175
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,918
I'm going to blast this tomb.

176
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,417
So that you two...

177
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,459
can forget about it.

178
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:29,709
No.

179
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:31,209
No!

180
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,584
You can't destroy the tomb!

181
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,209
If you blast the tomb,

182
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,083
it's the same as destroying Gao Yuan.

183
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,667
You're going to kill him!

184
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,167
You can't.

185
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,042
No!

186
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:42,626
No!

187
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,667
You can't do that!

188
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,334
Qing Ping.

189
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:45,501
Qing Ping!

190
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:47,876
Wake up.

191
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,999
I'm begging you, please.

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,626
I don't want you to blow it up.

193
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,626
I can't let you destroy Gao Yuan.

194
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,125
I won't let you!

195
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,584
-Qing Ping.
-Stay away.

196
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,501
Bu Xun.

197
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,709
I'm begging you.

198
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,209
Just give it to me.

199
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,042
I won't let you destroy my brother.

200
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,667
Are you just going to let me die?

201
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,209
Am I worth nothing to you?

202
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,292
Give it to me.

203
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:35,334
Okay.

204
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:36,584
Qing Ping.

205
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,167
I'll give it to you.

206
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,000
Put down the gun.

207
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,584
Give it!

208
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,125
Okay.

209
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:39,792
Look.

210
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:42,292
This is what you and Gao Yuan...

211
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,292
have been searching for.

212
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,125
Bu Xun!

213
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,209
Stay back!

214
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:20,959
The rotting human.

215
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,584
This disease of rotting
the human's heart...

216
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,250
is the secret of immortality...

217
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,999
that you've been searching for.

218
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:27,584
Once in contact,

219
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:28,626
it will turn you...

220
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,542
into a monster...

221
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,999
that's neither human nor ghost.

222
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,417
Alas...

223
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,250
Alas, you will die.

224
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,459
I won't let you die.

225
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,417
I won't let you die!

226
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:38,876
Tell me.

227
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,584
What can I do to save you?

228
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,375
Tell me how to save you!

229
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,999
Somebody!

230
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,209
Somebody! Help!

231
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:49,709
Bu Xun, tell me...

232
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,125
what I should do!

233
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,209
Gao Yuan.

234
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,999
He must know how to save you!

235
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,334
I'll get Gao Yuan.

236
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,250
He will have a way!

237
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,042
I'll get Gao Yuan.

238
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,334
I'll get Gao Yuan!

239
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,667
Save him!

240
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:03,918
Lieutenant!

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,751
Stop!

242
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:06,501
Stay back.

243
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:07,417
Stay back.

244
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,042
Stay back, Cheng.

245
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,083
Now...

246
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:13,918
Now...

247
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,209
Finally, someone believes me.

248
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,000
Lieutenant.

249
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,459
What did you do?

250
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,918
Is that worth it?

251
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,167
Stay back.

252
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,834
Stay back, Cheng.

253
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,792
Cheng.

254
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,000
Qing Ping has left to get Gao Yuan.

255
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,292
He should be here soon.

256
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,999
Wait for him to come see me.

257
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,167
There's a contraption
on the stone wall.

258
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,250
When they're here,

259
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,000
I want you to shut the contraption.

260
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,417
Do you hear me?

261
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,876
You understand?

262
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,667
I won't leave you here.

263
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,792
Qing Ping?

264
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,709
Brother!

265
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,250
Save Bu Xun!

266
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,626
Hurry and save Bu Xun!

267
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,501
Save him, please!

268
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,375
Go!

269
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,876
I have to stay!

270
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,000
I must stay.

271
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,834
The real reason I did this...

272
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,250
is so that Qing Ping
and Gao Yuan could be free.

273
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,667
I want every person in
the world to know...

274
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,375
that the supposed immortality spell...

275
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,751
is actually witchcraft.

276
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,792
If I can't accomplish that

277
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,125
once and for all,

278
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,459
then I what I had done to myself...

279
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,125
would've been in vain.

280
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,959
There's no way...

281
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,125
I'm leaving you here!

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,667
You said your life belongs to me.

283
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:33,626
So this will be...

284
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:34,751
your last mission...

285
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,083
that you must complete!

286
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,042
Gao Yuan, save him, quick!

287
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,459
Do it.

288
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,834
Go now!

289
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:59,959
Gao Yuan, save him!

290
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,375
Gao Yuan!

291
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,209
Bu Xun.

292
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,667
Bu Xun!

293
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:08,834
General,

294
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,083
you can't go!

295
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,999
You'll die too.

296
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,918
Do you still not get it?

297
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,876
That's the immortality spell.

298
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,167
Do you see?

299
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,417
Do you get it?

300
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,292
Why aren't you helping him?

301
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,083
I'll save him.

302
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,459
Step aside.

303
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:36,918
Get lost.

304
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,375
It's too late!

305
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,417
Lieutenant Zhang resorted to this...

306
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,626
in order to make you understand!

307
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,292
Bu Xun!

308
00:18:59,042 --> 00:18:59,667
General.

309
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,667
General!

310
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,042
This is his last wish!

311
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,709
Lieutenant Zhang sacrificed himself...

312
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,334
in order to make you see!

313
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,459
I beg you to let him fulfill his wish!

314
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,417
Please let him be.

315
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,834
It's over, General.

316
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:34,999
At last,

317
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:35,999
after Adjutant Dou finished...

318
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:37,375
what Lieutenant Zhang had asked,

319
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,667
he came back here
and committed suicide.

320
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,792
It's the dramatic love story...

321
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,876
your grandfather wrote about
in his notebook.

322
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:44,918
How did you know all this?

323
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:45,709
Me?

324
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:46,792
That's a secret.

325
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:51,709
So, Mr. Blindman.

326
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,459
Do you know who it was...

327
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:54,584
that knocked me out?

328
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:55,584
The ones who attacked you...

329
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,292
were the ones who
attacked Master Hua.

330
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,876
But they were killed by Pan Zi.

331
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,501
Pan Zi?

332
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:05,834
Pan Zi's here?

333
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,501
Is Uncle San Xing here too?

334
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,626
What else do you know?

335
00:27:11,918 --> 00:27:12,751
Don't ask me why.

336
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:13,792
I never question the reason
for any task.

337
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:14,792
Where exactly is Uncle San Xing?

338
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,125
Make a guess.

339
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,834
Who's hidden inside the coffin?

340
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:23,083
We'll know once we open it.

341
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,042
You like riddles too much.

342
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:27,542
Come, all together.

343
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,709
One, two, three, lift.

344
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,083
Lift!

345
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,209
Up and away.

346
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,167
The Mute Rider General.

347
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,209
You know him?

348
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,334
Isn't he the one in the recording...

349
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,083
we saw at Qinling?

350
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,000
-What recording?
-Little Master and I both saw it.

351
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,250
A secret.

352
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,083
If you could see my eyes,

353
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,375
you'd know I'm being scornful.

354
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,542
But where's the copper fish?

355
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:45,667
I don't see any clues...

356
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,667
or leads.

357
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:47,417
Mr. Naive?

358
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,459
Lieutenant Zhang.

359
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,209
He was here.

360
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:55,042
He had to have gone through...

361
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:56,209
the coffin like us...

362
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,417
to get to this tomb.

363
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,042
You mean...

364
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,417
Lieutenant Zhang also saw...

365
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:01,834
the Mute Rider here.

366
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,542
Not only did he see the Mute Rider,

367
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:04,667
but also...

368
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,334
He must have discovered...

369
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,209
the secret to immortality.

370
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,042
Maybe the price to pay
for obtaining immortality...

371
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,501
is the incineration of body and soul.

372
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,584
He couldn't let that happen.

373
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,709
So, he didn't tell anyone.

374
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,209
No wonder he moved in.

375
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:24,959
He basically became the tomb guard.

376
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,209
Still, that doesn't explain...

377
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,999
where the Snake Eye Copper Fish is.

378
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,626
Nobody would touch...

379
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,542
a corpse containing poison.

380
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:36,083
So, the Snake Eye Copper Fish...

381
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:40,918
is on Lieutenant Zhang.

382
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,000
We should be glad...

383
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,501
that the one to find
the copper fish...

384
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,209
was someone like Lieutenant Zhang.

385
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,334
In Dou Cheng's diary,

386
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,792
he mentioned many times...

387
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,792
about not understanding
Lieutenant Zhang's decisions.

388
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,459
Turns out that Lieutenant Zhang...

389
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,667
protected the secret...

390
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,542
on his own for so many years.

391
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:09,417
What are you doing?

392
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:10,834
What am I doing?

393
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:11,584
You...

394
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,876
I didn't do anything.

395
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:13,542
Why?

396
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,334
Watch out, Fatty!

397
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:49,751
Fatty, what did you touch?

398
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:51,000
There must be some contraption on him!

399
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,125
Yu Hua, are you okay?

400
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:22,792
Yu Hua.

401
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,209
Jia Sha!

402
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,042
Xiao Zhu.

403
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,876
This is what you want, right?

404
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:54,876
There!

405
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:09,751
Take it!

406
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,083
Xiao Zhu!

407
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,999
Xiao Zhu!

408
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:37,959
Xiao Hua!

409
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,292
Yu Hua, let's go!

410
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:41,209
No!

411
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:43,250
Come on.

412
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,417
Do you wish to die too? Let's go!

413
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,209
-Let's go, Yu Hua.
-Quick!

414
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,417
-Fatty, come on!
-Run!

415
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:11,876
Now what?

416
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,751
What else?

417
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,626
Guns are useless.

418
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:20,584
We'll have to take him head on.

419
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,542
Say how nice if we had...

420
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,751
gone back the way we came.

421
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:26,542
We stand a better chance...

422
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,125
fighting the phantom soldiers.

423
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,792
The Puppeteer.

424
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,667
The lightning bugs are coming.

425
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:14,417
Fatty.

426
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,999
What did you say was coming?

427
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:19,792
Me and my foul mouth.

428
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:43,959
Careful.

429
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,458
Don't clump together. Spread out.

430
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,542
Qi.

431
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,292
You deal with the phantom soldiers.

432
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,834
The big boss owes me a life!

433
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:51,751
Wait.

434
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:53,918
Do you see it?

435
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:54,958
We can only stop the contraption...

436
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:55,998
by placing the medallion on him.

437
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:58,959
I'll get the medallion.

438
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,292
I'll keep him busy.

439
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,209
Follow me!

440
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,542
Be careful, guys!

441
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,042
Who was the one who died? Xiao Zhu?

442
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:18,751
Good.

443
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,459
I'll be buried with you today!

444
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,459
How many more explosives left,
Xing Yao?

445
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:40,042
Three.

446
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,250
Buy me more time. Go!

447
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,626
Just do what you have to.

448
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:08,626
Stop being a nuisance!

449
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:23,667
Xiao Hua!

450
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,292
Hey dude, I haven't had
the chance to ask.

451
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,751
You work for Xiao Hua, right?

452
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:52,792
Yes.

453
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,834
Why haven't I heard about you?

454
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:56,709
Watch out!

455
00:36:58,876 --> 00:36:59,584
Don't worry, dude.

456
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:00,999
I'm here.

457
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,792
You can focus on your drones.

458
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:50,709
Uncle San Xing.

459
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,083
What are you doing here?

460
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:56,334
Uncle.

461
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:58,125
Say something.

462
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,542
Why are you here?

463
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,292
Uncle.

464
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,083
What on earth is going on?

465
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,167
What happened?

466
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:12,709
Tell me!

467
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,709
Nothing happened.

468
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:17,459
Hurry back, boy.

469
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:19,584
Your friends are waiting.

470
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:22,209
Uncle.

471
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:24,083
Uncle!

472
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:26,125
Uncle San Xing!

473
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,417
Why are you still hiding
the truth from me?

474
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,667
I'm Wu Xie, Uncle.

475
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,334
I'm Wu Xie!

476
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:43,709
Listen up, kiddo.

477
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:45,876
If you don't go back now,

478
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:48,626
your friends are
definitely going to die!

479
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,000
Give me some power! Power!

480
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,459
Xiao Hua!

481
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:18,292
Xiao Hua...

482
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:19,417
How are your injuries?

483
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:20,626
I'm okay.

484
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:24,250
Fatty.

485
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,209
The contraption worked.

486
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:37,584
That was close. He's down.

487
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:39,918
The lightning bugs.

488
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,918
They created the illusion.

489
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,709
After numerous explosions,

490
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,334
the tomb's structure is crumbling.

491
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,042
We need to leave.

492
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:47,167
Let's go!

493
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:19,292
Careful.

494
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:33,667
Here.

495
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:41,918
Why is the door shut?

496
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,501
The door can only be opened
from the outside.

497
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,334
Who closed it?

498
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:51,959
The body is gone.

499
00:45:31,375 --> 00:00:00,000
To a good partnership.
