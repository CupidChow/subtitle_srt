"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,180
"Episode 12"

3
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:08,542
Should I...

4
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,584
call you Mr. Hendry...

5
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,167
or Mr. Qiu De Kao?

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,918
Qiu De Kao is fine.

7
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,250
When we speak Chinese,

8
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,375
using this name...

9
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,501
makes me feel friendlier.

10
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,083
Why did you bring me here?

11
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,876
Don't pretend.

12
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,167
There's no coincidence.

13
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,834
It's you who sent the message.

14
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:26,999
So,

15
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,876
have you seen what you wished for?

16
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:30,501
Snake Eye Copper Fish?

17
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,250
Yes.

18
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,709
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

19
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,209
Do you know?

20
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,667
After so many years of research,

21
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,918
I only found out that...

22
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,042
it was cast in Ming dynasty.

23
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,375
What are your thoughts?

24
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,751
You want to investigate Wang Zang Hai?

25
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,834
Young people think fast.

26
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:49,751
Of course,

27
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,417
when we talk about the
Snake Eye Copper Fish,

28
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,417
we think of the underwater
tomb of Paracel Islands,

29
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,042
and Wang Zang Hai.

30
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:56,584
But,

31
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,626
there should be two more...

32
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,834
Snake Eye Copper Fish...

33
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,709
in the Underwater Tomb.

34
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,667
Where are the other two?

35
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:05,375
What I'd like to know...

36
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,167
is how you got the copper fish
that you already have.

37
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,792
Wasn't Xie Lian Huan
the one who found it?

38
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:14,584
Xie Lian Huan was a very smart guy.

39
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,292
Unfortunately, he passed away...

40
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,250
when he was only about your age.

41
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,250
What a pity.

42
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,542
You knew Xie Lian Huan?

43
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:22,709
Yes.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Not only do I know Wu San Xing,

45
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,876
I also knew Xie Lian Huan.

46
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,209
 Do you want to know the story?

47
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:30,501
Me...

48
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,000
and your grandfather, Wu Lao Gou,

49
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,584
were both old friends of his.

50
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,167
I know more things about him...

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,292
than you do.

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,334
Before liberation,

53
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,999
there was only war,

54
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:43,959
robbery,

55
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,167
famine...

56
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,000
and tragedy in China.

57
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,375
In order to survive,

58
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,959
some people thought
to sell burial objects...

59
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:52,125
for money to buy food.

60
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,584
The Wu family...

61
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,999
was one of them.

62
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:56,751
At the time, your grandfather...

63
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,125
was only a kid.

64
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,459
This is bad news.

65
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:49,542
This is a blood zombie tomb.

66
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,000
If this thing goes south,

67
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,667
we will end up dead...

68
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,792
down there too.

69
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,167
Are you going down or not?

70
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:57,751
Yes or no?

71
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:58,501
Decide.

72
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,626
Enough talking.

73
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,125
You two old men...

74
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,083
can't even walk right.

75
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:02,918
Just stay up here.

76
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,792
My little brother and I will go.

77
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,334
I don't care what's down there.

78
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:07,626
I'll just shoot it.

79
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,999
The younger son in your family
is too arrogant for his own good.

80
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,792
You never know when...

81
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,167
he's going to get into trouble.

82
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,501
You need to educate him better.

83
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,918
This business we're in...

84
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,667
is more than waving
a Mauser around,

85
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,959
thinking you own the world.

86
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,792
You little rascal.

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,334
Is that the way you talk
to your grandpa?

88
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,042
When I was toiling under the sun,

89
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,542
you were still in
your mother's stomach,

90
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,375
eating poop.

91
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:37,792
Like our ancestors said,

92
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,042
blood is in the earth,
gold is with the corpse.

93
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,626
There's a blood zombie down there.

94
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,999
So, there has to be valuables!

95
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:43,918
If we don't enter,

96
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,375
then what did we come here for?

97
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,501
Enough of your back talk!

98
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:47,292
Stop.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,334
Weren't you the same...

100
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,542
when you were a boy?

101
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,417
Like they say,

102
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:53,667
the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

103
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:56,792
Dad.

104
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,167
Can't you not hurt my pride...

105
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,542
in front of my son?

106
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:06,667
Meeting a blood zombie...

107
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:07,792
can be serious.

108
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,584
Last time, your uncle...

109
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,459
found one of these
things in Luoyang...

110
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,501
and ended up like a lunatic.

111
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,667
No idea what took over him.

112
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,751
So are we going in or not?

113
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,083
I'll go first.

114
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,501
You follow behind me.

115
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,834
Er Bai will bring up
the rear with the spade.

116
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,292
San Xing will stay here.

117
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:32,792
No way.

118
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,626
If Er Bai gets to go,
I want to go too.

119
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,667
Stop making trouble for me, kid!

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,375
You're pissing me off!

121
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,792
That's enough.

122
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:42,292
I'll get you a gold knife later.

123
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,417
I don't need you to get it for me.

124
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,542
I can do it myself.

125
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,876
If all four of us go down,

126
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,000
it will be hard to retreat.

127
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:47,834
You keep watch here.

128
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,209
Keep a hold onto
the rope of the spade.

129
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,751
If you feel a tug on the rope,

130
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:51,959
quickly pull it up.

131
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,417
No.

132
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,334
Stop making trouble.

133
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,167
I'll find a big treasure for you.

134
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,000
Grandpa!

135
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,667
Are you guys through?

136
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,542
Not sure yet!

137
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,083
Stay where you are!

138
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:19,626
Hold the rope!

139
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:34,918
San Xing, pull!

140
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,584
Why give me a gun?

141
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:47,834
Dad!

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,876
Er Bai!

143
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:58,999
Don't come near!

144
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,083
My grandfather told you so much.

145
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,999
Looks like he did
treat you as his friend.

146
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,417
It's too bad.

147
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,292
He would never have guessed...

148
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,292
that a friend he sincerely treated...

149
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:35,999
stole away the silk book...

150
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,167
of Warring States period
that he and his dear father...

151
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,042
risked their lives to find!

152
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,792
And almost got him thrown in jail!

153
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,000
Many years later,

154
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,501
when I met Wu San Xing,

155
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,834
it was like seeing...

156
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,626
a young Wu Lao Gou.

157
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,667
But compared to your grandfather,

158
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,999
San Xing had much more greed.

159
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,209
Do you get it?

160
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,167
Maybe Lady Luck...

161
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,250
pulled an invisible string...

162
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,417
between me and the Wu family.

163
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:02,584
Wu San Xing and I
were meant to meet.

164
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,999
We actually got along better...

165
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,042
than Wu Lao Gou and I.

166
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,584
At the time,

167
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,667
I was the consultant
at Far East Art Department...

168
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,334
of New York Metropolitan Museum.

169
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:13,918
I wanted to collect...

170
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,083
more Chinese cultural
artifacts for the museum.

171
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,709
How are you able to talk
about such shameful actions...

172
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:19,999
as if they are so righteous?

173
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,751
Your Uncle San Xing...

174
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,417
was my contact in China.

175
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,542
He was a big help to me.

176
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,542
For instance,

177
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,667
he took me on an expedition to see...

178
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,626
the ancient tomb depicted
in the silk book of...

179
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:32,709
Warring States period.

180
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,459
Your uncle was a genius.

181
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,667
He deduced the location
of the blood zombie tomb...

182
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,918
based on fragments...

183
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,417
he got from your grandfather's words.

184
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,000
We had no trouble finding the place...

185
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,918
and subsequently entered the tomb.

186
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,918
But unfortunately,

187
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,459
we met some strange things...

188
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,751
inside the tomb...

189
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:53,959
and had to retreat.

190
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,918
What's worse was...

191
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,042
the tomb accidentally collapsed.

192
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,250
It was impossible to get inside again.

193
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:03,876
But,

194
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,792
the expedition that time
built a strong foundation...

195
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,667
for our partnership.

196
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,334
Not long after,

197
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,584
we heard about
an archaeological team...

198
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,209
that had plans to uncover
the Paracel Islands Underwater Tomb.

199
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,417
And thus,

200
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,501
I asked Wu San Xing...

201
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,584
to sneak into the team.

202
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,626
Your uncle successfully
attached himself...

203
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,209
to the archeology team...

204
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,417
and discovered the location
of the underwater tomb.

205
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:32,667
The night before...

206
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,667
the team had prepared to move out,

207
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,751
your uncle secretly
went into the tomb.

208
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,918
But Xie Lian Huan found out...

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,876
and he followed him.

210
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:42,334
I'm sure you can guess the rest.

211
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,334
I can't!

212
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,167
Why?

213
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,209
The two got into a fight...

214
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,250
and Xie Lian Huan died.

215
00:11:58,834 --> 00:11:59,709
How did he die?

216
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,918
When he died,

217
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,751
Xie Lian Huan was holding
the copper fish in his hand.

218
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,876
Your uncle later handed it...

219
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,083
to the Xie family...

220
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,334
and received their forgiveness.

221
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:11,542
And then,

222
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,501
he used the excuse
of wanting to find the culprit...

223
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,167
to help avenge Xie Lian Huan,

224
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,584
he obtained the copper fish...

225
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,209
from Mr. Xie's hands...

226
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:22,792
before selling it to me.

227
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,667
You're lying.

228
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,584
It doesn't matter
what your uncle did...

229
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,626
to obtain the copper fish.

230
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:28,459
But I can tell you now...

231
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,459
that I legally purchased it
with my own money.

232
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,542
If you wish to have it,

233
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,083
I can sell it to you without...

234
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,375
going through an auction.

235
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,626
There's no need for you to steal.

236
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:48,417
I don't believe you.

237
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,459
Why would I lie to you?

238
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,417
Ning.

239
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,584
Where are you taking me?

240
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,083
Don't you think your boss is strange?

241
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,584
He called me all the way here...

242
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,999
just to tell me stories
about my ancestors?

243
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,042
Ning.

244
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,417
What exactly is your
connection with your boss?

245
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,584
Don't you find it weird?

246
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,250
He doesn't look his age at all.

247
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:27,999
Ning.

248
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,000
Ning.

249
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,584
How is your hand?

250
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,709
Listen, I didn't mean to hurt you.

251
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,000
I was panicking at the time.

252
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:40,542
But you have to admit...

253
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,751
back at the underwater tomb,

254
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,042
despite you trying to kill us,

255
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,334
Fatty, Little Master and I...

256
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,542
still did our best to save you.

257
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,000
When did we ever do
anything wrong to you?

258
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:48,542
But look at what you're doing.

259
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,959
What on earth is this?

260
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:51,626
Ning.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,584
Ning!

262
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:56,751
Go!

263
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:58,209
Don't touch me.

264
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,542
I'm not going any farther.

265
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:02,626
Ning.

266
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,709
I dare you to turn around and face me.

267
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:08,751
I always thought...

268
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,918
that after going through so much,

269
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:10,459
we would at least be comrades...

270
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,459
if not friends.

271
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:12,334
But you...

272
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:13,667
You didn't even blink...

273
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,000
when you betrayed me!

274
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,501
Is your heart made of steel?

275
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,626
You finally turned around.

276
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:30,542
Say it.

277
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,876
It's okay.

278
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:37,999
I get it.

279
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,167
You don't know how
to face me right now.

280
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,042
But it's okay.

281
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,125
If you want,

282
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,584
you can tell me everything you know.

283
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:46,792
Okay?

284
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,250
Ning. Ning!

285
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,792
Go! Hurry up.

286
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,584
Ning!

287
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,459
Let me out!

288
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,626
How could you lock me up?

289
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,167
Ning!

290
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:01,250
Madam, job's done.

291
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,709
How could you do this to me?

292
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:05,000
Say something, Ning!

293
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,626
Ning!

294
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,292
The moment you return
the Snake Eye Copper Fish,

295
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,250
you will be released.

296
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,042
How would I know where it is?

297
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:12,834
Besides,

298
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,501
I'd never tell you if I knew!

299
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,375
Then, you can die here.

300
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,626
Ning!

301
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:21,959
Ning!

302
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:31,542
Let me out!

303
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,042
Anyone out there?

304
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,417
Anyone?

305
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,501
The wound is pretty deep.

306
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:43,584
Stop moving so much.

307
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,501
Do you feel okay?

308
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:48,459
I'm fine.

309
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,459
What are we going to do now?

310
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,042
We have to think of a way...

311
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:56,334
to locate Wu Xie.

312
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,417
Right.

313
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,834
Looks like...

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,250
we have no choice
but to get Xiao Yu's help.

315
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:04,542
Who?

316
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:05,626
Xiao Yu.

317
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,709
You guys know Xiao Yu?

318
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:07,834
Yeah.

319
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:08,918
Xiao Hua and Xiao Yu...

320
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:09,999
are very good friends.

321
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,501
That's great.

322
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:12,042
Since you're all close,

323
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,125
I'll call him right now.

324
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,250
No need.

325
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,000
Xiu Xiu.

326
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,584
Contact him using my computer.

327
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:20,501
Okay.

328
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,292
Go, go. Do it, quick.

329
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:20,999
Ning.

330
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:23,542
Ning!

331
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:08,584
Start the drone.

332
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,292
The patrol changes every 5 minutes.

333
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:32,999
Security is tight.

334
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,209
That's just on the surface.

335
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,000
If we really stepped on their tails,

336
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,792
there would probably
be an army to greet us.

337
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,918
There's only a slim chance of success.

338
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,209
Typically, the plan...

339
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,626
for such a situation...

340
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,626
is to infiltrate and
cause a commotion,

341
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,626
divert their attention...

342
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,042
so a comrade could get close...

343
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,000
to the target.

344
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,584
But judging from the situation,

345
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,876
once I cause any commotion,

346
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,167
I'm as good as dead.

347
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:56,834
I'll do it alone.

348
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:57,334
No.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,751
You can't.

350
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,751
You're injured.

351
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,000
That's not what I meant.

352
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,876
I'm fine with getting caught.

353
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,042
The fact is, with your injury,

354
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,959
you might not even make it inside,

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,667
understand?

356
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:08,792
So what then?

357
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,250
Xiao Hua is injured...

358
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,751
but we have to save Wu Xie.

359
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:12,167
Right,

360
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:13,999
it's not like you could go with me.

361
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,792
I'll go. Let me go.

362
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:17,083
You can take me, Fatty.

363
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,209
-Don't be stupid.
-I'll go.

364
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,209
Dummy Zhang.

365
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:27,709
Done.

366
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,209
Problem solved.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,626
You go.

368
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,751
Time for you to perform.

369
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:53,459
Ning.

370
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:56,584
Ning.

371
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,125
Anyone?

372
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:00,626
I need water.

373
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,918
Water.

374
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,167
Need water...

375
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:41,292
Little Master!

376
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:14,876
Little Master.

377
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,167
Well?

378
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,792
Can you move now?

379
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,125
Fatty.

380
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,042
I can't believe you're playing
games at a time like this.

381
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,834
Can that Little Master really make it?

382
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,792
Don't you know my
connection with Mr. Naive?

383
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,501
I'm relaxed enough to play games.

384
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,334
So, listen to me when I tell you...

385
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,000
that you can be rest
assured with Little Master.

386
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,584
If you don't think he can,

387
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:54,584
who else could.

388
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,250
Nobody can, okay?

389
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:57,792
Rest assured.

390
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,167
Keep calm.

391
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:04,417
Wu Xie!

392
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,375
Wu Xie.

393
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:11,584
How are you?

394
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:12,459
Are you okay?

395
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:13,083
I'm okay.

396
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,834
See what I told you?

397
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:16,792
What happened?

398
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:18,501
You didn't get rape I hope.

399
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:19,250
Let me see.

400
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:20,292
Damn you.

401
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,667
I said it.

402
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:24,626
Little Master.

403
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,375
Our Little Master.

404
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,209
Nothing is impossible for him.

405
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,459
We should get out of here.

406
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,834
We don't want them to catch up.

407
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,584
Let's go together, Little Master.

408
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:37,959
Little Master?

409
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:39,999
Little Master!

410
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,334
It's good that he left. Come on.

411
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:49,667
We need to go too. Hurry up.

412
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:51,876
Wu Xie.

413
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:54,459
You know how Little Master is.

414
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:55,542
Let's go. He'll be fine.

415
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,459
Now.

416
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:23,959
That Little Master,
our Little Master...

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,876
is a little like Vegeta...

418
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:25,626
in Dragon Ball.

419
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,042
He appears at critical moments...

420
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,000
and disappears right after
the problem is solved.

421
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:30,626
He sure is dependable.

422
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,751
If my Xiao Hua hadn't been injured,

423
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:33,751
there would be no need for him.

424
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,876
Where are we going exactly?

425
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,334
To the Northern airport.

426
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:41,959
I guess that's the best option.

427
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,125
A text from Xiao Yu.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,083
We've been discovered!

429
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:47,751
They're on our tail!

430
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:49,751
About 2 to 3 km out.

431
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,000
Fatty, take this.

432
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:51,626
Wait.

433
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:56,918
It'll be fine.

434
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:57,834
Sit tight.

435
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:14,334
Wu Xie.

436
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,792
A text from your uncle.

437
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,792
"Star rises in the empty sky."

438
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,999
"Traveling girl of
the Sky Festival..."

439
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:28,667
"meets with me."

440
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,501
What does that mean?

441
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:36,209
It's a riddle.

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,584
Does "star" mean the stars in the sky?

443
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:39,834
Like a horoscope?

444
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,501
My uncle doesn't know
about horoscopes.

445
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,209
The term here probably means...

446
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:45,125
asterism.

447
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,042
Asterism?

448
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,501
So he should mean...

449
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,250
the Star Stallion of
Vermillion Bird of the South.

450
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:54,751
Vermillion Bird is in the South.

451
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:56,501
Star Stallion.

452
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:57,709
Seven stars.

453
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,709
Depicts North.

454
00:27:59,167 --> 00:27:59,918
A bad omen.

455
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:01,626
Black Tortoise of the North.

456
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,083
Emptiness Rat.

457
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,250
Two stars.

458
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,209
Depicts South.

459
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:06,292
A good omen.

460
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,125
A bad omen becomes a good omen.

461
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:09,918
From South to North.

462
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:12,459
Wait a minute.

463
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:13,999
The airport is in the South.

464
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,042
The North.

465
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:16,417
Is your uncle telling us...

466
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:17,751
to go to the train station?

467
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:19,834
If the airport is a no go,

468
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,292
leaving from the train station...

469
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,834
is worth a try.

470
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:24,834
But what about time?

471
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,417
Figure it out quickly.

472
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,042
The next line said,

473
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,501
traveling girl of the Sky Festival.

474
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,959
I think it means the time.

475
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,375
Sky Festival.

476
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,876
The Emptiness Rat is also
known as the Sky Festival.

477
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,959
Which is the Winter Solstice.

478
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:44,876
Winter Solstice usually falls on...

479
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,209
December 21 or 22...

480
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,083
of the Gregorian calendar.

481
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,125
But it's not December.

482
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,000
Twelve.

483
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,459
At 12:21...

484
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:54,417
or 12:22?

485
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,501
Mr. Wu...

486
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,083
is particular about time
down to the minute.

487
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:02,667
I don't think that's it.

488
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,834
The Emptiness Mansion
was already mentioned.

489
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:06,876
I don't think the next line
means the same thing.

490
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:08,709
So the Sky Festival
mentioned here...

491
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:10,667
isn't Winter Solstice.

492
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,167
Could it mean the 21st hour?

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,292
Traveling the Sky Festival.

494
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:31,876
There's a festival in Fuyang, Hebei...

495
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,042
called Sky Mending Festival.

496
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,667
Uncle San Xing took me
there when I was young.

497
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:37,334
The festival takes place...

498
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,959
on January 21 of the Lunar calendar.

499
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,584
I remember a local legend...

500
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,542
about a traveling girl
fetching pearls.

501
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,792
So the "traveling girl
of the Sky Festival"...

502
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,417
is probably talking about...

503
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,292
the number 21.

504
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,918
Twenty-one.

505
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,459
So don't you think it's the 21st hour?

506
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,667
I think it means Platform 21.

507
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:02,250
Fatty.

508
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,167
Get us to the train station.

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,501
Sure.

510
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:12,083
Wu Xie.

511
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:13,999
Your uncle sent another message.

512
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,542
He said not to go
to the train station.

513
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:16,542
There's a blockade there.

514
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:19,000
"Look for Snake at the river port."

515
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:23,167
What Star Stallion and Stallion Star.

516
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,501
So much for a good omen.

517
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,918
We racked our brains for nothing.

518
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:27,999
Mr. Wu...

519
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,834
sure knows how to tease.

520
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:41,542
Snake.

521
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:43,542
Snake?

522
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:45,709
Mr. Snake.

523
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:47,501
Rattlesnake?

524
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:50,709
Cobra snake?

525
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,542
Fatty.

526
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,501
Don't you know the situation?

527
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:04,709
It's not time for you to grab food.

528
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,250
We still need to eat while on the run.

529
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,042
You know nothing, Missy.

530
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:11,918
Snake!

531
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,751
Thanks for the stuff!

532
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:15,501
Why isn't he here?

533
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,959
This... Isn't this...?

534
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,542
I don't know which one.

535
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,542
Let's just go with this one.

536
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,167
Hurry up.

537
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,334
What are you people doing?

538
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:29,792
Why did you come...

539
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:30,918
barging in like this?

540
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,834
You're taking stuff because
the owner is not around?

541
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,999
Wait, sorry. But you are...

542
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,417
Call me Snake.

543
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,209
You're Snake?

544
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,250
You're Snake?

545
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:40,876
Why?

546
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,626
Which one of you...

547
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:44,501
is Wu San Xing's nephew?

548
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:45,876
I am.

549
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,125
He asked me to look for you.

550
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,751
How are you two related?

551
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:49,959
Where is he right now?

552
00:31:51,584 --> 00:31:53,042
-Xiao Hua.
-You're Wu Xie?

553
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:54,876
Not bad.

554
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:56,667
Compared to your uncle,

555
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:57,751
that old scoundrel,

556
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,667
you're much more energetic.

557
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,834
That's right, agreed.

558
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,792
Wu Xie,

559
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:03,042
they're catching up.

560
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:04,375
Hey.

561
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:06,834
Snake, we really need your help.

562
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:08,042
We really do.

563
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:10,375
What are you doing?

564
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,083
Do I look like...

565
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,417
I'm in need of money?

566
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,250
No.

567
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,542
You... Not at all, no.

568
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:18,959
Snake.

569
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:20,626
This time,

570
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:22,083
we're really in trouble.

571
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,417
We're being chased.

572
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,999
You're the only one
who can help us now.

573
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,542
That old scoundrel, Wu San Xing.

574
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,999
He didn't contact me
for over 10 years.

575
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,042
When he finally does, it's trouble.

576
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,042
Yes, that old man is indeed...

577
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,083
All right.

578
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:37,876
I've already prepared the boat.

579
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:39,501
Thanks, Snake.

580
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,751
Okay, let's go, little scoundrel.

581
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,626
Where are those guys?

582
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,834
Sorry, I don't understand
alien language.

583
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm warning you.

584
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:19,584
Don't bully us Chinese.

585
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:25,167
Where are they?

586
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:26,751
Who?

587
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,083
Four young guys.

588
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,876
There's nobody here.

589
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:39,709
Chase them, go.

590
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,667
Wait a second, miss.

591
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,626
None of the boats here...

592
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:45,999
have keys.

593
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:46,959
Don't believe me?

594
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:48,792
You're free to check.

595
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,584
Hurry up.

596
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:51,751
Go to the next port.

597
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,709
This adventure...

598
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,000
is a little tricky.

599
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:09,250
But we have help
from our Little Master,

600
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,834
Black Blindman...

601
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,876
and also Uncle San Xing.

602
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,000
Although your uncle
is a little mysterious.

603
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,876
All that riddle about Star Stallion,

604
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,000
bad omen and what not.

605
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,792
But it's going well, isn't it?

606
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:22,834
Smells good.

607
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:24,751
Want some, guys?

608
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:26,125
Stop eating.

609
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,000
Ning reached the port just now.

610
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,959
Hopefully, Snake got out of there.

611
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:33,709
No.

612
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,834
Ning isn't heartless.

613
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,751
Here you go being naive again.

614
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,209
Xiao Hua.

615
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:53,751
Captain,

616
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:55,959
is there a place to stop nearby?

617
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:56,876
We'd like to get off.

618
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,417
Why are we stopping the boat?

619
00:34:58,584 --> 00:34:59,417
Xiao Hua is...

620
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:05,250
Ning and her men...

621
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,375
will be waiting for us
at the next port.

622
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:07,918
We have to get off here.

623
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,000
But...

624
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:12,626
I don't like that Ning.

625
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:14,876
But Mr. Naive here likes her.

626
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,834
Captain, please stop
the boat in front.

627
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,292
Thank you.

628
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:17,459
Little rascal.

629
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,125
Where are the people on board?

630
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,751
They got off on the way here.

631
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:06,292
Uncle San Xing.

632
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,167
What is your connection
with Qiu De Kao?

633
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,250
Watch your tone.

634
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,167
Who did you learn it from?

635
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,083
You're talking to your uncle.

636
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:19,792
Where are your manners?

637
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:20,751
Uncle,

638
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,209
do you know what I've been
through the past month?

639
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:24,209
Ning told me...

640
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,083
that you went missing
in the South China Sea.

641
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,083
I went there to search for you...

642
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,292
and almost lost my
life in the process!

643
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:28,083
I returned to Hangzhou...

644
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,000
and asked Pan Zi where you went.

645
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,417
He said you went traveling.

646
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:31,375
I then came here...

647
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,959
after getting a lead on the
Snake Eye Copper Fish.

648
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,709
And discovered you're with Qiu De Kao.

649
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:35,751
Why did you tell Xiao Hua...

650
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:36,584
about the copper fish...

651
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:37,667
and not me?

652
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,042
Throughout my life,

653
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,000
there are countless things...

654
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:41,999
I never told you.

655
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,834
Because I didn't want you
to get caught up blindly.

656
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:45,918
Fine.

657
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:47,459
Tell me one thing.

658
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:49,999
What exactly is your
connection with Qiu De Kao?

659
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:50,709
Boy!

660
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:52,999
I'm warning you.

661
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,334
What my connection
with Qiu De Kao is,

662
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:57,626
is unrelated to you.

663
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:58,250
Understood?

664
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,792
What do you mean unrelated?

665
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,375
You and Qiu De Kao want
to raid the underwater tomb.

666
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,584
That's a national treasure!

667
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:03,375
Who gave you two the right...

668
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,334
to raid it on your own?

669
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,584
Don't tell me...

670
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,000
you're really working
with those relic dealers?

671
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:12,167
Uncle.

672
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,334
I wish I could keep my hands off...

673
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,459
certain things too.

674
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:18,209
But they had to happen before my eyes.

675
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:19,375
And they're all about you.

676
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:20,292
I had to get involved.

677
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:22,292
Uncle,

678
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,375
if you were me...

679
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,083
and everyone is telling you...

680
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,334
that your uncle is a scoundrel.

681
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,250
Not to mention,
all the things you experienced...

682
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,542
support that point.

683
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,083
Would you not want
to find out the truth?

684
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:34,876
Uncle,

685
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,250
we finally have some time alone...

686
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,125
to talk things through face to face.

687
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,459
Why must you still be so secretive?

688
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,876
Listen up, boy.

689
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,083
If someone is calling your uncle...

690
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:52,375
a scoundrel in front of you,

691
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,375
they are either lying...

692
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,167
of they're afraid of me.

693
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,125
Remember that.

694
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,209
I don't know what's
come over me lately.

695
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,584
I keep thinking about you as a kid.

696
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,292
You would pester me all the time.

697
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:07,709
Do this, Uncle.

698
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,083
Do that, Uncle.

699
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,792
Teach me this, Uncle.

700
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,667
Teach me that, Uncle.

701
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,000
You were so adorable back then.

702
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:15,584
What happened?

703
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:17,834
You've grown up.

704
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,667
You know the industry.

705
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:21,999
So, you're challenging me now?

706
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:23,834
You're even doubting me?

707
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:26,250
Uncle.

708
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,626
I never once doubted you.

709
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:30,501
You're the one I trust the most...

710
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:31,876
in this entire world.

711
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:33,959
But there are so many things...

712
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:34,626
on my mind right now.

713
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,542
Nobody has the answers,

714
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,501
but you.

715
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,000
So I don't want you to lie to me.

716
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,417
Ning works for Qiu De Kao.

717
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,626
She went underwater with me.

718
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,751
She knew what was going on,

719
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,999
but I was clueless...

720
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,167
and almost died down there.

721
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:55,999
I know that...

722
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,125
you went to the
underwater tomb before.

723
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,709
Was it you who told them about it?

724
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:02,999
The underwater tomb...

725
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:05,375
is a trauma that I...

726
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,000
will never be able to forget.

727
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,375
You know very well...

728
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:12,083
that I don't like talking about it.

729
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,667
Is it because of Aunt Wen Jin?

730
00:40:27,334 --> 00:40:28,334
That story...

731
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:30,999
I'd have to start from my dad.

732
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:32,417
Anyway,

733
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,667
during those days,

734
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,125
there was a saying
circulating Changsha.

735
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:36,876
It read,

736
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,125
blood is in the earth,
gold is with the corpse.

737
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:40,334
Do you know it?

738
00:40:42,459 --> 00:40:43,250
Yes, I've heard.

739
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:44,751
But I don't really know...

740
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:45,876
what it's about.

741
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,667
When the shovel hits the earth...

742
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,083
and you see blood,

743
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:51,999
that tomb...

744
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,375
no matter the situation,

745
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,918
is called a blood zombie tomb.

746
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,334
The descendants of
anyone buried there...

747
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,542
would have good fortune and success.

748
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,542
If that's not enough,

749
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:04,042
they might even become the emperor.

750
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:05,250
Of course,

751
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,667
that is only a legend.

752
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,751
But the blood zombie tomb...

753
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,209
is full of dangers.

754
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,292
Not many of those...

755
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,834
who went down came back alive.

756
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,000
Survival is tough, boy.

757
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,083
All the hardships the Wu family...

758
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,999
had to go through to survive.

759
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,042
Thinking about it
brings tears to my eyes.

760
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,876
Three lives from the
Wu family were lost...

761
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,709
in exchange for the 
Warring States silk book.

762
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:37,667
My grandfather lost his life too.

763
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,542
That silk book...

764
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,876
was stolen by Qiu De Kao.

765
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,626
Remember that man,

766
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,876
Qiu De Kao.

767
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,751
Later, in China,

768
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:48,501
he worked with relic con men...

769
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,375
and did every bad thing imaginable.

770
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,542
Just think about it.

771
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,501
Your uncle...

772
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:55,125
working with him?

773
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,667
Sometimes, I'd dream about...

774
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:00,999
killing him once and for all.

775
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:02,876
The connection...

776
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,000
was formed at Baoziling.

777
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,667
After that,

778
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:08,999
I thought about it in more detail.

779
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,292
The blood zombie tomb...

780
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,959
is probably located at
Mangshan, near Guizizhai.

781
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,000
Unexpectedly,

782
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,918
Xie Lian Huan and Qiu De Kao...

783
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,876
showed up too.

784
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,292
Have I told you before...

785
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,959
that Xie Lian Huan and I look alike?

786
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:32,542
No, you haven't.

787
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:37,375
Uncle,

788
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:40,459
are you saying that...

789
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,292
the one working with Qiu De Kao...

790
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,542
was Xie Lian Huan?

791
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,209
Because you two look alike,

792
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,083
so everyone thinks it's you?
