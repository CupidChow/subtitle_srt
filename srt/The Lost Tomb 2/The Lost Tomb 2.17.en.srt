"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,150
"Episode 17"

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,160
What's up with the face?

4
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
It's a Terracotta Sacrifice.

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
In ancient wars,

6
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
success was measured
by the number of kills.

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
A whole body would
be too heavy to move.

8
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,560
So, they'd cut off the head instead.

9
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
See, this head is...

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,480
stuck on a terracotta...

11
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
because he was buried as...

12
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,400
a sacrifice.

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,000
Wait.

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,720
Can't they just do what
Qin Shi Huang did with his...

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Terracotta Army?

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,720
Must they do this?

17
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
It's so creepy.

18
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,360
Fatty.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,600
Look!

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
There are more terracottas
as we go deeper.

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,480
This should be the place.

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,440
Let's go!

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,520
Wait a minute.

24
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,320
Someone's been here.

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
Could it be Lao Pao and his gang?

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,920
They have to be
rather skilled to get here.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,680
Be careful after we get inside.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Let's go.

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
Let's go.

30
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
Come, come here.

32
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,040
Let's go.

33
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,440
We're out of road.

34
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,800
Fatty.

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,240
There's an entrance over there.

36
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
The water is pretty deep here.

37
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,600
-Be careful.
-Wait!

38
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
Wait, wait, come back!

39
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,600
What?

40
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
You don't know this, right?

41
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,240
Have you watched "Man vs. Wild"?

42
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Bear Grylls...

43
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,000
only had to wrap his
phone with one of these...

44
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,280
and it will be water resistant,

45
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,560
you can still use it too.

46
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
You better learn this!

47
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
You learned it, right?

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,000
What about you?

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
Do you want this too?

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,320
You should save your energy,

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
and use it on something else.

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's go.

53
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,960
Let's go.

54
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,040
No, wait! I need a break!

55
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,880
I'm freezing!

56
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,280
Fatty.

57
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,760
I think...

58
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,640
there must be something in this place.

59
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm just worried...

60
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
that there's nothing here!

61
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,640
What kind of road is this?

62
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,960
It's so terribly done!

63
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
Say, the owner of this tomb...

64
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,280
This is such a big tomb,

65
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,160
why aren't there any roads?

66
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
Do you think that he spent all
his money on building the tomb...

67
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,160
and didn't have any
left to make roads?

68
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,920
This should be the outer bounds...

69
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,800
of the entire mausoleum!

70
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,040
Look!

71
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,920
The terracottas surrounding
it are not completed.

72
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
This should be where the artisans
quarried and carved the terracottas.

73
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,360
I think...

74
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,160
This should be what
Mr. Ma have mentioned...

75
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
The main burial chamber
that's used for the altar.

76
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Let me tell you,

77
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
it better be that...

78
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,280
and not just a giant earth pit!

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,120
Or it'd be like a dung beetle
meeting someone with diarrhea.

80
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,160
A waste...

81
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,960
A waste of time.

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,080
Let's go.

83
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,440
You won't feel cold
after you start swimming.

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,600
-Let's go.
-Swim, swim, swim.

85
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,720
Fatty!

86
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Fatty!

87
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,520
Fatty!

88
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Fatty!

89
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,400
Mr. Naive!

90
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Mr. Naive!

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,720
You got dragged down too?

92
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,720
No!

93
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,120
Underwater....

94
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,440
Fatty!

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Something's down there!

96
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
What is it?

97
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,560
I don't know!

98
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
Fatty!

99
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,560
Sayonara.

100
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Come back!

101
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,120
-Come back!
-Fatty.

102
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,380
-Come back!
-Are you okay?

103
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,037
I'm fine.

104
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,680
-I'll turn you into a grilled fish!
-Let's leave!

105
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,360
We should save ourselves first.
Let's go!

106
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
Mr. Naive, where did it go?

107
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,320
Hurry!

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Mr. Naive!

109
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
Mr. Naive! You...

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,120
Are you okay?

111
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm fine.

112
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,480
I won't let you off easily.

113
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,440
Darn it!

114
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,360
Don't be rash!

115
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
We still have a way out.

116
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,360
Let's go back!

117
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Hurry up!

118
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,880
Just you wait!

119
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,560
Fatty, hurry!

120
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
The door is closing!

121
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,160
Let's go underwater!

122
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Let's go!

123
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,360
Mr. Naive!

124
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
What are you trying to do?

125
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,840
If we die, we die together!

126
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
Hurry up and leave!

127
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
We can't both die here!

128
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
How can I leave?

129
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
Mr. Naive!

130
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Listen to me!

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,120
You must find a way to get out!

132
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Stay alive!

133
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
Without me by your side,

134
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,240
don't come to these places anymore!

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Mr. Naive, what are you saying?
I can't hear what you say!

136
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,560
I can't leave you here alone!

137
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Tell my uncle...

138
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
to find a partner...

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,440
and stop causing troubles!

140
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
Tell him that yourself!

141
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Of all human bonds,

142
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,000
nothing beats a brotherly bond.

143
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
If you believe, then stop doubting.

144
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
If you have any other questions,

145
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,760
ask yourself first.

146
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,480
Let it go, the wind is
sweeping through my world.

147
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,600
The hatred that I feel proves
that my love has failed.

148
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
Because they can't take it...

149
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Some people went to the extremes,

150
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,480
yet it did not turn out as expected,

151
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,000
and my dreams were taken in exchange.

152
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,040
My fault.

153
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Wu Xie.

154
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,760
Wu Xie.

155
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,120
Little Master!

156
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,880
-Little Master!
-Wu Xie.

157
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,120
You are...

158
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
You... Why are you here?

159
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
It's me.

160
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,200
Lao...

161
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Lao Yang?

162
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,120
Lao... Lao Yang.

163
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,120
Lao Yang!

164
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,200
Why are you here?

165
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,160
It's... It's been a while.

166
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,560
You saved me just now?

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,440
Did you see...

168
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
my friend?

169
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,920
Fatty.

170
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Fatty!

171
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,320
Fatty!

172
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,680
Fatty!

173
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,080
If you friend is dead,

174
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
his body would've floated up.

175
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
There are no bodies in the water,

176
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,000
he... he must be alive.

177
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,560
He probably got washed
away by the water.

178
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,840
This...

179
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,760
Is it a Siberian taimen?

180
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,080
It's the king of freshwater regions.

181
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,800
It...it's very vicious.

182
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Th...this one is considered small.

183
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Then, why would this place...

184
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
have a Siberian taimen?

185
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,400
I... I don't know.

186
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,360
Never mind.

187
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Let's not talk about
this fish anymore.

188
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,080
You've been in the
mountains for years,

189
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,120
yet you didn't tell me?

190
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,920
What kind of friend are you?

191
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,600
I... I don't know how long
I've been here either.

192
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Three years ago, I remember...

193
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,880
that you went somewhere with a Mr. Ma.

194
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,440
This was the place
that you were headed?

195
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,360
Yes.

196
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,280
How did you know?

197
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm very timid.

198
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,840
Once Mr. Ma got caught,

199
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,000
I panicked.

200
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,360
I thought of hiding out
on this mountain.

201
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,120
I didn't expect that I would
end up hiding for 3 years.

202
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,560
Shave your beard first.

203
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,760
Lao Yang!

204
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,920
I was still thinking of you, you know.

205
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,520
We've known each other since
we were in elementary school.

206
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,120
Why didn't I notice...

207
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,160
that you were such a stubborn person?

208
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,080
Say, if you went to jail with Mr. Ma,

209
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,120
it would be better
than your current state.

210
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
At least your mother...

211
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
still knows where you are.

212
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
But now...

213
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Does your mom know that
you're living in the mountains?

214
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,840
She must be worried sick.

215
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,440
Stay close.

216
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
There are 3 people's footprints here.

217
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,160
One would be Wu Xie,

218
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,200
one would be Fatty Wang,

219
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,760
and there's someone else.

220
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,760
I don't have that
person's information.

221
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
But judging from the footprints,

222
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,920
it should be someone
around 180 centimeters tall,

223
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
weighs 70 kilograms, male.

224
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,240
He didn't get close to
Wu Xie and Fatty Wang,

225
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
so he should be stalking them.

226
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,400
Wu Xie's curiosity is really strong.

227
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
Instead of staying on track
and looking for the Bronze Tree,

228
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,240
he actually decided
to stop here on the way.

229
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,480
But who is this that was stalking him?

230
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,440
Ms. Ning.

231
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,360
Are we going to wait
for them to come down?

232
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,080
They've went up,

233
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,120
let's go take a look.

234
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,480
Okay.

235
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Lao Yang!

236
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,440
This bell...

237
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,600
If you like it, I can give it to you.

238
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Don't move!

239
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,280
Has the bell rung before?

240
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,560
N...no.

241
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,280
That's a relief.

242
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,080
I have that lighter too.

243
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,160
It's wind and water resistant.

244
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
But when I was at Jiazi Falls,

245
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
a darn monkey took everything.

246
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,400
This fish is so big,

247
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,360
it can last us a few days.

248
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,520
You're going to eat it?

249
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm not going to eat it.

250
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
Even if I starve to death,
I won't eat it.

251
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,360
How picky.

252
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,280
I think this person
just got bitten to death.

253
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,560
Is it your friend?

254
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,280
Impossible.

255
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,800
My friend is fat and has a big head,

256
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,640
it can't be him.

257
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,560
If this was me,

258
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,640
would you be able to tell me apart?

259
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
Go, go, get out of my way.

260
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't say these kind
of unlucky things.

261
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,240
We used to be very close.

262
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,680
It's been 3 years,

263
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,280
and you've found a new friend.

264
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
Do you like your new
friend more than me?

265
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,520
We haven't met for a few years,

266
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,000
why have you become so corny?

267
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,640
I'm getting goosebumps.

268
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,080
Look.

269
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,520
Since this person...

270
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
just got eaten,

271
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,080
then someone else...

272
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,440
must have been here.

273
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
I think so.

274
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,720
There's a small mud gun too.

275
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,800
Basically take a small
caliber double barrel shotgun,

276
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,480
saw off the barrel part,

277
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,920
and modify the stock into a pistol.

278
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,360
This can shoot 2 bullets at a time.

279
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,280
But it can't eject bullet
shells automatically.

280
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,760
You have to change
bullets just like a pistol,

281
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,800
taking the shells out yourself.

282
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,400
But this gun is not that powerful.

283
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,240
It's fine if you want to
shoot something small,

284
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,720
but if you run into something big...

285
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,680
like wolves, wild boars,

286
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
you can't kill it in one shot.

287
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,000
If you go for the second shot,

288
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,200
you'll be dead by then.

289
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,800
Also, the range is also...

290
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
The range is quite short.

291
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,600
You can only use it to
shoot some rabbits or dogs.

292
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,640
Look,

293
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,640
this fish got a few
shots on its belly.

294
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,280
This means that it was
injured before it attacked us.

295
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,880
So, this person did not
come here to explore,

296
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,120
but for illegal hunting.

297
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,040
The fish was hit with
iron sand bullets.

298
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
It wasn't lethal.

299
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
No wonder you had
to put in so much effort...

300
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,320
to kill it.

301
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,920
What are you thinking about?

302
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm wondering how this fish got here.

303
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,680
It can't be that someone
is raring this fish, right?

304
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
I don't think so.

305
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,880
There is a waterway
beneath this stone tunnel.

306
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,480
The waterway is connected
to the underground river,

307
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,240
and the underground river is
linked to the nearby Jialing River.

308
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,760
So, the fish...

309
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,080
probably came from the river.

310
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
This is an ancient tomb.

311
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
How can there be a waterway?

312
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,240
They don't have diving
equipments in the past.

313
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,640
How would they even make a waterway?

314
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,760
I don't think they made it.

315
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
It was a result of an accident.

316
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,960
This is a rock mountain.

317
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,400
Usually, these kind of mountains...

318
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
have hollow areas that were
formed since the Archean era,

319
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,520
which are called dikes.

320
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,800
If this dike is linked
to the mountain stream,

321
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
then it would form
a river system in its center.

322
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,800
When miners break this river system,

323
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
then it would result
in a big accident.

324
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,680
This place is flooded...

325
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,800
simply because the
dike has been broken.

326
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,600
That means that there
was originally no waterway,

327
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
but the cave collapsed,
so a waterway was formed,

328
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,040
which resulted in flooding.

329
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,560
The tomb owner didn't choose
a place with good feng shui, huh.

330
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,600
Lao Yang.

331
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,720
Later, I will go into
this waterway again...

332
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,120
to look for my friend.

333
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,720
Wait for me over here.

334
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
When I find him,
I'll come back and rescue you.

335
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,560
No way.

336
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm coming with you.

337
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,440
I'll protect you.

338
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,040
You're so corny.

339
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,840
There's a cave in here.

340
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,840
-Go take a look inside.
-Roger.

341
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Be careful.

342
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
This is the place.

343
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
This is where their
signal was last seen....

344
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,080
before they disappeared.

345
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
There are footprints here!

346
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,680
The two of them are so lucky.

347
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,920
They found this place on foot.

348
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,560
My fault.

349
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
Skip to my soul!

350
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,360
Close your eyes
and listen to this tempo!

351
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,920
Bury the seeds in a dry land.

352
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,320
The darkness forced us
to pick up our weapons!

353
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,200
Mr. Naive!

354
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,560
Fatty Wang is coming for you,
just wait for me!

355
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,600
Rock.

356
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,280
It can't be some
kind of big fish, right?

357
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,400
The water level is so low.

358
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
The fish won't be
able to come in here.

359
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,640
Let's go.

360
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,080
See, there are other
things in the water.

361
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,800
Since you're saying that
this is a cave for quarrying,

362
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,480
then the direction where we came in...

363
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,800
must not be the actual entrance.

364
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
We're not lost, are we?

365
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,360
Mining...

366
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
is the same as construction piling.

367
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
There are many methods.

368
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,760
It's either done in a spiral method,

369
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,160
or completely straight
from top to bottom.

370
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,080
If it was done in a spiral,
that's better.

371
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,840
As long as we find the entrance,

372
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,080
we just have to follow
the path to go up.

373
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,240
But if it was done
completely straight,

374
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
then it won't be easy.

375
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,600
Look.

376
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,640
We're so far from the surface.

377
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
The lifting equipment from
a few hundred years ago...

378
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
definitely can't be used anymore.

379
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
Even if we can scale walls,

380
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,720
it will be very difficult to
climb all the way up.

381
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,960
Let's play it by ear.

382
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm still worried about
the fishes that are around.

383
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,880
Over there.

384
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's go!

385
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Be careful.

386
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,680
Come.

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,880
Eeny, meeny, miney,
get lost. Get lost!

388
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,080
Wu Xie.

389
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,560
There's water up ahead.

390
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,240
There may be those big fishes.

391
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,600
Let's walk this way.

392
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,400
Look.

393
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
This is shaped like a "U".

394
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
If we go that way, we'll go
back to where we started.

395
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,880
Let's take this road.

396
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
We'll use our old method.

397
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,320
Let's toss a coin.

398
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,760
No.

399
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,040
Scissors, paper, stone.

400
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,760
Come, come, come.

401
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,800
Truth will never fail.

402
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,600
Best 2 out of 3!

403
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
What kind of face is that?

404
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
What are you looking at?

405
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
You got a master?

406
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,160
If you want one,

407
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,560
I...

408
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
Fly, little bee.

409
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,160
Where did it go?

410
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,800
Darn it!

411
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
What is this?

412
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Go this way!

413
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,640
We're out of road.

414
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,400
This way.

415
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,920
Watch out, watch out!

416
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
There are rocks everywhere.

417
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,320
It's a quarry cave.

418
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,000
To make it easier to build the tomb,

419
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,040
they definitely did the mining
near the main burial chamber.

420
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,600
It would be easy to quarry,

421
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,080
convenient to carve,

422
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,240
and easy to transport.

423
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,680
What if he didn't
want people to know...

424
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
where his tomb is located,

425
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,800
and...

426
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,440
chose to take ingredients
from somewhere far?

427
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,760
That's possible too.

428
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,120
Wu Xie.

429
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,240
Look, why is there a skull...

430
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,640
on top of this terracotta?

431
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
Which dynasty is this from?

432
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,880
I have no idea at all.

433
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,000
You've always failed
your history tests,

434
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
what idea are you talking about?

435
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,680
It was carved from China mud stones,

436
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,720
and has a long history.

437
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,880
It once had a long
acculturation process...

438
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
with ancient Indian
and Tibetan culture.

439
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,440
Realism...

440
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
is the main technique
for these carvings.

441
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
But in my memory,

442
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,720
there were only
Qin Shi Huang's Terracotta Warriors.

443
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
Then, these...

444
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,680
If that is so, you...

445
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,200
You don't know too?

446
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,280
Why are scientists like this?

447
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Hurry up, Wu Xie!

448
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,160
I think there's something up ahead!

449
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,960
Lao Yang?

450
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,600
Lao Yang, slow down,
let's stick together!

451
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,640
Lao Yang!

452
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,920
Lao Yang!

453
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Lao Yang!

454
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,360
Lao Yang!

455
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,840
Lao Yang!

456
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
Lao Yang!

457
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,200
Lao Yang!

458
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,840
Where are you, Lao Yang?

459
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,720
Where are you, Lao Yang?

460
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Lao Yang!

461
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,080
-Lao Yang!
-Wu Xie!

462
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Wu Xie!

463
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,120
-Lao Yang!
-Wu Xie!

464
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm inside!

465
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,600
Help!

466
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,960
Wu Xie!

467
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,960
Don't be afraid.

468
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,840
I'll be right there.

469
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,040
Wu Xie!

470
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,360
Aside from that,

471
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,960
I would also like to
ask you something.

472
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,920
Three years ago,

473
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,280
do you know about...

474
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,760
two young people who
visited this place?

475
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
One of them is called Mr. Ma.

476
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,240
Yes.

477
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,880
There was someone called Mr. Ma.

478
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,040
He had an accent,

479
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,680
I couldn't really understand him.

480
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
There was also one who stutters.

481
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,560
It was so difficult...

482
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,920
to chat with them.

483
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,080
Oh, right!

484
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
I remember now.

485
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,640
They were going to Jiazi Falls too.

486
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,200
You're with them, right?

487
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,240
We just know them.

488
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,680
The both of them never came out.

489
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,880
Never came out?

490
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,440
They didn't listen to me,

491
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,840
and insisted to enter Jiazi Falls.

492
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,440
After they went in,

493
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,080
there were no news about them anymore.

494
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,600
That's not quite right, grandpa.

495
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
A few days ago,

496
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,480
I saw one of them in Beijing.

497
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,320
Alive.

498
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,680
That... That's not possible.

499
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
If they wanted to leave,

500
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,320
the nearest road would be
to go through our village.

501
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
Lao Yang.

502
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
Lao Yang!

503
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Wu Xie, where are you?

504
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,560
Wu Xie!

505
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
Where are you, Wu Xie?

506
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,920
-Wu Xie!
-Lao Yang.

507
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,080
Wu Xie, I'm so relieved!

508
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,880
What else are you hiding from me?

509
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,720
This place...

510
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,200
You've been here before, right?

511
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,360
What?

512
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
You said that you've been
in the mountain for 3 years.

513
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,960
Then it's not possible for you...

514
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,160
to have never entered
the quarry cave before.

515
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,800
Before this,

516
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
why did you enter the cave after me?

517
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,880
Wu Xie.

518
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,360
Why are you so suspicious?

519
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,240
Also,

520
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,240
the moss on this stone
door have been damaged.

521
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,200
You must have been here
for more than just once!

522
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
What is the reason of you...

523
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,120
leading me here?

524
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,240
Wu Xie.

525
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,520
Here.

526
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,640
I just came here from over there.

527
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,880
You...

528
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,960
Why are you suspecting me?

529
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
What do you want me to do?

530
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,560
You don't trust me?

531
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,880
Fine, I trust you.

532
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,400
Then let's leave now.

533
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Are you leaving or not?

534
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,160
Are you going back
to become fish food?

535
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,040
I'm not leaving!

536
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm going to take this road!

537
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,360
You still won't tell me the truth?

538
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,840
Lao Yang.

539
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,240
Let me tell you.

540
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,040
Ever since I was young, I...

541
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
have always treated
you like a brother.

542
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,360
I gave you 100 percent of my trust.

543
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,280
I have never done anything...

544
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,200
bad to you!

545
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,960
Now,

546
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,960
I don't care...

547
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,160
why you are lying to me.

548
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,880
But our brotherhood...

549
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,760
is over.

550
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,360
Wu Xie.

551
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,280
I lied to you,

552
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
but I'm not trying to harm you!

553
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,160
I...

554
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,080
I...

555
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,920
I treated you as a brother,

556
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
as my best friend.

557
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,720
Best friend?

558
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,200
You're my best friend,
so you lied to me, right?

559
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
Do you think that lying
to me is being good to me?

560
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,800
Listen to me!

561
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,880
I'll tell you everything!

562
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,880
Back then,

563
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,240
after Mr. Ma and I got
to this stone wall,

564
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,000
we found the entrance to...

565
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,840
a deep cave right next to it.

566
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,320
Mr. Ma was timid,

567
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
so he didn't dare go any further.

568
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,040
You know I've always been adventurous.

569
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,480
At that time, I decided...

570
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,240
to go in there alone.

571
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,040
I was walking,

572
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,120
and I met a group of
men from Liaodong.

573
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
We formed a temporary team,

574
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,320
and there were about 20 of us.

575
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,440
It was a very dangerous journey,

576
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
and many people died
while we were on the way.

577
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,240
There was also a rockfall
near the end of it,

578
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
and almost everyone got buried.

579
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,840
I was buried under
the rocks and sand too.

580
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,720
A piece of rock...

581
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
was crushing my shoulders.

582
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
I couldn't even move,

583
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,200
and I just watched...

584
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,320
how they all got crushed to nothing...

585
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
by the rockfall.

586
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,080
I...

587
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,960
I was so scared,
I almost peed my pants.

588
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,680
At that time,

589
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
the ground that I was lying on...

590
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,880
suddenly sunk down.

591
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,320
What's underneath...

592
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
was the place that we're at right now.

593
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
What happened after that?

594
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,560
After that,

595
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,040
I survived and escaped.

596
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,320
Then, I realized that...

597
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,680
Mr. Ma had taken away everything...

598
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
that we have found.

599
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,280
I met the people from the mountains.

600
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,920
I stayed in their
village for a while...

601
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,960
to receive treatment.

602
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,440
After I came out, I found out that...

603
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
Mr. Ma was jailed.

604
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,840
But I always feel like a voice...

605
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,640
has been telling me to come back.

606
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,680
But...

607
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,800
when I got here,

608
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
I realized that...

609
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,680
I could not find the way back.

610
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,200
This became my obsession.

611
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,440
If I can't find the tomb,

612
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
I just can't leave this mountain.

613
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,440
When you and your...

614
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,560
fatty friend came,

615
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,760
I followed you.

616
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,840
Only then, I realized...

617
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,320
that there was another way...

618
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,080
to come inside here.

619
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,080
It's so dangerous and you
still want to come in here?

620
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
-Are you crazy?
-Yes.

621
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm crazy.

622
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm crazy!

623
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,200
Wu Xie.

624
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,560
Aren't you here for the tomb?

625
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
We have the same goals,

626
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,600
and we have been brothers for years.

627
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,800
Isn't it great if we do this together?

628
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,680
Fine. Wu Xie.

629
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,360
Whatever you think,

630
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
I will never hurt you.

631
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,640
Now, I want to go in...

632
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
and see what's actually inside.

633
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,440
Wu Xie.

634
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
Are you coming with me?

635
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,000
Why isn't he coming?

636
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,960
Wu Xie.

637
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,360
You're here?

638
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,400
After we find the tomb,

639
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,320
I'll send you home.

640
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,960
I knew it,

641
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
you won't leave me behind.
