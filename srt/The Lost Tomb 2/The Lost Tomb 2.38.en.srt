"Episode 38"

3
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,560
Miss Ning,

4
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,960
cars can't pass through
the road ahead.

5
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
Should we take a break here?

6
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,960
We'll walk.

7
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,680
The sky is getting dark.

8
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
This topography is new to us.

9
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
The snow mountain
is dangerous at night.

10
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,960
-Now...
-Execute the command!

11
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,000
Little Master.

13
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,360
Do you think...

14
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Mr. Naive...

15
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,240
has been captured by Ning?

16
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Could they be...

17
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,920
sitting by the fire and sipping wine,

18
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
having a date over a stew,

19
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,720
or has she already...

20
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,360
murdered him?

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Since they spared Wu Xie and me,
we must be useful.

22
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,280
I seemed to have been here.

23
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,320
You were here?

24
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,160
For what?

25
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Treasure hunting?

26
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
I seem to have recalled something.

27
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Is there really treasures here?

28
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
Where is it?

29
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,960
Did you take everything back then?

30
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
Show me some reaction.

31
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,760
Are you ignoring me...

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,240
because I'm talking too much?

33
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,080
Listen.

34
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,040
This could be
a matter of life and death.

35
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
Mr. Naive could be in danger.

36
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
Great danger.

37
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
You should really talk less,

38
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,600
save your energy.

39
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Little Master, I can't.

40
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
I can't go on.

41
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
They left their cars
and started walking.

42
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,320
We've to take another route.

43
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
Otherwise, with this distance,

44
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
we'd lose them.

45
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
All right, it's your call.

46
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Let's split up!

47
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,720
I'll distract it!

48
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,480
Miss Ning!

49
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,040
Hurry!

50
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Miss Ning!

51
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,480
Miss Ning!

52
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,480
Come!

53
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Give me your hand!

54
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Thanks.

55
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,080
Ma ma Mia.

56
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Thanks.

57
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
Little Master, pull!

58
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
Pull me up!

59
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,800
Wait! Little Master!

60
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,400
Stop!

61
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,200
Let go a little, Little Master!

62
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,080
Little Master!

63
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,040
There seems to be a cave here!

64
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,480
Little Master, is it okay to go in?

65
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
Is it safe?

66
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,840
Yes.

67
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,280
It heads straight to
the other side of the mountain.

68
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,680
I came here before.

69
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,600
When?

70
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,640
I haven't recalled...

71
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
all the details yet.

72
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
But this...

73
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,480
is the only way to the ruins.

74
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
I remember it.

75
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
I had scouted inside.

76
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,840
It's not dangerous.

77
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,480
If we take this route,

78
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
we'll keep up with...

79
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,280
Ning's team very soon.

80
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
Okay.

81
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,240
Save Mr. Naive first.

82
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
If this is a ruin,

83
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,320
we'll explore this place.

84
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Three of us.

85
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,560
Okay?

86
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,440
Let's go!

87
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,560
Miss Ning,

88
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,720
we found him.

89
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Let's go.

90
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,680
Mr. Naive, Mr. Naive!

91
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,920
Mr. Naive.

92
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,240
Who's fooling us now?

93
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,280
Where the heck is Mr. Naive?

94
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,880
Wu Xie is not here!

95
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Can we go back tonight?

96
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,480
I think we can't.

97
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
It's too cold at night.

98
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,640
The melted snow will be frozen.

99
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
We have the sun in the day,
but it's risky at night.

100
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
We can only leave in the day.

101
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
Tell them to set up tents here.

102
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,720
Yes, ma'am!

103
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,040
Set up the tents!

104
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,720
Yes.

105
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
Little Master,

106
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,240
I reckon we can't...

107
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,160
leave tonight too.

108
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Let's borrow some gear from them.

109
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
Otherwise,
it'll be tough at night.

110
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,000
Tell those pansies.

111
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,960
It's too cold here.

112
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm not cold.

113
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,560
But I'm cold!

114
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Ning!

115
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
We came here in a rush!

116
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Can you spare us some equipment?

117
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,320
-Give them a tent.
-Okay.

118
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,520
Tent is great!

119
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,560
But slip some food...

120
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
inside the tent, too!

121
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank... Thank you.

122
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,760
Have you eaten, Ning?

123
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,840
Let's talk.

124
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,520
We have nothing to talk.

125
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,040
We have plenty to talk.

126
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
Like, you can tell me...

127
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,200
why you are...

128
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,120
looking for Mr. Naive.

129
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,520
Is it to do with the ruins nearby?

130
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,280
Acting dumb is useless,
I'm telling you.

131
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
What do you think the four of us...

132
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,160
can do together?

133
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,280
Play mahjong?

134
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
What else can we do?

135
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,240
It's the same old thing.

136
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,120
Am I right?

137
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,960
Let's share the information.

138
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,520
We could work together.

139
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,760
Who are you?

140
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,520
Little Master!

141
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,760
Little Master.

142
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
Try to recall.

143
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
How did you know...

144
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
about the Snow Village?

145
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Try to recall it.

146
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,040
How did you know
about the Snow Village?

147
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,840
If you came before,
then how did you get here?

148
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
And the ruins.

149
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
How did you know
about the ruins nearby?

150
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,800
If we want to save Mr. Naive,

151
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,320
we'll need your memories.

152
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,040
Little Master.

153
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,640
Little Master.

154
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,080
What's the matter?

155
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,520
What are you doing?

156
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,520
What's wrong with you?

157
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
It's me! Fatty!

158
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,080
Little Master.

159
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,080
What's wrong?

160
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,120
What happened to him?

161
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,040
In Mr. Zhang's blood sample,

162
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,640
we found...

163
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,840
an unknown blood virus.

164
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,080
Our drug can only suppress it for now.

165
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,080
When we found him,

166
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,080
he had been poisoned.

167
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,520
Sir,

168
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,160
we're unable to locate...

169
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,920
where Shun Zi...

170
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,760
took Wu Xie.

171
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Shun Zi's father had an accident...

172
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,560
with the expedition years ago.

173
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,040
It's understandable...

174
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,480
that he has his own ideas.

175
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,064
We're merely scratching
each other's back.

176
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,480
He's not dispensable.

177
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
The snow has covered the tracks.

178
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,360
It's difficult to search
at the moment.

179
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,720
Have you searched...

180
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,960
the yard where his father...

181
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
hunted in?

182
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
Understood, sir.

183
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,560
Ning.

184
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,800
You're leaving already?

185
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,320
Do you have any news...

186
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
about Mr. Naive?

187
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,560
You're asking me?

188
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,800
Besides,

189
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
would you believe what I say?

190
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,120
You can keep the tent. You're welcome.

191
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,640
Let's go!

192
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,200
The gun seems nice.

193
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,840
Why not leave a gun for me?

194
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
Leave more stuff for us!

195
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,840
What should we do?

196
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,880
She left without spitting a word.

197
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,520
When Shun Zi's father was hunting,

198
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
he had a yard in the woods.

199
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,640
Let's go there.

200
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
He's likely to be there.

201
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Miss Ning.

202
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,560
That's the west of the forest.

203
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,720
That place is said to be haunted.

204
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,680
We need one day...

205
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,920
to travel from here.

206
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,800
Didn't you receive training overseas?

207
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
Have you become dumb here?

208
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,760
We'd lose Wu Xie too
if we lose Shun Zi.

209
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,960
So, we must find them!

210
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes.

211
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,200
Miss Ning.

212
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
The yard is ahead of us.

213
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,640
Should we walk there?

214
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,960
How could anyone live here?

215
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
It's like a wolf's den now.

216
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,120
Nonsense!

217
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,000
Tell the others,

218
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,720
come with me.

219
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,680
Okay.

220
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,640
Get out of the car!

221
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,160
Unload the gears and depart!

222
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,800
Miss Ning.

223
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,680
This house is too creepy.

224
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,880
Let's not go inside.

225
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,320
We have to find out
if Wu Xie is inside.

226
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,200
It's dark now.

227
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
We won't find another bunker.

228
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,160
Retreat. Retreat!

229
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,800
Retreat!

230
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,600
There's nothing here.

231
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
They've all left.

232
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,000
Where do you think they've gone?

233
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,200
Wait.

234
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,920
Little Master.

235
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
You're a good fighter.

236
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,720
Go check it out first.

237
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
What is it?

238
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,320
Don't give me that now, Little Master.

239
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,320
Hey.

240
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,560
Little Master!

241
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,720
Little Master!

242
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,920
Let me go!

243
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,000
What's this?

244
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,240
Let me go now!

245
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,440
I grew up being threatened!

246
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm not afraid of this!

247
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,320
Do you know...

248
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,160
who's that with me?

249
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,240
-When he gets mad...
-Don't move!

250
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,840
You know what,

251
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,480
-you'll all die!
-Let's go.

252
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,400
Let go of me!

253
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,200
Hello? Can you hear me?

254
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,720
Little Master. Little Master?

255
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,040
Little Master.

256
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,760
Are you awake?

257
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,000
How long has it been?

258
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,520
Wait...

259
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,760
It should be dinnertime!

260
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,600
According to my previous experience,

261
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,680
a kind girl would come about now...

262
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,520
to send us food.

263
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,760
Someone's coming.

264
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,720
Now you remember us.

265
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,160
Is it time for dinner?

266
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,920
Move!

267
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,600
Be gentle!

268
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,200
-We're friends!
-No, we're not!

269
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,960
Slow down!

270
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
Untie them.

271
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,879
-Slow down.
-There.

272
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
Who the heck are you?

273
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,600
Stop it, Fatty.

274
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,439
We're friends.

275
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
Mr. Naive!

276
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,600
Little Master,

277
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,960
Mr. Naive is here.

278
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,200
What did you do to him?

279
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,160
Fatty?

280
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,959
Are you all right, Little Master?

281
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,200
Little Master.

282
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,359
You remember me now?

283
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,199
Yeah.

284
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,279
Fatty, Little Master,

285
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,400
we're all friends.

286
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,320
Don't misunderstand.

287
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Let me introduce to you,

288
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,239
this is Chen Si Ye.

289
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,760
A scout expert...

290
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
specially hired by Master Wu.

291
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,559
He's a veteran!

292
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,840
Okay,

293
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
I won't beat around the bush.

294
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,840
The mountain we're exploring
is the ruins of Eastern Xia.

295
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,840
The whereabouts of the copper fish...

296
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,400
are very much related to it.

297
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,600
Great Si,

298
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,600
Snake Eye Copper Fish?

299
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,840
Eastern Xia ruins?

300
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,200
What's wrong?

301
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
Didn't Wu San Xing tell you these?

302
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,160
What?

303
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,880
The copper fish is
in such a shady place?

304
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,040
Anyway, Wu San Xing and I...

305
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,000
have done our research...

306
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,680
and decided to find Easter Xia ruins.

307
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,880
If we want to...

308
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,640
get leads on the copper fish,

309
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,120
we've to first find
the Nine-Dragon Casket.

310
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
Copper fish is really there?

311
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,840
Then what's Nine-Dragon Casket?

312
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,680
It's stated clearly on your silk book.

313
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,360
If...

314
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,200
you hadn't lost your memory,

315
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,880
would I...

316
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,080
analyze it with you here?

317
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Monk Hua.

318
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
Help us to study it later.

319
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,440
Sure.

320
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,680
I've seen the map of this place.

321
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,600
There really is a Dragon Vein.

322
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
According to feng shui,

323
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,520
there is an auspicious location.

324
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,200
Wu Xie.

325
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,600
Do you...

326
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,160
have a black stone with you?

327
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,080
Where's the stone?

328
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,480
It's not there.

329
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
We probably dropped it...

330
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,120
in the fight at Jin Yang's house.

331
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
The stone is matte black.

332
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,560
It's texture is unique and complex.

333
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,800
It's slightly warm.

334
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,440
It seems to be...

335
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,840
integrated with metal.

336
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,600
Little Master,

337
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,440
why are you looking for it?

338
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,680
It is a...

339
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
unique magnet.

340
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,360
The place where we're going...

341
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,280
has a huge piece of magnet.

342
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,360
It causes magnetic interference.

343
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
The stone you found...

344
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,640
was carved from that magnet.

345
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,640
We won't be lost with it.

346
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,720
But now,

347
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,160
it will be difficult to find.

348
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,160
I think I know...

349
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,080
the place you're saying.

350
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
But it's impossible...

351
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,440
to get there.

352
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
There's a natural moat.

353
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,960
Besides,

354
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,800
one of you...

355
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,000
has reached a certain age.

356
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,480
I'll be fine.

357
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,000
Since it's hard to find,
let's pack up our things,

358
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
we'll depart tonight.

359
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,080
We'll still...

360
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
be able to make it.

361
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,760
Fatty,

362
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,880
where's Little Master?

363
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,720
He's taking care...

364
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,960
of his personal business.

365
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,520
He'll be back soon.

366
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Don't eat too much.

367
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,000
Little Master.

368
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,080
It'll be a long journey tonight.

369
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,800
Will you be all right?

370
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,360
I'm fine.

371
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
I know what to do.

372
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,920
I can handle it for now.

373
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,360
Get a few men to fix the car.

374
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,520
Go fix the car.

375
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,480
-Yes!
-Yes!

376
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,280
Bai Lin.

377
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,360
Last night, we were tricked...

378
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,720
and deceived.

379
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I found a secret room.

380
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Someone was in there.

381
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,240
He seemed to have left for some time.

382
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,200
I'll go with you.

383
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,840
I know where they are.

384
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,200
Mr. Qiu De Kao's calling.

385
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,840
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,840
I know.

387
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,320
I'll lead.

388
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,520
Obey my command.

389
00:41:32,560 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.
