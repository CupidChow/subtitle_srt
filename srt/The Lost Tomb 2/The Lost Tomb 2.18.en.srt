"Episode 18"

3
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,640
Let's go, Guo Guo.

4
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,840
Get ashore!

5
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,880
Hurry!

6
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
There's a fish!

7
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,320
Run!

8
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Run!

9
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
-Lao Yang.
-Wu Xie.

10
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,880
Why are you smiling?

11
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,400
After we find the tomb,

12
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,400
you'd better go home.

13
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,520
Coffin.

14
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,240
There's...

15
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
What is it?

16
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Look at its top.

17
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,800
The stone figure wasn't finished.

18
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,480
It could be a backup,

19
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,400
but was dumped before it was used.

20
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,880
Look.

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,040
This looks like...

22
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
where they kept their wastes.

23
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,640
It doesn't even have any entrance.

24
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,360
That is to say,

25
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
the stone passage we've just passed...

26
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
is closed at both ends.

27
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
But how were...

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
these stones transported?

29
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,840
The passage is under the water.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
That would be troublesome.

31
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
Will there be any corpses in here?

32
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,520
There won't be.

33
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,000
I've never heard of
a body being placed in...

34
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,000
before engraving the coffin.

35
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
Also, try to smell.

36
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,280
There's no smell of ptomaine.

37
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,320
It must be empty.

38
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,600
There's something inside.

39
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,760
Come and take a look.

40
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,360
Should we open it?

41
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Isn't that fishy?

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
We'd better leave it.

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
-Lao Yang!
-Zombie!

44
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,160
Lao Yang.

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,120
-Are you all right?
-I’m fine.

46
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,520
His...

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,640
His hand...

48
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
You've been poisoned by ptomaine?

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
You seemed fishy when
we met along the way.

50
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,840
So you're really coming for us.

51
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Now there's a different guy?

52
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,400
Where's that guy who was with you?

53
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,360
This may not be...

54
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,640
the grand tomb that
you're looking for.

55
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
What do you know?

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
What I know...

57
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,080
is enough for us to cooperate.

58
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,440
He's trying to trick us.

59
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,920
Mr. Wang.

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,720
Uncle Tai.

61
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,160
According to what Mr. Li...

62
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,920
said about the Eight
Diagrams location back then,

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,200
this must be...

64
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,840
the entrance...

65
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,800
of the tomb's underground water route.

66
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
But I see nothing here.

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,680
What's wrong?

68
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,480
It can't go wrong.

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,560
It must be here.

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,960
The entrance must've been
hidden when the tomb was sealed.

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
The hidden door must be in this room.

72
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Wu Xie,

73
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
who are they?

74
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Who?

75
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
I met them on the way here.

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
Teacher Liang,

77
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,760
what now?

78
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,480
According to Mr. Li descriptions,

79
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,560
this path mustn't be wrong.

80
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
If there really is a hidden door,

81
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,880
I think...

82
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,520
it won't be somewhere else,

83
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,160
but definitely on the
coffin bed under the coffin.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,280
One, two, three!

85
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
One, two, three!

86
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
One, two, three!

87
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
Why does it smell so familiar?

88
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
I think I've smelled it before.

89
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
But, I can't recall it.

90
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,960
Come here.

91
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,960
-Let's go.
-Lao Yang.

92
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Go down.

93
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,120
Hurry up!

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,440
It's fine.

95
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
-Go ahead.
-Hurry up!

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,960
Hurry!

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Hold on.

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
Take this with you.

99
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,400
Blow it when you reach the bottom.

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,520
If I don't hear anything
within half an hour,

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,040
I'll kill your friend.

102
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,680
Get down!

103
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
Mr. Naive.

104
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,360
Mr. Naive.

105
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
That's...

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
That's it for me today.

107
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
Twenty minutes have passed,

108
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
why haven't we heard anything?

109
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Will Wu Xie...

110
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,600
leave you here and run away?

111
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Where... Where...

112
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,160
Where can he go in this kind of place?

113
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
This hole is rather deep.

114
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,280
The tomb is located on the cliff wall,

115
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,280
don't tell me the hidden
passage heads all the way...

116
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,960
to the bottom through the cliff?

117
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,640
Ms. Ning,

118
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,120
can we not take the water route?

119
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm afraid there
might be other fishes.

120
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,640
You're scared?

121
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
Go back if you're scared.

122
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
Ms. Ning, Ms. Ning.

123
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Look at what happened to my men.

124
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,600
That's a huge loss.

125
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So, the pay...

126
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,680
Fine.

127
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
Forget about the raise.

128
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,520
If we find any burial objects,
give me one.

129
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,040
Deal?

130
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,720
Deal, Ms. Ning?

131
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,000
Be careful, Uncle Tai.

132
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,560
Gosh!

133
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,040
The water is hot!

134
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,200
I didn't expect that!

135
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,200
The passage of this tomb...

136
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,920
actually led us to
a subsurface stream.

137
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
It would've been unconvincing...

138
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,600
if I hadn't seen it myself.

139
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,640
We can't go any further.

140
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,080
It's quite deep...

141
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,040
and hot.

142
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,440
It's not easy to cross.

143
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,200
Mr. Wang,

144
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
which way should we go now?

145
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,760
Isn't it stated on the
precious map of Mr.  Li?

146
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,200
It's stated when
Mute Riders visited the tomb,

147
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
they set up 2 iron
chains under the water.

148
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,720
We'll reach...

149
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,560
the underground palace by
following the iron chain.

150
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,920
Fine.

151
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll go.

152
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,800
You don't need to.

153
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
But, this water...

154
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,920
Uncle Tai,

155
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,360
there's an iron chain under the water.

156
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,960
It's as thick as my arm.

157
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,880
It's not safe to take...

158
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,280
this water route.

159
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,720
The water here...

160
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,160
is even deeper than...

161
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,840
where Mr. Li died just now.

162
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Also, it's burning in here.

163
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,280
If we run into
one of those big fishes again,

164
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,280
-we'll die worse than Mr. Li.
-No worries.

165
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,000
The water is so hot here,

166
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,040
there must be hot spring down there.

167
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
Even the biggest fish...

168
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,480
would be cooked in this water.

169
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,840
Now,

170
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,600
it's your turn to lead our way.

171
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
Wait for me, Uncle Tai!

172
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,280
What was that?

173
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,560
A whale!

174
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,920
Nonsense!

175
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,320
Pull him back.

176
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,880
If not, I'll shoot you.

177
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Go!

178
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,520
Go!

179
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,840
He's been burned to death!

180
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,240
And he has blisters all over!

181
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,960
This is an intermittent geyser!

182
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Run!

183
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,760
Run, Lao Yang!

184
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
This is the downstream,

185
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,000
don't look back,

186
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,440
keep swimming forward!

187
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
There must be an entrance!

188
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,120
Hurry up!

189
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,000
Hurry up, Uncle Tai!

190
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,200
Hold tight!

191
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,040
Hurry!

192
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Hurry up!

193
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Lao Yang!

194
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,560
There's a shore!

195
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,400
Hurry!

196
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,520
Follow me!

197
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Lao Yang!

198
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,800
This way!

199
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,360
Uncle Tai,

200
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,320
hurry get ashore!

201
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,400
Hurry!

202
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
Hurry, Lao Yang!

203
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,800
Hurry!

204
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Save me!

205
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Save me!

206
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,480
-Teacher Liang!
-Save me!

207
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,320
Wu Xie,

208
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,520
are you insane?

209
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
You're still trying to save him?

210
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,440
No one dies.

211
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,640
-Teacher Liang!
-Wu Xie!

212
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,320
Wu Xie!

213
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Teacher Liang!

214
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Save me!

215
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Save me!

216
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Wu Xie!

217
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,720
Save me!

218
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
I can't hold it anymore!

219
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,600
Hurry up, save me!

220
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,440
Don't be afraid!

221
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,800
Hold tight!

222
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
I'm coming to save you!

223
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
I'm scared!

224
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,880
Teacher Liang!

225
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,160
Give me your hand!

226
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,520
Hurry up!

227
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,200
Don't be afraid!

228
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
I've held on!

229
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
Give me your hand!

230
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,680
I'm scared!

231
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
-I'm scared!
-Hurry!

232
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm scared!

233
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
Raise your hand higher!

234
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,760
Higher!

235
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
Teacher Liang!

236
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,600
Teacher Liang!

237
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,120
Wu Xie!

238
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,960
Wu Xie!

239
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Lao Yang!

240
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Why are you down here?

241
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,040
They...

242
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,080
Since...

243
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
a few of them...

244
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,040
have already...

245
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,880
fallen into the water,

246
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,000
what can we do now?

247
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Hang on!

248
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,880
Move with the iron chain!

249
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
It's the only way out!

250
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,560
My hand...

251
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,200
Hang on, Lao Yang!

252
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,960
Wu Xie,

253
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,400
the water is scalding!

254
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
You must be careful!

255
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,280
Hang on, Wu Xie!

256
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,360
-It feels so good.
-Right.

257
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,400
You've improved.

258
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,440
Are you willing to
massage for me everyday?

259
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,640
Of course, I'd love to.

260
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,480
Xiu Xiu,

261
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,800
why don't you go out and have fun?

262
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I want to stay with you.

263
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm an old lady,

264
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,120
aren't you tired of me?

265
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
You should go out and...

266
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
make more friends...

267
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,240
when you're still young,
you know that?

268
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,880
It's like how Xi'an people call it,

269
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,960
when they mean "having fun",

270
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
they'd say, "wave".

271
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,400
To me, it means "the wave of love",

272
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,240
right?

273
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,240
One asks,

274
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
"Where are you going?"

275
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,000
"Into the wave of love."

276
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Granny,

277
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,640
were you playful...

278
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
when you were young?

279
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,400
There are things that you
must try when you are young.

280
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,920
I loved having fun too,

281
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
you knew that.

282
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,160
What would you do?

283
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,280
Whatever I like.

284
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,720
For example, falling in love.

285
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,200
Granny,

286
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,720
I didn't know that
you were such a romantic!

287
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,440
Well, I'm different.

288
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,920
I'm a career woman.

289
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,280
Falling in love is only
a trick of dopamine.

290
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,000
An instinctive need for reproduction.

291
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,920
The happiness of falling in love...

292
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,520
can also be found elsewhere.

293
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,320
What's more,
love problems can be hurtful...

294
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
psychologically and physically.

295
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm fine being on my own.

296
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,360
Listen to what you said.

297
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,840
But, I think...

298
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,000
as a woman,

299
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,960
you eventually have to find the
right person to accompany you.

300
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Just give it a try, right?

301
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,400
You're right.

302
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,440
But,

303
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,600
it takes luck to meet such a person.

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Just let it be.

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,560
You've got a point.

306
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Of course,

307
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,040
it's also a blessing...

308
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,360
to not be bothered
by love affairs in your life.

309
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,880
By the way,

310
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,720
Xiu Xiu.

311
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,720
What did I tell you just now?

312
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
I asked you to buy a few properties.

313
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,200
But why were you so indifferent?

314
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
I wasn't being indifferent.

315
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,640
I do my house hunting
on phone these days.

316
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,240
Let me show you.

317
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,800
There's an application
called "Beike Real Estate".

318
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,640
You can get any type of house...

319
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,240
and residential environment in there.

320
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,080
You can even use
virtual reality to view houses.

321
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,120
I don't get it.

322
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,960
Look at this.

323
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:55,152
Click on Virtual Reality,
then you can view the house.

324
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,360
See,

325
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,520
this is the bedroom.

326
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,640
See.

327
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,080
-It's so advanced.
-That's right.

328
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,320
And, this is the toilet.

329
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,680
Come in.

330
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,760
Madam,

331
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
Si Ye from Changsha...

332
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
is here to see you.

333
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
He must have got into trouble again.

334
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,520
He wanted to exploit a land,

335
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,800
but someone meddled in it,

336
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,960
and he lost a lot of money.

337
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
He hopes you'd help
him get some connections.

338
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,760
He was taking advantage
of my absence in Changsha,

339
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,200
doing unscrupulous
business with my name.

340
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,120
Now, he runs into a tough one,

341
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,120
and has gotten cold feet.

342
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,000
So, what you're saying is...

343
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,760
Xiu Xiu,

344
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
why don't you go...

345
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,120
and meet your Uncle Si?

346
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,360
Madam,

347
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,680
Xiu Xiu is young,

348
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,520
she might not be able
to bring up certain things.

349
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,640
What are you afraid of?

350
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,120
Back then,

351
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,240
when I took over Huo family,

352
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,280
I was 2 years younger than you.

353
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Look at those uncles and aunties,

354
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,880
everyone of them...

355
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,400
was thinking of getting
something from me.

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,120
Do you know that?

357
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,960
But granny,

358
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,840
what if uncle gets angry?

359
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,000
The men of Huo family...

360
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,160
are all kept men.

361
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,760
How can they get angry?

362
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,200
If you can't even handle...

363
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,720
such a small matter,

364
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,720
why not get married earlier...

365
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,160
and give birth to
a great-grandchild for me.

366
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,960
At least...

367
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,040
one day,

368
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,440
I might be able to count on him.

369
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,000
Fine, I'll go.

370
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,000
Madam,

371
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,240
Xiu Xiu will be fine...

372
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
with your support.

373
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,360
In the past,

374
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,720
it was said that
the Mystic Nine was great.

375
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,960
But now,

376
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,520
it looks like...

377
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
they're all dead.

378
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,120
As for Wu family,

379
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,360
they're planning to
leave everything behind...

380
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,040
starting from Wu Xie's generation.

381
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,760
But for Huo family,

382
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,360
people are ever-changing,

383
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,520
the talents are lacking.

384
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,360
If Xiu Xiu is well-trained,

385
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,840
won't that be...

386
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,560
a more prosperous
generation for Huo family?

387
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
And after that...

388
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,960
Well, I can't take care of it anymore.

389
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,280
Out of sight, out of mind.

390
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,040
Xie Jiu had planned it well.

391
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,160
He sent Xie Zi to learn from...

392
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,320
Er Yue Hong when he was still young.

393
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,760
As for Er Yue Hong...

394
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,120
A coward kid expelled from school,

395
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,200
but was able to join the Mystic Nine,

396
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,560
and was even honored as the Great Si.

397
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,280
In later years,

398
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,720
Xie Zi was his best
disciple among all.

399
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,480
He gave Xie Zi all his connections,

400
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,280
which was a great
advantage to Xie Jiu.

401
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,840
Xie Yu Chen...

402
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,560
is the best among his peers.

403
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,560
Right.

404
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm a bit tired.

405
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
What now?

406
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,240
You finally showed up.

407
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Mr. Naive?

408
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,960
Where's Mr. Naive?

409
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,120
Wu Xie is also here?

410
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,200
Did you cure the poison for me?

411
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
Where's Wu Xie?

412
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,280
Forget it.

413
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,080
Once we came in,
we ran into a big fish.

414
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
It kept biting and hitting us.

415
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,320
Mr. Naive saved me.

416
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,200
But he should be out of danger now.

417
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Not sure where he's at.

418
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
Little Master,

419
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,480
how did you get out of
the underwater tomb...

420
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
and how did you come here?

421
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,680
Fine.

422
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
Back then,

423
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,040
when you posed as an expert,

424
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,560
you were fluent
with all those nonsense.

425
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,720
Now, you're back to normal,

426
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,440
back to Dummy Zhang again, huh?

427
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Forget it.

428
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
Anyway,

429
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,520
when we see Mr. Naive,

430
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,720
he will ask you.

431
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,040
Let's go.

432
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Let's look for Mr. Naive.

433
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,520
He can't survive in
the tomb without us.

434
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,560
You know the way?

435
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,920
I know how to go
back with the same route.

436
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,560
If Wu Xie is fine,

437
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
he probably won't stay put.

438
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's keep walking,

439
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,680
maybe we'll meet him.

440
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
Hang on, Wu Xie!

441
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,920
Where on earth is this?

442
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

443
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,080
I learned about the secret of
underwater tomb from my uncle.

444
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,400
What's going on?

445
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Why am I in underwater tomb again?

446
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
Impossible!

447
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,520
I've escaped from there.

448
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,240
Little Master!

449
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,600
Fatty!

450
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,960
Lao Yang!

451
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,520
Lao Yang.

452
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,280
How is it?

453
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,480
Should we open the coffin?

454
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,360
Wu San Xing told us...

455
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,800
-Little Master.
-not to touch the contents.

456
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,240
But Wu San Xing is sleeping now.

457
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Moreover, we're only...

458
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
opening it to take a look.

459
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
It should be fine.

460
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,240
I'm with Little Master.

461
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,320
We'd better wait.

462
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,840
When San Xing wakes up,
let's see what he says.

463
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,960
Does this need...

464
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
-his approval?
-Chen Wen Jin?

465
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,236
Speaking of protecting relics,
we're the professionals.

466
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,240
Let's open it.

467
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,240
What's that sound?

468
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,160
It seems like it's from the next door.

469
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,200
Let's check it out.

470
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,000
Let's go and check it out.

471
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,920
I think it's there.

472
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
Uncle San Xing?

473
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,880
So you've been following me!

474
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,760
Uncle San Xing, it's me!

475
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Tell me!

476
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,080
Why are you following me?

477
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,400
I...I'm...

478
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,840
I...

479
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,320
I...

480
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,240
Lao Yang!

481
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
Lao Yang!

482
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,720
Lao Yang!

483
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,400
Lao Yang!

484
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,280
Is that you, Lao Yang?

485
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,884
"The Grave of Mute Warriors"

486
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,520
Later,

487
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
during the Qing dynasty,

488
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,880
there came...

489
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,200
a few feng shui masters.

490
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,560
They wanted to find a cemetery...

491
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,160
for a wealthy family.

492
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,080
They went in for more than 10 days,

493
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,080
but when they came out,

494
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,880
they were traumatized.

495
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,360
It's said that...

496
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,720
there's a...

497
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Underworld Waterfall
in Tianmen Mountain...

498
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,440
which leads straight to hell!

499
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,080
Think about it.

500
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,200
The place where the army and...

501
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,640
the feng shui masters went...

502
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,880
was exactly the same place.

503
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,000
The army went to hell.

504
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Then, think about it.

505
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,080
What kind of army could enter hell?

506
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,760
Ghost army.

507
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,920
Absolutely!

508
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,440
Ghost army!

509
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,800
The ghost army...

510
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,480
climbed out of the underworld,

511
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,360
fought a battle on earth,

512
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,160
and went back to hell.

513
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,480
Wu Xie!

514
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,560
Wu Xie!

515
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,760
You're awake!

516
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,120
Lao Yang?

517
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,680
I knew it's you who saved my life.

518
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,880
Are you hurt?

519
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,160
Are you all right?

520
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,160
I'm fine.

521
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,280
Are you hurt?

522
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,080
No.

523
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,880
You...

524
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,320
Why are you sweating so much?

525
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Are you all right?

526
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
I had a nightmare just now.

527
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,360
You were dreaming?

528
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
What was it about?

529
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,360
Forget it.

530
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,520
Don't mention it.

531
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,240
It's good that you're safe.

532
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,480
By the way,

533
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,760
what were you looking at?

534
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,760
You were so absorbed.

535
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,760
Come.

536
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,320
Little did I know,

537
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
there's such a scene...

538
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,680
in Tianmen Mountain.

539
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,360
Look.

540
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,040
The bones on the ground make
it seem like an open burial grave.

541
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
Here lays the Mute Army
who were here to dig treasures.

542
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
They were all buried here.

543
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,560
They didn't get out.

544
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,640
Also,

545
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
look at this.

546
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,080
This is...

547
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,320
a typical...

548
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,280
Are you all right?

549
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm fine.

550
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,960
This is a typical...

551
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,760
underground Karst lake.

552
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,320
This kind of geography...

553
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,840
usually occurs during
the Quaternary Ice Age.

554
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,480
It could only form in that period.

555
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,760
It would take...

556
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
more than 10,000 years of
expansion to reach its current size.

557
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,920
So, the history of Karst cave...

558
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,440
is older than human race.

559
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,600
Why are you laughing?

560
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,800
Nothing.

561
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,560
You're still the same,

562
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
still like giving lessons on science.

563
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,720
I'm a Mr. Know-It-All of science.

564
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,840
Mr. Know-It-All,

565
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,480
then have you found
out how to get out of here?

566
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,480
I think I know how.

567
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,680
Really?

568
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,960
You know the way out of here?

569
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,560
You know about hell and
underworld, don't you?

570
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Do you think...

571
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,280
that was the real hell?

572
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,280
The village you went with Lao Ma,

573
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,720
there was an old hunter,

574
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,960
surname Liu.

575
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,720
Do you remember what he said
about the passing ghost army?

576
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,920
Also,

577
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,280
the underworld that the
feng shui master said?

578
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,560
That's right!

579
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,920
I think...

580
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,640
we better not talk about...

581
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,640
feudal superstition in
this kind of place, all right?

582
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,160
I beg you.

583
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,840
I won't tease you anymore.

584
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,800
Underworld, the yellow spring.

585
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,560
About the waterfall
that washed us down,

586
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,680
what color has it turned into
because of the hot spring?

587
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,360
Yellow.

588
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,160
The underworld is actually
the yellow spring that...

589
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,240
-the feng shui masters spoke of?
-Right!

590
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,640
Yellow spring...

591
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,720
doesn't actually refer to
the real underworld.
