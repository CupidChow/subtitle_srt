"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:07,108
"Episode 4"

3
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,083
Wait a minute,

4
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,209
the coffin should
be put in the rear hall.

5
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,501
Why is the coffin in the side hall?

6
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,751
Moreover, it is a basin coffin.

7
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,167
Basin coffins are from
the Warring States Period.

8
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:27,667
So...

9
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,626
this tomb isn't from Ming dynasty?

10
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,667
King Lu's Seven Star Palace!

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,584
King Lu's Seven Star Palace...

12
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,167
is a tomb from Warring States Period.

13
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,501
In both tombs,

14
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,918
Copper Fish with
Snake Brows were found.

15
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,501
So, what's the connection...

16
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,667
between them?

17
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:05,999
Here you are.

18
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,000
The paintings are...

19
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,709
about a group of people
working on a construction site.

20
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,083
What kind of construction was that?

21
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,959
Clearly, this is an
official uniform of Ming dynasty.

22
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,250
So, does this tomb
belong to Ming dynasty...

23
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,667
or the Warring States Period?

24
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:16,000
Stuffy?

25
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,083
Fatty?

26
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:18,792
Are you all right, Stuffy?

27
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,000
Just worry about him.
No need to worry about me.

28
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you all right, Little Master?

29
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm okay.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,417
My grandma doesn't care about me
and neither does my uncle.

31
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,876
I was only raised by my stepmother.

32
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,999
-What happened to your hand?
-Nothing.

33
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,375
It was a white-haired Drought Demon.

34
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,626
What? That thing was
the Drought Demon?

35
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,542
Drought Demon?

36
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:39,167
The "Classic of Poetry"
mentioned that,

37
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,626
When Drought Demon runs amok,
drought shall follow.

38
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,083
I thought it was just a myth.

39
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,334
But it actually exists!

40
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,375
Some say, it's a demon
that can cause a global drought.

41
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,751
Some say,

42
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,709
the corpse will
turn into Drought Demon,

43
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,083
if they're nourished for too long.

44
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,626
It was really an eye-opener to see it.

45
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:54,584
By the way, Dummy Zhang.

46
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,792
Why didn't we just let it...

47
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,542
have a tasty... tasty...
taste of bullet back there?

48
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,459
We can kill it...

49
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:04,709
by beheading it.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,459
However, large amounts of ptomaine...

51
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,667
will be emitted.

52
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,542
We don't have much oxygen to spare.

53
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:11,918
It's not worth it.

54
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,876
Well, we're at a
different chamber again.

55
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,083
Right,

56
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:21,417
I think we were wrong about
the elevator-like mechanism.

57
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:25,542
It's g-g-good to know
your own mistake,

58
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,792
why don't you try to analyze again?

59
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:30,943
Are you okay?

60
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:32,417
I'm fine.

61
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:41,959
The painting on this urn...

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,292
showed how the tomb owner
supervised the construction.

63
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,209
See,

64
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,334
the apparel is from
the early Ming dynasty.

65
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:49,334
He was wearing gauze cap...

66
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,250
and narrow sleeves.

67
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,584
It means the tomb owner...

68
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:53,000
might be a noble.

69
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:53,918
Or...

70
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,626
he could be...

71
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,834
an honorable architect at that time.

72
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,209
He must've been good at
feng shui and pseudoscience.

73
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:01,459
Only with that,

74
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,876
could he have built
an underwater tomb.

75
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,417
And only someone like that,

76
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,334
could create such elaborate things...

77
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,918
in his own tomb.

78
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,250
Hey brother urn,

79
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,459
you were our free tour guide just now,

80
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,375
now you gave us information
of our tomb owner.

81
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,709
You are such a selfless comrade.

82
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,501
What a shame.
If only I could take you home,

83
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,375
and exchange you for a bunch of cash,

84
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:22,667
that'd be perfect.

85
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,501
Stop interrupting.

86
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,042
If we follow this thought,

87
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:27,417
in Ming dynasty...

88
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,751
Early Ming dynasty, to be exact.

89
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,334
Such a skilled craftsman was rare.

90
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,417
And he must have been a great man...

91
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,876
to own such a big underwater tomb.

92
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,000
I can only think of one person...

93
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,250
who fulfills all the criteria above,

94
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,083
Wang Zang Hai.

95
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,334
The one who built Ming Palace?

96
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:52,375
He didn't just build
the whole Ming Palace,

97
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:56,167
but also a few
major cities at that time.

98
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,959
It only took him one word...

99
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,209
to make a city completely
vanish from this world.

100
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:02,918
By the way,

101
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,584
I read one of his feng shui books...

102
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,042
when I was looking
for Chinese classics.

103
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,250
The contents were
so hard to understand,

104
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,417
it was like taking a
peep at the mystic arts.

105
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,250
So does that mean you can be
the second Wang Zang Hai,

106
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,000
now that you've taken
a peek at the mystic arts.

107
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,125
To him, it may have been mystic arts.

108
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:20,334
But to me, the book
itself is a mystic bible.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,292
It is said that...

110
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,167
it was him who designed
Shen Wan San's underwater tomb...

111
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,083
beneath Yinzi Bang of Zhouzhuang.

112
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,209
He must be really wealthy to
make himself a tomb like this.

113
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,042
Wait, these are all
your speculations, right?

114
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,584
Do you have any solid evidence?

115
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,751
Dare to assume,

116
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,876
but prove wisely.

117
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,834
If this is really
Wang Zang Hai's tomb,

118
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,083
then it'll be an unexpected gain.

119
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,626
Of course it's an unexpected gain.

120
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm sure San Xing and
his archeological team...

121
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,375
were not the only ones
who had been here.

122
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,459
Look at that looting hole,

123
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,999
other raiders must
have been here before.

124
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:51,542
That looting hole...

125
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,876
does look unique.

126
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,751
It even made its way to this pond.

127
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,501
I think,

128
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,792
this pond might just be an exit.

129
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,542
Maybe the guy who
drilled this tunnel...

130
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:01,751
didn't know the
location of the main chamber.

131
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,876
So he just drilled holes at
random possible locations.

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
One of them is in the pond,

133
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,999
another one is under this coffin.

134
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,584
I didn't see any
branches in the tunnel,

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,459
it's just a one-way path.

136
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,792
There are so many bricks inside.

137
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,626
It would be really convenient...

138
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:44,751
to cover some holes with them.

139
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,918
You guys might've exited too quickly,

140
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:47,876
and you overlooked it.

141
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,918
Think about it.

142
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,792
One end of it is linked to the pond,

143
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,083
another one is under the coffin,

144
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,375
then where did he start digging?

145
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,417
I can only say,
he was horribly unlucky.

146
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,292
He hit the coffin weight when
he was digging to side chamber,

147
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,083
got to the pond when he was
digging to the sub-chamber.

148
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,209
He got the short end of the stick.

149
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,125
Any water left? I'm thirsty.

150
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,584
It's already finished.

151
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,501
Why didn't you bring your own?

152
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,667
But you're here, right?

153
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,959
Didn't you bring more?
I thought you did.

154
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:18,959
Hurry up.

155
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,042
Be patient.

156
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,709
Here.

157
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:32,375
I've done poison testing.

158
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,876
Take it or leave it.

159
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:34,792
Amazing.

160
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,626
What kind of technology is this?

161
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,125
Can you give me one?

162
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,125
Just take it,

163
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,584
I'll give you a hundred of this
if we make it out of here.

164
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,250
Nice.

165
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,876
Do you think the
Drought Demon can swim?

166
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,375
It's probably not the Sea Monkey.

167
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,751
Now there's a staircase.

168
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,375
I can't see anything
with this heavy fog.

169
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:45,542
Hey, check this out.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,999
There seems to be some carvings.

171
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,334
These are drain holes, aren't they?

172
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,083
Did you see that?

173
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,709
it's a monument over there.

174
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,542
Wow,

175
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:02,792
you have good eyesight.

176
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,918
I trained my eyes...

177
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,834
like Mei Lan Fang,
staring at birds all day.

178
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:06,876
Stop bluffing.

179
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,417
Can you see what's
written on the monument?

180
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,876
Easy peasy.

181
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,209
Fatty,

182
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,417
wait for the fog to be gone first.

183
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,584
Then how long should we wait?

184
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:15,959
It's okay.

185
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:17,000
Follow me.

186
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,167
Come here.

187
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,501
There's English here.

188
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,292
There can't be English in the tomb.

189
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,834
My English is not good,

190
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,417
but I know all the 24 alphabets.

191
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:09,999
This is English for sure.

192
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,501
There are 26 alphabets.

193
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,292
It's so obvious, like peas in a bowl.

194
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,000
See?

195
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,918
It's really English.

196
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,083
No wonder there's no
valuable stuff in here.

197
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,125
The foreigners took them all.

198
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,834
Just because it's in English,
doesn't mean it was a foreigner.

199
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,709
Alphabets are easier to
write than Chinese characters.

200
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,667
And these are acronyms.

201
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,000
These writings are sloppy.

202
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,667
Someone must have
carved it out of urgency,

203
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,751
as a reference for
those who come later.

204
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:33,959
That makes sense.

205
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,083
It should've been carved
around 20 to 30 years ago.

206
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,459
Could it have been your uncle?

207
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:42,918
Impossible.

208
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,959
His English is not
any better than yours.

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,626
I reckon it's one of the
archeological team members.

210
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,083
No matter who wrote this,

211
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,542
what do you think he was doing here?

212
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,292
Could there be any treasures here?

213
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,042
Fatty,

214
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,709
when will you change?

215
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,292
Everyone has their hobbies.

216
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,125
I like antiques
and I just can't help it.

217
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,501
I'm worried that the water
level might increase again.

218
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:04,667
Let's go back up.

219
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,060
Floating is definitely
faster than running.

220
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,463
Are you out of your mind?

221
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:09,834
Let me tell you,

222
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,459
When the water speed
and volume hit a certain peak,

223
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,876
it will cause a big impact.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,751
If you were hit by
the water and you fainted.

225
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,751
You won't stand a chance,
even if you are a good swimmer.

226
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,083
Such a coward.

227
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,083
No wonder Mister San Xing
wouldn't let you enter the tomb.

228
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,417
He has spoiled you.

229
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,083
Should've let you slept at
the graveyards for a day or two...

230
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,042
to build your courage.

231
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,209
So you are brave?

232
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,626
We're here to look for Uncle San Xing,

233
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,667
not for treasures.

234
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,959
Besides, Little Master is still here.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,250
I can't leave him.

236
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,292
We have to avoid all risks.

237
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,792
So what?

238
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:39,584
I'd be at the vanguard
if I was in the ancient army.

239
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,626
Yeah, right.

240
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,999
But recklessness is not a good thing.

241
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,626
I think I had been here before.

242
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,334
Little Master,

243
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,334
what have you found?

244
00:13:58,209 --> 00:13:58,834
Little Master.

245
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey, didn't you say not to take risks?

246
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,834
Little Master!

247
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:04,876
Slow down, Little Master!

248
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:06,501
Little Master!

249
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,042
Where are you, Little Master?

250
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,083
Just go on! Are you scared again?

251
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,083
Be careful.

252
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,751
Watch out for the holes underwater.

253
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:14,584
Don't step in there.

254
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,751
I already did!

255
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,626
You should've told me earlier!

256
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,292
Hey, where are you?

257
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,417
Enough, let's go.

258
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,209
Is it deep?

259
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,042
Be careful.

260
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:25,542
I'm fine, let's go.

261
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,542
Sea-calming monkey statue.

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,584
Little Master,

263
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,000
what have you found?

264
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,125
Long time no see.

265
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,709
Hey, little comrade,

266
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:20,417
come here,

267
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,083
translate this.

268
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,751
It says...

269
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,292
that the owner of this tomb
had built a Heavenly Palace.

270
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,167
The door to the Palace...

271
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,959
is hidden inside this stone monument.

272
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:42,876
If you are the right person,

273
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,292
the door will open for you...

274
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,459
and lead you to the Heavenly Palace.

275
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,709
These words look like allegory to me.

276
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,167
Different people would
have different understandings.

277
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,667
Maybe the Heavenly Palace
and its door is just a metaphor.

278
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,626
A secret must be
lying in this monument.

279
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,167
What door?
All I feel is the smooth rock.

280
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,292
You are not the right person,

281
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,417
of course you can't see the door.

282
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,542
As long as I can
see the buried treasures.

283
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,250
Little comrade, take a look at this.

284
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,209
Look at this.

285
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,459
Did someone really
go to the Heavenly Palace...

286
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:56,626
through the monument?

287
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:58,459
Fatty,

288
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:01,626
look around and see if there's any
clue left by the archeological team.

289
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:12,959
Uncle San Xing said,

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,834
he did not take any dive gear
with him when he left.

291
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,709
Could it be...

292
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,250
that he had really gone
to the Heaven Palace?

293
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,792
Where on earth is he now?

294
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,417
These are all rubbish down here.

295
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,999
What a waste of my time.
A flash in the pan.

296
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:29,125
Fatty,

297
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,250
I'm worried that the
water level will rise again.

298
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,709
Let's go back up.

299
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,542
We're too far from the surface.

300
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:37,792
It's too dangerous.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,501
Stop scaring yourself, will you?

302
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:49,459
What's that sound?

303
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,542
What? Is something in the water?

304
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,250
Could it be the Sea Monkey again?

305
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,751
As long as it's not the Drought Demon.

306
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:05,751
I think we better go up.

307
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,501
Not searching anymore?

308
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,501
Yeah, I quit.

309
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,292
Little Master,

310
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:14,834
let's go back!

311
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,375
He's gone again?

312
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,626
-Stuffy!
-He just comes...

313
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,834
and goes as he likes.

314
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,667
Is he retarded or what?

315
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,542
Little Master.

316
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:24,876
-Stuffy.
-It's too hazy here.

317
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,959
What's the PM2.5 reading here? Jeez.

318
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,459
Stuffy!

319
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,125
Dummy Zhang?

320
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,209
Dummy Zhang.

321
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:33,542
Stuffy!

322
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,584
Dummy Zhang!

323
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:35,959
Little Master!

324
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,292
Dummy Zhang.

325
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:38,542
Little Master.

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,876
Stuffy.

327
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,000
We meet again.

328
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,250
What are you doing?
Self-reflection?

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,751
Little Master.

330
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:23,834
Little Master,

331
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:25,501
what's wrong?

332
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:04,999
I remember it now.

333
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,709
I think I had been here before.

334
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,209
Sister Wen Jin, look.

335
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:51,501
Xu Qiang,

336
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,083
have you done the report
that Chen Wen Jin asked for?

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,083
I'm going to write...

338
00:21:57,209 --> 00:21:59,042
about the pattern-change
on blue and white porcelain.

339
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,334
Why don't we team up?

340
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,125
The content is quite strange.

341
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,083
You write.

342
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,334
It's not an easy job...

343
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,501
to finish it alone.

344
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,292
Well, let me think about it.

345
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,167
Huo Ling,

346
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,542
San Xing is still asleep,

347
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:22,209
don't wake him up.

348
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:22,999
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,667
Come take a look.

350
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:29,834
Something's on the base.

351
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:30,709
-What have you found?
-What?

352
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,542
Let me see.

353
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:34,375
I know this.

354
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,792
This is the markings
of Ming porcelain.

355
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,209
It represents its place of origin.

356
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,000
No.

357
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,292
The markings of Ming porcelain
doesn't look like this.

358
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:41,792
This might be...

359
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,584
the inscription that
indicates the owner's identity.

360
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:44,584
Zhou Yuan,

361
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,209
I think we better
write our own thesis.

362
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,959
I'm worried about your standard.

363
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,417
Marking inscriptions
should be in 4 characters,

364
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,918
don't you know that?

365
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,876
There's only one character here,

366
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,083
and it's a rare one.

367
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,584
What you said is impossible.

368
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,751
I haven't seen properly,

369
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,626
what's your problem?

370
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,626
You can't examine it alone.

371
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:01,167
Stop it.

372
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,501
Let's study it together,
and improve together.

373
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,584
What are you guys doing?

374
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:04,918
-It's an artifact.
-Let me have a look.

375
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,209
Enough!

376
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,000
You both are smatterers,
who only know how to bluff.

377
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,167
Give me that. Let go.

378
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,125
Let go.

379
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:19,999
Kylin,

380
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,042
take a look.

381
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:21,999
What is this?

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,334
Can you don't brush me off?

383
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,626
Look properly and answer me.

384
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,501
What is it?

385
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,667
There are some symbols under the
porcelains in the side chamber too.

386
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,584
I thought they were
just some decorations.

387
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,999
Then, I realized none
of them were the same.

388
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,501
There seemed to be a regular pattern.

389
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,626
So I think,

390
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,834
they might be some kind of coding.

391
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:16,834
And,

392
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,209
the painting on those porcelains...

393
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,834
should carry a purpose.

394
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:23,375
Look.

395
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,542
It's so symmetrical.

396
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,250
Splendid.

397
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,000
What do these codes mean?

398
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,667
I don't understand.

399
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,584
How did he figure it out?

400
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,542
The yellow one looks nice.

401
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:40,792
This one.

402
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,375
The bottom of this vase
is different from the others.

403
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,999
I think it means something.

404
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:47,167
What do you think?

405
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:48,292
Look.

406
00:24:58,292 --> 00:24:59,083
Kylin,

407
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:01,751
did you arrange
them in numerical order?

408
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,334
It's true!

409
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,918
The shape of these patterns...

410
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,250
really do look like numbers.

411
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,042
How strange...

412
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,626
to see coding on grave goods!

413
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,042
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
It could mean something else.

414
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,375
But he mistaken that for a code.

415
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:18,167
True.

416
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,334
Then what are these markings for?

417
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,334
Is this a palace in the heaven?

418
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,834
What does it mean?

419
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,501
Could it be some kind of symbolism?

420
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:31,250
You can't build a
palace in the sky anyways.

421
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,876
Could it be a myth?

422
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:35,125
Look!

423
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:36,459
There's a Taoist priest here.

424
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,876
Does this Taoist priest
refer to Lu Dong Bin?

425
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:41,959
Oh, this is about
how he became immortal!

426
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,334
-I don't think so.
-No way.

427
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,834
Take a look at the apparel,

428
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,167
they should be
from early Ming dynasty.

429
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,125
And the building process...

430
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,626
is in sequence too.

431
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,167
It can't be the
ancient people really...

432
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,626
built a palace in the sky.

433
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,584
I think she's read too many myths.

434
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:58,417
She sure did.

435
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,042
A little cuckoo there.

436
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,834
Legend has it,

437
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:03,918
that Zhu Yuan Zhang wanted to build...

438
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,209
a magnificent and
unprecedented palace.

439
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,250
He ordered Wang Zang Hai to do it.

440
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,167
And,

441
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,083
Wang Zang Hai really did it.

442
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:12,375
In the sky?

443
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,751
Impossible!

444
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,751
It's said that he used...

445
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,900
a giant kite.

446
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,370
And he spent a lot of money.

447
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:21,292
Finally,

448
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,459
he made a magnificent,

449
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,751
splendid illusion of
the Heavenly Palace...

450
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,334
to please the Zhu Yuan Zhang.

451
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,125
Zhu Yuan Zhang wanted a palace,

452
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,250
but he gave him a kite.

453
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,876
I'd be pissed if
I were Zhu Yuan Zhang.

454
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,501
I'll kill him like
General Yuan Chong Huan.

455
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:35,834
Sentence him to a death penalty
by slowly slicing him 3543 times.

456
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:37,083
He cheated the Emperor!

457
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,667
Come on, it's just a legend.

458
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:41,918
Little Master,

459
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,042
then what happened after that?

460
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,125
I thought there'd be more clues...

461
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,125
in the coffin at the rear hall.

462
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,375
So I suggested to keep moving.

463
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:54,209
No.

464
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,999
San Xing is the only one
who has ever entered a tomb.

465
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:58,459
But he's resting now.

466
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,709
We can't act on our own without him.

467
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,000
Wake him up then.

468
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:04,584
He's exhausted from taking
care of us all this way here.

469
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,501
Shouldn't we let him take some rest?

470
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,834
Kylin Zhang!

471
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,375
Don't worry,

472
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:13,417
I can take care of myself.

473
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,959
How?

474
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,417
Have you ever gone to a tomb?

475
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,334
Please think of the others,

476
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,250
if you don't care about yourself.

477
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:22,459
I will.

478
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:23,876
I'll be back in a minute.

479
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,000
You can't go!

480
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,709
One of us is dead already.

481
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:29,542
What should I tell the leaders
if something happens to you?

482
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,292
Thank you.

483
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,709
-Did Wen Jin agree?
-Where is he going?

484
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,209
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

485
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,167
Wen Jin,

486
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,751
my report is about the pattern change
research of blue and white porcelain,

487
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,542
and to research is why I came.

488
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,000
Plus, the pattern change...

489
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,292
of the porcelains here are incredible.

490
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,751
So guys...

491
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:07,792
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,167
I want to go too.

493
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,918
We are a team, we can't act alone.

494
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,906
Yes, you are right.

495
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,999
If all of you want to go,

496
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,459
let's go together.

497
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:19,501
-Great!
-Let's go.

498
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:22,876
Sister Wen Jin,

499
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,834
should we wake him up?

500
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:26,542
Forget it.

501
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,959
He is a hothead.

502
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,584
He'll definitely argue with Kylin...

503
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,542
if we wake him up now.

504
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,876
Just let him sleep.

505
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,918
Let's come back as soon as we can.

506
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,501
Okay, I'm going first.

507
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,250
Be careful.

508
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:15,834
Slow down.

509
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:49,834
I'm so scared.

510
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,375
What were those things?

511
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,000
It's okay.

512
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,042
We've gone through that.
It won't come back.

513
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:55,876
Hands off.

514
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:57,501
I said hands off.

515
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,334
You guys are older than Kylin,

516
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:01,501
but why are you such cowards?

517
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,542
There's nothing scary.

518
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,959
Let's go, stop scaring yourself.

519
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:06,000
Exactly!

520
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:07,751
I'll scout for you.

521
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,876
Zhou Yuan, don't run around.

522
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:14,999
Monster!

523
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,083
There's a monster!

524
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:21,459
Stop shouting.

525
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:23,501
There's no such thing as monsters.

526
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:27,417
It's just some metal
particles in the fog.

527
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,834
It can create some illusion...

528
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,209
under the light.

529
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,459
All these are normal
scientific phenomenons.

530
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,876
Stop scaring yourself.

531
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,375
So, this is the monster
you were talking about?

532
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:57,834
I just didn't see properly.

533
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,459
This is stunning!

534
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,250
This breaks the tradition
of a typical Chinese burial.

535
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:08,042
This site might just be a
new milestone in archeology!

536
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:08,918
Totally!

537
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,792
This is a major discovery.

538
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,871
Once this is made known,

539
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,080
we will be famous!

540
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,751
-You're right!
-That's amazing!

541
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,959
Xiao Mei.

542
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,000
Enough.

543
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,792
Don't waste time here,

544
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:27,792
let’s go back.

545
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:28,709
Sure, let's go.

546
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:33,834
Watch your step.

547
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,375
Wait up.

548
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,375
Kylin is not here yet.

549
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,167
He must be too fascinated.

550
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:42,892
I'll call him.

551
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:43,999
Kylin!

552
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,667
Hurry up, we're waiting here!

553
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,167
Kylin Zhang.

554
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,000
Kylin Zhang!

555
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,042
Let's go have a look.

556
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:54,834
Kylin Zhang!

557
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,542
Kylin!

558
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:58,918
What's wrong?

559
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,209
He's going to get us killed.

560
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,083
What's that thing over there?

561
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:09,999
Kylin!

562
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,334
What are you doing there?

563
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,459
Come here!

564
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,501
He's too close with that thing.

565
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,083
He won't be able to run...

566
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:18,626
if something really happens.

567
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:19,626
What should we do?

568
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,417
We can only stay still for now.

569
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,959
We just stay here?

570
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,167
Unless if you want to flee alone?

571
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:26,751
No...

572
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:27,959
But..

573
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,667
he's going to get us killed.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,751
Stay calm.

575
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,125
I remember that's where...

576
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,751
the sea-calming
monkey statue is located.

577
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:38,000
By the height of it,

578
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:41,002
could there be
something standing on it?

579
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,125
I remember that's the monkey statue.

580
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,959
But what's that standing on it?

581
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,209
Could it...

582
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,667
Could it be the monster...

583
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,520
that followed us when we came in?

584
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,501
What?

585
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:53,375
Or the zombie that
Wu San Xing mentioned?

586
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,751
Stop it!

587
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:56,999
Stay calm, everyone.

588
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,083
This is an underwater tomb.

589
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,375
It's been isolated for centuries.

590
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,459
It looks like individual
reefs from up above.

591
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,038
But it's actually a
mountain range under the sea.

592
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,709
If Wang Zang Hai
is really buried here,

593
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:12,751
it means he lacked
the water element in him.

594
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,751
With the undersea mountain range,

595
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,292
all the good wind and qi are drawn in.

596
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,923
The dragon head at the east,
tail at the west.

597
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,422
Zombie won't exist on a
land with such good feng shui.

598
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,125
It has to be either human or animal...

599
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,209
if it's not a zombie.

600
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,334
As long as it's a living thing,
we outnumber it.

601
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,501
Could it be Wu San Xing?

602
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:33,501
He must've realized we
were gone after he woke up.

603
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,999
So he came here to scare us.

604
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,042
You know him well,

605
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,209
isn't that how he always is?

606
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:39,959
Oh, come on!

607
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:41,375
He's scaring me to death.

608
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,167
Wu San Xing!

609
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,459
-Stop fooling around!
-Hush!

610
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,792
The girls are crying already!

611
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:50,375
Could it really be San Xing?

612
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,250
Be careful!

613
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,250
You guys wait here,

614
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:22,292
I'll call Kylin.

615
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:27,042
Huo Ling!

616
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,918
What are you doing, Kylin?

617
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:31,542
Wu San Xing?

618
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,834
What the heck are you doing?

619
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,167
Are you hurt?

620
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,125
Kylin Zhang!

621
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:39,709
Guard the staircase,

622
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:40,876
don't let him pass!

623
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:52,918
Where's San Xing?

624
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,167
Where is he?

625
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:56,999
What's happening?

626
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,918
The pond itself...

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,292
is a huge trap.

628
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,083
Another layer of
wall is rotating slowly...

629
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,167
behind this door.

630
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:24,667
A rotating wall?

631
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,999
Is it a revolving restaurant?

632
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:28,834
Based on my experience,

633
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,245
this mechanism must be
running on the simplest theory.

634
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:33,125
Why?

635
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,459
Regardless of the
material quality of...

636
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,124
an ordinary nimble spring
or crossbow mechanism,

637
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,459
after a hundred years,

638
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,584
or maybe a thousand years,

639
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:42,083
it will eventually rot.

640
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:42,792
So,

641
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:45,292
the mechanism which
normally traps those tomb raiders,

642
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,657
will be the simplest
anti-robbery sand wall.

643
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:48,209
You are right.

644
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,209
Once they dig deep enough,

645
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,209
tons of quicksand will fall.

646
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,454
They will either be
suffocated or crushed.

647
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,042
But there's both pros and cons.

648
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,999
Once I start digging,

649
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,543
I can locate the tomb judging
from the flow of quicksand.

650
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,959
And I could drill through
12 layers of blue bricks,

651
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:03,000
and get to the main chamber.

652
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:03,918
Do you believe it?

653
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,709
But of course,

654
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:07,751
it's nothing to be proud of.
I get it, okay?

655
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,501
I think Wang Zang Hai...

656
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,584
used the movement of the tides

657
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,042
to operate these traps.

658
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:17,501
It will keep working...

659
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,501
as long as the sea doesn't run dry.

660
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,542
You know what,
all the talk about pseudoscience...

661
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,007
is just about humans
fighting against nature.

662
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,667
But Wang Zang Hai
went the opposite way.

663
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,167
He made use of
the geographical advantages.

664
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,209
It's massive and well-rounded.

665
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:30,959
What a great defense system.

666
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:32,167
Hey,

667
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,667
you smart guys think too much.

668
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,626
You'll start losing hair, you know?

669
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,250
Dummy Zhang,

670
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,751
did you find the trapdoor...

671
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,626
that Uncle San Xing mentioned?

672
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:43,584
In fact,

673
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,042
I found 8 of them.

674
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,542
Eight trapdoors?

675
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:48,918
Qimen Dunjia?

676
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,167
Wow, Qimen Dunjia..

677
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,542
I don't know about it.

678
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:53,584
Tell me something, smarty.

679
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,999
Qimen Dunjia...

680
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,417
I don't know much about it,

681
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,667
but some say it has a long history.

682
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,576
It's as old as
China's recorded history.

683
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:02,167
The first person...

684
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:03,542
who used Qimen Dunjia...

685
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,459
was our ancestor, Yellow Emperor.

686
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,375
That'd be 5,000 years ago.

687
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,709
Qimen Dunjia...

688
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,876
had 4,320 styles in the beginning.

689
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,709
When it was passed
down to Yellow Emperor,

690
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,626
he kept only 1,080 of them.

691
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,038
When it got to Zhang Liang,
there were 72 styles left.

692
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,334
Then, Uncle Er Bai...

693
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,250
only managed to find 42 styles.

694
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,584
That's quite an accomplishment, okay?

695
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:26,422
Because generally people
only know of 18 styles.

696
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,169
My uncle found the rest
in a tomb from Han dynasty.

697
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,209
So, who created this Qimen Dunjia?

698
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:33,832
The Yellow Emperor was the first,
but he got only over 1,000 styles.

699
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,709
It must've been inherited or lost.

700
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,667
So...

701
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,751
he shouldn't be
the first one who got it.

702
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,167
In short,

703
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,492
Qimen Dunjia is a military
strategy and numerology study.

704
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,042
Also called, the Eight Formations.

705
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,999
It contains 8 gates with
prosperity, pleasure, life, death,

706
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,751
fright, injury, shelter, visionary.

707
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,667
Only Life Gate leads to live,

708
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,834
while Death Gates leads to death.

709
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,167
You'll see another Eight Gates again,

710
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,584
if you enter the others.

711
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,584
Like a cycle.

712
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,292
Class dismissed!
Goodbye, teacher.

713
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,626
Just tell me which
door I should enter.

714
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,209
About this,

715
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,375
I don't know.

716
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,795
These walls keep rotating,

717
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,292
The 8 trapdoors are always moving too.

718
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:15,334
I can't tell which one
is the Life or Death Gate.

719
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:18,209
It'd be dangerous
if you take the Death Gate.

720
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,417
Which door did you enter then?

721
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,542
Why did Wu San Xing
go into the trapdoor?

722
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:25,834
Should we follow?

723
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:28,375
Kylin said some
of the doors are traps,

724
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:29,667
we'd die if we take the wrong one.

725
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:32,375
Well, he must've
entered the real exit,

726
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,167
we just need to find that door.

727
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,083
How can you be sure that's the exit?

728
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:37,250
Maybe he is already...

729
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Sister Wen Jin,

730
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,542
I didn't mean it.

731
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:44,959
Please don't be angry.

732
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:48,542
I've found it.

733
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:49,667
Come over.

734
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:50,626
What is it?

735
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:51,542
Do like this.

736
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,334
Can you see it?

737
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:56,404
Can you see it?

738
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,167
Your position is too high,

739
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:05,542
go a bit lower.

740
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,083
Don't look at your face.

741
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,000
Touch your sideburns,

742
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:15,959
here.

743
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,792
We thought San Xing
was combing his hair,

744
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,959
But he was adjusting
the angle and height.

745
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,125
In this monument,

746
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,959
there's a mechanism
which moves as fast as the wall.

747
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,709
That's why the logo moved.

748
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,125
The position it's facing,

749
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:40,959
should be the exit.

750
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,467
Hold your torchlight,
I'm going to comb my hair.

751
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:44,959
Where are you going?

752
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:45,999
Looking for the exit.

753
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,501
For what?

754
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,334
Can we get out of
here if we find the exit?

755
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,959
Then why is it called an exit?

756
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,042
But the Heavenly Palace is in there.

757
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:11,834
What's wrong, Sister Wen Jin?

758
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:14,292
Nothing.

759
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,209
Stay close, everyone.

760
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,209
Okay.

761
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,501
It's so beautiful!

762
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,480
Oh my god!

763
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,380
Good heavens.

764
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:56,876
This is a paradise!

765
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:00,417
Oh my god, this is so magnificent!

766
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,459
Can't believe there's such a
beautiful place in this ancient tomb.

767
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,042
Unbelievable!

768
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:04,667
Agreed.

769
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,292
This is an entire piece
of Phoebe Zhennan log!

770
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,792
Impressive!

771
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,459
Look at that.

772
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:11,417
Look!

773
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:12,834
It's the Luminous Pearl!

774
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,000
It's gorgeous.
