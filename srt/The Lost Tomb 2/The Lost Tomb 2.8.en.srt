"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,120
"Episode 8"

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Get back here!

4
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Nonsense!

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,360
He's more capable than you!

6
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
And he has more experience
with tombs than you!

7
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,760
What if he comes back later,
and you die in the tomb?

8
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
You know what? Come here.

9
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Look at me.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm a believer of fate.

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
Everyone has their own fate.

12
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
Humans will eventually die.

13
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
No matter how much one longs to live!

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,000
But those who aren't
supposed to die...

15
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,240
Someone like Little Master.

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,240
He's as old as Uncle San Xing but
he looks younger than both of us.

17
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,400
He is skilled,
and invincible like god.

18
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,240
It's impossible for him
to die in a mere tomb.

19
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
He's still alive, you know?

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
He's still alive!

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
Little Master.

22
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Little Master.

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
He'll definitely make it back alive.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,640
He will.

25
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,120
He will.

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,320
Where is Ning?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
Here comes another trouble.

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,800
She better have been eaten by sharks.

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
I'll go save her.

30
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
You stay here!

31
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,720
You stay.

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
Stay! All right? Stay!

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll go back down.

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
-I'll look for her, all right?
-Okay.

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,160
That woman kept a boat for herself.

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
I've a question for you.

37
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,440
Why did you insist to have me carry
her all the way up from the bottom?

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
You were so persistent.

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,280
Now look.

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,560
She's running away alone!

41
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,360
Can you see that with
your bright, naive eyes?

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,680
She has left you behind!

43
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,680
You...!

44
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,880
You're so naive that you have
no idea what danger looks like!

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,240
Ning!

46
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
Don't you dare to
let me see you again!

47
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
So you've been sitting
here all night long?

48
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,600
Let me have a look at you.

49
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,240
Let's see if you've
turned into a statue.

50
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,800
No next time.

51
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,800
No next time.

52
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
But he's still down there.

53
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,760
This Stuffy is really a troublemaker!

54
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,640
He's best at playing
Mr. Missing-In-Action!

55
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
He said that there'll be no next time,

56
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,240
and look what he has done now?

57
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm sure that he's back from the sea.

58
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Stuffy!

59
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,760
Show yourself, Stuffy!

60
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't think that I can't see you.

61
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,840
-Come on out!
-Enough.

62
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,080
Do you hear me? Come on out!

63
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,840
Enough.

64
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
He loves to give you
surprises, doesn't he?

65
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,680
Perhaps one day when you bring
a girl out for dinner and movie,

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,320
you return to your hotel
room to spend the night,

67
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,360
the girl would toss you onto the
bed and take off her mask,

68
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,560
and there it reveals Stuffy.

69
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,000
Nonsense.

70
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
You know what, he better
not let me get hold of him.

71
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,040
I'll beat him up if I do!

72
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,760
Yes. Teach him a lesson!

73
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,440
But before that, nature calls.

74
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,800
Ship!

75
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
There's a ship!

76
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
Help!

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,960
-S.O.S!
-We're here!

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,760
-We're here!
-Come here!

79
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,160
-S.O.S!
-We're here!

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
We're here!

81
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
Help!

82
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
Anybody here?

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,960
Anybody?

84
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
Captain!

85
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,320
This is so weird.

86
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,240
This was the ship we came in.

87
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,880
Where is everybody?

88
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Fatty.

89
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,680
Look.

90
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,600
It was endgame.

91
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,880
And the water temperature.

92
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,840
This proves that somebody
was here half an hour ago.

93
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,800
Anybody here?

94
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,320
I saw you, quit hiding!

95
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,720
Even a pitcher plant is picky.

96
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,999
A high-fat, high-cholesterol,
and nasty man like you...

97
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,960
is definitely not on my list.

98
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,000
See that? She's monitoring us.

99
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,840
Now who's the nasty one?

100
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Helm Station

101
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,920
Let's leave everything aside and eat.

102
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,840
Come on.

103
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
Eat something.

104
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
I've checked all the device systems,

105
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,400
they're functioning fine.

106
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
No sign of a ship malfunction.

107
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,680
Do you think they've been
captured by coast guards?

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,000
That's impossible.

109
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,680
They should've taken the
ship along, why leave it here?

110
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,720
But there might be pirates on sea.

111
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,240
It couldn't be the pirates.

112
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,360
The goods won't be left
behind if it was the pirates.

113
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
Then it must be the ghosts.

114
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,240
Nonsense.

115
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,680
A ghost ship looking
for its replacement.

116
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,280
What's with the ghosts?

117
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,600
Are you writing a novel?

118
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,960
Out on the Paracel Islands,
2 lost young men paging for rescue.

119
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
Out on the Paracel Islands,
2 lost young men paging for rescue.

120
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
0101, it's 02 paging.

121
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Brinjal, brinjal, it's potato paging.

122
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,480
Yamete!

123
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
Sawadee krub.

124
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,040
According to the latest
news from the weather station,

125
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,680
the eye of massive Typhoon Thelma...

126
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,000
is located at 5° 7’ north
and 92° east at 0400,

127
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
near the Paracel sea.

128
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,840
The central pressure is 910 Pa.

129
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,680
Wind scale exceeding
17 near the center.

130
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,320
The eye of typhoon is estimated
to be moving at 15 to 20 km/h...

131
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
towards north west.

132
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,040
We urge all sailing ships to
seek refuge at nearby ports.

133
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
We urge all sailing ships to
seek refuge at nearby ports.

134
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Since you're playing
around with the devices,

135
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,440
can you sail a ship?

136
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,560
I can drive a car. Let me try.

137
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Just forget about it.

138
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Step aside.

139
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,280
Can you do it?

140
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course.

141
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
I didn't know that
you could sail a ship.

142
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Lift the anchor.

143
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,200
I'm not trying to scare you,

144
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,880
but there are submerged reefs around,

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
accidents could happen
if we run into one.

146
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,400
I was the top rower at
Shicha Sea when I was young.

147
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
Don't you worry.
Lift the anchor.

148
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
So you don't know how to drive a ship?

149
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,160
You go lift the anchor!

150
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,560

Hail to Master Fatty, you commoners!

172
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,880
We've made it out of
the submerged reefs!

173
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,560
I made it out of the submerged reefs!

174
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Amazing.

175
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Why are you all geared up?

176
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,920
Don't you trust me?

177
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm preparing for the worst.

178
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,800
This is mine.

179
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,560
This is yours.

180
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,920
Bookworms have no guts.

181
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes.

182
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,640
Fatty is the greatest, all right?

183
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,160
That's right.

184
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
I'll show you something even greater.

185
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,240
Is this the Luminous Pearl?

186
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,240
When did you get it?

187
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,640
I would look amateurish
if I let you see I took it.

188
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
Since we're now free,
let's guess its value.

189
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,000
Fatty.

190
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,320
We've agreed not to take anything
from the tomb before entering.

191
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,520
Come on, just give me a number.

192
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,880
Something's not right.

193
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
It's fake.

194
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,520
It's not a Luminous Pearl.

195
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
Don't you dare lie to me.

196
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,400
Look for yourself.

197
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,920
It's an apophyllite.

198
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,520
It's impossible!

199
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
You're the naive one this time around.

200
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,040
Look.

201
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
However rich Wang Zang Hai is,

202
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
how many Luminous Pearls
can he place on his dome?

203
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,080
There aren't many Luminous
Pearls throughout the entire China.

204
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Then, how much is it worth?

205
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,600
This is...

206
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,840
worth not more than a meal.

207
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,440
But a meal between a small restaurant
and a luxurious one cost different.

208
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,880
"Tianya Tiny Garden"

209
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,480
"Tianya Tiny Garden"

210
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,880
I think something is
fishy about the ship.

211
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
What a coincidence for it
to moor right beside us.

212
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Fatty.

213
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,400
Fatty.

214
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,560
How dumb could you be?

215
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,560
Get up.

216
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,560
Go get your shower.

217
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
You're polluting the
environment with you scent.

218
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,520
Get up, Fatty.

219
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,840
Get up.

220
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,000
-Whose Luminous Pearl is this?
-Where?

221
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,240
Go take your shower.

222
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,080
You smell awful.

223
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,200
No, I'll sleep in like this.

224
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm just concerned about your wounds.

225
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,800
It's not my problem if
you get an infection.

226
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
Look, there are rashes already.

227
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
If it spreads through your body,

228
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,080
you'll be deformed.

229
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,120
It can't be that serious.

230
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,080
What do you think?

231
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,160
I've applied ointment.

232
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,920
It's right there,
and it's quite effective.

233
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
You still have to shower no matter
how effective the ointment is.

234
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,560
You still have to apply
antiseptic after shower.

235
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,880
And after that I'll dress your wounds.

236
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,080
Come on.

237
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,360
-Come on. Go shower.
-Don't pull me up. I'm sleepy.

238
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,240
That way.

239
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,720
Are you going to bathe in the sea?

240
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
You're not allowed to peek
while I take my shower.

241
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,440
Why? Why are you breaking up with me?

242
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,240
Have you forgotten about the gift
you got me from the underwater tomb?

243
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,880
What is that?

244
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,400
The Luminous Pearl!

245
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,320
It's just an apophyllite.

246
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,000
What?

247
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
How dare you fool me
with a stupid stone?

248
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,400
How about Jacky then?

249
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,880
You mean the Sea Monkey
that we reared?

250
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,640
Yes. Jacky!

251
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,600
It's a tough fellow.

252
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,000
Even you'll die before he does.

253
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
Do you have to be so cruel to me?

254
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,720
I'll jump if that's what you want.

255
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
Did you even love me?

256
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,240
Ning.

257
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,760
I've never loved you.

258
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,960
You may die now.

259
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,720
You...

260
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,520
Mr. Naive, you're finally up.

261
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,960
What time is it?

262
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,680
It's half past one.

263
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,680
Let's see if you're
still having a fever.

264
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
-Thank you, Fatty.
-Stop it.

265
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,000
This guest house looks really bad.

266
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,440
I'm so bored that my
hair has grown everywhere.

267
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,680
Didn't you have it on your back?

268
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,680
The white hair.

269
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,280
Let's never talk about that.

270
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
Oh god.

271
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,120
What did you put on my back anyway?

272
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,560
Don't tell me that it was a toner.

273
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,480
I don't believe it.

274
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,640
My blood.

275
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,480
Let me take a look.

276
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,800
Sure.

277
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,160
How is it?

278
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,280
Fatty, this is serious.

279
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm not lying.

280
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
It has gone moldy.

281
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,400
White mold.

282
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,280
Lingzhi might even grow
on it in a few days.

283
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
White mold?
Lingzhi? What the heck?

284
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Do something about it!

285
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,520
This is too itchy.

286
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
You might as well skin me off!

287
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,920
Hurry up!

288
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,320
I heard some even killed themselves
after they were shot by these arrows.

289
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
Dummy Zhang, are you
making fun of me now?

290
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
Hurry up and figure something out!
What, now? Do something! Look at it!

291
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Okay, Fatty.

292
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll stop teasing you.

293
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,360
The truth is,

294
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,480
I know how to deal with this.

295
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,840
Just apply lotion.

296
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,680
You city folks are such princesses.

297
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
It stings!

298
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,200
We're raiding a tomb,
but you brought... Lotion?

299
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,680
You might as well bring along
poker cards and start playing here.

300
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
Blow on it, quick!

301
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
When I was in
King Lu's Seven Star Palace,

302
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
I accidentally
ingested dragon's blood.

303
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,080
Since then, I feel like my
blood has been ever-changing.

304
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,160
After being shot by the arrow
in the underwater tomb,

305
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,640
my body was also itching.

306
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,120
But it recovered quickly,
perhaps due to my blood.

307
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,880
Seeing you suffer from the itch,

308
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,880
I tried to help you by using my blood.

309
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
Enough.

310
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,800
You deserve this.

311
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,320
Fatty.

312
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Both you and Little Master
have saved my life.

313
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,160
You're like brothers to me.

314
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,880
Brothers for life.

315
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
No, no. Stop.

316
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
This is too mushy.

317
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,640
I might take your blood
while you're asleep,

318
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,040
and sell it as toner online.

319
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Stuffy.

320
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
How are you?

321
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,200
Is there really no more next time?

322
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,720
Here are 2 cheques.

323
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,080
One is for your remuneration.

324
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,440
Another one is my
payment for this ship.

325
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,520
I don't want anyone to
know about the ship.

326
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,440
Got it.

327
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,440
Don't you worry.

328
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,960
Sir.

329
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,320
When your security detail arrives,

330
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,560
you can come back.

331
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll ask someone else to help you.

332
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,880
You can have a rest
for a few days, okay?

333
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
I want to stay.

334
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,040
I don't trust the
others to handle this.

335
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,280
The most important thing
needs your supervision.

336
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,960
For the rest, it's unnecessary.

337
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,040
You should learn to delegate
routine tasks to your people.

338
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,280
Otherwise, what are they for?

339
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,320
Okay.

340
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,320
What do you think of Wu Xie?

341
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Since you have spent
a lot of time together.

342
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,560
He's a good person.

343
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,960
A nice guy?

344
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,360
He...

345
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
He's very kind.

346
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,480
He would save others
even if he's in danger himself.

347
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,720
That's foolish.

348
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,880
I don't want you to be like him.

349
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,320
Remember.

350
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,920
You're always the most
important person here.

351
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,240
You have to protect
yourself before anyone else.

352
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,440
Sir,

353
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,120
I don't think he's foolish.

354
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,040
He has a sense of righteousness,

355
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,360
and he's smart.

356
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
His kindness is very persistent.

357
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,560
Okay.

358
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,920
So,

359
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,400
what else do we have about...

360
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,280
our kind and righteous boy?

361
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,880
A burning curiosity.

362
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,520
Oh, yeah?

363
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,040
He's fascinated by his family history.

364
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,640
But his family hid
many things from him.

365
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,600
However,

366
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,360
the more they hide,

367
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,080
the more he wants to learn.

368
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,320
He's very confident
about his investigations.

369
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,560
But with the decryption,
he doesn't trust anyone.

370
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,000
Including his uncle.

371
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,000
You're right, Ning.

372
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,320
You're getting better and better.

373
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm proud of you.

374
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Sir,

375
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,440
my biggest wish is to help you.

376
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,120
Since the day I've adopted you,

377
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,800
I knew that one day...

378
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,840
you'll shine like the Cullinan Diamond
on the crown of the Queen of England.

379
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Dazzling and brilliant.

380
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
The pots are piping hot, Fatty.

381
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,000
-Where did you buy them?
-I exchanged them with the boss.

382
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
They are great because
no fire is needed.

383
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,480
They heat up on their own.

384
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
We Chinese people
are really good at food.

385
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,360
We didn't put our
millennia of wisdom to waste...

386
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,800
for inventing something like this.

387
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,720
It's scorching hot! Delicious.

388
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,520
You know what?
If it wasn't for Ning setting us up,

389
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,360
we wouldn't have been
in this crappy situation.

390
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,360
There's not even one
decent restaurant around here.

391
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,960
I just can't figure out
Ning's motive behind all this.

392
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,720
Did you get with her, then dumped her,
and got her hurt badly?

393
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
Dump? What the heck?

394
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Just say it.
Are you both an item?

395
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
How has this got to do with me?

396
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,000
We never even got together,
how could we break up?

397
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,080
This is delicious.

398
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
Tell you something serious, Fatty.

399
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm suspecting that...

400
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
the incident where Uncle San Xing
went missing in the underwater tomb...

401
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,640
was made up by Ning to trick us.

402
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,360
Why do you say so?

403
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,400
Look.

404
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:18,872
You know my family background.

405
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
My grandfather is scholar,

406
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,680
and Uncle San Xing is
sort of in this industry too.

407
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,040
But because I'm the
only child of the family,

408
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,480
they never let me get my hand on this.

409
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,520
Moreover,

410
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,600
even if my uncle
needed help in this,

411
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,960
he would never ask me for help.

412
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,200
He might as well get
Uncle Er Bai's help.

413
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
Uncle Er Bai is also a tomb explorer?

414
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,040
No.

415
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
He's a businessman.

416
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,240
But he's extremely clever and capable.

417
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,000
Even a lowbrow man
like Uncle San Xing...

418
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,040
is respectful to Uncle Er Bai.

419
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
Then I guess Uncle San Xing
wouldn't have called you in to help.

420
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,880
That's right.

421
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
I was suspicious
when I first met Ning.

422
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,000
But I still boarded that
ship for Uncle San Xing.

423
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,800
Why did she do that then?

424
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,360
Why did she lie to you?

425
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,520
Was it just to trick you to
go down to the tomb with her,

426
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,040
and then get you killed using some
lowly trick after everything is done?

427
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,920
This is not a conspiracy.

428
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,280
It's hatred out of love.

429
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,920
Between you and her...

430
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
Nothing!

431
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,360
I swear by my name,
there's nothing between us!

432
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,360
Why are you getting all worked up?

433
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,400
Feeling guilty?

434
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,160
Here you go.

435
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,520
Ning, listen to me.

436
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,000
We've planted a seed of
doubt in Wu Xie's mind.

437
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,480
And with his character,

438
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,680
he'll keep investigating
the relationship...

439
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
between Wu and the tomb in the ocean.

440
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,320
Sir, I'll cast a new bait soon.

441
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
Don't hurry.

442
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,760
I've been waiting for decades,

443
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,520
I don't mind waiting
for a few more years.

444
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
And the whereabouts
of Wu San Xing,

445
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,760
are there no news?

446
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,400
Sir,

447
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Wu San Xing has been too careful.

448
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,200
It's been difficult to track him.

449
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,760
Twenty days ago, he went to
Hainan and rented a boat.

450
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,200
I thought he went to the tomb,

451
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,720
but I didn't find anything
new in the chamber.

452
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,960
It looks like we were the
only ones who ever went in it...

453
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,840
since the archeology team.

454
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,200
Wu San Xing is very bold.

455
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,240
He didn't go to the tomb of the ocean.

456
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,120
There's only one explanation.

457
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,000
That he has found out what was there.

458
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,071
So it's not attractive to him anymore.

459
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,360
But we have the copper fish
taken out by Xie Lian Huan.

460
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,560
Not many relics were left.

461
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,520
To us and to Wu San Xing,

462
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,440
the value of the
copper fish surpasses all.

463
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,760
Yes.

464
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,320
So what does he have?

465
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,680
What are you drawing?

466
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,240
I'll be done in a while.

467
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,440
What's this?

468
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,760
The underwater tomb?
You had it all drawn out?

469
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,280
Impressive, Michelangelo.

470
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,360
What's this? The route we took?

471
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,000
We've haven’t been to
all parts of the tomb.

472
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,360
So most of the parts were
drawn by mere guessing.

473
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
-It's detailed enough.
-Here.

474
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,720
Look.

475
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,800
The mezzanine between
the top floor and the tomb beneath...

476
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,400
is where Wang Zang Hai
keeps all his treasured beasts.

477
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,400
The Forbidden Maiden and
Sea Monkey must've escaped from here.

478
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,920
You mean he took those beasts as pets?

479
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,760
That's one way to put it.

480
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,080
The ancient royal families...

481
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,920
always loved to have a private
zoo while they were alive.

482
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,360
They'd later move the animals to the
tomb as companions after they died.

483
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,560
This was very common
in royal mausoleums.

484
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,120
Right.

485
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,280
You've investigated on Wang Zang Hai
all day yet you found nothing.

486
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,680
Even I know him better than you.

487
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,920
But people are saying on the internet
that it was Wang who founded Macao.

488
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,800
Look, isn't that the
Snake Eye Copper Fish?

489
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,000
Red packet?

490
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,560
Forget about the red packet.

491
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
It's just an application...

492
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,760
that gives bigger packets to
those with the fastest answers.

493
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,280
Is there any information
regarding Wang Zang Hai?

494
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,400
This is where we found Ning, right?

495
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,800
Yes.

496
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,360
It was the place where Little Master
and his archeology team fainted.

497
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,440
What happened to
Little Master is just impossible.

498
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,240
I've seen people putting on
thick make up to look young.

499
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,040
But I've never seen a man his age...

500
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
looking like a twenty-something.

501
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,680
Who would believe that?

502
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,440
If what happened to
Little Master's body and memory...

503
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,920
had something to do with the tomb,

504
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,280
will the other members on his
team have similar experience?

505
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,560
That's not right.

506
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,000
Why was Uncle San Xing
not affected then?

507
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,160
His hair is getting so thin,
he's practically balding.

508
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,560
Perhaps it has something
to do with the secret passage.

509
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,280
Or maybe Uncle San Xing has
never even set foot into the place.

510
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,200
No way.

511
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,400
Have you forgotten?

512
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,360
They went in after Uncle San Xing.

513
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,840
But Little Master didn't
actually see Uncle San Xing.

514
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,920
What's wrong?

515
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,680
Somebody's in there!

516
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,440
What?

517
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,240
What happened?

518
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,920
Somebody's in there!

519
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,320
Who's there? Show yourself!

520
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,960
It's Wu San Xing.

521
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,160
I saw his face.

522
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,040
Are you sure that it's San Xing?

523
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,840
Did you see it clearly?

524
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,000
I only saw half of his face.

525
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,000
Right.

526
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,880
There was only a girl called
Huo Ling who saw my uncle.

527
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,680
No.

528
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,840
Huo Ling claimed
that she saw my uncle.

529
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,200
Who she saw might not
even be your Uncle San Xing.

530
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,760
And maybe she saw nobody.

531
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
Why did she lie then?

532
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
There is no point for her to lie.

533
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,360
Unless she mistook
Sea Monkey for Uncle San Xing.

534
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,520
That's quite impossible.

535
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,080
They would've been attacked
if it was the Sea Monkey.

536
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,680
Perhaps the monkey was
intimidated by the crowd.

537
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,480
No.

538
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,080
I remember something!

539
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,960
Little Master and Chen Wen Jin
were on the monkey statue...

540
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,720
when they saw someone
combing hair by the monument.

541
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
But they couldn't
make out who that was.

542
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,360
Only Huo Ling went by
and startled that person.

543
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,840
And Huo Ling was the only one
yelling Uncle San Xing's name.

544
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,200
You mean that person
wasn't Uncle San Xing too?

545
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,720
Think about it.

546
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,160
Uncle San Xing is a very vigilant man.

547
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,520
Unless it was Little Master,

548
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,000
or else he would've noticed people
like Chen Wen Jin once they showed up.

549
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,720
He wouldn't be combing his hair or
looking for markings in front of them.

550
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,800
You're right. Weird things
happen in the tomb.

551
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,960
That wasn't a rare one.

552
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,760
The archeology team is
such an interesting one.

553
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,600
Uncle San Xing and Xie Lian Huan
both started off as tomb raiders,

554
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,800
the successors of The Mystic Nine.

555
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,800
And who else?

556
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,480
Well,

557
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,920
if Huo Ling was from
the Huos of The Mystic Nine,

558
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,000
then there are three of them.

559
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,400
Is it an archeology team
or a tomb raider team?

560
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,800
If Huo Ling was the
descendent of the Huos,

561
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,840
she must know Uncle San Xing
and Xie Lian Huan well.

562
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,000
But we can't confirm her identity yet.

563
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,280
What I really want to now now...

564
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,120
is whether she really
saw Uncle San Xing or not.

565
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Enough. Stop worrying about that.

566
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
We're still unclear about
what is happening now.

567
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,720
Let alone the incident that
happened over ten years ago.

568
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,920
Let Little Master take care
of the archeology team.

569
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm more interested in finding
out if the Sky Palace is real.

570
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,200
If Wang Zang Hai wasn't
laughing at his own joke,

571
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,960
then what we saw on the mural is real.

572
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,120
Sky Palace does exist.

573
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,000
What's unknown is
who was buried there.

574
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,480
For sure it was someone
from the royal family.

575
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,680
Or it could be some really rich man.

576
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,640
Or else how could he afford to hire
Wang Zang Hai to design his tomb.

577
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,280
Not necessarily.

578
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,200
Have you forgotten what we saw?

579
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,920
Their costumes weren't
from the Ming Dynasty.

580
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,080
They looked more like a minority clan.

581
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Don't be a racist, Mr. Naive.

582
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,160
Can't minorities be rich?

583
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,360
The key is to locate its
position on Changbai Mountain.

584
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,840
Are you treasure hunting?

585
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,048
With your alertness,

586
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,200
you'll be perfect as a
Chaoyang informant of Beijing.

587
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,040
I have limited clues.

588
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,400
How can I be certain?

589
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,400
You wouldn't tell me even if you were.

590
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,080
Do you have your
temporary identity card?

591
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,040
Let's go back to Beijing.

592
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,600
With his birthday stated
on his identity card,

593
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,400
will the security let Little Master
through and board the plane?

594
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,800
Does Little Master even
have an identity card?

595
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,440
This must be one of the
top ten mysteries of the year.

596
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,040
I'll ask him if I ever
get to see him next time.

597
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,120
Don't worry.

598
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm sure you will.

599
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,320
All right.

600
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,600
This is my stop.

601
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
All good things come to an end.

602
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,560
At least we've had a good ride.

603
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,600
Give me a buzz if
there's any rewarding job.

604
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,360
Don't worry.

605
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,160
I got you.

606
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay.

607
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,360
Bye.

608
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,320
Young Master Wu?

609
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,720
Pan Zi?

610
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
Please have a seat.

611
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I'll fetch you a cup of water.

612
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,360
Pan Zi.

613
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,520
Where is Uncle San Xing's laptop?

614
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,440
Look for yourself. It's up there.

615
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,840
"Everything is done as ordered.
Don't worry, Master Wu."

616
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,040
-Hold it right there!
-Uncle San Xing.

617
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,000
-Stop chasing me.
-Hold it.

618
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,280
Are you trying to piss me off?

619
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Your item is exactly
what the museum lacks.

620
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,600
I'll donate you to
the museum right now.

621
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Do it.

622
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,760
Just do it.

623
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,080
Are you daring me to cane you?

624
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,880
Are you?

625
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,360
Answer me.

626
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Did I make it clear?
Is it still lacking?

627
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,720
-Please be gentle.
-Is it?

628
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,160
I was wrong.

629
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
But still, I have to
hand it to the country.

630
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,120
So you're trying to
challenge me still.

631
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,600
You can't keep running away from me.

632
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,680
Pan Zi.

633
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,280
This is not my uncle's old laptop.

634
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,840
Where is the old one?

635
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
I've no idea about that then.

636
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,480
Here's your water.

637
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,000
Where did Uncle San Xing go?

638
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,880
He went overseas for vacation.

639
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,000
When did he leave?

640
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,080
It was more than a month ago.

641
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,760
He flew off alone?

642
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Yes.

643
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,520
Anything troubling you,
Young Master Wu?

644
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,160
Someone told me that
Uncle San Xing went missing in Hainan.

645
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,400
I called his employee,
no one knows his whereabouts.

646
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,320
I wanted to call you but
I didn't have your number.

647
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,400
There's no need for
Master Wu to tell them.

648
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,760
But I'm certain that
he isn't in Hainan.

649
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,720
Can you still get in touch
with Uncle San Xing now?

650
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,120
From what you say, Pan Zi,

651
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,680
not only can you not
reach Uncle San Xing,

652
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,080
but you don't know where he went,

653
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,560
and you aren't even sure
if he really is abroad.

654
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
So doesn't he count
as a missing person?

655
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,000
Fine.

656
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,440
I shall ask you then
since my uncle is away.

657
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,000
Has he ever told you about an
underwater tomb at Paracel Islands?

658
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,720
No clue.

659
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
The sunken ship? Wang Zang Hai?
The archeology team?

660
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,200
Then,

661
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,920
what about Ning?

662
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,600
That, I've heard.

663
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,560
Do you know Ning owns a company?

664
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,000
Master Wu said that
Ning's boss is called Qiu De Kao.

665
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,160
He's always mixing around
with those antique sellers.

666
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,760
Qiu De Kao.

667
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,240
I need to know the
whereabouts of Wu San Xing.

668
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,320
And keep an eye on Wu San Ju.
