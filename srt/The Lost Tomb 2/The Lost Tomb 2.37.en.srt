"THE LOST TOMB 2 - Explore With The Note"

2
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,797
"Episode 37"

3
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Slowly now.

4
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm telling you,

5
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
stop messing around until...

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
the supply truck arrives.

7
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,200
Is there a doctor here?

8
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Doctor?

9
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,360
Why do you need a doctor?

10
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,280
I feel like...

11
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,240
something's wrong with me.

12
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
My memories...

13
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,440
are all garbled up,

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,040
I can't remember anything.

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,640
And the more I think,
the more my head aches.

16
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,400
Our Chief, Shou Shan,

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,440
can diagnose you.

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,480
But,

19
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,200
he definitely won't help you.

20
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,720
Think about it.

21
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Every man who returns from..

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
the Forbidden Land carries a curse.

23
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
His brother...

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
suffered from the same
odd disease and died.

25
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
He must hate you.

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,720
Why would he ever help you?

27
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,640
It makes sense that you feel tired.

28
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,840
That's because...

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,000
I fed you sleeping pills.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,080
This...

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,920
None in there.

32
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,000
I did it to help you.

33
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,120
Do you know...

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,080
the person who came back...

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
committed suicide.

36
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
Your symptoms...

37
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
are exactly like his were.

38
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,360
-Hold on.
-I...

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,960
He committed suicide?

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,586
That happened...

41
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,201
many years ago.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
After he returned to the village,

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
his body was covered
with purple spots.

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Then, his skin started to fester...

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
and stink.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
He was rather strong.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,200
He insisted...

48
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,760
to find herbs alone in the snowfield.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
But for uncertain reasons,

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
he committed suicide out there.

51
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,080
His corpse...

52
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,479
was brought back
by the mountaineering team.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,480
Mountaineering team?

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
When did that happen?

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,400
It happened ages ago.

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,320
Lastly,

57
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
they were hit by an avalanche.

58
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,840
I was still a kid then.

59
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
My elder sister...

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,280
was curious about...

61
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
the outside world.

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
When the mountaineers came,

63
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,880
she was so excited.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,280
When they...

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,520
lodged at our house,

66
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
my elder sister...

67
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
had never before seen...

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,640
those fancy gadgets they had.

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
So she pestered them,

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,880
and asked all sorts of questions.

71
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,840
Then, you should...

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,320
know them very well.

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,920
They...

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
didn't stay long.

75
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,080
But my elder sister...

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,920
still wrote...

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
to one of the mountaineers.

78
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,040
I read her letters...

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,880
and diaries.

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,040
So, I kind of...

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
know what happened.

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Why did you ask all this for?

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
You better rest up.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Don't mention...

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
the Forbidden Land again.

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,972
"Forbidden Land"

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Where is this map for?

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
Is it hand-drawn?

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,880
This is our Snow Village...

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,800
and the topography
of nearby mountains.

91
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
Every family...

92
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
who hunts...

93
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
has such a hand-drawn map.

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,680
It's passed from
generation to generation.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
Each generation...

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,320
will update the map.

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
So this empty space...

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
is what you call the Forbidden Land?

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Yes.

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
No one ever enter this area.

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,240
We mark it out...

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,680
to prevent...

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
trespassing when hunting.

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
Stop following me.

105
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,960
You may not have...

106
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,200
such luck next time.

107
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,080
Excuse me, may I know...

108
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,280
I don't know anything.

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,440
Do you know...

110
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,320
No, I don't.

111
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,320
Uncle,

112
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,840
can I ask you about someone?

113
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,680
He looks...

114
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
like a delicate pretty boy.

115
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
At this height.

116
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
A young guy.

117
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,800
Extremely handsome.

118
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
But, not as handsome as me.

119
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Have you seen this person?

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
No, never.

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,600
Please think carefully.
Have you seen him?

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
No, no. I haven't.

123
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
I haven't seen him.

124
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,640
Fine.

125
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Anything to buy?

126
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
No, I'm fine.

127
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,960
All right.

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Can I ask you about someone...

129
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,520
Don't know anyone.

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,880
You guys are so unfriendly.

131
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Wait.

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
Auntie,

133
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,520
Can I ask you about someone?

134
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
He's not from your village.

135
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
But he's quite young.

136
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Quite handsome. Have you seen him?

137
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,920
No. I don't know him.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
Never seen him.

139
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,200
Uncle,

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,440
can I ask you about someone?

141
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
He's not from your village.

142
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
He's quite young.

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
He looks neat...

144
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,520
and delicate like a pretty boy.

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Have you seen him?

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,040
No, I haven't.

147
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
He's about this tall.

148
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,080
No idea.

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
Does it know him?

150
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,400
Of course not.

151
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
True.

152
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,440
Mr. Naive!

153
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Mr. Naive!

154
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,240
Mr. Naive!

155
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
What the heck!

156
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,440
Sir,

157
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
I have him here.

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Keep him from Wu Xie
for the time being.

159
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Understood.

160
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,280
Folks!

161
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,160
My hometown is also in Dongbei!

162
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,160
Folks!

163
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm also from Dongbei!

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,280
We're from the same hometown!

165
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
You've got the wrong guy!

166
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,120
You're mistaken!
You've got the wrong guy!

167
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,760
Right, right!

168
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,960
Let go of me, hurry!

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
Folks...

170
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
You.

171
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,960
Wait.

172
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
You invited me here,

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
because you missed me?

174
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,720
Why are you here?

175
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm here for the same reason as you.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,840
Are you...

177
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
hiding Mr. Naive?

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,640
Tell you what.

179
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,680
You're being way too boring.

180
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,160
Do you think you could...

181
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,680
hide whatever's between you and him?

182
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
You can't hide nothing from me.

183
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,680
So, let's be respectful,

184
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,280
and talk nicely.

185
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Tell me where's Mr. Naive.

186
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,520
Mr. Naive!

187
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,720
Mr. Naive!

188
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,600
All right already.

189
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,920
You must have...

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
got here by tracking...

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
Wu Xie's GPS.

192
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
If I had hid him,

193
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,360
you'd never find him.

194
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
So, what do you mean?

195
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
To tell you the truth,

196
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,080
we're looking for him too.

197
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,520
We don't know...

198
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
his exact location.

199
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,680
You talked about being respectful.

200
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,520
Work with me to look for Wu Xie.

201
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
Don't cause me trouble.

202
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,640
How do you know I'd cause trouble?

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
You could be the trouble.

204
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,640
You're hilarious.

205
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
This village is very strange.

206
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
If you want to find him
at the soonest,

207
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,240
you'd better stay right here.

208
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Stay out of trouble.

209
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Get out of my way.

210
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm hungry!

211
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Is there anything to eat?

212
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,000
Jin Yang!

213
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Look!

214
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,120
What?

215
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,200
I suspect...

216
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,120
those people...

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
were not mountaineers at all.

218
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,960
They were here seeking for...

219
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,000
treasures or ruins.

220
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,680
Why do you think so?

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,680
I haven't...

222
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,320
heard of any treasures nearby.

223
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,280
Look at this topography.

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,960
The back is as wide as its front,

225
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,040
shaped like turtle shell.

226
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
It's vital energy.

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
This is one of the best spots...

228
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,640
in terms of feng shui.

229
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,560
Look.

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,760
From the village to
the mountain behind,

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
it fits this feature.

232
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,000
Also,

233
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,160
this Forbidden Land...

234
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,520
is surrounded by mountains.

235
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,120
The surrounding trees stand tall...

236
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,560
and the soil is rich.

237
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
This is where the best spot is,

238
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,400
which is the perfect location...

239
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
to hide treasures.

240
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,440
Way to go.

241
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
It sounds logical.

242
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,120
But, I can't read much information...

243
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
with a map like this.

244
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,080
Thanks to...

245
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,400
the map being hand-drawn,

246
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
those terrains...

247
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,960
are very detailed.

248
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,640
And I...

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,960
just got back from there.

250
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,120
But,

251
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
aren't you curious?

252
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,480
This map was...

253
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
handed down...

254
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,600
from your ancestors.

255
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,400
Don't you want to update it?

256
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,760
Forget it.

257
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
The marked area...

258
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
is wide enough for hunting.

259
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
We needn't risk it.

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,800
Isn't there...

261
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
a gold mine near the village?

262
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,560
That's why your ancestors...

263
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
moved here,

264
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
and took the surname "Gold".

265
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,360
Also, look at this landscape.

266
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,680
I suspect...

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,840
the gold mine...

268
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
is in this Forbidden Land.

269
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Want to check it out?

270
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
My friend.

271
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm happy with...

272
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,200
having food to eat
and clothes to wear.

273
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Why go looking for trouble?

274
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Jin Yang.

275
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,760
You said...

276
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
you wanted to find your sister
in the Forbidden Land.

277
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,040
She's your only kin.

278
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
Are you giving up so soon?

279
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,880
I think...

280
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
she must be dead by now.

281
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
Dead or alive, you should see her.

282
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
It's human sentiment...

283
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,280
and a family's form of care.

284
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,200
I believe...

285
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,600
you're not like...

286
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,160
the other folks in this village.

287
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280
You lied to them...

288
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
to shelter me,

289
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,040
so, you won't...

290
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
give up on your sister.

291
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,520
By the way,

292
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,800
I have a tube of Piyanping ointment.

293
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,720
Bring it with you.

294
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,680
In case,

295
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
you get a rash or something,

296
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,400
you can use it.

297
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
Jin Yang.

298
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,560
Come with me!

299
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,000
-Hold on.
-Wu Xie!

300
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,080
Take Wu Xie away!

301
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,880
-Chief.
-Move aside!

302
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Today is already the seventh-day!

303
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
We need to take Wu Xie away!

304
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
If the Mountain Deity gets mad,

305
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,440
no one can stop Him!

306
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Chief,

307
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
isn't today the seventh-day?

308
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
-We'll be doomed if it happens!
-But...

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,040
Move aside!

310
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
-Chief!
-Take him away!

311
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,200
-Take him!
-Let me go!

312
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
-Let me go!
-Move it!

313
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
Chief!

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,880
-Stay out of this!
-Jin Yang!

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Let's go!

316
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,160
Chief!

317
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,200
Check all equipment!

318
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,000
Ready to go!

319
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,840
Yes!

320
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,760
Hold on.

321
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,200
You needn't go on this mission.

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,200
Wait here.

323
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,040
You'd better not show up first,

324
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,040
to avoid...

325
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
a confrontation with them.

326
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,720
I can go by myself.

327
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,559
I have confidence.

328
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,280
We'll wait outside the village.

329
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,880
Don't play any tricks.

330
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,960
Don't worry.

331
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,239
I don't wish him harm.

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Go ahead if you have...

333
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,800
any suggestions.

334
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,040
Why don't we let him go?

335
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
If we chase him away,

336
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,480
nothing will happen.

337
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,720
We can't just let him go.

338
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,880
What if the disease...

339
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
outbreaks in the village again?

340
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,360
I think...

341
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,840
it's safer to hold him for a few days.

342
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,000
Our grandson...

343
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
has been having a fever.

344
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,640
I don't know if...

345
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,600
it's because of him.

346
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,640
He's been here...

347
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,800
for several days,

348
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,120
and nothing's happened.

349
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
It's kind of weird.

350
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,440
Maybe we let him go for now and see.

351
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
No way we're letting him go,

352
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,120
just in case.

353
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,840
Chief.

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,160
What are you doing here?

355
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,480
We're talking business here.

356
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,360
Don't meddle.

357
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,920
In fact, it's not hard to decide.

358
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,520
It's the fairest to hand...

359
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,800
Wu Xie over to the Mountain Deity.

360
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,840
He broke the taboo,

361
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,240
the Mountain Deity will punish him.

362
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,240
If not,

363
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,800
we can't malign a good person.

364
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
All right, you crooked little man.

365
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,400
No.

366
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,840
Is there anyone more vicious than you?

367
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
You exile a life...

368
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
into the wilderness.

369
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,920
Even without punishment,

370
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
will he even survive?

371
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
Where on earth did you come from?

372
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,440
How dare you insult
our Mountain Deity!

373
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,720
Who are you to talk!

374
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,320
Right!

375
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,400
Do I look like
I'm from the wilderness?

376
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,800
Rookie!

377
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
Tell you what.

378
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
The one whom
you kidnapped is my friend.

379
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,000
Where did you hide him?

380
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,760
Tell me now.

381
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,400
If not,

382
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,760
this is the end of your village.

383
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,000
Get in.

384
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,560
Behave yourself.

385
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,360
Behave yourself!

386
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,080
Let's go.

387
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,080
Go.

388
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm here to send you food.

389
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,960
Drink some water first.

390
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,720
Here.

391
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Is it poisonous?

392
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,680
How can you say that!

393
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm here to send you water.

394
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Biting the hand that feeds you?

395
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
A cultured woman...

396
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
must know reason better.

397
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,800
Well...

398
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,800
Listen to me,

399
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
those that they do are all illegal.

400
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,360
If my friend...

401
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,520
is really sent into the mountains,

402
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,760
he won't come out alive.

403
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,960
You have to let me go.

404
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,240
I have to save him.

405
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,520
My dad must have...

406
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
his reasons for doing so.

407
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
There's something wrong
with your friend.

408
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm only here to send you water.

409
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,120
I shall leave now.

410
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,680
No!

411
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,960
He's a good person.

412
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,920
He's as kind as you, lady.

413
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,320
Can you watch a good person...

414
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,840
be trapped in the snow mountain...

415
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,840
and eventually die?

416
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you know...

417
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
I was an orphan since I was a kid.

418
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
It's his parents...

419
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,480
who took care of me...

420
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,680
and brought me up.

421
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
I promised his parents...

422
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
to look for him...

423
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
and get him home.

424
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,920
I came all the way from Beijing.

425
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
I climbed the snow-capped
mountains for 3 full days.

426
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,920
All that I do...

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
are to repay their kindness.

428
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,080
I promised them.

429
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,720
I know you promised your dad too.

430
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,760
But, I made my promise to them first.

431
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Seeing as I promised them first,

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
you should help me...

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,280
with my promise first.

434
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,000
After that,

435
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,560
you can do your promise to your dad.

436
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,960
So, can you understand...

437
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
such a logic?

438
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
It's called first come, first served.

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,320
If according to you,

440
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
I promised my dad first,

441
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,680
but I didn't promise you.

442
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,520
And my dad said...

443
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,520
you're not a good man.

444
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,000
I can't promise you.

445
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,200
Lady,

446
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
not only can you reason
but you're smart too.

447
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
He's sick.

448
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,760
Incurable disease.

449
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,800
He has had...

450
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
many sessions of chemo therapies.

451
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,320
Do you know...

452
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Do you know he needs drugs...

453
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
to maintain his life?

454
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,040
Such drugs...

455
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,160
can only be found in big cities, so...

456
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,840
he must meet his parents...

457
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,280
before he dies.

458
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,080
Do you understand?

459
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,080
So, let me go now.

460
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,720
I have to save him.

461
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,600
Sir,

462
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
are you all right?

463
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm fine.

464
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,680
Give it to me straight.

465
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes.

466
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,760
We lost contact with Shun...

467
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,600
after he went looking
for the village chief.

468
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
Wu Xie is hidden.

469
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,280
Wang is tracking down Shun,

470
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
but...

471
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,240
we haven't an update yet.

472
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,960
Sir.

473
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,840
Find Wu Xie immediately.

474
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,800
I don't care what you have to do.

475
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
The situation is growing...

476
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,000
increasingly volatile.

477
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,240
You need to keep it at bay.

478
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm running out...

479
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,640
of patience.

480
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,440
Wu Xie was taken away
by the villagers.

481
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Eat this.

482
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
-Smells good!
-You eat, too.

483
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,720
You tied me up here!

484
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,640
Eat while it's hot.

485
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
It'll get cold soon.

486
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,800
It won't be nice then.

487
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,520
Tell you what!

488
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
When my brothers are here,

489
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,440
it'll be the end of your village!

490
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,320
Understand?

491
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,440
-Here.
-Let me go!

492
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,120
Let me go now!

493
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,800
Or you'll be sorry!

494
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,360
Let me go now!

495
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,160
This is illegal detention!

496
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,920
He's so annoying.

497
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,560
Chief!

498
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,240
I was sent by the Mountain Deity...

499
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,000
to punish you!

500
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,840
You tied me up here.

501
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,960
I'll get a bunch of people...

502
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,400
to send you all up the mountains!

503
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,480
All hail the immortal Chief!

504
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Dad,

505
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,760
I'll go and take a look.

506
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Stay put.

507
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Sit down.

508
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,600
No one goes without my permission.

509
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,120
All right.

510
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,080
What's that?

511
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,200
Coming for me?

512
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,640
You're illegally holding...

513
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,480
my handsome face captive...

514
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
here in broad daylight.

515
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,680
Don't you know the law?

516
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
What are you doing?

517
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Taking a shower right before me?

518
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,200
I'm not into stuff like this,
you know?

519
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,960
So good at shouting, huh?

520
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,960
What are you doing to me?

521
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,040
Illegally holding me captive,

522
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,880
then abuse me?

523
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,960
Let me calm you down.

524
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,040
Trying shouting now!

525
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
I'll calm you down!

526
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,000
Trying shouting now!

527
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,960
I'll calm you down!

528
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,600
Miss Ning,

529
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,960
the campsite has been moved...

530
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
a hundred meters inwards.

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,360
Are you sure...

532
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,600
our routes won't clash?

533
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes.

534
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,720
Have you found Fatty Wang?

535
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,040
If you find him,

536
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,640
it's best that we work together.

537
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
Find Wu Xie before he gets...

538
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,920
into the Forbidden Land.

539
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,040
Just now,

540
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,160
we detected that Mr. Wang's signal...

541
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,000
had disappeared.

542
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,200
Where did we lose it?

543
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,440
The Chief's house.

544
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,760
Keep monitoring down the hill.

545
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,760
Yes.

546
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,400
Come at me, won't...

547
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,120
Don't shout.

548
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,080
I came secretly to give you food.

549
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
You're the kindest.

550
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,080
Wait. Why don't you...

551
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,160
just free me?

552
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Right, you...

553
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,400
Tell you what.

554
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,040
The longer we delay,

555
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
the more risk my friend
will face in the mountains.

556
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,600
Also, it's useless...

557
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,120
for your dad to lock me up,

558
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,440
right?

559
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,480
Don't worry.

560
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,120
I...I definitely won't back...

561
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,960
and trouble you.

562
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,440
I'm here to save him.

563
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,200
Wait! No...

564
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,920
Why are Dongbei girls so stubborn!

565
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,320
Wait.

566
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,400
Lady,

567
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,040
haven't you realized...

568
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,280
how serious this is?

569
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
My friend was tied up
by you in the mountains.

570
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,280
If he dies,

571
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,080
your dad would become the murderer,

572
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
you'll be his accomplice.

573
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,240
Do you know that
you'll be sent to jail?

574
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,400
Nonsense.

575
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
No one went to jail...

576
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,560
when my uncle died.

577
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,120
Why should my dad go to jail?

578
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,080
No.

579
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,400
Well. Fine.

580
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,840
Are you...

581
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Are you messing with us?

582
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,640
Fine.

583
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,560
You illegally hold me captive.

584
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
You're done!

585
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,440
I won't eat nor drink.

586
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,200
You...

587
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
I won't eat nor drink.

588
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,200
I won't eat nor drink
and starve to death.

589
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,200
If I starved to death,
you'll be sent to jail,

590
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,400
right?

591
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,400
-You'll be sent to jail then.
-You...

592
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,680
I think it was...

593
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,880
stewed pork vermicelli in the basket.

594
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,280
I won't eat nor drink
even if you're back.

595
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,320
You'll starve me to death anyway.

596
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,600
I'll starve and die.

597
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm done, I'm dead.

598
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,680
Here, dad.

599
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,959
Offering sacrifice seems...

600
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
too exhausting for you,

601
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,719
let me do it next time.

602
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,720
I had no idea that...

603
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,760
the animal for offering...

604
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,200
wouldn't cry...

605
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,440
after so many prayers.

606
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,599
I was a bit flustered indeed.

607
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,080
Luckily, the Mountain Deity accepted.

608
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,600
Hope everything goes well.

609
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,560
And see what will happen...

610
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,199
to Wu Xie next.

611
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Who are you?

612
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
Where did you hide Wu Xie?

613
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,240
Who's Wu Xie?

614
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,920
I don't know what you're saying.

615
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,080
Listen to me,

616
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,600
my dad is exhausted now.

617
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
If you bother him further,

618
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,880
then excuse me for being rude.

619
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,480
I know...

620
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,040
you're all from big cities...

621
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,440
and very capable.

622
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,040
But if I find out that...

623
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,320
you're secretly...

624
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,520
plotting against my dad,

625
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
I'll do my best...

626
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,560
to make you pay.

627
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,400
Mr. Jin,

628
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,600
I think you got us wrong.

629
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,760
We're here...

630
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,080
to make a deal with you.

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,880
We'd like to buy the information
we need with money.

632
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I don't need money.

633
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,600
No villagers are short of money,

634
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,920
we can cater to our needs.

635
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,600
We don't have...

636
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,480
what you want here.

637
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,760
Please leave,

638
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,400
and don't come again.

639
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,760
What about coal in exchange?

640
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,080
What?

641
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,200
Coal?

642
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,880
Heavy snow cut off the road,

643
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,600
I suppose...

644
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,040
you've run out of coal.

645
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,040
You should know better than me...

646
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,680
how much coal you have left.

647
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,040
Tell me where Wu Xie is.

648
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,600
The coal will be delivered tomorrow.

649
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,640
Well...

650
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,440
Shun Zi took him away overnight.

651
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,960
Bury what you can't take away,

652
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,440
discard what's necessary,

653
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,160
what don't you understand?

654
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm in a rush now.

655
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm ordering you...

656
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,920
to show up immediately!

657
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,200
Shun Zi took him away overnight.

658
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
He took Wu Xie into the mountain?

659
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,240
Why did he do that?

660
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,800
He'll take Wu Xie...

661
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,200
to the site where it all happened.

662
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,320
If Wu Xie can survive...

663
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,280
one full day...

664
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
in the mountains,

665
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,160
it proves he's innocent.

666
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,440
No one can last a full day...

667
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,240
in subzero temperature.

668
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,520
There are wild animals,

669
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
and Wu Xie is still injured.

670
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,600
Are you insane?

671
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,840
Little Master,

672
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,400
what's going on?

673
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,520
Why is Ning here?

674
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,600
What are...

675
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
we all doing here?

676
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,240
Where are we going?

677
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,200
And,

678
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,800
do you know where Mr. Naive is?

679
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,280
I was poisoned.

680
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,200
I can't recall...

681
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,400
what happened.

682
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,080
Lost your memory again?

683
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,520
You remember how you got here,

684
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,840
don't you?

685
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,080
Someone sent me a message saying...

686
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,800
Wu Xie is in danger here.

687
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,680
So, I rushed here right away.

688
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,120
So,

689
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,440
we were tricked.

690
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,360
Follow the plan...

691
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,320
and find Wu Xie first.

692
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
But where are we going to find him?

693
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
You don't know that I've seen...

694
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,200
the parochial villagers here...

695
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,640
and their implacability.

696
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,600
It's already the 21st century,

697
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
I can't believe...

698
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,320
