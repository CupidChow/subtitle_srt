RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,026
Thank you.

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,488
Morning.

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,489
Hey.

5
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,534
Hey, why are you wearing your scrub cap?

6
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,327
Nice bib…

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,455
Hey, you know…

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,623
I knew it.

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,499
It says right here.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,377
The October horoscope for
Rats born in ninety six.

11
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,838
This week has major conflicts,
even with superiors.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,215
And next week will also
be full of turbulence.

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,719
You'll try to bite your tongue,
but avoiding fights will prove impossible.

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,930
You told me last week was gonna be easy,
and it turned out to be hell on earth.

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,223
That's precisely my worry:

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,476
If last week was supposed to be easy,
then imagine this week!

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,853
There were seven hundred thousand
babies born that year.

18
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,647
It seems unlikely that all
of them share the same fate.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,607
I don't believe in that.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,691
This one's always spot on.

21
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,026
Look at this.

22
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,153
You'll have nothing to
show for your efforts--

23
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,071
Amen.

24
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,448
For God's sake,

25
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,991
I'm just trying to warn you…

26
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,789
Excuse me.

27
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,847
Morning.

28
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,015
Oh,

29
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,517
good morning, professor.

30
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,148
You're early today.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,775
Yes.

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,949
Want…

33
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,325
-coffee?
-Oh.

34
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,535
Um,

35
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,161
not on an empty stomach.

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,080
Mine's empty too,
I was just trying to make small talk.

37
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,498
Oh, that's not what I meant.

38
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,667
I really do have a sensitive stomach.

39
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,669
No, I really do…

40
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,504
Good morning, Professor.

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,131
Ah, Doctor Tak,

42
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,632
haven't seen you in a while.

43
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,383
How are you?

44
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:14,676
Good.

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,553
You're with Pediatrics now,

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,096
-is that right?
-Yes.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,056
I gotta say, seeing all the little

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
babies there every day…

49
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,350
makes me miss Obstetrics.

50
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,185
It's October already, huh.

51
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:24,894
Have you…

52
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,062
chosen a department?

53
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,897
I'm still thinking about it.

54
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,691
I was initially considering Surgery,

55
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,817
but on second thought…

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,610
Internal Medicine's looking good too.

57
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,696
In that case,
you should choose a department

58
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,989
that combines both of those.

59
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:38,950
OBGYN.

60
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,411
Doctor Pyo here should've mentioned that.

61
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,996
Did she not?

62
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,746
Oh,

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,707
I mentioned it. I did tell you,

64
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,249
didn't I?

65
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,709
Yes.

66
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:48,877
That's great.

67
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,839
I heard Nam-kyung's been
treating you very well.

68
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,756
Oh…

69
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,594
Yes, she's great.

70
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,971
Honestly, I've never met anyone quite

71
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,431
like Doctor Pyo before.

72
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,185
You haven't, have you?

73
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,690
I imagine you're busy.

74
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,737
I'll be seeing you

75
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,071
over in the OBGYN offices

76
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,947
next year.

77
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,492
Thank you, professor.

78
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,208
I guess that's a no.

79
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,919
Oh, that's weird.
He promised me he'd pick us.

80
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,669
Ugh,

81
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,755
I shouldn't've relied on you to recruit.

82
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,465
Oh, god.

83
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,850
Oh, no, no, please you go on ahead.

84
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,741
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

85
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,576
Filming us?

86
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,078
Mm,

87
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,621
they've given the go-ahead.

88
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,333
They want to capture all of us
going about our daily lives,

89
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,794
so just act normally, be yourself.

90
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,254
Really?

91
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,672
Really, be myself?

92
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,467
Maybe give a bit more effort than usual.

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,551
All right.

94
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,053
I've gotten sign-offs from the patients,

95
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,180
and those who've declined have
been spoken to separately,

96
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,723
so there shouldn't be any issues.

97
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,641
Okay.

98
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,394
There they are.

99
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,395
Thanks in advance.

100
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,704
Hello, sir.

101
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,455
Oh, hello.

102
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh, nice to meet you.
I'm Jang Young-seok, the producer.

103
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,668
I'm first-year resident Oh Yi-young.

104
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,460
Right.

105
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,171
Uh, my children Mo-ne and
Ma-ne were both born here.

106
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,214
Oh, gosh.

107
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,716
Oh…

108
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:01,551
you don't say?

109
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:02,969
Yes.

110
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,929
Well, shall we go?

111
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,389
Oh, just wait a minute.

112
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm here with, uh,

113
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,476
one of my fellow producers who's more
knowledgeable about hospitals.

114
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,020
But I don't know

115
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,146
what's keeping him.

116
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,355
Sorry I'm late!

117
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,524
Ah,

118
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:17,567
hello, Doctor.

119
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:18,860
-Hello.
-This, here, is our

120
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,819
director of photography.

121
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,029
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello.

122
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,573
I thought it was GYN,
so I went to the tenth floor.

123
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,657
Why GYN?

124
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,118
I told you to come to
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

125
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,286
Where we are now is OB,

126
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,539
and GYN is for Gynecology,
so Obstetrics and Gynecology is OBGYN.

127
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,916
Did I ask you to explain that?

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,917
Huh?

129
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,253
-I was asking why you're late.
-I told you, I went to the tenth floor.

130
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,005
Exactly, why'd you go there when I
said come to Obstetrics and Gynecology?

131
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,215
GYN's part of OBGYN

132
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,469
Look, when did I tell you to come to GYN?
I never said that to you at all.

133
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,137
I have no idea what GYN is.

134
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,681
That's a pretty basic thing to
know if you're filming OBGYN.

135
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,476
I think I can film just fine
without knowing what GYN is.

136
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,853
You've been a total douchebag
since working on those dramas.

137
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,729
Excuse me,

138
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,023
you know, I'm pretty busy.

139
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,691
If you're gonna argue,

140
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,650
we'll do this another time.

141
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,777
-Oh, no.
-You'reright

142
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,736
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, doctor.

143
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,029
Let's get going.

144
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,946
Sure.

145
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,826
So what's the show called?

146
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,495
Oh, it's a brand new series.

147
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,829
It's called

148
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,332
Jang Young-seok's Wee-Oo-Wee-Oo.

149
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,168
Naw,

150
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
it's a mini docuseries that's
set in a hospital.

151
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,671
Okay, but you should know,

152
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,715
a hospital isn't always full of…

153
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,843
touching or high-drama moments
like you see on television.

154
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,595
At the end of the day,

155
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,721
it's just a place of work.

156
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,223
Yeah?

157
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,974
What?!

158
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,020
Why's Doctor Myeong in an ambulance?

159
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,109
Please be careful.

160
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,988
Song Na-mu, thirty-eight weeks,
elderly primigravida, ROM, starting labor.

161
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,573
She's not a regular patient of ours,

162
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,575
she lives far away,
and she's in lots of pain.

163
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,244
-Admit her first.
-Will do.

164
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,215
Oh. Oh!

165
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,470
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

166
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:09,971
That's, um…

167
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,348
That's mine.

168
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,891
-Oh, okay.
-Thanks for your help.

169
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,981
How could I possibly turn a blind eye

170
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,150
to a mom whose water had just broken?

171
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,277
Although, I admit,

172
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,945
she did get very lucky.

173
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,365
She was very scared,
so for the entire ambulance ride,

174
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,660
She rode in the ambulance with a patient
who fell in a department store.

175
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,411
Yeah,

176
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,455
And ended up in front of the
cameras on day one of filming.

177
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,622
Timing's crazy.

178
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,749
That's why she's doing that interview.

179
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,584
Yes.

180
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,253
But what was she doing
at a department store?

181
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,213
We're right in the middle of the workday.

182
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,340
Miss Oh,

183
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,925
the serology and blood
typing were sent out?

184
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh, yes.

185
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,139
I'll do an amniocentesis and
ultrasound on Miss Lee.

186
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,600
Doctor Myeong said she'd do them.

187
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,726
She told me to do it.

188
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,270
I'll do those, then go see Miss Song.

189
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,605
Okay.

190
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,484
I'm Professor Kong Gi-sun.

191
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,652
-You must've had such a scare back there.
-Yes.

192
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm scheduled to be induced next week,

193
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,617
so I didn't expect my water
to break before then.

194
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,160
I understand.

195
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,163
I was informed before hand you wished to…

196
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,582
give birth here,
so I obtained your previous records

197
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,418
from your home hospital over in Haenam,
and reviewed them all.

198
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,628
We want you to feel at ease.

199
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,421
Mm, And um…

200
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,298
I've checked your test results

201
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,925
and nothing seems to be wrong.

202
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,302
Thank god…

203
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,803
Oh, thanks so much, Professor.

204
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,972
Just so you know,

205
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,349
I have many deliveries today

206
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,099
Oh,

207
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,976
I understand.

208
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,686
Oh, then…

209
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,688
could the doctor who saved me today

210
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,690
deliver my baby instead?

211
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,567
Oh…

212
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,152
you mean

213
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,362
Doctor Myeong, here?

214
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,197
-Yes.
-Aw,

215
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,115
you don't have to do that.

216
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,325
Our professor is better than me

217
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,785
when it comes to deliveries

218
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,621
I just feel like we were
fated to meet like this.

219
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,873
If you could deliver my baby,

220
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,793
I won't ever forget what
you've done for me.

221
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,631
In your best interest,
that's a great idea.

222
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,340
Mm.

223
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,967
I have a lot on my plate

224
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,385
so this worked out

225
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,428
I'll leave her with you.

226
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,097
Oh,

227
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,431
sure.

228
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,809
Aw, Doctor.

229
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,353
I promise to do my very best.

230
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,438
Oh, I know you will.
I put my faith in you.

231
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,147
Thank you.

232
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,485
Don't worry about anything.

233
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,611
I won't. Thank you.

234
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,244
She was in town to see a fortune teller,

235
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,664
and they told her that she should
really try to give birth naturally.

236
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh…

237
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,709
So prep with that in mind.

238
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,335
But Doctor,

239
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,712
the patient's a little old

240
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,422
and has a narrow pelvic outlet.

241
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,007
The EBW's a bit high too.

242
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,383
Really?

243
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,720
Oh, but three point five kilo is fine.

244
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,513
You got me worried.

245
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,350
I promised her that she could
have a vaginal delivery.

246
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,059
What if…

247
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,644
the labor doesn't progress well

248
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,562
and she needs surgery?

249
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,439
I've had many cases like that.

250
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,898
You think I don't know that?

251
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,567
We're gonna have to.

252
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,778
I told her on camera that VD
wouldn't be a problem and

253
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,196
I don't wanna look like an idiot.

254
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,406
Huh?

255
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,117
It's not gonna be a huge deal anyway,
so let's just go with VD.

256
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,246
Right.

257
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,291
Oh, I've been so busy I
haven't gotten you guys coffee yet.

258
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:25,791
Hey, hello…

259
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:26,959
-Hello.
-I'm sorry.

260
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,044
I'm sorry. Ugh…

261
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,463
Coffee isn't the issue.
You've been working on an empty stomach.

262
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,922
I saw your lunch was uneaten.

263
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,257
Oh… so that's why.

264
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,050
I am starving.

265
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,217
Mm.

266
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,427
Oh, Jae-il,

267
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,179
the intern who's starting here tomorrow

268
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,347
is Nam Dong-eun, right?

269
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,264
Yes,

270
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
I told him to report to the ward tomorrow.

271
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,309
My friend said,

272
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,062
he's been on rotation
in eight departments,

273
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,773
and he's had team dinners
in seven of them.

274
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,441
We're the same MBTI:

275
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,567
both "E"s.

276
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,943
It's not like that.

277
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,405
All seven of the different team
dinners he was invited to,

278
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,992
were at beef barbecue restaurants,
and he paid…

279
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,496
So I think that basically means

280
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,664
-He's the perfect man!
-he's the perfect man.

281
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,456
Oh,

282
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,875
wouldn't it be great if
he joined our department?

283
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,210
Doctor,

284
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,795
you can rest assured.

285
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,588
I don't know about much,

286
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,216
but I'm confident in my ability
to win people over.

287
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,511
I have over a hundred theft convictions
for stealing the hearts of fans,

288
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,388
from young girls to moms,

289
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,473
You can call me a criminal…

290
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,266
Um Jay.

291
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,729
Hey.

292
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,272
Hello.

293
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,858
Didn't I tell you to set up a consultation

294
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,236
with Colorectal Surgery
for this upcoming Friday?

295
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,654
Yes, you did, professor.

296
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,614
Oh!

297
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,952
But they'll be off-site then,

298
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,079
they're all going to
a conference that day.

299
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:45,830
Uh, I--

300
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,873
Oh, I'm sorry, Professor.

301
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,874
I'll do what I can to arrange

302
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,001
-the consultation.
-No, no need for that.

303
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,669
And why, you ask?

304
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,796
Because I've already done it myself.

305
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,298
A professor had to do a resident's job.

306
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,428
How can an R-three forget to set up
a consultation? Where's your head at?

307
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,888
Not even an R-one would screw up that bad.

308
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,058
What kind of example do you think
you're setting for him, huh?

309
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,020
-Ac-- Actually--
-I-I'm sorry.

310
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,857
You think preparing for an
upcoming surgery's a joke?

311
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,611
Seriously.

312
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,453
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

313
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,330
You said to do it yesterday.

314
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
I did.

315
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,921
I just…

316
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,929
I should've double-checked on it.

317
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,139
Right?

318
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,891
It slipped my mind too.

319
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,393
No, doctor,

320
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,978
it was all my fault.

321
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,188
Because of me, you…

322
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,983
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

323
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,110
As long as you recognize it, you're good.

324
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,945
Just don't forget to do it again.

325
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,364
No,

326
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,492
I'll never mess up like this again.

327
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,451
I promise you.

328
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,205
Doctor,

329
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,582
I'm sorry.

330
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,083
That's all right, it's fine.

331
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,294
I gotta go over a patient's surgery.

332
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,212
Okay.

333
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,136
I guess this is why everyone calls
her Mother Eun-mi Teresa.

334
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,555
Da-hye would've been mad.

335
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:27,932
Ugh.

336
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,684
I saw that the lab results
aren't included in the remarks.

337
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,560
I'm about to do it.

338
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,939
And Miss Jang's has had her painkillers
changed to fentanyl.

339
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,106
I already noticed that!

340
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,489
If an R-one messes up, the R-two takes
the rap, so obviously I'm pretty nervous.

341
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,406
I don't ever…

342
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,246
Thank you for taking
the time to remind me.

343
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,332
Exactly.

344
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,251
You need to get your act together

345
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,877
so I don't have to remind you.

346
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,380
Right.

347
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,507
But Doctor,

348
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,093
I'm putting together the
schedule for this week,

349
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,596
and I see that Miss Kwon,
who was booked for PDS on Thursday,

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,431
has now been scheduled for IDS instead.

351
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,724
Yes,

352
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,893
that's what they've been
saying this whole time.

353
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,811
Right.

354
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:15,938
But last week,

355
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,107
Miss Park Seong-ok underwent PDS and

356
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,110
when her CT scan also ruled
out serous carcinoma,

357
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,529
she had a similar degree of metastasis.

358
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,323
Well, the thing is,
the professor told us that was…

359
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,158
Yes, I'm coming!

360
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,244
I'm busy right now.

361
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,245
We'll talk later.

362
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,708
Ugh, seriously,

363
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,042
R-two this, R-two that!

364
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,586
-Cha Da-hye?
-Yeah,

365
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,462
she calls me every hour.

366
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,423
Have you done it yet, are you gonna do it?

367
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,340
That's an improvement.

368
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
She used to call me every half hour.

369
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,678
And she never answers my questions.

370
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,264
I don't know who can't trust whom.

371
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,181
Hey,

372
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,143
separation anxiety mixed with
mistrust is still better.

373
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,853
Unlike a senior

374
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,063
who takes credit for work she didn't do.

375
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,607
Myeong Eun-won?

376
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,317
Yes.

377
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,110
You disagree?

378
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,945
Isn't this

379
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,988
a little better?

380
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,989
It isn't--

381
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,157
everyone in OBGYN's weird.

382
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,658
That's so true.

383
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,827
My friend in Anesthesia told me

384
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,579
that Obstetrics surgeries

385
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,872
are like horror movies.

386
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,250
They're always screaming at you
when they're taking out the baby,

387
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:18,959
but once it's out,

388
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,878
they're humming a little tune,

389
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,379
and by the time they're closing her up,

390
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,589
everyone's nice again.

391
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,257
Like, "Where do you all live?

392
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,508
Have you eaten yet?"

393
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,302
And it all happens

394
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,179
within a three-minute timeframe.

395
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,263
It's so freaking creepy.

396
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,807
They're all messed up.

397
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,767
That's not true.

398
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,352
There's one normal person.

399
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,144
Who's that?

400
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,396
Ki Eun-mi, of course.

401
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,357
Oh, I'll give you that.

402
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,859
Did you know… she happens to have

403
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,361
mixed ancestry?

404
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,529
She's part human

405
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,323
and she's also part angel.

406
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,950
Her blood type must be A

407
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,784
for Angel.

408
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,744
From now on,

409
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,204
Eun-mi is my role model.

410
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,748
She's the person I admire most,

411
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,958
more than the guys in BTS,

412
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,250
seriously.

413
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,962
There's one more normal person.

414
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,671
Who?

415
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,255
Doctor Ku Do-won.

416
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,050
-That's right.
-What do you mean?

417
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,011
What's normal about someone who comes
to work at four thirty in the morning,

418
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,096
entirely by choice?

419
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,430
He doesn't these days.

420
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,141
Now and then, he comes in at six.

421
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,643
How do you know that?

422
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,019
I've seen him.

423
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,437
What?

424
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,815
I mean, I haven't seen…

425
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,486
There've been days when
he's not in the caf…

426
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,613
at five in the morning.

427
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,739
Mister Routine has changed.

428
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,408
He was my role model.

429
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,076
How many role models do you have?

430
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:34,994
Mm…

431
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,496
OH JOO-YOUNG

432
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,165
I'm off.

433
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,375
Where to?

434
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,835
To dinner.

435
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,420
Hey, but you just ate!

436
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,597
Seung-Won.

437
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,974
Yeah?

438
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,356
I…

439
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,359
What?

440
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,365
It's about Yi-young.

441
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,913
Try not to fight with her.

442
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,127
Joo-young!

443
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,837
Honey! Honey.

444
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,592
-Hi, hon.
-What's this?

445
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,843
-Did you get groceries? What…
-Yeah, I did.

446
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,095
-I got the things you asked for.
-Let me see. Ah…

447
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,722
-Seaweed, loach stew--
-Okay.

448
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,265
Oh, but I don't like loach stew.

449
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,184
Well, I didn't buy it for you.

450
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,603
What about oranges?

451
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,814
Ugh, I'm not a fan of loach stew.

452
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,816
-Oh!
-Oh! Hey,

453
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,401
-Careful, it's hot!
-watch it!

454
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,653
Seung-won, you--

455
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,905
I'm sorry.

456
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,989
That wasn't intentional.

457
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,365
It's a love reflex.

458
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,575
You all right?

459
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,085
You know that I'm expecting.

460
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,837
Could you be a bit more careful?

461
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,173
You had the embryo transfer today.

462
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,174
It's just a bunch of cells.

463
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,258
Don't say "It."

464
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,426
It's our Foweva.

465
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,095
Fo… Fo what?

466
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,888
Young from Joo-young,

467
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,183
Won from Seung-won, Young One Forever.

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,477
Whaddaya think?

469
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:24,812
Cute name, right?

470
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,730
Even your baby's nickname is cringey.

471
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,066
The procedure wasn't too uncomfortable?

472
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,984
I was too happy to even notice.

473
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,945
I'm so glad we got four embryos.

474
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,405
We transferred two and
froze the other two,

475
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,406
so we have backups.

476
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,909
Like installment savings.
Good backup plan.

477
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,746
I was so happy to be done with all
those injections, but apparently,

478
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,872
we have to get new ones.

479
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,958
-Injections?
-Mm,

480
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,335
they're to thicken the uteran wall.

481
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,171
It's to help implantation
and sustain the pregnancy.

482
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,131
Mm-hmm.

483
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,174
They're really painful.

484
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,551
Why?

485
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,804
Well, the ingredient they're injecting
is progesterone, it's a lipid,

486
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,598
so that means it causes knots
at the site of injection.

487
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,433
That's why people call
them rock injections.

488
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,184
Mm…

489
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,478
You know more than this R-One here,
Joo-young.

490
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,481
Welp, I mean,
how many years have I been doing IVF?

491
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,691
Hey, R-one,

492
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,901
you come to me with any questions.

493
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,780
You should be eating a real dinner.

494
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,115
I thought you wanted loach stew.

495
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,367
Avocados, kiwi fruit,
and loach stew help with implantation,

496
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,619
so we've stocked up on all of that stuff…

497
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,831
The best thing is to eat
a range of healthy foods.

498
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,874
Yeah, exactly. See? Look,

499
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,459
that's enough of this,
it'll make you cold. Have something hot,

500
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,711
like loach stew.

501
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,213
Aw, you're so funny.

502
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,840
Oh, did we tell you?

503
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,757
We're going on a trip.

504
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
Oh yeah? All of a sudden?

505
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,137
Well, we won't find out for a week
whether the implantation worked,

506
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,181
so we wanna do something
that'll keep us occupied.

507
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,807
Well, if I'm at home,

508
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,184
I'll just keep taking
pregnancy tests every

509
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,227
day and then I'll know
if it's worked or not.

510
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,898
She's promised me she'll try to not
keep taking those tests every day.

511
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,691
That's great.

512
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,818
You guys should go and enjoy yourselves.

513
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,486
Oh.

514
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,946
Pass me my phone?

515
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,245
PREGNANCY TEST

516
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,503
Mm.

517
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,092
Hello?

518
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,511
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

519
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,441
Do you need more time to think it over?

520
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,151
I don't. I'll do it.

521
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,444
Great.

522
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,862
-So--
-Hang on.

523
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,697
-I don't think I can.
-Oh,

524
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,448
okay.

525
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,700
-That's no problem--
-No, I'll do it.

526
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,701
Please set it up.

527
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,204
I think that's a good choice.

528
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,498
A fixed deposit savings
plan for young adults,

529
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,291
a hundred and fifty thousand won deposits,

530
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,751
and the duration is one year.

531
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,670
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

532
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,298
We also have a two year plan.

533
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,008
Can I give you more info?

534
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,010
No, thanks. I need the money next year.

535
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,887
I might be an aunt by then.

536
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,183
I wanted to buy a car seat for the baby

537
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,518
but they're so expensive.

538
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,061
You're gonna be an auntie, huh?

539
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,854
Congrats in advance.

540
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,314
Is it a boy or a girl?

541
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:14,982
Dunno,

542
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,316
right now,

543
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,609
it's just a bunch of cells.

544
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,027
But…

545
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,280
I think I'd be happy with either.

546
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,907
You must be very close to your sister.

547
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,160
Actually,
I'm not at all. My sister kinda hates me.

548
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,121
Well, hopefully,

549
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,163
this plan works for you.

550
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,919
Excuse me,

551
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,504
uh…

552
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,172
I have another question.

553
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,010
Can I extend my overdraft
account next January?

554
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:43,760
Oh,

555
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,887
just bring your Certificate of Employment.

556
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,723
And if I don't have one?

557
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,266
Then it won't be possible.

558
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,393
It won't…

559
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,065
Why were you at the bank?

560
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,151
Well, you know,

561
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,485
just…

562
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,529
Ah.

563
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,905
Here you go.

564
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,870
-Aw, I've already had breakfast.
-Mm, actually,

565
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,996
they're not for you.

566
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,459
Joo-young likes the streusel
buns from here,

567
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,294
but I don't think I'll
make it home tonight so

568
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,211
could you take them?

569
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,215
I like their streusel buns too.

570
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,010
I like them more than she does.

571
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,561
I'll… get you some next time.

572
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,271
It's always "next time" with you.

573
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,273
You said you'd buy me crab.

574
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,610
Another empty promise?

575
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,527
Um…

576
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,364
You see? You've forgotten, haven't you?

577
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,283
Uh, Oh Yi---

578
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,702
Doctor Oh, uh…

579
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,213
You wanna…

580
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,297
go get dinner?

581
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,512
-Tomorrow at nine.
-I do.

582
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,347
Don't you need to

583
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,598
-check--
-I'll be there.

584
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,183
No need.

585
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,852
I'll be there.

586
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:25,946
It's your phone.

587
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,032
What'll we eat?

588
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,328
Your phone.

589
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,746
Where do you wanna go?

590
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,214
Doctor Oh Yi-Young.

591
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,468
-Your phone.
-Yes.

592
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,722
Hello?

593
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,641
Oh, I'm coming now.

594
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,990
Yeah, Sa-Bi, I'm almost there.

595
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,908
Yeah, me too.

596
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,246
What's going on?

597
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,289
Doctor,

598
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,249
the professor

599
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,960
told me to remove the
patient's drainage bag.

600
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:22,878
Right.

601
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,006
Bag number one.

602
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,259
Huh?

603
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,803
What did you just remove?

604
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,306
-I'm sorry.
-You think sorry's gonna…

605
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,724
I'm sorry, our intern misunderstood--

606
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,391
We should've

607
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,976
helped him remove it.

608
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:38,977
I apologize.

609
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,229
So what are we gonna do?

610
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,857
I mean…isn't this going to cause problems?

611
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,359
Oh, there was little drainage
into bag number one yesterday,

612
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,070
which is why he requested a
removal this morning, but…

613
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,572
Since yesterday afternoon,

614
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,366
the drainage into bag number two has
also decreased to almost nothing,

615
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,285
and looking at the bag,
both the drainage color

616
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,496
and the volume look fine,
so it shouldn't be a problem

617
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,664
-to remove both.
-Given what we're seeing,

618
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,957
I'd say there's no need to worry.

619
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,917
Really?

620
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,460
Is everything okay?

621
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,587
Uh, even so,

622
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,296
uh,

623
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,006
we'll go and check with
the professor again

624
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,133
and ask when the remaining
bag can be removed, so

625
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,760
we'll update you very soon.

626
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,802
So then,

627
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,679
you're saying everything's fine now?

628
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,597
Yes.

629
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,849
We're sorry we scared you.

630
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,101
Gosh, I got so worried there.

631
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,270
Please do check with him.

632
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,522
I will.

633
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm sorry, ma'am.

634
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,109
Right.

635
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,695
Well then.

636
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,373
Doctor Nam Dong-eun,

637
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,917
why did you have to call both of us over?

638
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,378
Uh… mm.

639
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,337
I did

640
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,507
try calling you first,
uh, but you didn't pick up, so…

641
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,591
I called him after,

642
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,759
and he said he'd come.

643
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,719
But then…

644
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,555
you called back saying you'd come, so…

645
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,890
I don't typically get angry with people,

646
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,268
but why do you keep messing up?

647
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,477
Hm? Also,

648
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,479
it's all in the chart right here, so why?

649
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,397
Whoa.

650
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,233
Cut him some slack,
okay? He's overwhelmed 'cause it's

651
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,442
his first day in Gynecology.

652
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:10,902
Aren't you?

653
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,904
Don't worry,

654
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,864
I'll check in with the professor.

655
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,616
Thank you, doctor.

656
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:18,994
Have you had lunch?

657
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,290
Go down,

658
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,542
and get us coffee and snacks, would you?

659
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,085
And get some fresh air, too.

660
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,212
Oh.

661
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,422
Thank you, doctor.

662
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,965
Go on.

663
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,550
Go, go.

664
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,720
Hey,

665
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,930
we need to tell him exactly
what he did wrong.

666
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,515
It wasn't because he didn't know.

667
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,683
He was just nervous.

668
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:44,769
Oh.

669
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,313
Are you sweet-talking him

670
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,606
-so he'll join us?
-No,

671
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,608
I'm just trying to be like Eun-mi.

672
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,484
That's not something you can copy.

673
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,820
Excuse me.

674
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,571
Oh, yes.

675
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,615
-How can I help you?
-Are you…

676
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,324
uh…

677
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,617
Oh. Excuse me.

678
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,329
Yes?

679
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,039
You are, aren't you?

680
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,540
You really are!

681
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,374
Huh?

682
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,084
Hi-Boyz.

683
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,377
Oh…

684
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,879
Um Jay, it's you!

685
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,047
Yes.

686
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,549
Hi,

687
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,092
my Boyz.

688
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,386
Hi,

689
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,680
Hello Girl.

690
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,391
Oh,

691
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,101
oh, oh, oh…

692
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,021
Oh, h-h-how, how-- how did you…

693
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,232
I've been an enormous fan of yours
since I was in middle school.

694
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,820
Gosh, you have no idea how much I cried
when I heard you were breaking up.

695
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,239
Debuted on February fourth, twenty eleven,

696
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,949
chart-topped June, twenty twelve,

697
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,826
and then December, twenty thirteen,

698
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,661
sudden disbandment.

699
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,790
Uh, may I…?

700
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,169
I appreciate it.

701
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,088
Oh,

702
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,547
your mother,

703
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,591
-she's gonna be okay.
-Oh, yes,

704
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,634
I think so too.

705
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,429
Oh, oh, are- are you all right?

706
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,514
Oh, yes.

707
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,724
Doctor,

708
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,643
I got this for you.

709
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,061
Oh, thank you.

710
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,863
-Something the matter with Miss Song Na-mu?
-No, but

711
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,615
they removed her NST so
she could use the toilet.

712
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,158
I was just with her to put it back.

713
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,410
When was the last cervical check?

714
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,412
Three hours ago.
It was at two point five centimeters.

715
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,621
And the ultrasound?

716
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,040
When she was admitted,
everything was fine.

717
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:29,999
Uh-huh.

718
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,043
Maybe you should do another one.

719
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,378
Huh? Why?

720
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,130
And make sure to tell her,

721
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,756
it's by my special instructions.

722
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm in surgery now,
message me when you're done.

723
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,718
Surgery?

724
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,720
You don't have any surgeries today.

725
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,054
I'm assisting one.

726
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,681
Do the ultrasound.

727
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,558
Okay…

728
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,729
I'm off to do an ultrasound.

729
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,272
Got it.

730
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,736
Ma'am,
we're administering the anesthesia now.

731
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,071
You'll be getting an injection
in your back.

732
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,157
It might be scary because
you can't see it,

733
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,324
but it won't be too painful.

734
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,951
I'll be here,

735
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,203
holding your hand while it's administered.

736
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,793
Could you bend forward a little more?
That's it.

737
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,383
And lastly,
don't forget to remove Miss Yoo Ji-an's

738
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,010
Foley catheter tomorrow morning.

739
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,011
Right.

740
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,929
-If she's unable to self-void--
-The catheter has to go back

741
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,264
in, so I'll be sure to check.

742
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,644
And the final thing:

743
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,104
the consent forms and orders

744
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,023
-for the patients in surgery--
-Doctor,

745
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,401
do you have the antiemetic order
for Miss Oh's vomiting ready?

746
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,527
Oh, right.

747
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,487
I'll enter the order now.

748
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,572
And don't forget,
the professor asked you to change

749
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,615
Miss Kim's chemo agent.

750
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,991
That's right, that's right.

751
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,075
What…

752
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:47,410
Ugh, come on…

753
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,620
um,

754
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,079
what agent…?

755
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,415
Gemcitabine and Carboplatin.

756
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,708
That's right.

757
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:56,961
Hm,

758
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,254
right answer.

759
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,054
But actually, Doctor,

760
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,098
if the patient was initially
on Gemcitabine

761
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,725
alone at one thousand per BSA,

762
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,188
should she be on the same dosage when
on a combined regimen with Carboplatin?

763
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,819
You should look it up before you ask that
question. That's a big part of learning.

764
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,570
Right.

765
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh,

766
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,704
yes, dosage should be the same.

767
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,831
Right? It's the same dosage.

768
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,667
And make sure you remember

769
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,584
for next time.

770
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,586
Don't ask the same question.

771
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:40,922
Right.

772
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,715
Mm…

773
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,051
Is everything okay with Miss Song Na-mu?

774
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,929
She was in pain,
so I put her on PCA an hour ago.

775
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,264
She's doing okay now.

776
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,266
Excuse me, uh--

777
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,603
Sorry about that.

778
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,688
Are they still filming?

779
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,106
I guess so.

780
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,149
Ugh, I'm at home right now.

781
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,818
Oh, then…

782
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,821
I'll have Lee Yong-sim's
results ready for you by tomorrow--

783
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,488
Wait,

784
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,614
um,

785
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,533
I'm gonna have to see Miss Song.

786
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,034
Huh?

787
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,953
You said you were at home.

788
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,829
I am,

789
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,372
but in this case…

790
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,958
I'll have to come back.

791
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,710
Actually, no.

792
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,211
Let's do this.

793
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,134
What?

794
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,349
Hello, Doctor Oh.

795
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,231
Miss Song, I'm out of the hospital right

796
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,567
now working on a paper,
but I just wanted to check

797
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,443
and see how you were.

798
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,361
It's not ideal, but I hope you understand.

799
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,738
Oh, you didn't have to do this.

800
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,698
I'm really so grateful.

801
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,991
You're the best, Doctor.

802
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,202
You're looking great.
I'm sure everything will just be fine.

803
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,581
The pain has been coming
and going all day,

804
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,166
it's kind of nerve-wracking.

805
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,169
Uh… I'm getting updated on
your condition in real time.

806
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,130
If anything happens, I'll be there,
even in the middle of the night,

807
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,048
so please don't worry.

808
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,841
Thank you, Doctor.

809
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,134
Oh and Doctor Oh.

810
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,469
Yeah

811
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,596
I can't see your face.

812
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,726
-I'm right here.
-Ah.

813
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,355
Keep an eye on her contractions and the
fetal monitor and update me every hour.

814
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,314
Update you every hour?

815
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,231
Mm.

816
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,816
Thank you.

817
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,695
Goodness,

818
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,489
I can't believe there
are doctors like this.

819
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,615
Me neither.

820
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,159
In that case,

821
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,577
I'll see you in an hour, then.

822
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,037
Great.

823
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,292
Yes, Doctor?

824
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,752
Jae-il, the intern's supposed

825
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,380
to watch the surgery,
but he's not here and he's not picking up.

826
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,089
Oh,

827
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,799
I'll try calling him now.

828
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,842
Bye.

829
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,571
Hello,

830
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,490
this is Intern Nam Dong-eun.

831
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,408
Huh?

832
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,994
But I am sitting in on the surgery.

833
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,120
Oh… really?

834
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,788
Where are you?

835
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,706
Oh…

836
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,290
O-OR two.

837
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,337
Doctor?

838
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,679
Doctor,

839
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,472
OR-two has a Urology surgery.

840
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,724
The Gynecology surgery

841
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,267
is in OR-one-zero.

842
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,394
Ahh…

843
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,022
Come on,

844
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,315
the whole point was to
observe a hysterectomy.

845
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,859
So why would a prostatectomy--

846
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,943
I mean--

847
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,987
-There's no uterus involved there.
-Oh,

848
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,780
I'm so sorry.

849
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,865
Listen, Doctor…

850
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,747
It's understandable. Mm.

851
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,291
There's a lot going on inside the OR,

852
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,292
and it's stressful,

853
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,793
and you're still feeling

854
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,544
disoriented.

855
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:07,879
I do get that.

856
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,297
Mmhmm. From now on,

857
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,090
I promise I'll be careful.

858
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,761
I… told Doctor Ku Do-won

859
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,181
that you got a call from the
ward and went to do an ECG,

860
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,308
so say that's where you were.

861
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:21,684
Great.

862
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,311
I'll do that, doctor.

863
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,856
Hey, uh,

864
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,107
do you

865
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,276
usually have difficulty reading numbers?

866
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,945
Oh, I was actually

867
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,988
good at math,

868
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,199
I dunno…

869
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,533
Mm…

870
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,664
She's always on my case even
though she messes stuff up.

871
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,750
Hey listen, at least
she's not phoning it in.

872
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,293
She always says to ask her later.

873
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,170
And when I do,
she says "Why don't you know?"

874
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,088
That's nothing.

875
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,507
They tell me to do stuff that I've
already done. Again! Again!

876
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,716
Hey, can you keep it down?

877
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,718
-Well, we're really angry!
-Well, we're really angry!

878
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,511
Oh.

879
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,388
Since when have the two of you ever
been on the same wavelength?

880
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,306
Yeah,

881
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,725
stop badmouthing people.

882
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,061
Others are struggling,
too, even the seniors.

883
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,146
Now that I'm training interns,

884
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,981
I realize it's not easy.

885
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,194
It must've been hard for the senior
residents to get us up to speed.

886
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:13,861
Mm,

887
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,321
you mean…

888
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,824
it "is" hard,
not that it "must've" been hard.

889
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,079
Oh, for God's sake,

890
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,372
can you do some work?

891
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,540
Sorry.

892
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,627
If you're gonna doodle,
do it on scrap paper.

893
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,294
What,

894
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,963
does this look like doodling to you?

895
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm signing an autograph here.

896
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,633
-Pshh, no you're not.
-Heyyy!

897
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,718
Wait, Kim Sa-bi,

898
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,136
you saw.

899
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,178
Right?

900
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,721
You heard her ask, right?

901
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,348
-Right? Say something!
-Yeah.

902
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,975
The daughter of a patient.
She's a "Hello Girl."

903
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,892
Hell…

904
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,353
-Hell- Hello Girl? What's that?
-His band's fan club.

905
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,857
She knows everything about us,
from our hits to the variety

906
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,607
shows we were on.

907
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,111
She cried more when we disbanded
than when her mom got sick.

908
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,030
Hi Boyz, Bye Boyz. Whatever, okay?

909
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,158
But I suggest you get some work done

910
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,993
unless you're planning to quit.

911
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,746
HELLO GIRL! NEVER CHANGE! THANK YOU

912
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,375
I'll work as soon as I'm
back from my fan meeting.

913
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
You wanna come?

914
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,131
You don't, right?

915
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,591
Later!

916
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,763
Hello?

917
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,016
Yes, I'm on call today.

918
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,352
I'll go check right away.

919
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,564
I took a look because there was bleeding,

920
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,066
and the pulse seems to have quickened
compared to two hours ago,

921
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,401
so I wanted your opinion.

922
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,405
All right…
let's just keep monitoring for now.

923
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,990
What?

924
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,033
But…

925
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,784
she's bleeding a lot.

926
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:45,953
Miss Yoo,

927
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,164
it's not unusual to have some bleeding

928
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,333
after you have surgery, I promise.

929
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
Oh, I see.

930
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,170
I won't

931
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,380
have to get surgery again, will I?

932
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,717
Not unless the bleeding gets worse.
At this level, you're okay.

933
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,760
Oh…

934
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,678
We'll keep observing you until

935
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,721
tomorrow morning.

936
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,014
All right.

937
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,356
Doctor,

938
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,274
are we sure it's not active bleeding?

939
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,151
Embolization isn't necessary?

940
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,321
The pad count is still low,
and the bleeding is mild,

941
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,447
just at the oozing level,

942
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,783
so it's fine, just keep an eye on her.

943
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,370
Oh, we do need to check her hemoglobin
level, so do a lab test for that.

944
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,287
Sure.

945
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,653
It's R-one Kim Sa-bi.

946
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,570
Doctor,

947
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,447
it's about Miss Yoo,
who you went to see at around two.

948
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,116
Yes, what's up?

949
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,118
I really think it's active bleeding,

950
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,537
based on the fact that the
bleeding is continuing.

951
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,997
I told you that it's not.

952
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,833
I know it's a small amount,
but it's not stopping yet,

953
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,127
and the hemoglobin level's
dropped to the tens, and--

954
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,170
The latest BP is a hundred over seventy,

955
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,007
the pulse is one oh five,
and the pad count is two hundred.

956
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,133
I've checked as well.

957
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,926
Everything's fine.

958
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,027
6:00 AM PAD COUNT

959
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,135
DR. CHA DA-HYE

960
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,655
It's R-one Kim Sa-bi…

961
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,700
professor.

962
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,287
Miss Yoo San-ho,
who had a hysterectomy today,

963
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,664
has been bleeding continuously
since midnight.

964
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:36,999
It looks like…

965
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,085
it's active bleeding, professor.

966
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,089
Hey, Kim Sa-bi!

967
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,426
Tell me again what you said to me when
you called me at three o'clock in

968
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,135
the morning.

969
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,345
Yoo San-ho,

970
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,722
BP one hundred over seventy,
pulse one oh five,

971
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,599
pad count two hundred,

972
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:54,767
hemoglobin level

973
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,310
in the tens…

974
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,270
Cha Da-hye.

975
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,480
Yes.

976
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,107
How do we treat this?

977
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,899
Uh…

978
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,318
We monitor the patient closely overnight,

979
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
and if there are no changes,

980
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,656
we can update you during
our morning rounds.

981
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,660
Right?

982
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,539
-Hey, Cha Da-Hye.
-Yes.

983
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,667
If you don't do your job as backup,
why be on call all night?

984
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,584
Huh?

985
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,255
Does it even make sense for an R-one
to call a professor directly?

986
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,258
Why have a hierarchy if you're
just gonna act like this!

987
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,677
I apologize.

988
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,721
An R-one calling me about this,

989
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,516
and an R-two who doesn't look into it…

990
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,978
It's just total chaos around here.

991
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:41,939
Ugh.

992
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,525
You two…

993
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,695
you need to start doing
a lot better than this.

994
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,696
Huh?

995
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:56,912
Uh…

996
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,831
sorry about this, Doctor.

997
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,208
You see,

998
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,293
it just seemed to me…

999
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,300
Sabi-sabi,

1000
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,926
wanna go eat?

1001
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,695
We're meeting later.

1002
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,488
Alright?

1003
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
If, by any chance, anything happens--

1004
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,327
Don't you'll jinx it.

1005
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,870
Be careful.

1006
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,131
I'll see you later.

1007
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,139
Doctor.

1008
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,142
-I think it's started.
-Oh, okay.

1009
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,731
Nurse, we're gonna start pushing now.

1010
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,401
Miss Song,

1011
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,486
we're gonna start pushing now.

1012
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,029
Watch me and follow what I'm doing.

1013
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:12,947
Okay.

1014
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,407
What about Doctor Myeong?

1015
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,450
She's seeing outpatients.

1016
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,993
I'm gonna walk you through this

1017
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,496
and once we're ready for delivery,
she'll come join us.

1018
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,080
Okay.

1019
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,873
Let's get you into position.

1020
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,795
Please lift your thighs up and
hold onto them from the back.

1021
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,088
One, two, three

1022
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,589
Push!

1023
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,300
Keep going, as long as possible,
hold it, there you go, hold it.

1024
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,218
Oh…

1025
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,346
Catch your breath for a bit,
and once more.

1026
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,181
You need to keep pushing Miss Song.

1027
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,977
Right: one, two, three

1028
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,061
push!

1029
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,524
Keep going, keep going!

1030
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,067
Keep going.

1031
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,443
Miss Song, you gotta stay focused.

1032
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,112
If you don't push,
your baby won't make it out.

1033
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,656
He's done all that he can.
You gotta keep pushing okay?

1034
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,953
Doctor, I don't think she's progressing.
It's been almost two hours.

1035
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,329
Oh, Gosh, where is she?

1036
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,668
MYEONG EUN-WON

1037
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,673
Answer…

1038
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,512
Ugh, why's she leaving me on read?

1039
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,347
Ugh.

1040
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:22,600
Miss Song,

1041
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,059
are you worn out?

1042
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,439
I want to do another ultrasound
on Miss Song.

1043
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,356
Okay.

1044
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,493
What…

1045
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,288
Oh no this can't be…

1046
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,456
I saw the baby's eyes.

1047
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,457
Huh?

1048
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,380
The baby's coming down facing
forward instead of backwards.

1049
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,257
That's why this is difficult for you.

1050
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,678
Ugh, what am I supposed to do, then?

1051
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,764
Miss Song

1052
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,141
you need to keep pushing

1053
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,726
a lot harder than you are now.

1054
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,685
Let's try it.

1055
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,519
You can do this

1056
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,812
Let's go.

1057
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,315
One, two,
three, now I want you to breathe in!

1058
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,276
Push!

1059
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,737
Push harder.

1060
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,113
There you go, hold it there!

1061
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,073
Harder!

1062
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,367
Oh.

1063
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:23,994
Hang on.

1064
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,037
Sure.

1065
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:27,915
Yes, Doctor?

1066
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,376
Doctor, I just wanted to make sure that

1067
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,670
you've checked Yong Jin-suk's chest xrays?

1068
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,587
Oh.

1069
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,215
I did request those scans a while ago,

1070
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,841
but I still need to…

1071
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,510
follow up. Uh,

1072
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,178
I'm sorry.

1073
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,305
What about the OTPT follow-up?

1074
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,932
Uh… gimme a moment.

1075
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,142
I'll go check them right away.

1076
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:55,901
Uh,

1077
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,986
Actually, last time I checked,

1078
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,322
those results weren't in the system yet.

1079
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,448
Right.

1080
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,866
And the hemoglobin?

1081
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:04,868
I'm not…

1082
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,120
sure about that…

1083
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,830
Oh…

1084
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,666
then I'll just go to the ward myself.

1085
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,251
It's all right.

1086
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:13,919
Thank you, Doctor.

1087
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,296
Sorry about that.

1088
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,509
Don't you need to go?

1089
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,301
Mm-mm.

1090
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,845
It's all right.

1091
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,265
How can you say "I don't
know" to everything?

1092
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:28,892
Mm.

1093
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,686
That guy on the phone is an R-one.

1094
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,478
He's crazy nice.

1095
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,896
He never gets mad,

1096
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,772
he's got my back.

1097
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,315
Mm.

1098
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,067
-It's pretty great.
-Wow,

1099
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,527
you're so lucky, aren't you?

1100
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,446
Should I join OBGYN?

1101
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,282
If I leave something unfinished,

1102
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,491
he just does it himself,

1103
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,034
and if I mess up, he covers for me.

1104
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,911
He does everything I ask.

1105
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:49,705
He's…

1106
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,081
how shall I put it?

1107
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,500
A pushover… type?

1108
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:54,918
Jeez.

1109
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,170
Mm.

1110
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,880
All I have to do is half-try,

1111
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,631
and he'll take care of it himself.

1112
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,431
Nam Dong-eun, was it?

1113
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,436
Enjoy your sandwich.

1114
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:44,927
Doctor Nam,

1115
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,929
Miss Baek Geum-yeong's ABGA--

1116
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:47,679
Oh.

1117
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,932
I was just about to go do it now. I swear.

1118
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,891
I was just saying,

1119
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,143
I did it because you seemed busy.

1120
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,603
Oh…

1121
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,023
Thank you.

1122
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,279
Also…

1123
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,699
I am sorry.

1124
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,621
Don't worry about it.

1125
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:13,914
The ABGA

1126
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,958
is pretty hard for an intern.

1127
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,919
The patient's pain makes you nervous.

1128
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,337
No,

1129
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,797
I meant…

1130
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,882
-in the cafet…
-By October of R-one,

1131
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,676
you can throw the syringe,

1132
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,094
and the needle goes

1133
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,637
right in the wrist.

1134
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:30,848
Doctor.

1135
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,266
It was a joke.

1136
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,311
Well, why don't you head out?

1137
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,689
I don't have anything left for you.

1138
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,195
Everything's okay.

1139
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,364
You can leave now.

1140
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,161
Okay.

1141
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,086
Goodbye, Doctor.

1142
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,095
I'm really sorry.

1143
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:12,890
See you tomorrow.

1144
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,233
Um Jae-il,

1145
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,485
Miss Yoon Su-mi's blood test results…

1146
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:30,949
Doctor.

1147
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:37,623
Mm…

1148
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,345
Why're you out here when
you don't even smoke?

1149
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,972
I heard that smoking can help

1150
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,223
with frustration relief,

1151
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,435
so I wanted to at least pretend.

1152
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,774
How can I help you?

1153
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,317
Hm?

1154
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,070
This asshole intern, should I talk to him?

1155
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,321
Make him come over,

1156
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,739
get on his knees and say sorry?

1157
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,075
I know that you won't.

1158
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,538
Well…

1159
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,334
It's probably not my place to butt in.

1160
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,213
No.

1161
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,549
It's something I gotta handle.

1162
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,679
Um Jae-il,

1163
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,557
getting angry and scolding
someone isn't easy.

1164
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,601
It's unpleasant, uncomfortable,

1165
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,769
and awkward for the one

1166
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,603
doing the scolding,

1167
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,437
but you have to.

1168
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,190
We don't scold for no reason.
If someone makes a mistake,

1169
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,400
it should be corrected.

1170
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,152
And for an intern,
having someone point out mistakes

1171
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,656
is much more helpful than just kindness,
even if it comes with a scolding.

1172
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
Not for me.

1173
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,036
When a senior told me so kindly

1174
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,287
that it was okay,

1175
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,164
and told me to do better next time,

1176
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,500
and said that it was their
fault and not mine,

1177
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,459
I really

1178
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,003
wanted to do better.

1179
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,630
-And to never make a mistake again.
-Who was that?

1180
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:09,715
Doctor Eun-mi.

1181
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,134
Come on, that…

1182
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,014
That's because you're a kind person.

1183
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,599
Because you're someone

1184
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,436
who is able to accept Eun-mi's
generosity with gratitude.

1185
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,729
That's why it worked for you.

1186
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,771
There aren't many here,

1187
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,689
hell,

1188
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,566
there aren't many in the
whole world like that.

1189
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,317
Most people will just take advantage.

1190
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,740
You know how easy life is if you're mean?
You and Eun-mi are unusually foolish.

1191
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,742
Then

1192
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,493
what should I do now?

1193
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,248
It's not like I can tell you to be meaner.

1194
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,668
Ugh, I don't know.

1195
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,758
If someone messes up, scold them.
If they do well, compliment them.

1196
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,759
Once you practice,

1197
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,260
you'll get the hang of it.

1198
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,180
You'll figure out when to encourage them,

1199
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,222
don't you think?

1200
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,391
Right.

1201
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,894
I've found that juniors appreciate

1202
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,812
a clear distinction between the two.

1203
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,773
Okay.

1204
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,735
Uh, Doctor,

1205
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,238
have I said that I love you?

1206
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,157
Have I told you yet?

1207
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:19,701
I'm going.

1208
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,957
Hold up!

1209
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,671
Miss Song, you need to breathe to provide

1210
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,672
your baby with oxygen.

1211
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,049
Take a deep breath in,

1212
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,133
and breathe out.

1213
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,635
Yes, that's great.

1214
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,137
Breathe in, and out.

1215
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,222
-Doctor,
-Okay.

1216
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,181
Have you seen my texts?

1217
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,849
A VD's not possible.

1218
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,267
Keep trying for another half hour.

1219
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:44,935
No, we can't.

1220
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,103
We've already tried.

1221
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,105
I told you the baby's OP.

1222
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,148
He's not coming down at all.

1223
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,983
Are you sure you've taken the right steps?

1224
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,693
Yes, we've been taking the right steps.

1225
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,612
-She's pushing as we speak.
-That's good.

1226
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,739
But there's been no change
in the baby's position

1227
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,824
It's been two hours.

1228
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,783
The baby's stuck,

1229
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,451
and the mother's too exhausted.

1230
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,577
Okay, so?

1231
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,538
The patient's already been
pushing for two hours,

1232
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,914
and you want surgery now?

1233
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:06,581
Yes,

1234
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,083
that's what I'm saying.

1235
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,292
Should I look for an OR?

1236
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:12,796
Doctor?

1237
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,172
Hey,

1238
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,049
you want a C-section at full dilation?

1239
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,801
Don't you know that's
the worst thing to do?

1240
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,886
-Yes I know…
-All right, keep pushing, keep pushing.

1241
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,972
She needs surgery right now.

1242
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,141
I promised her a VD.

1243
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,767
How many times do I have to tell you?

1244
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,394
And I told you…

1245
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,062
She really needs to have surgery!

1246
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,605
Hey, have you lost your mind?

1247
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,691
How dare you speak to me like--

1248
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,655
Just hold it right there,
keep pushing, don't give up yet

1249
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,115
Miss Song, are you okay?

1250
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,449
May I take a look?

1251
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,203
Doctor, it hurts too much.

1252
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,207
She's been pushing for almost three hours.
She's not able to keep going.

1253
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,250
There's an OR available.

1254
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,090
She's too exhausted. Also what if the…

1255
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,467
the DECEL worsens?

1256
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,226
Doctor Oh Yi-Young!

1257
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,065
Why haven't you transferred
the patient to the OR?

1258
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,735
Were you waiting until the fetal
monitor showed signs of distress?

1259
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,069
Where's your sense of judgement?

1260
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,572
-I have been telling you--
-What're you waiting for?

1261
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,823
Wheel her down to the OR!

1262
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:22,908
Right now!

1263
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,100
I LIKE YOU A LOT TOO

1264
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,564
Hello?

1265
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,066
Uh,

1266
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,151
-I have a delivery from the florist.
-Oh,

1267
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,196
not the lobby, but the parking garage.
Can you come to the back of the garage?

1268
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,197
Oh, you see…

1269
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,907
I'm very sorry.

1270
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,575
Sorry?

1271
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,286
Did you call me?

1272
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:09,829
Oh.

1273
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,456
-Uh, are you Mister Ku?
-Oh, yes.

1274
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,040
Oh.

1275
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:12,916
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1276
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,543
I hit a bus around the corner
from the hospital,

1277
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,461
and…

1278
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:18,755
Don't worry.

1279
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,466
Are you all right?
Do you have any other injuries?

1280
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,175
No,

1281
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,843
um, no, I'm all right,

1282
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,928
but the flowers are…

1283
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,346
I'm sorry.

1284
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,015
It's fine, don't worry about the flowers.

1285
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:29,975
I'm sorry.

1286
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,104
-Mister Park?
-Yes.

1287
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,356
-Do you have any other injuries?
-No, no.

1288
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,107
Hello?

1289
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,359
Hello,
I'm calling from Bon Moment restaurant.

1290
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,318
Ah, yes.

1291
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,153
I'm calling to confirm your reservation.

1292
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,530
Nine o'clock tomorrow for two--

1293
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,073
Oh, today, actually.

1294
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:45,907
Huh?

1295
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,993
Your reservation's for tomorrow.

1296
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,869
I booked for the thirteenth.

1297
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,373
Yes, sir, the thirteenth is tomorrow.
Today is the twelfth.

1298
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,542
Ugh, no…

1299
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,211
Oh…

1300
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,546
Uh…

1301
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,089
Um, I'm sorry, you wouldn't

1302
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,966
happen to have a table tonight?

1303
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,593
Oh, we're actually fully booked tonight,
sir.

1304
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,434
I'm really sorry, but tomorrow's no good,
I'm gonna have to cancel.

1305
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,019
Now, pull.

1306
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,145
Pull further.

1307
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,649
Remove the instrument.

1308
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,487
Fundal.

1309
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,828
The baby's out.

1310
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,372
Time nineteen thirty-five, male.

1311
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,250
Your baby is healthy. He's beautiful.

1312
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,377
We'll show him to you soon.

1313
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,171
Thank you, Doctor Myeong.

1314
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,469
We'll remove the placenta now,
then we'll stitch you up.

1315
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,679
You may feel a bit of discomfort.

1316
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,819
Good job today, Doctor Oh.

1317
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,780
You did well overall,

1318
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,367
but you need to brush up a bit more on
what constitutes dystocia and when to

1319
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,326
decide on a C-section.

1320
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,371
Feel free to come to me
anytime with questions.

1321
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,545
Oh, hello, Mister Jang.

1322
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,047
Yeah, we got the shot!

1323
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,258
Thrill, great scenes,
inspirational quotes, we've got it all.

1324
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,885
Gosh, this is gonna be a hit.

1325
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,977
R2 MEDICAL OFFICE
OBGYN

1326
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,449
Who is it?

1327
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,868
It's R-one Kim Sa-bi.

1328
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,171
I'm sorry.

1329
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,842
It was totally my fault.

1330
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,509
I…

1331
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,760
made a big mistake.

1332
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,221
Let's leave it.

1333
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,682
Nothing to do about it now,

1334
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,267
is there?

1335
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,064
If you're gonna ignore me,

1336
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,566
and do what you want anyway,

1337
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,608
why would you

1338
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,901
even bother calling,

1339
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:27,819
hm?

1340
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,654
In the future, just handle it,

1341
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,989
since you're so clever.

1342
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:32,782
I'm sorry, doctor.

1343
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,244
It's entirely on me.
I don't know what else to say.

1344
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,375
Instead of apologizing with just words,

1345
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,713
I've been thinking about what
I should do going forward.

1346
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,259
In the future,

1347
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,928
I'll never act rashly based
on my own judgment alone.

1348
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,182
But with that goal,

1349
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,850
I'll keep asking questions

1350
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,852
until my every curiosity is satisfied

1351
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,481
and all skepticism is put to rest.

1352
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,649
Until everything's clear

1353
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,401
and I have no further questions to ask--

1354
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,402
Don't do that.

1355
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,195
Huh?

1356
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,946
I said don't do that.

1357
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,909
Stop asking me so many questions!
I don't know all the answers, okay?

1358
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,913
I'm just as ignorant about
this stuff as you guys are!

1359
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,372
How can an R-two

1360
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,751
tell an R-one she doesn't know?
It's so embarrassing!

1361
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,087
Ugh, so embarrassing, jeez…

1362
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,006
Oh.

1363
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,971
Not knowing isn't something
to be ashamed of.

1364
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:38,973
What?

1365
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,391
Oh, I'm sorry.

1366
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,603
Ugh, Kim Sa-bi, seriously.

1367
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,897
But listen, Doctor,

1368
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,524
uh,

1369
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,234
I've read that one.

1370
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,152
So I don't have any questions about it.

1371
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,320
But if you'd like…

1372
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,613
you can ask me.

1373
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:57,909
Yeah… good for you.

1374
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,327
Kay?

1375
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,703
Good for you.

1376
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,705
I'm sorry, doctor.

1377
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,583
Don't smile.

1378
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,294
I'm still angry with you!

1379
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:10,797
Hello?

1380
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,298
Don't you smirk!

1381
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,050
I said I'm still mad at you!

1382
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,687
Ta-da.

1383
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,732
That's exactly what I need right now.
How did you know?

1384
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,568
Because we're a team.

1385
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,118
Ugh, I told him to finish the dressings.

1386
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,953
He tried to, but…

1387
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,788
he can't help that his hands are slow.

1388
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,540
I can do them once I finish this.

1389
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,583
Ugh, jeez.

1390
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,167
Hey,

1391
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,627
you were like that too.

1392
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,628
You don't remember?

1393
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,379
Doctor,

1394
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,047
how can you smile now?

1395
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,424
Well, what? Should I cry 'cause he didn't

1396
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,300
finish the dressings?

1397
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,517
I'll take care of Room ten eleven.

1398
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,352
Hey, don't worry about it. Just go.

1399
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,688
-Why don't you go?
-Come on, I can do it.

1400
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,647
I can take care of it.

1401
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,732
I'm doing it, okay?

1402
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,265
Ugh,

1403
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,518
this will take awhile to fill out.

1404
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,107
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
NAME: OH YI-YOUNG

1405
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,110
I, Oh Yi-young,

1406
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,697
can no longer endure the tyranny
of Doctor Myeong Eun-won,

1407
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,908
The resulting pain and anger have
become impossible to bear.

1408
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,077
I hereby tender my resignation.

1409
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,624
PRINT

1410
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,180
Hey!

1411
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,603
Here.

1412
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,565
I don't give this to just anyone.

1413
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,649
It's non-alcoholic.

1414
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,537
Doctor Myeong?

1415
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,457
Why's she only like this with me?

1416
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,751
You had a run-in with her in March.

1417
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,835
Was there…

1418
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:36,878
anything after that?

1419
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,005
One time, I talked back.

1420
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,673
No, I confronted her.

1421
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,593
Anyway,

1422
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,636
our personalities clash.

1423
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,846
She's weird.

1424
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,055
Seriously.

1425
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,307
She has no shame.

1426
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,518
Wow, it was like watching
some kind of melodrama.

1427
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,855
I was saying the patient needed surgery,
but she was going on about natural birth,

1428
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,898
and then she shouts,

1429
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,025
What are you doing? Take her to the OR!

1430
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,987
She gave me the stink eye, like--

1431
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,280
But then, in front of the camera,

1432
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,323
she's all fake nice.

1433
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,034
You can ask me any questions.

1434
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:10,828
Jeez

1435
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,456
wow, I'm so honored you're
finally helping me!

1436
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,208
Pretty sure this is non-alcoholic.

1437
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,001
I can't do this.

1438
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,252
I can't take it anymore.

1439
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,631
Are you really gonna quit?

1440
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,342
Yeah. I don't want another accident.

1441
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,344
-Not again.
-Accident?

1442
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,221
Hey,

1443
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,764
are those rumors real?

1444
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,098
In the clinic.

1445
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,187
Wow, you…

1446
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,064
You're really…

1447
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,857
you're really quite something.

1448
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,903
No but seriously,

1449
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,072
everything you've endured as an R-one,

1450
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,406
you want it to be for nothing?

1451
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,866
I'm never doing this again.

1452
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,368
It makes no difference.

1453
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:51,327
Really?

1454
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,330
You know what does make a difference…

1455
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,043
The year-end bonus.

1456
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,545
In December.

1457
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,464
Aw… with only two months to go,

1458
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,550
that'd be too bad.

1459
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,467
Hmm.

1460
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:09,887
How much is it?

1461
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:11,722
Quite a lot.

1462
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:15,643
Ugh.

1463
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,855
Why would they pay out
the bonus in December?

1464
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,398
Ugh,

1465
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:21,983
this is so annoying, ugh…

1466
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,319
KU DO-WON

1467
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,534
Yes, Doctor?

1468
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,078
I'm sorry, but…

1469
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,540
could I take a rain check
for tonight's dinner?

1470
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,958
Why? What for?

1471
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,168
I'm sorry, but…

1472
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:42,795
something's come up.

1473
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:47,675
Yeah, all right.

1474
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:49,844
Later.

1475
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,805
What was that?

1476
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,432
Absolutely nothing's going my way.

1477
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,684
I did warn you.

1478
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,228
A turbulent week.

1479
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,607
I told you this was spot on.

1480
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:14,827
Hey Namkyung,

1481
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,204
can you stop telling me my horoscope?

1482
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,289
Me too.

1483
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,624
I'd rather not get a warning.

1484
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,917
It's not like I can do anything.

1485
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,084
Hey!

1486
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,711
We can't go on like this.

1487
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,754
Let's undo the jinx.

1488
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,047
I took a look at today's horoscope.

1489
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,715
-Don't tell us
-Wait, what?

1490
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:28,299
What about it?

1491
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:29,550
Kim Sa-bi,

1492
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,427
her lucky number is twelve.

1493
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,720
Oh Yi-young,

1494
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,679
her lucky drink is beer.

1495
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,056
Nam-kyung's lucky place is

1496
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,807
-Karaoke.
-Eh?

1497
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:37,308
You read it?

1498
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:38,476
Mm.

1499
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:39,936
But listen to this.

1500
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,479
What's today's date?

1501
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,439
It's the twelfth. And tonight,

1502
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,607
none of us are on call.

1503
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,983
Which means we can have beer.

1504
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,944
And once you've had a beer,

1505
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,612
you go to karaoke.

1506
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:50,363
I think

1507
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,365
you just retrofitted this whole
thing 'cause you wanna party.

1508
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,199
No, no,

1509
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,910
our horoscopes are instructing
us to party!

1510
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,286
Hey, let's go.

1511
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,204
No?

1512
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,081
Come on, let's have some fun!

1513
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,290
Ugh,

1514
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,042
she wouldn't go, would she?

1515
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:05,670
I can't.

1516
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,129
Huh?

1517
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:08,422
What's wrong?

1518
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:09,966
Today was…

1519
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,595
Never mind. I'll go.

1520
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,138
You're serious, right?

1521
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:17,974
In that case,

1522
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,100
I have raw eggs.

1523
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,310
You carry raw eggs around with you?

1524
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,062
I'm always ready for karaoke.

1525
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,063
Got anything else?

1526
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,982
Anything other than raw eggs?

1527
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:29,527
Ta-da!

1528
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,612
Here, take one each.

1529
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,115
You're awesome, Um Jae-il.

1530
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,242
The things inside your bag…

1531
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,119
I knew this day would come at some point.

1532
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,286
All right,

1533
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,621
bottoms up!

1534
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,456
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

1535
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,256
Hey, let's get out of here.
We can't waste a second.

1536
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:55,177
We should've at least stayed friends

1537
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,972
Forgetting everything

1538
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,185
Hey, you're not gonna sing?
We have three minutes left!

1539
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,855
No thanks, I'm not in the mood.

1540
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:10,359
-I just stared at you
-You're not singing either?

1541
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,820
-For a long time
-You are?

1542
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:16,449
-And the girl you were with too
-Then I'm gonna go, okay?

1543
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,367
She could've waited it out…

1544
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,163
So I could look at you
even for a moment longer

1545
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,457
If I ever see you…

1546
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:26,876
Come on!

1547
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,212
-This is the climax of the song!
-Oh, no…

1548
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:30,796
I'm sorry.

1549
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,548
You did that on purpose.

1550
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:33,799
You're in a karaoke room with me.

1551
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,092
We gotta do this one.

1552
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,107
I can't let you go like this

1553
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,403
Cause nothing can pull us apart

1554
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,407
Now, I know I'm a bad boy
and I know you're a good girl

1555
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,118
I'm so blinded by love that
I've become a bumbling fool

1556
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,370
-So this is why he's here.
-Oh, is this his song?

1557
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,372
I hurt you so many times
and I made you cry often

1558
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,124
The uh, Hi-Boyz.

1559
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,003
There are things outside my control
in my love for you

1560
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:18,844
The two of us in our youth
memories of my clumsy first love

1561
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:25,518
I hope this song
can take us back to those days

1562
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,733
Ooh.

1563
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,069
Um Jae-il!

1564
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,363
This is awesome!

1565
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,575
Ah!

1566
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,079
He sure is different.

1567
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:50,876
He's actually good.

1568
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,342
-Wow! Amazing!
-That was so good!

1569
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,015
You recorded it?

1570
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,019
-Ooh, idol.
-Hey, Sa-bi, like this?

1571
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:50,686
Huh?

1572
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,021
Is this how it goes?

1573
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,647
-Ooh…
-Kim Sa-bi.

1574
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:55,649
-Kim Sa-bi!
-Knock it off.

1575
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,652
-Wow, so you're a long-time fan.
-Whatever.

1576
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,323
-Hey, Sa-bi, how do I look?
-Oh, it's here

1577
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,282
Oh, hey, my cab's here.

1578
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:04,700
Hey, bye, guys.

1579
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,911
I want an encore, okay? See ya.

1580
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:07,995
Once was enough.

1581
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:09,997
See you tomorrow.

1582
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,548
Why is it

1583
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,674
taking so long?

1584
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,220
Where's yours?

1585
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,263
I haven't called mine yet.

1586
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,140
I'll go once I've seen you off.

1587
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,058
Oh.

1588
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,357
Hey.

1589
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,234
You wanna do it?

1590
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,443
What?

1591
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,278
Hi,

1592
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,781
-Hello Girl.
-Sheesh…

1593
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:45,824
Hey,

1594
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,993
why didn't you say anything?

1595
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:49,245
How…

1596
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,705
did you keep it a secret at work?

1597
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,753
In the interest of setting
the record straight,

1598
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,505
I am a Hello Girl.

1599
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,341
But you're not my fave.

1600
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:03,592
Huh?

1601
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,469
My favorite member

1602
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,221
is Top Key, not you.

1603
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:08,347
That's a lie.

1604
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,350
And the date you guys first chart-topped
was June ninth, not June second.

1605
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,560
You were nominated on the second.

1606
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:17,022
That Hello Girl back at the hospital
must've gotten her dates wrong.

1607
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,482
I just wanna be accurate.

1608
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:19,942
Oh.

1609
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:21,485
Okay.

1610
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,448
I'm off.

1611
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,242
Good night.

1612
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,538
I thought you were busy.

1613
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:16,874
Yeah, well.

1614
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,462
Did you lie to get out of
having dinner with me?

1615
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:25,758
-Why would I lie about that?
-Then why'd you cancel, and On the day of?

1616
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,055
I'm sorry.

1617
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,271
I was looking forward to it…

1618
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,690
I wanted to have dinner with my crush.

1619
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,950
I'm gonna head in now.

1620
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,169
Actually, the reservation was canceled.

1621
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,213
I bought flowers too…

1622
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,383
ugh,

1623
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:08,967
they got ruined.

1624
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,179
I even wrote a card.

1625
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,688
I left it back there.

1626
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,815
I really did.

1627
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,695
So the only thing I have left is this.

1628
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:34,618
Uh…

1629
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:39,873
Oh Yi-young,

1630
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,463
I like you.

1631
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,551
Really?

1632
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:52,803
You like me?

1633
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,348
Is this a love confession?

1634
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:58,642
Yes.

1635
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,402
Oh…

1636
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,573
I also…

1637
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,994
I've told you many times how I feel

1638
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,370
so I don't need to say it.

1639
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,333
So uh…

1640
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:28,755
Then

1641
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,090
what now? Huh?

1642
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:33,719
Then…

1643
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:41,727
We…

1644
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,505
Oh.

1645
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,550
I'm not gonna tell Joo-young
anything for now.

1646
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,052
I'll wait till we find out if the IVF

1647
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:58,971
is a success or not.

1648
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:00,973
You decide what we do.

1649
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:02,724
I'll follow your lead.

1650
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,502
Oh,

1651
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:31,920
that's right.

1652
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,172
Right…

1653
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,550
They're not at home.

1654
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,845
They're on their trip.

1655
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,638
For three days right?

1656
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:43,765
Ah…

1657
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,644
I need to go back to the hospital.

1658
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,146
Did I not tell you?

1659
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:50,814
No.

1660
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:52,399
Uh…

1661
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:53,984
I have work…

1662
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,861
Oh, I mean,

1663
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:56,945
I got papers to read.

1664
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,822
-Huh?
-Huh?

1665
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,157
What?

1666
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:03,285
Oh, it completely slipped my mind.
I'll stay at the hospital tonight.

1667
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:05,829
Is this because um…

1668
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,581
you don't wanna be alone together?

1669
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,835
We've been alone together this whole time,
though.

1670
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,298
I guess…

1671
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,467
it's different in there.

1672
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,603
But out here is cool?

1673
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:51,875
Come on.

1674
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,252
I'll go with you to the first floor.

1675
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,324
They said the trailer for
Wee-Oo-Wee-Oo was out.

1676
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,076
Gosh…

1677
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,787
what am I gonna do if my fans
see this and storm the hospital?

1678
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:29,788
Don't worry,

1679
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,039
there aren't very many.

1680
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,999
-You're one of 'em.
-I told you I'm not.

1681
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:35,794
Hey,

1682
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,546
who do you think's the star?

1683
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:39,756
Could it be Oh Yi-young?

1684
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:41,925
Oh Yi-young,

1685
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:43,552
you were in the delivery room
with the filming crew.

1686
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,137
And you were pushing for surgery.

1687
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,805
Whatever, this is embarrassing.

1688
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:48,807
Oh, here it is.

1689
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,434
-Wee-Oo-Wee-Oo trailer.
-Oh

1690
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,101
yeah.

1691
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,813
A whole new kind of mini
docuseries. Jang Young-seok's

1692
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,440
-Wee-Oo-Wee-Oo:
-Please be careful.

1693
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,526
A place where you can never
let your guard down.

1694
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,070
Harder, one last push. Keep pushing!

1695
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,781
Were you waiting until the fetal
monitor showed signs of distress?

1696
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,324
Where's your sense of judgement?

1697
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,327
A split second can be the difference
between life and death,

1698
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,038
and in those split seconds:
miracles happen.

1699
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,833
It's a place where
you'll meet remarkable people.

1700
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,126
Don't worry about anything.

1701
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:17,919
Come to me any time with questions.

1702
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,380
How could I possibly turn a blind eye

1703
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,841
to a mom whose water had just broken?

1704
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,217
Although, I admit,

1705
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:25,844
she did get very lucky.

1706
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:29,181
Experience it all on Jang
Young-seok's Wee-Oo-Wee-Oo.

1707
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,229
Myeong Eun-won, again?

1708
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,857
How? How is she so lucky?

1709
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,525
It's so unfair!

1710
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,319
Hey, to be fair,

1711
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,987
none of this is really her fault.

1712
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,405
That damn producer.

1713
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,450
I'm never watching his crap again.

1714
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,665
Hey, hey, did you see Oh Yi-young's face?

1715
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,876
-Where was it?
-What was the time stamp?

1716
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:58,835
Seventeen seconds.

1717
01:19:58,919 --> 01:19:59,753
Seventeen?

1718
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:03,799
Heading out?

1719
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,177
You saw it?

1720
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,261
Saw what?

1721
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,222
What?

1722
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:11,681
Sorry?

1723
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,308
So you did see it then.

1724
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,030
Ouch.

1725
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,491
Hey.

1726
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,118
Excuse me, you oughta be more careful.

1727
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:35,914
Please go on.

1728
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,339
Ugh!

1729
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:24,421
THANK YOU TO THE LEGENDARY COMEDY DUO
NA YOUNG-SEOK AND SHIN WON-HO

1730
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:25,964
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCES

1731
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,133
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1732
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,469
-Don't you think those two are acting weird
-How so?

1733
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,013
It's a savage rivalry.

1734
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:35,140
You've told Professor Kong her surgery's
been pushed back, right?

1735
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,017
If there's one open,
I should get to use it.

1736
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,351
Why does she take everything?

1737
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,561
I'll book the room.

1738
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:40,437
I was just about

1739
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,146
to say the same thing.

1740
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:42,647
I'm gonna take it now.

1741
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,316
Is she trying to assert her dominance?

1742
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,234
-It's Professor Seo's patient.
-Oh, be quiet.

1743
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,278
-And--
-Uh, here you go, Professor Kong…

1744
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,322
Why not do it during lunch,
when there are no appointments?

1745
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,741
How many times do I have to tell you:
I just found out?

1746
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:53,825
I'll do it right away.

1747
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,743
You had a fight?

1748
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:55,744
-No.
-No.

1749
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:56,995
They did.

1750
01:21:57,495 --> 01:22:00,790
-What are you saying? Why would we fight?
-Is this some kind of race to the bottom?

1751
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,125
Huh?

1752
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,419
What are you gonna do? Get married?

1753
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,503
-You are?
-Who is it?

1754
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,505
Someone from the hospital?

1755
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,132
Do you wanna keep this under wraps
or shout it from the roof?

1756
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:11,718
The R-ones don't know about it,
and I feel like I should

1757
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:12,761
break it to them first.

1758
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:13,386
Who was that?

1759
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:14,763
You're not…

1760
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,806
Hey, what are you doing?

1761
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,141
Tell me,

1762
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,685
do you come to work to save
people or to kill them?

1763
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,686
I'm sorry.

1764
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,896
If you wanna be alone,

1765
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,147
come here during the day,

1766
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,357
and go there at night.

1767
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,525
It's been so long that-- Oof…
