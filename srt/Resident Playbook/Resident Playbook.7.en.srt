RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,603
Are things going well in EM?

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,274
Were you with OS last rotation?

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,191
How was that?

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
It wasn't great there either.

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,653
The second-year residents are so scary.

7
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,489
So they're the problem in OS.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,367
In OB-GYN,
the first-years are the problem.

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,952
Why? What's wrong with them?

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,456
They're all

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,000
a bit unwell.

12
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,585
Breathe.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,296
<i>One has body temperature</i>
<i>that's way too low.</i>

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,173
<i>She has hypothermia for sure.</i>

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,716
Ma'am, please push.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,177
I think I'm going to die.

17
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,679
You're not there yet. Push.

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,892
<i>Then shouldn't they crank up</i>
<i>the heat in the labor room?</i>

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,060
Good.

20
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>- No way.</i>
- Push one more time.

21
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>There's another one with…</i>

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,772
Okay, ma'am!

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>- …a high fever.</i>
- Breathe in!

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,567
There you go! Very good!

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,986
One, two, three!

26
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,326
One more time!

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,870
One, two, three!

28
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,042
Ma'am, push!

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,254
<i>And there's one whose BP is way too high.</i>
<i>She has high blood pressure.</i>

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,756
One more time.

31
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,636
Good! That's awesome!

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,055
- That was so good!
<i>- And the last one…</i>

33
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,723
<i>Her vitals can't be measured.</i>

34
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>She can't be diagnosed.</i>

35
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,560
Doctor, it hurts so much.

36
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,813
Ma'am, breathe.

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,774
Ma'am, are you seeing white?

38
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,150
No.

39
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,653
Then we're not there yet.

40
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,279
Call me when you see white.

41
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>It's been confirmed she's not human.</i>

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,658
What on earth is she saying?

43
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,621
My next rotation
is OB-GYN next month. I'm screwed.

44
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,252
But in some ways, they seem okay.

45
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,004
What? You said they were all unwell.

46
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,798
The residents are weird,

47
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,758
but when you see babies being born,

48
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,218
it's really nice.

49
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,931
The mothers and patients are all nice.

50
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,349
It's hard work,

51
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,144
but it's nice.

52
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,315
- What in the world?
- You scared me.

53
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,611
The alarm went off
because you were saying nonsense.

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,155
My medication alarm.

55
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,407
I have high blood pressure too.
It's time for my meds.

56
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,869
Let's go.

57
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,786
All right.

58
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,711
They're interns, right?

59
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,754
Who else are they? Fellows?

60
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,923
Right.

61
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,843
Doesn't the intern Tak Gi-on

62
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,470
seem interested in OB-GYN?

63
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,723
You're already preparing
to recruit interns?

64
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,100
What do you mean "already"?
It's July. We're late.

65
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,562
Our current first-years
didn't turn out well at all.

66
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,481
If they're duds next year too,
we're all screwed.

67
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,942
You better get it together.

68
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
Right.

69
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,612
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,239
Let's go.

71
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,033
Yes, ma'am.

RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

73
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,298
EPISODE 7

74
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,312
I got chewed out by Prof. Seo
for not suturing well.

75
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,189
She said to watch you and practice.

76
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,191
- Nam-kyung.
- What?

77
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,192
You too, right?

78
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,860
No, I wasn't scolded.

79
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,071
It was just a bit of nagging.

80
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,744
You always pretended to slack off.

81
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,954
You must've practiced a lot.

82
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:06,996
I didn't.

83
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,123
For abdominal fascia sutures,

84
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,877
Prof. Kong says
to suture tightly to prevent hernias.

85
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,296
But Prof. Seo will yell at you
for suturing too tightly,

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,965
because it restricts blood flow.

87
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,092
But what's the difference?

88
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,510
She did it Prof. Seo's way.

89
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,303
Really?

90
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,221
You didn't know?

91
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,057
No. I just did whatever they'd tell me.

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,184
Is she a genius?

93
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,727
Genius, my foot.

94
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,938
They say if you're not smart,
you'll end up toiling.

95
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,441
While toiling away,
she probably just got lucky.

96
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
Yi-young is smart.

97
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,945
You said she was
the top student in high school.

98
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,154
I had the best grades.

99
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,948
She did the best on mock exams.

100
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,616
We were rivals for three years.

101
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,743
None of that matters.

102
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,745
Being the top student
in high school is useless.

103
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,914
I'm broke and hungry now.

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm a total bum.

105
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,378
You bought another bag?

106
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,796
This?

107
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,549
I took out a 12-month installment plan.

108
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,718
This was the last one
in the country in this color.

109
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,635
So what could I do?

110
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,304
I had to buy it.

111
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,221
Isn't it pretty?

112
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,139
Well…

113
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,890
it's not my taste.

114
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,809
It's like a bag for older women.

115
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,103
You don't know what's trendy.

116
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,605
Don't you know
what the "old-money look" is?

117
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,858
- Where would you even take that?
- Plenty of places.

118
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,067
To and from work.

119
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,402
The hospital. My home.

120
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,987
She has a lot to go to.

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,406
She has to go on dates
and see her boyfriend.

122
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,033
I told you several times we broke up.

123
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,076
You said it was just a fight.

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,077
I'm off.

125
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,247
We broke up! It's over!

126
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,791
Even if he calls again,
I won't ever pick up.

127
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,127
Even if he breaks down
and begs me to meet,

128
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,838
there's nothing I can do
since I won't ever see him.

129
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,506
This again?

130
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,426
Just tell me if it was a fight
or a breakup once you decide.

131
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,553
I told you it's been decided.

132
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,431
Geez, I said it's really over.

133
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,021
<i>Doctor, the ER patient's results</i>
<i>are ready.</i>

134
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,027
<i>Gi-dong, call me</i>
<i>when you're not mad anymore.</i>

135
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

136
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,074
It's the ER.

137
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,534
I'm off.

138
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,017
My phone!

139
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,366
That's what I said.

140
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,785
Hello.

141
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,828
Hey, it's…

142
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,956
Dr. Pyo Nam-kyung.

143
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,873
Where are you going?

144
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,751
The ER. I'm going to see
a patient with our intern.

145
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,086
The one on his GYN rotation…

146
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,005
Our intern…

147
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,800
Dr. Tak Gi-on. Right?

148
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,717
Yes.

149
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219
Go on.

150
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,720
Have a good day.

151
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,098
Oh, right.

152
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,768
I heard the interns on OB-GYN rotation

153
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,187
say that you're their favorite.

154
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,564
Me?

155
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,441
Especially that doctor…

156
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,152
You know.

157
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,446
Who? I don't know.

158
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,782
The intern who was with us in April.

159
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,663
They said you were so friendly
and such a kind teacher.

160
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,248
That's what I heard.

161
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,293
I didn't do much though.

162
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:44,130
That's great. I was worried
no one would apply to OB-GYN next year,

163
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,549
but we can just count on Dr. Pyo.

164
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,967
Me?

165
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,345
A lot of interns choose their departments
based on the senior residents.

166
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,934
And without junior residents,
the seniors suffer the most.

167
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,521
So try your best to persuade the interns.

168
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,150
Yes, ma'am. I will.

169
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,027
Good luck.

170
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,695
Thank you.

171
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,157
I'll get going.

172
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,998
I hope she can just bring Dr. Tak over.

173
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,418
But are you really sure
that intern's good though?

174
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,836
I told you he is.

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
He's perceptive and skilled.

176
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,007
<i>He's the perfect fit for OB-GYN.</i>

177
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,594
It's not cholangitis, so don't worry.

178
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,931
Judging from the cough I have,
it's just a cold.

179
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,643
I know the doctors here. Don't worry.

180
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,646
- May I come in?
- Yes.

181
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,897
The doctor's here.

182
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,815
I'll call you back. Bye.

183
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,069
Are you Ms. Lee Ik-sun?

184
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,362
Yes.

185
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,905
We're going to run an EKG.

186
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,822
Sorry?

187
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,326
I didn't do this last time.

188
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,702
Why am I doing it this time?

189
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,499
It seems metastasis is causing
your current symptoms.

190
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,793
There may be a heart issue,
so they want us to check.

191
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,336
Metastasis?

192
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,629
Yes.

193
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,714
Then, that means…

194
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,051
You're saying it's cancer?

195
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,724
Have your cough and chest tightness
been worse recently?

196
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,393
Yes, coughing…

197
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,728
I had a cough.

198
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,523
My chest did seem a little tight too.

199
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,193
And you've had major surgery before?

200
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,028
Yes, that's right.

201
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,322
I'm sure you had a hard time then as well.

202
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,452
Is it really bad?

203
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,831
Sorry, excuse me.

204
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,625
Hi. I'm not done yet.

205
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,755
I said don't worry.
I'll call you right after I'm done.

206
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:51,966
Okay, bye.

207
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,683
I'm finally off my meds now,
and I thought I was getting better.

208
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,270
But this is so unfair.

209
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,023
What's going on?

210
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,858
Hey, come on in.

211
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,320
What, are you really sick?

212
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,906
Is something wrong?

213
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,908
Well…

214
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,118
Are the results in?

215
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,787
Could I see the CT results?

216
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,080
Well…

217
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,707
Dr. Tak, what are you doing here?

218
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,625
Dr. Pyo.

219
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,960
I was going to do an EKG,

220
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,380
but the patient became bit startled.

221
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,761
Ms. Lee Ik-sun?

222
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,970
Yes.

223
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,267
Ms. Lee Ik-sun, age 89?

224
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,728
Eighty…

225
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,899
Which department are you with?

226
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,817
GS? GI?

227
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,611
OB-GYN.

228
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,324
I'm very sorry.

229
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,534
I think our intern has the wrong patient.

230
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm really sorry.

231
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,247
Isn't checking patient identity
the most basic thing?

232
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,626
It's a mistake you can't make
no matter how busy you are.

233
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,212
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

234
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,881
Goodbye.

235
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

236
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,263
Why did you do that? Geez, come on.

237
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,348
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,977
Captain Ahn.

239
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,314
Your juniors have become
way too undisciplined.

240
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,110
I apologize, Major.

241
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,028
I was so shocked. My nose is running.

242
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,572
I need a tissue.

243
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,661
Wait…

244
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,788
Are you going to do the dove thing?

245
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,543
I'm going to blow my nose, okay?
It's running.

246
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,877
I was so surprised.

247
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,505
Also, I've become old.

248
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,007
My fingers are too stiff
to do the dove now.

249
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,384
But you work out a lot.

250
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,301
I do.

251
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,054
That's why I'm hanging on like this.

252
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,347
Goodness.

253
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,932
What about you?

254
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,852
You look like you don't work out at all.

255
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,521
What's wrong with how I look?

256
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,441
I look totally fine.

257
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,317
I'm like Gen Z in mind and body.

258
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,654
That's so embarrassing. Fine.

259
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,324
Then I'll treat you
to dinner tonight as the elder.

260
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,160
What do you want, Gen Z? Pasta?

261
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,538
No. I saw a place on my way here.
Brick-oven pizza.

262
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,665
I need to eat rice.

263
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,417
Koreans need rice.

264
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,087
There's a great
beef bone soup place nearby.

265
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,005
We can go there.

266
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,341
Hey, what kind of Gen Z eats
beef bone soup? Have some pasta.

267
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,843
- Hey, Gen Z.
- Just a moment, ma'am.

268
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,762
Yes, I'll be right there.

269
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,765
Hey, Gen Z. Pasta.

270
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,685
Kids these days like beef bone soup.

271
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,564
How have you become so old already?

272
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,566
- Good luck with treatment. See you later.
- Okay.

273
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,322
Who wouldn't be scared
if you suddenly say it's metastasized?

274
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,700
You should have double-checked
before saying that.

275
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,497
Things got busy all of a sudden,
and I lost focus.

277
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,584
From now on,
always check the patient's name and age.

278
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,753
Ask for their identification too, okay?

279
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,130
Yes. I'm sorry.

280
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,965
For goodness' sake.

281
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,219
And thank you.

282
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,348
The other first-year resident
always gets mad.

283
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,683
They tell me to get lost.

284
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,019
Who would say that?

285
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,271
Dr. Oh.

286
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,150
But you explained what I did wrong

287
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,236
and how I should fix it.

288
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,863
It's so nice.

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,243
You can't just say anything
no matter how angry you are.

290
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,036
Gosh, I can't even speak casually.

291
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,123
Even if you're a junior,
I have to be respectful.

292
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,463
Yes, this is
Jongno Yulje Medical Center ER.

293
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,882
All beds are full right now.
Please try another hospital.

294
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,677
- We've been waiting forever.
- Sorry, we'll be with you soon.

295
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,387
When will that be?

296
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,055
I came to the ER for a consult.

297
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,723
Yes, I'll be right there.

298
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,520
Hello, I was called to look at a mass
on a CT for abdominal pain.

299
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,898
- Please go over there to E.
- Okay.

300
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,989
The CT shows a 3 cm ovarian cyst.

301
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,242
Yes, that was already there.

302
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,996
Abdominal pain isn't common
for something that small.

303
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,581
Just a moment.

304
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,793
- Does that hurt?
- No, not there.

305
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
You're sure the pain isn't down here?

306
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,425
If it's from the cyst,
it should hurt here.

307
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,137
Then how about here?

308
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,020
Doctor? Knock-knock.

309
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm busy right now.

310
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,940
Doctor, I looked at the patient.

311
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,484
The pain isn't where the cyst is.

312
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,862
She has upper abdominal pain
and indigestion.

313
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,364
So why did you call us?

314
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,617
Before, she said it hurt all over.

315
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,872
You see, not all abdominal pain
in women is related to OB-GYN.

316
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,458
We couldn't confirm cholecystitis
from the CT scan.

317
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,836
We thought it could've been
ovarian cyst torsion, so we called OB-GYN.

318
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,671
I also called Gastroenterology.

319
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,760
Well, torsion from a 3 cm cyst

320
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,844
is not very common.

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,596
I guess that's true.

322
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,681
But it doesn't hurt to check.

323
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,934
Last week,
we were called for an appendicitis.

324
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,645
That patient had a history
of ovarian surgery.

325
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,438
The week before that,
it was for gastritis.

326
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,607
She had severe menstrual cramps.

327
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,859
All she needed were painkillers,
but you still called.

328
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,153
You said to call you promptly last time.

329
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,405
Sorry?

330
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,241
Last week,
you scolded us for calling too late

331
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
with all the OB-GYN patients waiting.

332
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,704
The week before that,
you said we couldn't diagnose

333
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,122
since we had no OB-GYN knowledge.

334
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,667
You told us to call
instead of wasting time.

335
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,378
That's not what we meant.

336
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,298
It's just we've received
especially a lot of calls lately

337
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,842
when it's not OB-GYN-related.

338
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,177
Then should we not call you?

339
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,097
Really?

340
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,516
No.

341
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,600
See?

342
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,686
I'll call again if there's a patient.

343
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,396
Thanks.

344
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,529
Dr. Park Moo-kang from Pediatrics?
It's Kim Sa-bi from OB-GYN.

345
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,030
<i>It's about Ms. Yoo Hong-seon.</i>

346
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,740
Is the baby coming? Should I come now?

347
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,910
No. Progress is slow,
so I think the baby will come tomorrow.

348
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,911
Really?

349
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,038
So can I go eat then? Can I?

350
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,123
I'm really going to go.

351
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,958
I think that's for you to decide.

352
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,336
Tomorrow morning,
I'll call you again with an update.

353
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,421
Okay, bye.

354
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,019
Doctor, Ms. Yoo's baby is coming!

355
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,228
- Please come now!
<i>- What?</i>

356
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,105
<i>You said it wasn't coming today.</i>

357
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,524
The baby's coming now!
Its heart rate is falling. Hurry!

358
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,443
You said I could eat.

359
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,445
I'm coming.

360
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,575
Geez, OB!

361
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,051
You did so well.

362
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,137
DELIVERY ROOM

363
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,221
Very good.

364
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,934
Doctor, is the baby okay?
Is it breathing well?

365
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,396
Yes, you said the baby's heart rate
was falling, but it's perfectly fine.

366
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,564
Doctor,

367
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,525
if the baby's okay,
then why are you angry?

368
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,653
Isn't that a good thing?

369
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,821
Why is he mad?

370
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,448
No, I wasn't angry…

371
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,162
Yes, this is Dr. Park from Pediatrics.

372
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,042
Ms. Park Sol's baby in the NICU?
I'll be right there. I'm sorry.

373
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,046
I mean, how many times are you going
to call Anesthesiology today?

374
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,633
For local anesthesia,
we have to use a thick needle,

375
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,135
so you may feel some discomfort.

376
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Okay.

377
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,145
You've heard of "pain-free heaven," right?

378
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,855
You'll be there soon. Just hold on.

379
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,611
It won't hurt much
once the epidural goes in.

380
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,946
Please relax.

381
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,248
Still, isn't calling
every 30 minutes excessive?

382
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,251
Can't you do it all at once?
This my fifth time here today.

383
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,669
I'm sorry.

384
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,547
I'm serious. A liver transplant,
peritonitis, and cerebral hemorrhage.

385
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,298
Three surgeries
opened at the same time.

386
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,259
Each operating room is in chaos.

387
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,260
Us too.

388
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,140
The mothers screamed in the delivery room
that they were in pain every 30 minutes.

389
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,641
Their husbands complained.

390
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,268
It was total chaos.

391
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
That is OB's problem.

392
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,729
We're not some rapid-response unit.

393
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,649
Excuse me, Doctor!

394
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,653
Doctor!

395
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,280
Doctor!

396
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,741
The epidural from an hour ago didn't work.
She needs it again. Now!

397
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,287
Can you

398
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,458
keep the cancer a secret?

399
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,504
If my mother knows it's cancer,
she'll never have the surgery.

400
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,339
But now,

401
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,010
I think it would be better
for the treatment if she knew.

402
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,179
Well…

403
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,392
This year, both her friend and my aunt

404
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,563
passed away
after a tough battle with cancer.

405
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,648
After that,

406
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,234
she said even surgery
wouldn't help with cancer

407
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,946
and that she'd never spend time
suffering in a hospital.

408
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,115
This time,

409
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,994
I barely managed to bring her here
by telling her it was a cyst.

410
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,916
To do this surgery, this is the only way.

411
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,377
Afterwards, I'll take
full responsibility and tell her.

412
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,469
<i>The mung bean pancake lady</i>
<i>at Pyeongnam Market.</i>

413
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,386
<i>Sir?</i>

414
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,764
Just now… Don't you know?

415
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,891
She says money should be spent

416
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,269
on kids who have full lives ahead of them,
not old people like her.

417
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,105
So she donates
100 million won yearly to Pediatrics.

418
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,690
She was on <i>You Quiz on the Block</i> too.

419
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,694
So that's why the hospital director
came to say hello?

420
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,862
Yeah.

421
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,114
She does so many good things.

422
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,368
But… Wait.

423
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,956
Think of this
as a small thank you for that,

424
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,126
and let's be careful about what we say.

425
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,295
I know it's a bit of a hassle.

426
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,339
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,634
Is everyone getting off work?
How about dinner?

428
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,135
- I have plans.
- Sounds good, sir.

429
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,061
It's all right. Relax.
Don't worry about it.

430
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,521
Okay.

431
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,439
- Let's go.
- Okay.

432
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,359
Enjoy your dinner.

433
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,861
Thank you.

434
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,822
You too, Professor.

435
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,823
I will.

436
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,289
Fresh ribs.

437
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,875
Marinated ribs.

438
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,878
Whole pork belly!

439
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,965
Eat up.

440
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,384
It was a pain arranging a night
when you all were free.

441
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,052
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

442
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,935
Dr. Ku, you're close
with Dr. Park Jun-suk from EM, right?

443
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,936
Not particularly.

444
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,896
Can't you have a word with him?

445
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,649
EM's been stressing me out so much
that I might go bald.

446
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,443
I mean,

447
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,572
if a female patient's stomach hurts,
they call us without checking properly.

448
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,074
Why call OB-GYN for cholecystitis?

449
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,244
Maybe they needed you to check.

450
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,915
It's not that.
They're like, "We called you."

451
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,834
"Someone hurry and take this patient."

452
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,920
Geez. That's why people mock them
and say they're a call center.

453
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,505
Scold Pediatrics too.

454
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,341
Why would I do that?

455
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,011
They get mad if I call them
either too soon or too late.

456
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,846
They get really upset
over even tiny things.

457
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,724
Pediatrics is about as generous
as the size of their patients.

458
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,392
There's a lot who aren't like that.

459
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,643
There can't be a lot.

460
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,395
Their department barely has anyone.

461
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,065
Don't forget about Anesthesiology.

462
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,233
They stand near the patient's head
and act superior.

463
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,568
They're so arrogant.

464
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,695
They think they own the OR.

465
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,448
What about OB-GYN?

466
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,118
We always thoughtlessly
push our way into the OR.

467
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,579
We use babies as threats
to boss people around.

468
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,831
That's why everyone mocks us
as the "thugs of Yulje."

469
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,333
People don't like us either.

470
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,960
And they don't need anything from us.

471
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,296
If we fight, it only hurts us
since we always need help.

472
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,965
So try to get along, okay?

473
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,890
Tonight, let's just eat
and not talk about work.

474
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,767
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

475
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm so full.

476
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,151
Gosh, I'm stuffed!

477
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,530
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

478
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,697
See you tomorrow.

479
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,157
- Good night!
- See you tomorrow!

480
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,408
- Good night.
- Take care, sir.

481
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,957
- See you.
- Bye.

482
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,874
Bye.

483
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,635
Weren't you going back to work?

484
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,345
No, I'm going home.

485
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,681
But why did you go that way?

486
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,016
What?

487
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,354
I got lost and thought home was that way.

488
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,279
Were you worried
the others would get the wrong idea?

489
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,073
They'd just assume
we're going the same way.

490
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,243
They're not as nosy as you think.

491
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,580
You're the one who told me
to not say anything.

492
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,665
I did?

493
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,586
But why take this street
and not the main one?

494
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,462
This is the fastest way.

495
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,257
But it's so dark.

496
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,676
And empty.

497
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,345
It seems a bit dangerous to walk alone.

498
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,274
I mean, what if you
come across some weirdo?

499
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,779
I'll punch them in the face.

500
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,698
And smack them in the ear.

501
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,578
So you are a thug.

502
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,704
You really are.

503
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,006
Did you box during high school
or something?

504
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,549
What do you mean?

505
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,801
I heard you're a good puncher.

506
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,179
What are you talking about?

507
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,021
- Is it that good?
- Yeah.

508
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,607
This place has the best crabs.

509
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,067
I'll buy much more next time.

510
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,319
I went too late,
and they only had two left.

511
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,489
I need to replenish my stamina.

512
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,951
When I had the egg retrieval last time,
I realized how weak I was.

513
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,374
Getting the shots
while having a cold was really tough.

514
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:47,379
This time, I'll eat well,
get healthier, and then--

515
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,089
You said that was the last time.

516
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,674
You said you were done.

517
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,758
When did I say that?

518
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,303
I said I'd see how many embryos grow
and only do that much.

519
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,764
Having zero embryos
wasn't part of the plan.

520
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,848
It doesn't count.

521
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,350
But you cried so much.

522
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,061
I did? When? No, I didn't.

523
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,190
I think it'll go well this time.

524
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,192
I can feel it.

525
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,488
They're home already?

526
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,740
Clear the table!

527
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,367
The crab fiend's here. Oh, no!

528
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,248
- I'm home.
- Me too.

529
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,499
You came home together.

530
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,209
Yes, we had dinner together.

531
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,131
Not just us two.
With the other first-years too.

532
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,174
We didn't say anything.

533
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,385
We were curious
if you had something good without us.

534
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,428
We had barbecue.

535
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,679
I'll go wash up.

536
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,014
- Okay.
- All right.

537
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,649
Hey, Joo-young.

538
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,617
What is this?

539
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,661
What do you mean?

540
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,625
That's all you're eating?

541
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,543
What?

542
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,255
It's seaweed.

543
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,675
This is all I need to eat all of my rice.

544
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,136
You need to eat better.

545
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,930
Seung-won, can you wake me up tomorrow?

546
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,099
Okay, Yi-young. Good night.

547
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,352
What am I doing?

548
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
She didn't catch us.

549
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,427
How did you know about the crabs?

550
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,973
<i>Didn't you see the soy sauce drop</i>
<i>by the seaweed?</i>

551
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,394
It's lighter than brewed soy sauce
and more aromatic than soup soy sauce.

552
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,854
Then what else could it be?
It's marinated raw crabs.

553
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,777
My brother bought it for your sister.

554
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,987
It's from her favorite place.

555
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,115
He must've stood in line for it.

556
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,535
That's why I'm only eating the legs.

557
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,163
Is it even worth eating that?

558
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,249
I was full anyway. Just a taste…

559
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm just having a taste.

560
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,386
Why are you up though?

561
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,013
I had some papers to read.

562
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,308
Why are you reading
so many of those boring things?

563
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,352
You stayed up reading
the last two nights too.

564
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,146
I napped in the resident's lounge.

565
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,735
I bet there's nothing in there.

566
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,156
Stop eating. I'll buy you some next time.

567
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,243
Really?

568
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,165
Just me without Joo-young?

569
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,584
Okay.

570
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,880
When?

571
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,715
How about this Friday?

572
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,800
Okay.

573
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,010
Nice.

574
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:22,927
No, I can't.

575
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,096
Why not?

576
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,390
I have somewhere to go. I forgot.

577
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,808
Damn it.

578
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,620
You go on leave tomorrow. Right, Dr. Ku?

579
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,038
Was it for three days?

580
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,080
Yes, Professor.

581
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,749
You should've taken more days off.

582
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,375
You've been so busy this whole time.

583
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,669
And you must've had
a hard time with that paper.

584
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,754
Sorry? What do you mean?

585
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,422
I mean get some rest.

586
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,466
I'll make sure no one calls you.

587
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,593
Okay. Thank you.

588
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,184
Do-won, are you really off
starting tomorrow?

589
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,101
Yes, Professor.

590
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,647
Then, can you help me out
a lot today before you go?

591
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,648
Sure, Professor.

592
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,859
Then, could you review my paper,
the summer symposium presentation,

593
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,154
and Prof. Im's retirement ceremony plans?

594
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,076
I just can't trust the juniors with them.

595
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,661
Yes, of course.

596
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,665
And I have two surgeries today.

597
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,208
I'll be assisting you on both.

598
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,088
I swear I won't call you on your vacation.

599
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,422
- Thanks.
- Sure.

600
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,051
Is she telling you
to go on vacation or not?

601
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,236
I heard our chief resident's
going on holiday.

602
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,612
Yes, Professor.

603
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,656
Right. Are you busy today?

604
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,658
No, I'm not.

605
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,411
- No, right?
- No.

606
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,707
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

607
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,210
Did Prof. Jo scold you a lot
over the surgery records?

608
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,128
Yes.

609
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,548
My goodness. Look.

610
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,968
If it's benign, always add
the uterus weight in the surgery record.

611
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,178
And when making the diagram,

612
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,931
mark the direction the uterus
was removed in with an arrow.

613
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,981
And remind him one more time tonight
about tomorrow's first surgery.

614
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,150
There's a frozen section
for tomorrow's last surgery,

615
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,943
so remember to book with Pathology.

616
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,194
Okay, I will.

617
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,698
Are you coming in to assist tomorrow?

618
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,700
No, I won't be here tomorrow.
I'll be on leave.

619
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,368
Oh, right!

620
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,621
Where are you going?

621
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,373
Taiwan. I'm hopping on a plane.

622
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,460
What's wrong with this consent form?

623
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,836
Oh, that?

624
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,797
That's for the pancake lady.
We made the font larger.

625
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,175
The Pyeongnam Market
mung bean pancake lady?

626
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,470
The font on the form was too small.

627
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,221
It'd be hard for her to read.

628
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,060
Her son asked us to keep it a secret.

629
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,978
She doesn't know she has cancer.

630
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,273
I also checked to make sure
cancer wasn't mentioned.

631
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,945
I mean, I won't let it slip.

632
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,113
But I'm worried about the intern.

633
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,949
He's quite the troublemaker.

634
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,201
Dr. Tak Gi-on, right? How is he doing?

635
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,537
I'm teaching him well.

636
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,167
He really trusts and relies on me.

637
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,171
Dr. Pyo?

638
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,589
Yes?

639
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,133
I think you should come and look.

640
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,142
Just a moment.

641
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,102
Okay.

642
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,021
A moment, please?

643
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,948
Dr. Tak?

644
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,743
Are you drawing stars on her belly?
You can't tape her like that.

645
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:17,954
Sorry?

646
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,039
Then, how…

647
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,000
Put a long strip over the affected area

648
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,752
from top to bottom
to help the skin close better.

649
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,588
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,883
I was worried
water would get in while showering.

651
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,262
I mean, you're struggling to remove
the Hemovac and PICC,

652
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,847
so I'm doing them all for you.

653
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,684
That's more work for me.

654
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,437
You should at least figure out
how to tape on your own.

655
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,105
I'm sorry.

656
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,400
Could you do better next time?

657
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,195
Okay.

658
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,451
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

659
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,662
I'm afraid we'll need to reapply the tape.

660
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,372
Again?

661
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,541
Yes.

662
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,836
Be careful to not let
water in when showering.

663
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,755
On your next outpatient visit,

664
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,466
we'll check how they're healing
and redress them.

665
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,925
Okay.

666
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,011
Hello.

667
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,221
You said you're leaving
early tomorrow morning,

668
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,891
so we've prepared everything
for an early discharge.

669
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,808
Thank you.

670
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,937
But, Professor, is this okay?

671
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,107
I feel like
they might fall off right away.

672
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,318
Don't worry, ma'am. I taped them well.

673
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,238
Well, that male doctor
did it very thoroughly earlier.

674
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,658
But the retaping she did
doesn't feel as secure.

675
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,537
Then, let me take a look at it.

676
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,666
Yes, it's fine.

677
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,959
They've been taped well.

678
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,211
Really?

679
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,590
That's incredible.

680
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:59,305
I wonder how our male doctor did it
if it was better than this.

681
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,850
He did it so thoroughly
that even a drop of water wouldn't get in.

682
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,436
I don't know why she did it again.

683
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,522
No, it wasn't like that--

684
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,148
It's all right. Don't worry.

685
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,858
There's no need to be humble right now.

686
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,318
Sir?

687
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,695
Yeah.

688
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,448
Thank you.

689
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
I'm so curious.

690
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,833
Yi-young, what's up?

691
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,834
You scared me.

692
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
I'm withdrawing some cash. You?

693
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,797
I had a savings plan.

694
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,965
- Savings?
- Yeah.

695
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,424
It matured, so I'm closing it.

696
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,342
Matured?

697
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,303
Some people really do pull that off.

698
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,764
You could suddenly need a lot of cash.

699
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,599
You could move or go travel,

700
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,517
so we need to save.

701
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,645
I know that. I just can't do it.

702
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,355
You don't have a savings plan?

703
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,314
I've never tried.

704
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,608
Some people really do live recklessly.

705
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,820
But I do one thing similar to that.

706
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,113
What?

707
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,032
The lottery.

708
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,617
There's a prime spot near my house.

709
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,994
Eight winners came from there.

710
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,252
- We've got a patient.
- We've got a patient.

711
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,254
- Yes, Doctor.
- Yes.

712
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,172
I'll be right there.

713
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,756
- I'm on my way!
- No!

714
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,135
Ten centimeters to the left
and five to the right would do it.

715
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,761
Doctor?

716
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,055
This isn't a parking lot.

717
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,767
If you made a little space,
you could fit one more in here.

718
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,728
There's no one to care for it.

719
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,813
Shoving in a bassinet
won't solve anything.

720
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,941
We can't shove the baby back in,
so we have to push this in.

721
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,236
We're completely full right now.

722
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,155
Remember the three sets
of twins yesterday?

723
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,741
I remember. At two, five,
and one in the morning.

724
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,742
That's right.

725
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,577
That's three deliveries for OB.

726
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,996
For us, it's six more, okay?

727
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,625
It's not that we don't want to take it.
We just can't.

728
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,085
Goodness, are you hungry?

729
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,670
Wait just a second.

730
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,173
How precious.

731
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,091
We're short-staffed.

732
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,635
Don't you watch the news?

733
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,803
Pediatrics has no applicants
or first-year residents.

734
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,263
And people are slowly quitting.

735
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,308
So I've done three straight shifts.
I've been up for almost 36 hours.

736
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,186
I do feel for you about that.

737
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,522
But why do you always
share Pediatrics' stats with me?

738
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,984
It's to tell you no.

739
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,778
It's a no.

740
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,820
It's a no for me too.

741
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,865
Prof. Seo said
the mother can't be transferred.

742
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,661
Then are you going to feed the newborns
and rock them to sleep…

743
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,998
Are you going feed and put them to sleep?

744
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,334
Is it a yes if I do?

745
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,295
If I feed them, can we add a bassinet?

746
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,213
Now look here.

747
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,009
Yes, this is Dr. Park from Pediatrics.

748
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,471
Hui-yul is throwing up?
I'll be right there.

749
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,307
I clearly said no, okay?

750
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,101
If you put a bassinet in, I swear…

751
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,659
Yi-young, I got a spot!

752
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,576
Okay.

753
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,626
- There are no rooms.
- Right.

754
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,378
I know, but we need one.

755
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,130
- It's an emergency.
- I'm sure it is.

756
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,341
If I give you one,
we have to delay all the other surgeries.

757
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,718
Thanks to OB-GYN last night,

758
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,178
other departments chewed us out
for their delayed surgeries.

759
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,847
Please, just this once.

760
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,390
There's an urgent C-section.

761
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,683
You saw when you came here.

762
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,977
There are no Anesthesiology staff
or rooms left.

763
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,562
The surgery is impossible.

764
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,150
So you're saying
we absolutely can't do it?

765
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,318
Yes.

766
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,987
Then I'll tell the mother
we can't do it due to Anesthesiology

767
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,072
and she needs to transfer hospitals.

768
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,033
What?

769
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,826
Are you threatening me right now?

770
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:54,248
Or should I tell her to hold the baby in
until Anesthesiology can give us a room?

771
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,460
You are so mean. You really are.

772
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,628
I can't afford to worry
about anyone else right now.

773
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,255
And no other hospitals can take her.

774
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,431
Hey, Sang-hyeon.

775
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,100
Can you push back the OS surgery?

776
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,270
Just beg them again.
Theirs isn't an emergency.

777
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,190
Yeah. Just one hour.

778
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,942
Who do you think? OB-GYN.

779
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,031
Thank you!

780
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,497
Professor, I got an OR.

781
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
I'll bring her down.

782
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,630
Doctor, I got a call
about a pregnant patient.

783
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,673
- She's over there. I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

784
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,969
- Call Neurosurgery.
- Okay.

785
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,763
I'll disinfect your wound.

786
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,764
It might sting.

787
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,769
Her fever's high.

788
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,357
Doctor, are the CBC and CRP results in?

789
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,986
We didn't run the tests yet.

790
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,780
How about the UA?

791
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,366
We were going to do that,

792
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,285
but she couldn't produce
any urine, so not yet.

793
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,541
So you called me
even though you didn't run any tests?

794
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,171
I'm sorry, Dr. Um.

795
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,257
But could we run the tests

796
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,217
after transferring her
to the delivery room?

797
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,763
When we're busy,
other OB-GYN doctors would do that for us.

798
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,184
We have a lot of patients today.

799
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,353
All the beds are full. Look.

800
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,444
Our delivery room's the same.

801
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,405
The labor room's full too.

802
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,282
It's pure chaos.

803
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,950
I see.

804
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,787
But couldn't you take her just this once?

805
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,584
Could we?

806
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,676
I'm sorry, we're really busy too.

807
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,430
Please run the urinalysis
and blood tests for CBC, CRP, PCT,

808
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,891
electro, OPTP, BUN, and creatinine.

809
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,684
And if you do a sonogram too,

810
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,770
we'll make her transfer
swift and accurate.

811
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,272
Oh, right.

812
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,773
All right.

813
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,234
Give me a call
when the tests are complete.

814
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,361
Thank you.

815
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,034
He's a lot sharper now.

816
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,536
That was a fail.

817
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,622
He wasn't always like that.

818
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,459
- Nurse, could we run the blood work?
- Okay.

819
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,669
- It looks great!
- It looks great!

820
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,049
Let's eat.

821
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,261
- Let's dig in.
- Let's eat!

822
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,605
I had no energy to debone.
Thank God it's boneless.

823
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,359
A patient gave it to us for letting her
safely have her baby here.

824
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,028
Right!

825
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,988
You got to have chicken when celebrating.

826
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,658
But why are all of you so happy?

827
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,035
It's 11:30 p.m., and we're stuck here.

828
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,162
I really gave it to the EM team.

829
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,456
I destroyed them with cold, hard facts.

830
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,457
Hey, good job.

831
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,085
They think we're fools
because we hold back.

832
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,294
Exactly.

833
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,671
Being nice gets you nothing.

834
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,714
You'll just go mad. No!

835
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,425
Don't put up with it! Watch out!

836
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,012
Right, being patient three times
is too much.

837
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:37,930
No more.

838
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,807
What is this?

839
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,976
Why are you three
suddenly on the same page?

840
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,145
Are you all now,
"United we stand! Together as one!"

841
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,272
And things like that?

842
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,315
Are you?

843
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,568
Hey, guys.

844
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,736
Check your patients' operability.

845
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,447
And Ms. Ahn Ho-jin in MFICU
will likely deliver soon,

846
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,241
so watch for labor signs.

847
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,867
- Okay.
- Okay.

848
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,035
You're still here though?

849
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,537
Isn't your flight tomorrow morning?

850
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,374
I'm just about to grab my things
and leave. Bye.

851
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,797
Don't call me and ask, "Where are you?"

852
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,841
"I'm sorry. Could I ask a question?"

853
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,009
Especially you, Jae-il.

854
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,510
Don't. I won't stand for it.

855
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,763
Come on. You're gone for three days,
not three months.

856
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,265
Who do you think I am?

857
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,726
We can do things on our own now too.

858
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,311
Don't you worry.

859
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,520
Have fun.

860
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,355
A small gift will suffice.

861
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,276
Okay, see you next week.

862
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,611
- Safe travels!
- Bye!

863
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,825
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

864
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,079
Anytime we ask something,
they say to ask the chief resident.

865
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,664
It was my mistake,

866
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,668
but they blamed the chief for not checking
and said to bring him.

867
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,422
How many times can we say
Ku Do-won's not here?

868
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,216
What's shocking is

869
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,595
he hasn't even been gone for a day.

870
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,522
Everyone's looking for the chief resident.

871
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,774
But why is he looking for me?

872
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,733
Who?

873
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,817
The intern.

874
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,863
Leaving him alone makes me anxious,
but being next to him makes me angry.

875
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,452
Dr. Ku must have felt the same way.

876
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,041
I should go before he screws up. Bye.

877
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:35,506
OB-GYN 4TH-YEAR RESIDENT LOUNGE

878
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,850
This is different from that one.

879
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,311
It's a consent form
for epidural anesthesia.

880
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,647
It'll let us use medicine
so you won't feel pain.

881
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,981
That's what it's about.

882
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,400
If you look here…

883
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,778
I'm just removing a small cyst.
Is it that painful?

884
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,574
It's different for everyone.

885
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,536
But given your age,
it may be more painful.

886
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,704
So we'd like to prepare this in advance.

887
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,416
How long does it take to remove the cyst?

888
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,962
Including the prep and anesthesia,
about an hour and a half.

889
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,424
That's longer than I thought.

890
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,593
Yes, cancer surgeries
usually take a while.

891
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,596
But compared to other cancer surgeries,
it's pretty short.

892
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,515
Really?

893
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,478
Cancer surgery?

894
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,188
Yes.

895
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,274
Who has cancer?

896
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,234
Me?

897
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,783
If it's cancer surgery,
you're saying I have cancer?

898
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,785
Not a cyst but cancer?

899
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,707
Yes, it's…

900
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,917
It's cancer.

901
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,049
So,

902
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,304
you had all known
from the beginning except for me?

903
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,680
That I had cancer?

904
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,975
How can a hospital
lie to its own patient?

905
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,685
I asked them to.

906
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,980
Because I knew you'd refuse surgery.

907
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,485
You should have the surgery.

908
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,489
The imaging suggests
it's at a very early stage,

909
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,867
and the prognosis appears to be good.

910
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,203
And a laparoscopic surgery

911
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,330
doesn't leave much of a scar.

912
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,332
So recovery will be quick too.

913
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,293
They told my sister she'd live too.

914
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,963
But she ended up suffering
in the hospital and died.

915
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,134
Gosh, I don't want
to waste time like that.

916
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,679
I guess they're saying I'm old now,
and it's my time to go.

917
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,349
So it's okay to die just for being old?

918
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,476
Says who?

919
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,728
The law? Does it say that in books?

920
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,189
Let's have the surgery, Mom.

921
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,027
Let's make more pancakes
to let more children get surgery.

922
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,572
It's not for you but for the children.

923
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,409
You don't want that either? No?

924
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,662
Mom.

925
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,664
Your son is right.

926
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,624
Please have the surgery, ma'am.

927
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,334
Please.

928
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,336
It's all my fault.

929
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,047
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please.

930
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,932
I never wanted surgery.

931
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,518
And I'm upset you all lied to me,

932
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,728
so I was going to leave.

933
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,489
But I'll think it over for this doctor.

934
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,578
Because I'm grateful.

935
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,372
But it was really nothing--

936
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,332
For being honest with me.

937
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,627
If it weren't for you,

938
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,381
I would've never known about my illness
or what would happen to me

939
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,216
before being dragged into surgery.

940
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,553
What kind of fool would I have become?

941
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,558
Thank you for telling me.

942
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,353
You're the only one I can trust.

943
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,399
I'm an ignorant old woman,
so it must have been easy to fool me.

944
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,277
We apologize.

945
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,237
I'm sorry.

946
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,700
If I do go through with surgery,
will you be there?

947
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,166
Yes. I'll be there, ma'am.

948
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,132
- Okay, we'll see you for surgery.
- Yes.

949
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,133
But,

950
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,636
this surgical consent form…

951
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,679
Why is the font like that?

952
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,476
I enlarged the font for her
so it would be easier to read.

953
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,062
Has she read it?

954
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,980
My mother can't read.

955
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,023
Excuse me?

956
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,941
I think I told you before.

957
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,943
But you just gave it and left.

958
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:12,407
So my mother can just sign here, right?

959
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,870
That was a copy for your reference.

960
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:21,875
Before she signs, we'll make sure
to read it for her and explain everything.

961
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,252
I see. Thank you.

962
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,216
I eat it at home too.

963
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,218
- I see.
- Yes.

964
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,719
<i>Fortune favors those who are lucky.</i>

965
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,763
Everything just goes well for them.

966
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,098
Everything works out.

967
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,018
Their timing couldn't be more perfect.
You know?

968
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,355
Look.

969
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,524
When you're on call, you get no calls.

970
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,275
I had deliveries all night on my shift.

971
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,319
Just go home if you're going to whine.

972
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,197
If you're staying, take my shift.

973
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,575
Because of emergency surgeries,
two of Prof. Ryu's were delayed.

974
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,244
So I can't go!

975
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,372
What a pain for those who are unlucky.

976
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,040
You little…

977
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,174
THURSDAY, JULY 20

978
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,941
I'm going in for Ms. Jin's delivery.

979
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,193
Keep your eye on the ward and ER.

980
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,111
Yes, ma'am.

981
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,198
Hello, OB-GYN.

982
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,703
Yes, I'll be right there.

983
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,210
She's not our patient, but came here
with her amniotic sac ruptured.

984
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,133
Ma'am?

985
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,141
So, your water broke.

986
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,272
I don't speak English well

987
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,191
or understand Korean.

988
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,650
Am I okay?

989
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,985
What on earth is she saying?

990
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,655
Name? What's your name?

991
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,786
Margarita Kalashnikova.

992
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,454
- Margarita?
- Margarita.

993
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,622
Margarita?

994
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,045
Twins?

995
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,671
No, I only saw one.

996
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,381
She says it's twins.

997
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,051
It's her second baby.
She had a C-section for her first.

998
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,142
Thank you.

999
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,771
Professor, a patient needs you in the ER.

1000
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,315
She's not our patient, but it's an ROM.

1001
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,275
<i>The ultrasound shows</i>
<i>the baby is in breech.</i>

1002
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,986
<i>She's in active labor,</i>
<i>at Station 1.5, and effaced 50%.</i>

1003
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,072
<i>She'll need surgery,</i>
<i>so I'm calling in advance.</i>

1004
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,949
Yeah, I'm in delivery,
but I'll be done soon.

1005
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,494
Prep for surgery.
I'll finish up and be there soon.

1006
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,411
<i>Okay.</i>

1007
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,331
Wait.

1008
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,125
The bleeding is severe.

1009
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,888
Our intern is assisting this evening

1010
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,265
to keep his promise.

1011
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,474
It's all right.

1012
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,894
He's kind to his patients,
and he's a good worker too.

1013
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,438
There's nothing but praise for him.

1014
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,108
Everyone's talking about Dr. Tak.

1015
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,025
My gosh.

1016
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,444
- You remembered his name, Professor?
- What?

1017
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,115
Yes. I etched it into my heart.

1018
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,337
Receiving praise as an intern

1019
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,214
is not an easy thing to do.

1020
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,841
Right? Doctor…

1021
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,801
Sir?

1022
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,265
Yes, of course.

1023
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,391
Thank you.

1024
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,643
In any case,
I hope I'll be seeing more of you

1025
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,396
for a long time.

1026
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,398
- Fan, please?
- Sir?

1027
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,859
Fan.

1028
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,694
Okay.

1029
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,406
I don't usually sweat this much.

1030
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,450
But it's so hot today.

1031
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,287
Wait.

1032
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,456
Not there.

1033
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,540
The wound.

1034
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,375
I applied glue on this wound.

1035
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,836
Oh, here!

1036
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,837
Right!

1037
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,340
- Wait, I need a minute.
- Here.

1038
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:45,138
Hold on. Were you always this hilarious?

1039
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,557
Look at this.

1040
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,517
OB-GYN is a lot of fun, right?

1041
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,102
Yes, it's hilarious.

1042
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,273
This really is a happy place, isn't it?

1043
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,108
Yes, it is.

1044
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,030
What's wrong with me?

1045
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,531
Why is it so hot today?

1046
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,201
Even though it was hot, nice work.

1047
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,329
- Good night, sir.
- Thank you.

1048
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,834
Dr. Tak.

1049
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,171
Are you laughing?

1050
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,007
You think it's funny?

1051
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,682
Why isn't Anesthesiology picking up?

1052
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,228
Doctor, it's OB-GYN.

1053
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:35,355
A patient needs emergency surgery.

1054
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,272
Did she fast?

1055
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,691
Fast…

1056
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:45,365
My hospital said there were no problems.

1057
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,701
Let me check and call you back.

1058
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,119
Could you prep the OR first…

1059
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,123
HAM DONG-HO

1060
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,710
I lost my phone,

1061
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,461
so I couldn't call.

1062
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,963
Have you seen my phone?

1063
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,137
The translation app.

1064
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,141
Does your stomach hurt?

1065
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,523
Damn it.

1066
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,751
What on earth? Why is it…

1067
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,670
When are we moving her?

1068
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,755
Now.

1069
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,756
What?

1070
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,591
Right now, the baby's foot…

1071
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,010
The baby's foot is out right now!

1072
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,721
- Nurse!
- Yes?

1073
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,431
Is something wrong with the baby?

1074
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,308
I'm not giving birth now, right?

1075
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,024
The baby's foot is out.
We have to move her.

1076
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,485
Contact her guardian now
and get the patient's history.

1077
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,402
Okay.

1078
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,489
- I'll call Anesthesiology.
- Thank you!

1079
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,327
I need an OR now.

1080
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,579
Just get me one now. It's OB-GYN.

1081
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,456
- Professor, you have to get here.
- Yeah, now!

1082
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,832
The baby's foot is out!

1083
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,669
There are vaginal and rectal tears,
so I'm suturing now.

1084
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,421
I think I'll be a while.

1085
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,631
<i>What? Then, what do I do?</i>

1086
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,466
No one else can come?

1087
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,762
Get the on-call GYN professor.
Tell them I asked. Hurry.

1088
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,014
That's Professor Ryu.
They're in emergency surgery.

1089
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,265
What do we do?

1090
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,184
Then you get ready.

1091
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,936
I'll have GS switch with me and go.

1092
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,687
Get ready, and if it's urgent,

1093
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,398
administer general anesthesia
and open her up when she's under.

1094
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,316
<i>Okay.</i>

1095
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,776
What?

1096
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,528
<i>Open her up. I'll be right there.</i>

1097
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,780
Can you call the on-call GS doctor?

1098
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,408
Check if Gi-sun
or Dr. Myeong can come too.

1099
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,326
Yes, ma'am.

1100
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,703
- Do we have an OR?
- Yes.

1101
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,789
The caregivers and nurses helped clean up.

1102
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,249
We pushed back an appendectomy.

1103
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,333
Thank you, Doctor.

1104
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,751
Any underlying conditions?

1105
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,211
- Any medications?
- We don't know.

1106
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,879
- Did she fast?
- I don't know.

1107
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,214
What's her weight?

1108
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,342
- Do you know her name?
- It's so long. I'm sorry.

1109
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,015
Isn't that Dr. Oh from OB-GYN?

1110
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,392
I think so.

1111
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,436
It must be really urgent
if they're going that fast.

1112
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,648
What is it now?

1113
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,155
Let me know when you're ready.
The anesthesia's been prepared.

1114
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,956
Dr. Oh, don't cry.

1115
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,041
If you shed tears,
you have to prep all over again.

1116
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:42,959
You know, right?

1117
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,211
Yes.

1118
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,504
If you have to pull it out--

1119
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,755
I can't.

1120
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,424
I understand you're scared, but…

1121
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,176
When did the foot come out?

1122
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,094
It was ten minutes ago.

1123
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,013
Patient's name is Margarita Kalashnikova.

1124
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,639
She's at 37 weeks,

1125
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,184
and she visited our ER
early in the pregnancy,

1126
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,894
but nothing was abnormal then.

1127
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,020
Her husband's on his way.

1128
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,813
He verbally gave his consent.

1129
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,357
Thanks.

1130
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,817
Find someone who can come.

1131
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,946
It's okay. Your husband is coming.

1132
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,951
I think we'll have to open her up.

1133
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,578
I can't. I've never done it before.

1134
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,164
It'll be dangerous
if blood doesn't flow to that leg.

1135
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,917
We're still looking for who can come.

1136
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,210
I'll assist for now.

1137
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,796
If the baby goes under too,
I can wake it, so take your time.

1138
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,548
I'll take good care of the baby, okay?

1139
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,675
Yes. I'll watch the mother carefully too.

1140
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,843
Calm down.

1141
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,888
We're all here.

1142
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,977
When Dr. Oh makes the incision,
pull the stomach down a bit.

1143
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,562
Okay.

1144
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,525
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

1145
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,568
She's under.

1146
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,736
Her vitals are good.

1147
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,620
Make the cut deeper.

1148
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,961
Dr. Ku!

1149
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,481
Get it together.

1150
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,418
Dr. Ham?

1151
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,836
Her vitals are okay.

1152
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,254
And--

1153
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,839
I contacted the NICU. Don't worry.

1154
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,923
Okay, thank you.

1155
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,139
Pull.

1156
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,440
Yes.

1157
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,443
I'm at the OB-GYN on-call room.

1158
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,236
No one's here.

1159
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,574
Yes, let me know.

1160
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:02,992
Okay, bye.

1161
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,581
Oh, dear. It seems like no one's here.

1162
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,876
Goodness.

1163
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,170
What do we do, Obstetrics?

1164
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:20,551
What on earth?

1165
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,099
This isn't Taiwan.

1166
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,729
There goes my plane ticket.

1167
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,316
It's an OB-GYN doctor.

1168
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,987
The baby's coming.

1169
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,534
It's 8:46 p.m., and it's a boy.

1170
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,707
Take the baby now.

1171
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,502
Wrap the sensor around
and clean the baby.

1172
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,461
Okay.

1173
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,673
Okay, cry for us.

1174
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,967
Come on, baby. Cry.

1175
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,595
Heart rate's under 100. I'll start PPV.

1176
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,389
- Oxygen, please.
- Okay.

1177
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,558
Yi-young, are you okay?

1178
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:10,560
- Professor!
- Professor!

1179
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,103
Did you get the baby out okay?

1180
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,563
Yes.

1181
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,231
- Are the mother's vitals okay?
- Yes.

1182
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,816
Nice work. Go rest.

1183
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,942
Yes, Professor.

1184
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,944
Are you okay?

1185
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:20,987
Let's switch, Yi-young.

1186
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:21,904
Okay.

1187
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,450
The baby's out,
and uterine contractions are good.

1188
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,951
Good job.

1189
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,372
Heart rate?

1190
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,750
It's under 100.

1191
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,168
- Stimulate him more.
- Okay.

1192
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,919
Come on, baby. Cry.

1193
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,505
Please.

1194
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,794
Is the baby okay?

1195
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,921
Yes, Apgar is 8,
and the saturation is fine.

1196
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,464
His pulse is also above 100.

1197
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,549
We'll move him to the NICU.

1198
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,802
Good work. Thank you.

1199
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,304
You did great too.

1200
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,059
Yi-young!

1201
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,727
Nice work.

1202
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,145
Really nice.

1203
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,814
Thank you.

1204
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,607
The mother's vitals are good.

1205
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,234
Dong-ho, good work.

1206
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,527
Thank you.

1207
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,668
Dr. Oh's been contaminated.

1208
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,339
Since you've been contaminated,
why don't you two leave and get some rest?

1209
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,860
OB-GYN

1210
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,875
Hey, Gi-dong!

1211
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,629
What? You're where?

1212
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,554
Nam-kyung.

1213
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:57,935
Gi-dong.

1214
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,899
Hello, Professor.

1215
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,359
The patient you called about
is now in the ER.

1216
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,570
The CT shows EDH
on the right temporal lobe,

1217
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:08,946
and it's a lot.

1218
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,408
Mental status is stupor.
Left motor function is grade 3.

1219
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,118
I'll move them to the OR now.

1220
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:16,787
Okay, bye.

1221
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,417
Hello, Doctor.

1222
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,670
OB-GYN, right?

1223
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,089
Yes, I'm first-year OB-GYN, Pyo Nam-kyung.

1224
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,843
I wanted to ask you something
about a patient.

1225
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,094
Yes?

1226
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,388
It's the one who fell down the stairs.

1227
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:35,514
Ms. Jo Suk-hui?

1228
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,100
Yes, I'd like to know her test results.

1229
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,644
Just a moment.

1230
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:48,152
The CT didn't show
any cerebral hemorrhage or skull fracture.

1231
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,908
But it was a big fall,
so a week's rest is needed,

1232
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:56,619
and she should come back
if she notices anything abnormal.

1233
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,372
Okay. Thank you.

1234
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,415
She's not a GYN patient, is she?

1235
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,500
Sorry?

1236
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,752
I don't see that on her chart.

1237
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,964
No, she's not.

1238
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,549
She's my boyfriend's mother.

1239
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,926
I see.

1240
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,052
So her son is…

1241
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,095
Yes.

1242
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,556
Goodness. He seemed to be pretty shocked.

1243
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,142
Our resident did explain everything,

1244
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,812
but you should tell him again.

1245
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,563
I will. Thank you.

1246
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,115
Professor.

1247
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,199
Yes?

1248
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:37,493
Mr. Ku Pil-jong's
CT angiography results came back.

1249
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,078
It's an MCA aneurysm rupture.

1250
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,080
Arrange an OR and prep for clipping.

1251
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:41,998
Yes, sir.

1252
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,420
The CT showed no signs
of brain damage or bleeding.

1253
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,546
Her skull is fine too.

1254
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,548
So she wasn't hurt too bad?

1255
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,050
There's no problem with her brain, right?

1256
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,302
No. As of now, everything's fine.

1257
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,263
That's a relief.

1258
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,223
Thanks.

1259
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,183
Thank you so much, Nam-kyung.

1260
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,727
It could've been worse.

1261
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,312
You must have been so shocked.

1262
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:07,940
Yeah.

1263
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,781
Are you still mad at me?

1264
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,325
How could I be mad?

1265
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,661
It's over now.

1266
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,790
I'm sorry for ghosting you.

1267
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,126
I was afraid if I replied to your text,

1268
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,794
I'd end up calling you,

1269
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:32,131
and then we'd meet up again.

1270
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,967
Hey, why are you being like this
over just a fight?

1271
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,137
We broke up, Nam-kyung.

1272
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,556
I told you.

1273
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,311
The next time you asked to break up,
that really would be it.

1274
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,938
No, I just said that out of anger…

1275
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,653
You know,

1276
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,656
being someone

1277
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,077
you could threaten
to break up with out of anger

1278
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,121
made me really sad.

1279
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:06,874
But I endured it.

1280
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,419
Because that's how much I liked you.

1281
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,797
Gi-dong.

1282
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,467
When we were fighting

1283
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,012
and not contacting each other,
I knew you went on blind dates.

1284
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,681
I also knew you were embarrassed
to tell your friends

1285
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,266
that I was looking for work.

1286
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,852
But I just pretended not to know.

1287
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:31,107
Because I thought I wasn't good enough.

1288
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,443
But this time,

1289
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,613
when you asked to break up,

1290
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,574
it was the first time I didn't feel sad.

1291
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,909
I felt relieved.

1292
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,871
Because I could hate you
instead of myself.

1293
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,959
But even after that,

1294
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,504
I still called you.

1295
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,840
When my mother fell,

1296
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,675
my mind just went blank.

1297
01:08:58,759 --> 01:08:59,927
And I only thought of you.

1298
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,179
You're the only doctor I know.

1299
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,808
I know I shouldn't have called you.

1300
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:07,893
I'm sorry.

1301
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,065
I won't call again.

1302
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,069
Thanks for today.

1303
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:22,867
Hey, Hong Gi-dong.

1304
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:29,165
Call me. Just call.

1305
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,167
No.

1306
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,169
Call me.

1307
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,255
If you need to come to the hospital again,

1308
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,674
or if someone's sick or hurt,

1309
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,050
you can call me.

1310
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,678
Hey.

1311
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,972
We were together for seven years.

1312
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,018
Just because we broke up doesn't mean
you can't ask for a tiny favor.

1313
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,065
I won't ask to get back together again.

1314
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,734
I won't ask to be your friend either.

1315
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,405
So call me when you need to.

1316
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,748
You should go. Your mom must be waiting.

1317
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,252
Okay.

1318
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:16,962
I'll go on first then.

1319
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:18,839
Bye.

1320
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,658
What is it?

1321
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,664
Hey.

1322
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,417
Are you laughing?

1323
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,170
This is funny to you?

1324
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:43,507
I'm sorry.

1325
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,562
That was a close call.

1326
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,231
I've been in obstetrics forever.

1327
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,232
But emergency calls?

1328
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,152
I can never get used to them.

1329
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,529
How do you think we feel, Professor?

1330
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,865
Thanks, Do-won.

1331
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,826
You guys saved the baby.

1332
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:16,540
Is Dr. Oh okay?
Does she need medicine to calm her down?

1333
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,459
I'll check on her.

1334
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:19,960
Okay.

1335
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,588
But gosh,

1336
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,922
despite her attitude,

1337
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,799
she's good.

1338
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,218
And she's quick and fearless.

1339
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,720
You're right.

1340
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:32,181
Oh, right!

1341
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,602
Why are you here?

1342
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,063
You didn't oversleep
and miss your vacation too, did you?

1343
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,314
Someone else did that too?

1344
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:41,565
Me. Last year.

1345
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,111
Still,

1346
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,823
that breech C-section
you did last time helped, right?

1347
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,658
That wasn't me.

1348
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,079
It was my first time today.

1349
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,955
Really?

1350
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,919
Do-won, you've really grown!

1351
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,837
I wonder who trained you this well.

1352
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,215
Who? It wasn't me.

1353
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:07,966
- No…
- Did you do it all by yourself?

1354
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,094
I almost cried when we opened her up,

1355
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,137
but so many were watching,
so I barely held it in.

1356
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,390
You were calmer than I was.

1357
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,307
Gosh.

1358
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,268
I had no idea.

1359
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:23,440
Hi, Dr. Myeong.

1360
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,487
Just make a J-shaped incision
around the myoma.

1361
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,030
You don't need me for that.

1362
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,367
I have to go.

1363
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,077
I'm coming now.

1364
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:37,538
Bye, Professor.

1365
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,797
<i>Can you buy me a coffee?</i>

1366
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,137
Drink this.

1367
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,847
You seemed very startled earlier.

1368
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:44,897
Thank you.

1369
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,607
Good work today.

1370
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,485
Thank you for today.

1371
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,446
I really appreciated it.

1372
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,531
Sure.

1373
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:58,368
Okay.

1374
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,002
It's raining. Aren't you going in?

1375
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:11,131
No, I'm meeting someone.

1376
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,842
I see. Good night then.

1377
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,053
Sorry about that.

1378
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,264
- Take this.
- No, I'm fine.

1379
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,975
Take it. You can just give it back later.

1380
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:24,102
Thank you.

1381
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,484
And when you do…

1382
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,239
want to have dinner together?

1383
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,623
THANKS TO SUNG YU-BEEN
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE AS HONG GI-DONG

1384
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,204
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUESTS,
KIM JUN-HAN & KWAK SUN-YOUNG,

1385
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,706
OUR ETERNAL AHN CHI-HONG & LEE IK-SUN

1386
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:11,376
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1387
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,419
<i>It is tough.</i>

1388
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,963
<i>These days,</i>
<i>I'm smiling, but not on the inside.</i>

1389
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,508
<i>The one I like</i>
<i>much more than I appear to is…</i>

1390
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:19,509
Aren't you getting in?

1391
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,595
We still had things to talk about.

1392
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:24,723
Hey, I was curious about something.

1393
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,892
<i>Asking to have dinner means it's a date.</i>

1394
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,352
- With who?
- I think it's a guy.

1395
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,269
<i>He likes her.</i>

1396
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,772
- Welcome, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1397
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:32,856
<i>- Mom.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

1398
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,691
<i>Please don't talk about me, okay?</i>

1399
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:35,734
<i>Seriously, don't.</i>

1400
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,404
Wherever the dumplings went got a ton
of fun facts about Nam-kyung too.

1401
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,947
- Just eat one before you go.
- Mom!

1402
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,950
Couldn't the first-years come early?

1403
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,078
<i>We're lucky they show up at all.</i>

1404
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,373
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey, over here! Come here now!

1405
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,249
Hey, Sa-bi!

1406
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,292
<i>Is it bad?</i>

1407
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,503
It's not malignant, right?

1408
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:55,962
I…

1409
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,548
want to go back.
