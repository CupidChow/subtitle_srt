RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,025
FINAL EPISODE

3
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,319
We ordered the beer ages ago.

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,947
Why is it taking so long?

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,996
PUB BY THE HOSPITAL

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,623
I bought these for you guys.

7
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,625
Looks refreshing, right?

8
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,627
Why are you acting out of character?

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,545
I guess we're right.

10
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,047
All right. Let's drink these
and start talking.

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,341
Cheers. Bottoms up.

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,890
So?

13
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,849
For real?

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,017
You two are…

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,269
You see…

16
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,108
Here are your beers.

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,986
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,697
That was great timing.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,625
I live with
my sister's brother-in-law, Dr. Ku.

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,963
We're dating. Happy now?

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,049
- Holy cow!
- It really is true.

22
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,634
- You were right.
- Hey, can you stop--

23
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,344
See? I told you I saw them!

24
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,387
Hey, Yi-young. I kept it a secret though.

25
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,097
Hey, when did you start dating?

26
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,098
Who liked who first?

27
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,058
Does your family know?

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,310
Wait, that's double in-laws.
You'll be double in-laws?

29
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,063
Look, I'll handle my own relationship,

30
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,856
so stop worrying about it.

31
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,109
Just keep it a secret at work for me.

32
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,319
Okay.

33
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,155
It would only be a headache
if people at work knew.

34
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,366
I don't have anyone to tell.

35
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,408
But, Yi-young.

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,744
We feel hurt.

37
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,538
You should've told us.

38
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,914
That's…

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,085
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,380
All right. We'll forgive you.

41
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,258
So with that in mind, this one's on you.

42
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,596
Let's get dried pollack. It's good.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,056
The whelks and cuttlefish too.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,058
We ordered some squid earlier.

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,101
- Excuse me!
- Order more.

46
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,811
Dried pollack, whelks, and cuttlefish.

47
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,062
- Nachos too.
- French fries.

48
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
- And nachos and fries, please.
- Don't order those yet!

49
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,869
Doctor, about Ms. Lee Sang-lim in MFICU…

50
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,871
I prescribed her a uterine relaxant,

51
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,330
so you can hook it up for her.

52
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,166
And for Ms. Kim Go-yun,

53
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,544
I checked her personal medication,
and she can take them all.

54
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,006
Your hands are moving like a blur.

55
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,300
I know, right?

56
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,095
I can't believe this used to be so hard
I had to stay after work to do it.

57
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,891
Are you going somewhere?

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,518
I have a date tonight.

59
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,605
You're so lucky. Gosh, I'm jealous.

60
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
Are you on a break from dating these days?

61
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,442
Not a break. I'm out of business.

62
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,403
I mean, I'm always at the hospital,
so how can I meet people?

63
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,573
I guess that's why
people date their coworkers.

64
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,782
Date their coworkers?

65
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,161
Someone's dating their coworker?

66
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,078
What?

67
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm not sure if I should say this.

68
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,171
Besides Dr. Oh's relationship,
there's another couple?

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,881
Wait, how did you know?

70
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,760
Well…

71
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,806
Nurse, I said it was a secret!

72
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,815
- And…
- There's more?

73
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,110
I requested a GS consult for Ms. Yun
and scheduled her operation.

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,321
How did you know that?

75
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,782
Did… I ask you to do it?

76
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,869
Her chart said she had wanted
a chemo port even before surgery,

77
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,454
so I only got it ready.

78
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,002
And Ms. Na Seo-hyeon
was scheduled for a BSO,

79
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,922
but she wanted ovary preservation,
so I changed it to a BOC.

80
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,423
Just in case you forgot.

81
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,300
Nice work.

82
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,927
- Thank you.
- Hello, sir.

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,053
Hi, Dr. Ku.

84
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,096
The study group.

85
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,723
You didn't join?

86
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,894
I see. So there's nothing more
for you to learn?

87
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,271
No, there's a ton to learn.

88
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,274
But I'm so busy right now,
so I was planning to join in January.

89
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,150
We lost him to OB.

90
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,569
This diligent and talented doctor.

91
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,071
Thank you, sir.

92
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,740
I should get going.

93
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,325
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,496
For a variety of reasons,

95
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,664
it's such a shame.

96
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,790
If I had a daughter…

97
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,375
Even if you did, it wouldn't matter.

98
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,713
He has a girlfriend.

99
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:58,923
Really?

100
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,968
What? Who?

101
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,096
It's a secret.

102
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,059
Someone from work, right?

103
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,644
Yes, it's Oh Yi-young.

104
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,771
Right, Oh Yi-young. The…

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,398
The one with the short hair?

106
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,399
No, long hair.

107
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,526
Right, and she's tall?

108
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,611
No, she's shorter than me.

109
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,529
Really?

110
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,658
I know. It must be her.

111
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,744
The intern planning to go to Neurology.

112
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,997
Yes, that's right.

113
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,167
Those two?

114
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,961
They're very…

115
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,004
Since when?

116
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,547
Has it been long?

117
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,134
The surgery schedule
will be hectic tomorrow.

118
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,136
I looked into it.

119
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,764
OR 7 will likely be free first.

120
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,974
So how about putting
the TLH as OR 7's last surgery

121
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,851
and having the explo-laparotomy in OR 10?

122
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,228
That would work.

123
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,897
You figured that out quick.

124
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,650
I never thought
I'd live long enough to see

125
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,027
such an incredible sight.

126
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,030
This is nothing, Doctor.

127
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,827
There's something else
that really is incredible though.

128
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,460
About Dr. Ku…

129
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,129
They're still together?

130
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,714
What?

131
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,717
I thought he and Dr. Oh would break up,
but they're lasting a long time.

132
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,719
Wait, how did you know?

133
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,222
What do you mean? It was pretty obvious.

134
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,433
I have to go. See you later.

135
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,478
A secret relationship, my foot.
It's only secret to them.

136
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,022
Everyone at work knows. Everyone.

137
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:38,981
Do you know too?

138
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,319
Your savings matured as of December 29th.

139
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,863
The amount listed there
will be deposited now.

140
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,907
Not many people make it to five years.

141
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,866
It's very impressive.

142
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,326
Thank you.

143
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,502
Would you like to hear
about any other products?

144
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,421
I'd like to open
another one-year savings account.

145
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,257
So you need short-term savings plan?

146
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,174
Yes.

147
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,136
I think I'll need the money soon.

148
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,347
By soon…

149
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,473
Do you mean…

150
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,558
For a wedding fund?

151
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:14,976
Yes.

152
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,237
What on earth?
Why are you here making a ruckus?

153
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,448
Are you prepped for rounds?
What about the charts?

154
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,035
Go away. Now.

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,079
Yes, sir. Then,

156
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,416
your sisters-in-law
and brother-in-law will leave you to it.

157
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,587
It's Yi-young!

158
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,761
- Go! Now! Go do your work!
- Bye!

159
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,348
What a bunch of kids.

160
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,985
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

161
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,946
Have you decided
on who the new OB professor will be?

162
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,782
We've narrowed it down to two
based on your feedback.

163
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,243
But our OB chief, Prof. Seo,

164
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,204
would like a bit more time.

165
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,124
Both candidates
have great evaluations in teaching

166
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,959
and extensive work
and research experience.

167
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,879
But they were a bit lacking
in other evaluation criteria.

168
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,924
I'd like to review those areas
a bit more before deciding.

169
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,093
Then why don't we decide
on appointing a professor next week?

170
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,803
Yes, that sounds good.

171
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,846
Thank you, everyone!

172
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,848
Thank you.

173
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,853
- Rounds?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,446
2024 NON-TENURE FACULTY APPLICATION
MYEONG EUN-WON

175
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,574
Time sure does fly.

176
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,202
There's only one day left in this year.

177
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,121
It feels like
we did introductions just yesterday.

178
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,039
I know.

179
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,125
But we're already 29.

180
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,461
I can't believe it.

181
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,924
Right? Seeing as how you still
throw money away like a child.

182
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,013
It's a Christmas gift to myself.

183
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,683
You gifted yourself last month too.

184
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,017
The necklace.

185
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,313
It was 68% off for Black Friday.

186
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,273
How could I not?

187
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,190
I had to buy it.

188
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,319
Once she drowns in debt after maxing out
an overdraft account, then she'll wake up.

189
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,946
Geez, enough with the nagging.

190
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,614
You're worse than my mom.

191
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,077
He's so loud.

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,495
He didn't go home again?

193
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,373
No, he's been pulling
all-nighters in the ward for days.

194
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,457
Why?

195
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,668
There's a cervical cancer patient in GYN,

196
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,795
and it seems her cancer pain is severe.

197
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,715
Painkillers must not be working,
because she calls every two hours.

198
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
Can't he wait in here
until he gets called?

199
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,885
He says he feels better being nearby.

200
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,971
And he feels bad she's alone.

201
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,265
She wasn't alone though.

202
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,933
She has a full-time caregiver.

203
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,020
No, that's not what we meant
by "being alone."

204
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,937
Her family…

205
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,231
Do I have to explain this?

206
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,693
One is too warm,

207
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,903
and the other is too cold.

208
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,282
It'd be nice if we could mix you two up.

209
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,493
But you're like oil and water.

210
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,170
Yes?

211
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,839
Yes, I'm on my way.

212
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,432
Hello.

213
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,894
So, were you able to get some sleep?

214
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,023
I couldn't sleep again at all, Doctor.

215
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,944
My back and hips

216
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,824
feel like they're being ripped apart.

217
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,827
Have you been controlling the pain?

218
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,455
Yes, morphine is
being administered intravenously.

219
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,501
She complained of pain overnight,
so we increased dosing frequency.

220
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,508
But lying in bed for too long
can cause clots.

221
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,718
So it may be hard, but moving around--

222
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,887
How can I?

223
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,225
I'm in too much pain.

224
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,228
Of course.

225
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,397
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,026
Check in on her frequently.

227
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,944
Yes, sir.

228
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,327
Ma'am, I'll be at the station
at all times.

229
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,038
Call me anytime if the pain's too much.
I'll come right over.

230
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,881
You look so tired.

231
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,425
Are you okay?

232
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,552
I'm fine.

233
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,930
There's not much I can do,

234
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,224
but I should still check on her.

235
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,643
This is why all the patients ask for you.

236
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,147
Nurse, being asked for is a good thing.

237
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,274
It means you're useful.

238
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
Just a few months ago,

239
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,111
no one even noticed when I was gone.

240
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,237
I was invisible.

241
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,739
- Really?
- Yes.

242
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,535
After it happened to me, I realized
nothing's sadder than being useless.

243
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,789
Did something happen?

244
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,169
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,355
What happened?

246
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:58,486
The first patient Dr. Ki took on
when she arrived at Jongno Yulje…

247
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,906
passed away.

248
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,243
Eun-mi was in charge
from her first admission

249
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,953
to her last cancer treatment.

250
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,540
But she suddenly passed,
so it's hitting her harder.

251
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,793
She has time before surgery,
so let her cry it out.

252
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,837
- Call me for anything urgent.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,974
It's not time for rounds.

254
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,104
Goodness.

255
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,024
Ms. So Won-ju.

256
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,568
Is it because your surgery's approaching?

257
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,112
You seem pretty worried.

258
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,450
I thought I'd be fine the second time,

259
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:47,993
but I'm not.

260
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,871
I'm so scared I can't sleep.

261
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,250
But you need to sleep well
before the big day.

262
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,751
By the way, Professor.

263
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,546
You're here alone again today.

264
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,463
Yes, I am.

265
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>I am Solo</i> is trending these days.

266
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,844
How about I give you a Super Surgery Pass…

267
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,807
I mean, famous doctors at other hospitals

268
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
would always have
a group of juniors in tow.

269
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,188
And they say you can't see doctors much
because they're so busy.

270
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,440
But you come by very often.

271
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,070
I mean, we came for a renowned surgeon,
so I'm just making sure.

272
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,782
First of all, I'm not a renowned doctor.

273
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,537
I just work hard
on surgeries and treatments.

274
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,497
That's about all I do.

275
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,749
I like to make rounds.

276
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,669
But having my juniors in tow
every time I do that

277
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,547
would be an inconvenience.

278
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,632
And it's a waste of manpower.

279
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,011
Also, that kind of stuff
only happens on TV.

280
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,512
But in real life,

281
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,224
no one goes around
with a big group like that.

282
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,271
Well, they say you do
the most surgeries here at this hospital.

283
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,772
That much is true, right?

284
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,815
Yes, that's right.

285
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,694
He does a lot of surgeries, and he's good.

286
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,237
You don't have to worry.

287
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,908
And he appeared on a TV show
that features only renowned doctors.

288
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,327
They call him the superstar of Yulje.

289
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,245
Is that so?

290
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,873
Wait, hold on. Don't get so excited.

291
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,374
What are you doing?

292
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,668
What's with you? Why are you saying that?

293
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,586
Stop.

294
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,630
- I'm done, sir.
- You are?

295
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,298
I see. What brings you here?

296
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,841
The patient's results are in.

297
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,385
Hemoglobin was in the nines
at outpatient care.

298
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,346
But the pre-op lab shows it's in the 12s.

299
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,264
That's good news.

300
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,392
Because of pelvic adhesions,

301
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,937
bleeding is the main concern
for this surgery.

302
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,147
But with numbers like these,

303
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,483
we won't need a preemptive transfusion.

304
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,734
That's fantastic.

305
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,402
That's a relief.

306
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,363
After hearing only bad news all the time,

307
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,782
hearing some good news

308
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,742
does make me feel a bit better.

309
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,954
We got a positive sign,

310
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,289
so you can sleep well tonight.

311
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,293
We'll do our best tomorrow during surgery.

312
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,379
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,756
Thank you.

314
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,092
I so wish that Ms. So

315
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,844
will sleep soundly tonight.

316
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,979
I got verbal confirmation from Radiology

317
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,314
and contacted
a Vascular Surgery professor via consult.

318
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:23,899
Already?

319
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,526
I ordered more blood for transfusions,

320
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,361
re-briefed Anesthesiology
about the patient,

321
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,279
and rechecked the bed
in the ICU this morning.

322
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,197
So,

323
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,450
it's okay take a breath.

324
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,368
Yes, sir.

325
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,829
What is it?

326
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,706
Are you worried?

327
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,332
Yes.

328
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,461
There are severe adhesions
from the pelvic wall to the bowels,

329
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,797
so I think there will be heavy bleeding.

330
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,298
Yes, there will be.

331
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,051
You've done it many times,
so I'm sure you're okay,

332
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,344
but for me,

333
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,306
I still get scared
when there's heavy bleeding.

334
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,599
I feel the same way.

335
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,394
I also get very scared.

336
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,896
I get terrified.

337
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,735
It's like this. The patient didn't give up
on surgery and got her labs up.

338
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,320
She's done her part.

339
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,530
So now,

340
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,782
the rest is up to us.

341
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,410
And on top of that,
if there's heavy bleeding,

342
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,494
it's really scary.

343
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,121
I lose sleep too.

344
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,374
That's why I keep doing rounds,

345
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,626
try to make jokes,

346
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,962
and assure them things will be okay.

347
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,964
That's what I'm doing.

348
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,760
So, I wanted to ask…

349
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,304
For some encouragement,

350
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,306
can you repeat…

351
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,893
what you said earlier?

352
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,352
Sorry?

353
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,147
You know. What you said to the patient…

354
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,026
That you do the most surgeries
and are the best at them?

355
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,652
Not that. That's not important.

356
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,945
You were on <i>Best Doctors?</i>

357
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,493
The superstar of Yulje?

358
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,749
"Superstar."

359
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,251
But still,

360
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,630
how can I call myself a superstar
like I'm Lim Young-woong or something?

361
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,381
That's a bit…

362
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,511
You might offend some people.
They'll storm the hospital.

363
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,642
- Then too?
- Yes.

364
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,601
Professor?

365
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,271
The patients I updated you about
have entered the labor room.

366
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,190
Okay, let's go.

367
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,275
- Thank you.
- Of course.

368
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,616
Hello, ma'am.

369
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,534
Hello.

370
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,037
Nam Seol-i at 39 weeks and 5 days.
Multigravida, last birth in 2015.

371
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,039
Cervix is fingertip-soft,

372
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,750
but contractions were every ten minutes,
so we admitted her.

373
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,337
Labor usually progresses faster
with the second baby.

374
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,174
But it's been eight years
since you last gave birth,

375
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,303
and at this rate,
you won't be having the baby today.

376
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,930
Okay.

377
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,432
Maybe it's because I've done it once.

378
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,560
But I feel more scared, Professor.

379
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,062
Things will go much smoother. Don't worry.

380
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
- Oh, my. It's that good?
- By the way…

381
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,859
You said the baby
was on the larger side last time…

382
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,777
No way!

383
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,906
But I could give birth on the 31st.

384
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,869
So you're saying

385
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,455
a birth on New Year's Day
would bring the most fortune, right?

386
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,834
Even better if it's born at midnight?

387
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,881
But I can't believe how a single day
makes such a difference in luck.

388
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,008
So the 31st is really bad, right?

389
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,637
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,556
I'll be done soon.

391
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,188
She went through a lot
to get pregnant through IVF,

393
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,772
so she's especially eager.

394
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,817
And tomorrow's the 31st.

395
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,111
Among mothers
who go into labor at this period,

396
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,656
some get greedy
and want a New Year's baby.

397
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,160
It's giving birth
right at midnight on January 1st.

398
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,955
So that's why they're all making a fuss?

399
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,708
Hello!

400
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,503
Well, the thing is
my water suddenly broke,

401
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,422
so my due date got pushed up.

402
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,174
But guess what?

403
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,676
They say our little darling
could be born tomorrow.

404
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,429
So, since I'm here now,

405
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,598
I'll try to give birth
to a New Year's baby.

406
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,851
I'll give birth on January 1st at midnight

407
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,520
and share that magical energy
with you all.

408
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,481
Subscribe, like,
and turn on notifications…

409
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,358
Oh, my goodness.

410
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,610
I'm so sorry.
It's for content we're creating.

411
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,196
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.

412
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,163
A healthy baby is enough.
What more do you want?

413
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,085
The <i>doljabi</i> isn't that important.

414
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,715
Hey, Min-hye.

415
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,261
I really wanted to come celebrate
your baby's first birthday,

416
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,389
but it's my mother-in-law's
birthday that day.

417
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,476
Don't feel bad for inviting me.

418
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,939
I'm more upset
at how cautious you're being around me.

419
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,152
I had another transfer this week,
and I'll do a blood test soon.

420
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,822
It's going to be fine. Don't worry.

421
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,283
I'm really fine.

422
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,163
Okay, let's talk again soon. Bye.

423
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,083
Seung-won!

424
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,334
Yes, dear?

425
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,836
What? Is that you, dear?

426
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,714
It's cold out. What are you doing here?

427
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,636
Did you hear?

428
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,804
No.

429
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,139
Then why did you walk away?

430
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,226
I was cold.

431
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,485
You know Min-hye, right?

432
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,821
Yeah, she's your closest friend.

433
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,033
She gave a speech at our wedding
and came to Yi-young's graduation.

434
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,660
She had a hard time conceiving

435
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,787
- and came to our hospital last year.
- Right.

436
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,999
But she got pregnant
on her first try with IVF.

437
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,254
The baby's already a year old.

438
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,049
So cute, right?

439
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,717
So cute.

440
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,514
What's wrong?
You don't want to go to the party?

441
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,225
No.

442
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,937
I can't bring myself to congratulate her.

443
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,149
So I lied.

444
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,151
Good.

445
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,532
I'm mad she invited me to the party,

446
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,870
I'm upset
that she's so cautious around me,

447
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,249
and I'm annoyed
that she asked me if I'm okay.

448
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,753
But what I hate most right now is…

449
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,507
how jealous

450
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,551
and petty I'm being.

451
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,971
The blood test is in a few days.

452
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,557
You're just on edge right now.

453
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,438
All this fuss to get pregnant.

454
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,318
It's turning me into a mess.

455
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,653
You're not a mess.

456
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,030
It's understandable.

457
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,367
I totally get it.

458
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,750
Gosh, your hands are so cold.

459
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,001
Let's go in, okay?

460
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,587
It's so cold.

461
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,424
Let's go in. It's so cold!

462
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,930
You don't have a moving date yet.
Why are you already packing?

463
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,474
I wanted to pack in advance
while I had the time.

464
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,018
In your second year,
you'll be too busy to clean your room.

465
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,478
Should I stop here and help you?

466
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,771
I cleaned it last week.

467
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,316
No, you didn't.

468
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,193
I did.

469
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,445
That's the cleaned room?

470
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,536
Will I become too busy
to see you next year then?

471
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,413
I'll be doing more deliveries.

472
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,873
That's right.

473
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,208
But you'll do less
of your first-year duties.

474
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,835
I heard we may not get a first-year.

475
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,089
That will make things really hard.

476
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,258
It's okay. I can just quit.

477
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,342
Again with that.

478
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,095
I'm just saying I could.

479
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,473
I stay on until I'm debt-free,
so don't worry.

480
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,810
But I'm almost done.

481
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,270
Now, I'm down to 19 million.

482
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,938
You've paid off a lot.

483
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,903
I'm never using
an overdraft account again.

484
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,454
It's too messy in there.

485
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,873
I'll clean it up myself next time.

486
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,334
I see. Okay, then.

487
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,890
"To my Do-won."

488
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,852
"All that studying must be tough.
Right, Do-won?"

489
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,898
"I miss you so much."

490
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,025
- "It's so hard to bear."
- That's not mine!

491
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,445
"Sometimes, I think I like you more
than you like me."

492
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,280
"It makes me so sad!"

493
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,587
What are you two doing?

494
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,175
Are you two…

495
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,767
Are you two physically fighting now?

496
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,310
Yi-young, move your elbow.

497
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,312
That's the solar plexus. You'll kill him.

498
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,774
When is that idiot ever going to grow up?

499
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,526
Are you sick?

500
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,196
I'm healthy!

501
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,532
We didn't fight!

502
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,826
I was helping him!

503
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,474
Oh, right.

504
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,943
Please…

505
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,284
Damn it.

506
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,327
I always lose.

507
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,799
When did I buy this?

508
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,394
CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU'VE WON 32,984,892 WON

509
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,953
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

510
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,790
One hot Americano, please.

511
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,167
That'll be 1,500 won.

512
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,922
You're all set.

513
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,097
Hello, this is Oh Yi-young.

514
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,432
<i>Hello, this is your bank.</i>

515
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,976
<i>We're calling you</i>
<i>about extending your overdraft account.</i>

516
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,728
Oh, yes.

517
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,772
<i>If you'd like to extend it next year…</i>

518
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,066
I need to come
with my certificate of employment, right?

519
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,443
<i>Yes. If you don't have plans to extend it,</i>

520
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,363
<i>you can repay</i>
<i>the amount of 19,750,300 won.</i>

521
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,489
I'll repay it.

522
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,157
I won't be extending it.

523
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,283
<i>All right.</i>

524
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,620
<i>In that case, the account will remain</i>
<i>only until January 21st.</i>

525
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,579
Okay.

526
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:27,997
Thank you.

527
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,339
Dr. Oh?

528
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,260
Good morning, Doctor.

529
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,470
You have this month's
delivery stats, right?

530
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,139
Can you email them to me by tonight?

531
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,726
Patient and baby data from today
needs to be included as well.

532
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,354
I'll need more time then--

533
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,606
And I need to do ultrasounds
for MFICU patients.

534
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
Go and have them prepped for me now.

535
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,072
Drink your coffee first though.

536
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,243
It's okay.

537
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,036
I'll get right on it.

538
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,165
If you're getting coffee,
you can take my place in line.

539
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,002
What on earth?

540
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,838
Why is she being so scary?

541
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,809
I've never seen this before.

542
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,732
Hey! It's morning. Get up.

543
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,319
Already?

544
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,780
Did you stay up in the ward again?

545
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,697
Yeah.

546
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,868
Ms. Hong Sa-ra's pain is getting worse.

547
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,373
She keeps calling.

548
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,880
But is it okay
to give her drugs that often?

549
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,881
Isn't it too much?

550
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,549
I don't go to give her drugs.

551
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,384
I just check to see if she's okay.

552
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,678
I see. You check.

553
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,431
What do you check?

554
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,186
The worse her pain gets,
the more depressed and lonely she becomes.

555
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,730
I keep her company and chat with her.

556
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:19,943
But

557
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,530
does that make her pain hurt less?

558
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,034
I mean, she didn't ask you
to come keep her company.

559
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,536
She called because she's in pain.

560
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,414
You're so cold.

561
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,501
You said it's an advanced cancer mass
with severe pelvic pain

562
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,294
and her whole body aches from metastasis.

563
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,714
She's had three days of IV morphine,
but the pain hasn't subsided.

564
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,632
Yeah.

565
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,385
That's why I'm so worried I can't go home.

566
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,012
That's not what I mean.

567
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,894
I guess we really are like water and oil.

568
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,899
Hey. Where are you going?

569
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,817
Surgery!

570
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,800
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

ANESTHESIA TIME, CURRENT TIME,
SURGERY TIME

573
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,106
How are her vitals?

574
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,107
Her BP's low.

575
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,318
EBL's 1,100.

576
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,112
I'm using vasopressors while transfusing,

577
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,822
but her vitals aren't stable, Professor.

578
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,700
We fully removed the tumor
and stopped most of the bleeding,

579
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,869
but the entire pelvic floor is oozing.

580
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,540
This won't work.
Let's move her to the ICU!

581
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,709
- Yes, sir.
- She's still bleeding. Is that okay?

582
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,836
- Roll gauze, please.
- Yes, this is OR 10.

583
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,088
We'll first put pressure
to stop the bleeding.

584
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,507
The organs are swollen right now,

585
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,135
so we can't spot microvascular bleeding.

586
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,387
Let's not waste time

587
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,473
and let the patient's condition worsen.

588
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,602
Pack the inside, and after compression,

589
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,520
let's open it and check
before closing her up.

590
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,910

LABOR ROOM

592
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,121
It's still 4:20 p.m.!

593
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,331
I can hold…

594
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,540
I can hold it.

595
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,209
Wait!

596
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,924
The fortune teller

597
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,009
said a January 1st birth

598
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,470
will lead to a future as president.

599
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,431
- Ma'am.
- Can we wait a bit?

600
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,809
Just a few hours.

601
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,815
I really can't give birth on the 31st!

602
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,941
I'm sorry.

603
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,235
The baby's the one
who chooses when to come out.

604
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,987
We'll push when I count to three.

605
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,822
One, two, three!

606
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,625
The baby's out.

607
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
Hi!

608
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,838
You did so well.

609
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,927
We just need to remove the placenta.

610
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,515
Is my baby okay?

611
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,183
Yes, you can hold him soon.

612
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,648
- Yi-young, let's remove the placenta.
- Yes, ma'am.

613
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,156
Me?

614
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,615
I'm still…

615
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,243
I told you everything you need to do.

616
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,590
Gently.

617
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,138
Don't pull…

618
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,059
Move.

619
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,776
I said don't pull all at once.

620
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,861
If you try to yank it out,

621
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,906
the cord breaks off from the placenta.

622
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,824
I'm sorry.

623
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,453
Mom's name is Yong Hui-seon,
and Dad's name is Jeon Tae-san, right?

624
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,996
Yes.

625
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,334
Time of birth is 4:28 p.m. on December 31.

626
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm so sorry.

627
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,547
Mommy

628
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,302
let you out too soon, so I'm sorry.

629
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,537
Gosh.

630
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,498
It really is the year's end.

631
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,584
Doctor.

632
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,628
Yes?

633
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,255
I was about to call you.

634
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,464
What is it?

635
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,301
I think you should come see.

636
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,219
Okay.

637
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,431
She's a recurrent
gynecologic cancer patient,

638
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,767
presenting with
general weakness and dyspnea.

639
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,395
Her labs are all over the place,

640
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,771
and her BP keeps dropping.

641
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,190
She's currently bedridden.

642
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,441
What's her BP?

643
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,778
She's on vasopressors,
but BP's 60 over 40.

644
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,990
That means her condition is really bad.

645
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,410
I checked and she already signed a DNR.

646
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,037
Okay. I'll take a look.

647
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,541
What's her name?

648
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,376
Yeom Mi-so.

649
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,966
Age 38. After getting
her last cancer treatment here in October,

650
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,426
she was receiving follow-up care.

651
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,657
Did you check Ms. Yong Hui-seon's
uterine contractions?

652
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,201
Yes, I just checked.

653
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,077
Contractions were fine with no hematoma.

654
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,829
That's a relief.

655
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,707
What about that fortune thing?
Did you work it out?

656
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,459
I managed to persuade her.

657
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,337
I mean the fortune teller.

658
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,379
What?

659
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,048
I took the call instead.

660
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,592
If he's born on January 1st,
he'll only be lucky later in life

661
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,052
and become president at 80.

662
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,179
If he's born on the 31st,

663
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,473
he'll become prime minister
but the youngest on record.

664
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,141
That's what we agreed to.

665
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,437
You can't remove a placenta,

666
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,689
but you deal with complaints well.

667
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,861
Nice work. Go eat dinner.

668
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:19,820
Thank you, ma'am.

669
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,704
Okay.

670
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,334
Yes, I understand.

671
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,715
There's no space in the ward.

672
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,593
Her guardian will have to come here.

673
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,053
Okay.

674
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,436
She likes silence

675
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,731
and being alone though.

676
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,152
Why today of all days?

677
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,029
Do you know her?

678
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,201
Yes. She was my first patient in GYN.

679
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,787
I once ran away,

680
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,540
but came back to see her.

681
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,214
I'll finish writing up her chart.

682
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,270
Ms. Yeom.

683
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,898
Your brother is on his way.

684
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,402
The professor will be here soon too.

685
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,946
Things aren't looking good right now.

686
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,409
Would you like to keep the DNR you signed?

687
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,789
Okay.

688
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,085
Painkillers are still being administered.

689
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,341
Are your lips dry?

690
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,552
Would you like me to place
a wet gauze on them?

691
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:12,892
Then…

692
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,479
Then, now…

693
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,524
There's nothing else I can do.

694
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,131
I'm

695
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,550
really good at this job now.

696
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,095
I get a lot of praise too.

697
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,849
It's all thanks to you.

698
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,292
RESTRICTED

699
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,053
Sa-bi, what are you doing here?

700
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,931
I was writing up charts
and checking on patients too.

701
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,474
There won't be much to do for now.

702
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,476
Go to the lounge. I'll call you.

703
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,436
It's okay.

704
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,521
Then, at least go eat something.

705
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,566
I have to log surgical records anyway.
I'll keep an eye on things.

706
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,359
It's okay though…

707
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,111
Doctor, vitals are dropping!

708
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,874
Professor, I think Ms. So
has active bleeding.

709
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,167
Her pulse is at 110,

710
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,752
and mean BP's still under 60
even on norepinephrine.

711
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,045
We can't wait longer.

712
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,339
Okay, sir.

713
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,178
Anesthesiology? The patient who was
just in OR 10 needs reoperation.

714
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,763
Yes. Let's move her.

715
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,056
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

716
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,855
Get that camera away from me!

717
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,398
I think you need to come now.

718
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,776
Doctor, just one more hour.

719
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,987
No, now!

720
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,572
It hurts too much!

721
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,075
- Let's move to the delivery room.
- Wait.

722
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,494
Can't we go a bit later?

723
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,620
We can't.

724
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,331
But I showed the preview
on the livestream earlier!

725
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,916
Just one more hour.

726
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,501
No New Year's baby would be a waste.

727
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,752
It's not a waste at all.

728
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,047
This is the best time to deliver.
Trust me. I know.

729
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
What?

730
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,467
The baby's ready
and so is the delivery room.

731
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,386
Once you're ready,
everything will be perfect.

732
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,180
- Let's move.
- Hurry!

733
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,765
Honey.

734
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,099
Hi!

735
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,861
CURRENT TIME

736
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,906
Mom's name is Moon Jin-hui,
and Dad's name is Song Ji-hwan.

737
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,868
Time of birth is 11:02 p.m.
on December 31.

738
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,786
Right.

739
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,499
Unfortunately, he wasn't
a New Year's baby,

740
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,751
but he'll always be your bundle of--

741
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,669
Doctor.

742
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,839
They said babies don't look pretty
right when they're born…

743
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,053
but why is he so beautiful?

744
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,353
He really is very cute.

745
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,856
Yi-young.

746
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,944
This is your last chance of the year.
Well? Want to try again?

747
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,658
Yes.

748
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,623
- I mean, no. I misspoke--
- Come here.

749
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,141
Now take your left hand.

750
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,185
I'll make sure to take out the placenta
without breaking the cord.

751
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,285
The placenta's out.

752
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,330
- Start the oxytocin.
- Yes, ma'am.

753
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,045
Good.

754
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,597
DELIVERY ROOM

755
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,850
She must be disappointed
it wasn't a New Year's baby.

756
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,809
No.

757
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,021
She's happy she can greet
the new year with her baby.

758
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,315
She and her husband
are busy filming right now.

759
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,860
By the way, Professor,
you fulfilled your wish today.

760
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,945
It was your wish

761
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,782
to have a first-year wrap up
a delivery before the year's end.

762
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:21,992
You're right.

763
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,746
Great work today.

764
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,498
See you next year.

765
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,046
You were terrible this afternoon.
What happened?

766
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,132
Well…

767
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,928
It's embarrassing
to screw up all the time.

768
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,347
And I'm the one making the mistake,

769
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,059
but it scared me to think
the patient would suffer for it.

770
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,729
So I looked up some videos.

771
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,903
I didn't only look them up.

772
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,363
I…

773
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,615
I practiced too.

774
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,242
In the air, like this…

775
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,745
Why are you scared?
I'm complimenting you for doing well.

776
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,748
You did well.

777
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,751
You did so well

778
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,629
it reminded me of myself
when I was a first-year.

779
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,048
I see.

780
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,967
Hey, that was a huge compliment.

781
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,470
Thank you.

782
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:30,394
Yi-young, can you come with me somewhere?

783
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,395
Where?

784
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,479
Someplace nice.

785
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,955
You're sleeping here again?

786
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:59,006
Is that all you've learned this past year?
Being able to sleep anywhere?

787
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,091
I'm sorry.

788
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,551
You can't sleep while on call.

789
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,094
You have to work.

790
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,681
I'm the one on call tonight, Professor.

791
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,435
Then, what's he doing here?

792
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:16,064
Ms. Hong Sa-ra
continues to suffer from pain.

793
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,357
So?

794
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,404
I was keeping her company
and chatting with her.

795
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,742
And I was wondering about
what else I could do for her.

796
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:33,081
It's Ms. Hong. She must be in pain again.

797
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,217
It's me again.

798
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,720
Are you feeling any discomfort?

799
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,972
No, it's not that.

800
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,726
It's just so strange
that I don't feel any pain.

801
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,898
Before, even brushing against the bed
was so excruciating

802
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,775
that I couldn't sleep at all.

803
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,779
But I slept for four hours straight today.

804
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,533
Did her condition improve?

805
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,745
Her lab results haven't changed much.

806
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,458
I came across something in a book.

807
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,752
According to textbooks

808
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,796
and the Cancer Center's
guidelines on pain,

809
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,549
when pain from bone metastasis
or neuropathy

810
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,593
can't be controlled by opioids,

811
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,388
adding adjuvant medication
can be effective.

812
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,016
So I looked up some related papers.

813
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,568
Adding diazepam and dexamethasone

814
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,361
helps reduce muscle spasms

815
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,863
and inflammation around the tumor,

816
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,701
and they said that would help
relieve the pain.

817
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,788
Instead of just keeping her company,

818
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,958
I wanted to try some other things too.

819
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,543
So that's why…

820
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,962
It was so good, Doctor.

821
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,215
Maybe it's because I slept well,

822
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,303
but when I saw myself in the mirror,
I didn't seem like a patient at all.

823
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,472
Actually, my daughter

824
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,558
is coming tomorrow
to see me for the new year.

825
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,228
She'll see me smiling
for the first time in a while.

826
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,731
Thank you, Doctor.

827
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,065
It's no problem.

828
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,906
Why did you suddenly do something
you weren't asked to do?

829
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,743
I'm sorry, sir.

830
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,786
Sa-bi was reading a book in the lounge…

831
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,665
Only now?

832
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,377
Geez, that took you long enough.

833
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,129
I'm sorry, sir.

834
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,135
Hey, Jae-il.

835
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,931
I'll give you an Excel file
on ovarian cancer,

836
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,141
so organize the data.

837
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,226
Yes, sir.

838
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,936
If the data looks good,

839
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,316
I'll help you write the paper
and abstract with you as first author,

840
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,609
so make sure you do it well.

841
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,402
Yes, sir.

842
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,279
Good night, Professor.

843
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,323
Good night, Professor.

844
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,117
Holy cow!

845
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,037
That was amazing, Jae-il!

846
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,622
What?

847
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,961
Seriously, this is the first time

848
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,422
that Prof. Jo's ever praised anyone.

849
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,425
He didn't praise me.

850
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,177
He wants to write a paper with you.

851
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,929
If that's not praise, what is?

852
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,431
I mean, Prof. Jo

853
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,226
approached a first-year for a paper.

854
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,896
I think this is the first time
in the history of Yulje.

855
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,149
It's a good thing, right?

856
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,359
Of course.

857
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,778
You basically got a "Good job" sticker

858
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,279
stamped on your forehead.

859
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,824
But you'll get busier.

860
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,453
Gosh, Jae-il.

861
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,997
You've made it.

862
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,625
It seemed like just yesterday
you were a fool.

863
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,712
Dr. Cha, I thought I was a fool too.

864
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,673
But after seeing the interns this year,
I was pretty okay.

865
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,717
That's true.

866
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,427
Who was it?

867
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,096
I don't remember who it was.

868
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,225
But he saw a bedridden patient
with a runny nose

869
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,394
and said it was a brain fracture.

870
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:26,481
Then he said,
"Doctor, I found an aortic dissection."

871
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,484
And he called me like that,
sounding all determined.

872
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,863
I think it was around March.

873
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,740
Which intern was it?

874
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,657
That

875
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,367
was me.

876
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,369
I did that.

877
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,545
It was so funny then.

878
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,675
Prof. Seo asked me to bring her something.

879
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,634
I forgot.

880
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,553
See you later.

881
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,929
I think she already left.

882
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,410
Weren't you saving this for a good day?

883
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,704
Yeah. That day is today.

884
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,708
Your paper got an award?

885
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,751
No.

886
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,002
A promotion…

887
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,337
is probably not it.

888
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,589
Is it your birthday?

889
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,924
It's not.

890
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,092
Then why?

891
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,386
Didn't you hear earlier?

892
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,388
I fulfilled my wish thanks to you.

893
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,643
You closed a patient up last time

894
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,853
and removed a placenta today.

895
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,356
I knew you had good hands,

896
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,566
but things like that only stand out now.

897
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,693
In a few years,
we all end up similar in skill.

898
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,613
Manual skills come with practice.

899
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,534
But because you were worried
for the patient's well-being,

900
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:05,330
you studied
and thought to research things.

901
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,957
That was a surprise.

902
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,668
Especially since
you'd always been trying to quit.

903
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,964
That's more than enough reason
to open this.

904
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,592
It wasn't that impressive.

905
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,639
Still, I think
it would be nice to drink it.

906
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:23,682
Should we open it?

907
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,766
Here?

908
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,645
You can't drink alcohol in a hospital.

909
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,730
Then why did you bring me here?

910
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,484
Take it and enjoy it later.

911
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,153
Today's the perfect day for it.

912
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,073
No, it's okay.
Let's drink it together next time outside.

913
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,284
I want you to have it.

914
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,328
Still…

915
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,793
Then I'll gratefully accept.

916
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,677
Hello?

917
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,097
Already? Okay.

918
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,018
My goodness.
They said Ms. Nam Seol-i's all full.

919
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,060
All of a sudden?

920
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,979
They'll move her after having her push.

921
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,188
I'm off.

922
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,900
Enjoy that and have fun
to your heart's content tonight.

923
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,202
Professor!

924
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,956
I'll take the alcohol next time.

925
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,208
I said it's okay to go.

926
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,376
You're not even on call.

927
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,296
Still, I'm her doctor.
I'm curious how her baby is.

928
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,469
Yes?

929
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,846
I'll go in for delivery.

930
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,266
Can you move her for us?

931
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,855
Push if it hurts.

932
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,656
You're almost done, ma'am.

933
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,950
Just a little more
and you can see your baby.

934
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,869
Yi-young. The baby's coming now.

935
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,288
You receive it.

936
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,123
What?

937
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,751
Hurry, Doctor.

938
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,087
All you have to do
is just put your hands out.

939
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,051
Come on!

940
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,761
Yes, ma'am.

941
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,854
Ma'am, just one more final push!

942
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,194
To get the anterior shoulder out,

943
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:44,197
you have to lower the head a little.

944
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,533
The shoulder's out!

945
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,827
Support the neck with one hand

946
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,454
and the back with the other.

947
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,331
Go down to the bottom.

948
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,389
The baby's out.

949
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,725
Honey.

950
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,226
He's out.

951
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,061
Honey!

952
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,397
You were great.

953
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,567
You did so well.

954
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,406
Hi.

955
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,868
Great job. Move.

956
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,666
Ma'am, congratulations.

957
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,043
The baby's healthy.

958
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,545
You can hold him soon.

959
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,714
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

960
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,924
Thank you.

961
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:48,928
You did great.

962
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,765
Ma'am, your baby.

963
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,849
Hi, baby.

964
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,518
It's your mom.

965
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,648
Thank you for coming to me.

966
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,317
Thank you.

967
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,998
Mom's name is Nam Seol-i,
and Dad's name is Do Se-ho.

968
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:22,087
Time of birth is 12:00 a.m.
on January 1, 2024.

969
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,505
Really?

970
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,590
Congratulations!

971
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,592
It's a New Year's baby!

972
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,720
- Congratulations.
- That's so cool.

973
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,602
ANESTHESIA TIME, SURGERY TIME,
CURRENT TIME

974
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,993
How is she?

975
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,670
Good.

976
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,713
We're tapering the norepinephrine,

977
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,715
and vitals are staying stable.

978
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,928
I think we got everything handled.

979
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,930
Yes. I don't see any bleeding, Professor.

980
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:17,475
Gosh, I was so scared
something bad might happen.

981
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,936
All right, then…

982
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,438
We will close her up for good now!

983
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,318
- I need a 1-0 suture please.
- Yes, sir!

984
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,280
And also…

985
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,364
Everyone…

986
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,579
It's already after midnight.

987
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,788
Happy New Year!

988
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,457
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

989
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,416
Happy New Year!

990
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,626
Happy New Year.

991
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,961
You too, Dr. Kim.

992
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,133
Let's not forget to tell the patient
when she wakes up,

993
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,053
"It's been so long
we hardly recognized you."

994
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,724
"It's been a whole year."

995
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,856
"You've become so healthy in that time."

996
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,526
No?

997
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,034
Laugh, Sa-bi.

998
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,787
Don't force it.

999
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,165
I know it's not funny.

1000
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,085
Still, if we joke a little like this,

1001
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,046
the patient will smile

1002
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,631
and feel better.

1003
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,966
And they can recover quicker.

1004
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,772
Mi-so.

1005
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,816
Say hello to Mom for me.

1006
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,945
We'll meet again.

1007
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,738
And when we do…

1008
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,575
let's be together for a long time.

1009
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,289
January 1, 2024,

1010
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,374
time, 12:15 a.m.

1011
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,252
Ms. Yeom Mi-so has passed.

1012
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,588
Mi-so!

1013
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,759
Mi-so!

1014
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,934
Mi-so.

1015
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,320
Mi-so.

1016
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,380
Excuse me, Doctor?

1017
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,803
Was my sister in a lot of pain?

1018
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,556
She was sick for a while.

1019
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,726
Did she have a hard time
before she passed?

1020
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,521
She seemed to be in a lot of pain,
so we continuously gave her pain meds.

1021
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,193
I'm sure it wasn't too bad
when she passed.

1022
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,201
And she was here alone?

1023
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,412
She'd been alone her whole life.

1024
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,709
And it feels like I made her die alone.

1025
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,048
I stayed by her side.

1026
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,719
I held her hand

1027
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,346
and spoke to her.

1028
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,726
She had a favorite hymn,
so I turned it on for her.

1029
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:32,271
She looked peaceful, as if she was asleep.

1030
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,148
Thank you.

1031
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,526
Thank you so much.

1032
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,761
DEATH CERTIFICATE

1033
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:12,937
CAUSE OF DEATH

1034
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,354
We need help here! Please call OB-GYN!

1035
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,399
Ma'am, take deep breaths!

1036
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,778
Slowly.

1037
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,821
What happened?

1038
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,199
Her water broke at home.

1039
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,326
We just came up from the parking lot.

1040
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,621
How many weeks? Is it her first pregnancy?

1041
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,539
Well, I…

1042
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,375
It's my second, and I'm at 35 weeks.

1043
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,171
I still have so much time before I'm due.

1044
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,802
I can see the baby's head right now!

1045
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,179
We have to deliver the baby here.

1046
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,640
Please call the delivery room
and the doctor on call.

1047
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:31,557
Yes, Doctor.

1048
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,976
- Get a delivery kit ready.
- Yes, Doctor.

1049
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,144
OB-GYN?

1050
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,062
Yes.

1051
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:38,898
Sir, you can--

1052
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,191
Honey!

1053
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,402
Doctor, are my wife and baby okay?

1054
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,279
The baby will be out soon.

1055
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,465
The baby will come out
on the bed, so it won't fall.

1056
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,967
You can relax and receive it.

1057
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,009
Okay.

1058
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:07,927
What?

1059
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,303
Me?

1060
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,267
It's okay.

1061
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,729
Okay, let's take some deeper breaths.

1062
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,857
Okay, ma'am.

1063
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,359
Take in a deep breath and push.

1064
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:24,986
Push!

1065
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,155
Okay, great. You're doing so well.
Just one more time.

1066
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,408
Take a big breath.

1067
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,159
That's great.

1068
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,204
Okay, let's push. Push!

1069
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,751
Great, the baby's coming.

1070
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,045
Okay, this is the last part.

1071
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,716
Okay.

1072
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,509
Okay, ma'am.

1073
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,679
Take a deep breath one last time and push.

1074
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,473
Okay, take a deep breath and push.

1075
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,392
Okay. One last time, push!

1076
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,772
Ma'am. Push longer.

1077
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,983
Take in a breath and one more time.

1078
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,067
Push!

1079
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,905
One, two, three, push!

1080
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,506
January 1st.
Time, 12:24 a.m. It's a baby boy.

1081
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,761
You did great, ma'am.

1082
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,139
The baby's crying well.

1083
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,204
It's okay.

1084
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,121
What happened?

1085
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,919
A multigravida came
after her water broke at home.

1086
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,088
The baby was appearing
when she was admitted.

1087
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,215
It looks good.

1088
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,217
We'll remove the placenta upstairs.

1089
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:12,969
Gosh.

1090
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,055
You did well by yourself.

1091
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,692
Where did he go?

1092
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,327
Professor, the baby is fine.

1093
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:39,870
Okay.

1094
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,832
Are you okay?

1095
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,839
Ma'am, are you awake?

1096
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:32,840
Are you okay?

1097
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,592
Yes.

1098
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:37,678
And you, Sa-bi?

1099
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:39,638
Are you okay?

1100
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,765
Sir?

1101
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,725
Yes.

1102
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,437
I've been monitoring her.

1103
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,148
Urine output's good
and her vitals are stable.

1104
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,859
I've tapered off the norepinephrine.

1105
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,404
I checked your blood work.
It all looks good.

1106
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,782
First, get some rest,

1107
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,159
and you can focus on recovery.

1108
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:05,748
And…

1109
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,631
The bleeding didn't stop initially,
so there were a few things that happened.

1110
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:17,718
But I will explain everything
in detail later.

1111
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,388
There's more though.

1112
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,021
As soon as your bed is ready,

1113
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,397
you'll go into the ward.

1114
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,274
I'll explain it to you then.

1115
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,654
And one more thing.

1116
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,412
It's been so long,

1117
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,832
I almost didn't recognize you.

1118
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,126
It's been a year.

1119
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,048
Gosh.

1120
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,718
You've become so healthy in that time.

1121
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:07,935
So it's January 1st.

1122
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,481
The professor said
you'll recover faster if you smile.

1123
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,775
Please get better soon.

1124
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,113
Thank you for working the entire year

1125
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,615
on my surgery.

1126
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,369
Happy New Year.

1127
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,000
Happy New Year.

1128
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:32,877
Happy New Year.

1131
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,324
Hey.

1132
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,368
Are you sleeping?

1133
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,623
Get up.

1134
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,877
Did you just get back?

1135
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,962
You didn't go home?

1136
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,715
We couldn't.

1137
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:21,592
I'm so hungry.

1138
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,469
Me too.

1139
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,263
I'm hungry too.

1140
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,980
It's good.

1141
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,649
What do you mean? They're all bloated.

1142
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,109
The bigger rice cakes will mean
a more bountiful year.

1143
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,361
Isn't that for <i>Chuseok</i>?

1144
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:41,987
It's good for any time of the year.

1145
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,198
Bountiful pockets and hearts.

1146
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,200
And work… is probably not.

1147
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:49,453
I just happened to read
my fortune for this year.

1148
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,665
I'm all out of luck in all areas

1149
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:53,999
except for work.

1150
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,709
We're second-years now.

1151
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,253
Dr. Eun-mi said

1152
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,588
to think of it as being twice
as busy as we are now.

1153
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,257
Gosh, I can't do a second year.

1154
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,343
No, I won't. How can I?

1155
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,095
I'm so tired of that.

1156
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,805
People like her stay the longest.

1157
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,640
It's her habit of speaking now.

1158
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,727
I was going to tell you guys.

1159
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,065
I'm not doing my second year.

1160
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,402
I'm going to quit at the end of February.

1161
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,028
Hey, do we have kimchi in the fridge?

1162
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,321
No, it's all gone.

1163
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,657
Eat the whole rice cake. It's good.

1164
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,868
I'm serious.

1165
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,248
I wasn't going to tell you this, but…

1166
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,045
I won the lottery.

1167
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,637
So I don't need to work.

1168
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:52,808
Liar.

1169
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:53,809
Come on.

1170
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:54,810
No way.

1171
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,691
Goodness.

1172
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,112
I don't know
if you've ever seen such a thing before.

1173
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,242
Ta-da!

1174
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:13,912
This will cover all of my debt.

1175
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,332
So I can quit being a resident.

1176
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,710
Well, I'm going to rest

1177
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,129
and look for other work.

1178
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,589
Oh, dear.

1179
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,344
Goodness.

1180
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:36,894
Wait, what the…

1181
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,774
THE CLAIM PERIOD HAS EXPIRED

1182
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,446
No.

1183
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,449
No!

1184
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,336
What are you taking home?

1185
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:04,046
- A taxi.
- The bus.

1186
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,839
- Me too.
- The bus for me too.

1187
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,217
Oh, right!

1188
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,594
Damn it, nothing's going my way.

1189
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,221
I'll see you later.

1190
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:15,933
Where is she going?

1191
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,976
On a date, of course.

1192
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,606
Oh, my gosh!

1193
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,149
What is it? Are you in pain?

1194
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,401
Yeah, my stomach hurts.

1195
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:26,443
Because I'm so jealous.

1196
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,739
Right. Bye.

1197
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,616
See you tomorrow.

1198
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,827
- Happy New Year.
- You too.

1199
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:44,878
Let's go.

1200
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:51,885
Wow, it's snowing.

1201
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,346
On the first day of the year too.

1202
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:00,185
Hey, I'm going to write a paper
on ovarian cancer with Prof. Jo.

1203
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,104
And that means,

1204
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,983
I'm his first-ever first-year mentee.

1205
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:09,194
Ovarian cancer? Then look up
Prof. Ryu's paper from last year.

1206
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,156
It's a good reference for how they set up
patient and control groups.

1207
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,450
Thanks.

1208
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,494
How do you remember
every paper you read though?

1209
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,913
I organize them
by publication year and importance.

1210
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,374
And I write down what I'm curious about

1211
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,626
and resolve them
before moving on to the next chapter.

1212
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,836
That's my strict rule.

1213
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,924
When you talk about your rules,
you're the cutest…

1214
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,646
Hey, you already know,

1215
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:48,275
but I'm the type who needs
to resolve things I'm curious about.

1216
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,404
Do you like me?

1217
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,824
I didn't want to get you wrong,
so I thought about it.

1218
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,160
First was karaoke.
Second was the outpatient churros.

1219
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,038
And third was
when you were in the wheelchair.

1220
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,749
If you weren't in pain,
but pretended to be, that means--

1221
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:04,666
Hey.

1222
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,878
What's with the step-by-step questioning?

1223
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,797
And why are you so curious?

1224
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:12,382
Of course…

1225
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,512
I like you.

1226
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,183
Everything you said was right.

1227
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,810
You made the right conclusion.

1228
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,313
I…

1229
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,775
like you.

1230
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:35,989
What about you?

1231
01:15:38,575 --> 01:15:40,994
- If you like me too…
- No!

1232
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,874
I think about you too,

1233
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,085
and it is true that I miss you at times.

1234
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,674
But I don't think I'm ready to date yet.

1235
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,594
They say you need at least a year
to get to know someone first.

1236
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,555
It's a strict rule of mine too.

1237
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,390
Hey, I didn't ask you to marry me.

1238
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:02,933
Who needs strict rules for dating?

1239
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:03,850
I do.

1240
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,645
We met last March,

1241
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,731
so I still need to get to know you more.

1242
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,109
I don't need to see anymore, okay?

1243
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:13,902
You know me enough already, Sa-bi.

1244
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,654
I really like you.

1245
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,239
Hey, stop saying that.

1246
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,408
Kim Sa-bi, I like you a lot.

1247
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,159
I said stop!

1248
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,327
Sa-bi, I like you!

Are you going home?

1251
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,596
Yes.

1252
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:50,939
Are you okay?

1253
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,566
What?

1254
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:57,863
Yes.

1255
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,702
Thanks for today.

1256
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:06,496
Sure.

1257
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,468
Doctor.

1258
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,055
I chose which department to go to.

1259
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,726
Don't you want to know which one?

1260
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:31,396
OB-GYN.

1261
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,607
I'm going to join OB-GYN.

1262
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,359
Really?

1263
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,236
You're serious, right?

1264
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,780
No takebacks.

1265
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,281
You've promised to come. Okay?

1266
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,325
Okay.

1267
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,910
You made the right choice.

1268
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,745
You won't regret it.

1269
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,914
I'll be really good to you.

1270
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:50,957
Okay.

1271
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,173
I look forward to working with you.

1272
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,261
Me too.

1273
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,727
I'm so sorry.

1274
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,937
I had a really hectic day today.

1275
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:58,984
What?

1276
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,196
How did you know I was here?

1277
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,365
You didn't pick up
and weren't at the lounge.

1278
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,616
I figured I'd come by here.

1279
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,370
It's still January 1st.

1280
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,456
It's 11:40 p.m. We have 20 minutes left.

1281
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,253
I mean,

1282
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,673
babies were coming out
and mothers were in labor left and right.

1283
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,802
And I had all my debt repaid,
but all my money disappeared.

1284
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,179
Nothing went right today…

1285
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,935
I didn't want to give them to you here.

1286
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,563
I failed again

1287
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,315
to surprise you.

1288
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:42,736
What is that?

1289
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:46,907
Ah, this.

1290
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:50,994
I was proud of you
for bravely completing your first year

1291
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,582
and wanted to
wish you luck on your second.

1292
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:01,046
Yes. Thank you, Dr. Ku.

1293
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,807
But is it okay over there?

1294
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,266
Over where?

1295
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,186
Well, on your seat…

1296
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,574
I really didn't mean
to give that to you this way either.

1297
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:36,790
Here.

1298
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,680
Why are you giving me this?

1299
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,186
Because I like you.

1300
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:01,499
<i>Now, today's guest of honor,</i>

1301
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,878
<i>Professor Im Dong-ju from OB-GYN</i>
<i>will give his retirement speech.</i>

1302
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:21,436
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RETIREMENT
PROFESSOR IM DONG-JU, OB-GYN

1303
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,566
I've been an OB-GYN doctor

1304
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,903
for already 40 years now.

1305
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,823
Facing the timeless truth
of life and death every day,

1306
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:38,036
I've said countless farewells.

1307
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:40,580
But my farewell to you today

1308
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:43,458
will be the hardest to bear.

1309
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:48,004
I might be a bit late in admitting this,

1310
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,800
but to be honest,
I always came in last place.

1311
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:58,723
I was never a good student
and suffered from an inferiority complex.

1312
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,685
My nose was always buried in books,

1313
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,854
so I was dead last
in emotional growth too.

1314
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:11,569
Despite all that, I can retire today
after enjoying a full career

1315
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:15,156
thanks to all the amazing people

1316
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,409
I met here at Yulje.

1317
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,663
In ways seen or unseen,

1318
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:24,582
through every moment of despair and joy,

1319
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,627
to those who gave me trust and faith…

1320
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,548
I wanted to select someone who can provide

1321
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:33,675
trust and faith in every moment.

1322
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,219
Instead of sitting at desks,

1323
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,848
looking at pieces of papers like us,

1324
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:43,893
our nurses and residents spend more time
working together in the field,

1325
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,062
and I thought they'd know better than us.

1326
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,273
So I asked for their advice,

1327
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,192
and I think it was a great help.

1328
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,486
I'd like to appoint as professor

1329
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,781
someone who focuses on taking an honest

1330
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,160
and upright approach to the process

1331
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:01,995
over the end result.

1332
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,457
Therefore, our new OB professor will be…

1333
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,630
this person.

1334
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:16,801
Hello, Professor.

1335
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,056
Thank you for letting me know so quickly.

1336
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,184
It's all right. Don't worry.

1337
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,395
Yes, Professor.

1338
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:30,398
Okay, bye.

1339
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:48,833
Also, there were so many patients

1340
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,543
who became great teachers

1341
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,171
in my journey of personal growth.

1342
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:55,173
And among them,

1343
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:59,344
it's thanks to those who taught me
how to fail with grace

1344
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,722
and to let go with courage

1345
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:08,186
that I was able to become a better person.

1346
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,272
The blood test results came back,

1347
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,359
and it's under 0.2.

1348
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:16,653
You're not

1349
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,363
pregnant.

1350
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,825
Professor, by any chance…

1351
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:25,203
What if we tried a second blood test?

1352
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,705
It would be pointless.

1353
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,833
I see.

1354
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,169
You should rest for a few months,

1355
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:34,587
get your strength up,

1356
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:36,673
and refresh your minds.

1357
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,675
Then we can start again
with egg retrieval.

1358
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,677
There's a lot of patients who succeeded

1359
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,887
after more than ten attempts.

1360
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,056
Right.

1361
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,351
They must be amazing people.

1362
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:50,812
But I

1363
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:54,482
don't think I'm one of them.

1364
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:04,450
I…

1365
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:07,829
would like to stop.

1366
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,797
We'd like to stop here.

1367
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:22,594
If we had a baby, it would be beautiful,
and we'd be so happy.

1368
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,555
That's why mothers say,

1369
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:29,809
"Gosh, I guess I was born
to meet my baby."

1370
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,898
People say a baby completes a family

1371
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,359
and wonder how can you live
without that happiness.

1372
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,489
But I'll give that life a shot.

1373
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,952
My family may be incomplete to some,
but I am happy with it.

1374
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:51,706
The joy a baby brings

1375
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,627
is something I'll try to find
elsewhere on my own.

1376
01:26:57,128 --> 01:27:00,131
I won't resent myself anymore.

1377
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,676
I'll love myself

1378
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,221
and try to live a happy life.

1379
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:10,350
Thank you for all your help, Professor.

1380
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:12,852
All right. I understand.

1381
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,072
<i>Thanks to all of them,</i>

1382
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:28,159
I leave this place with no regrets.

1383
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:33,414
Thank you for everything.

1384
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:35,792
Once again,

1385
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,211
thank you.

1386
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:53,851
Thank you, thank you.

1387
01:28:14,163 --> 01:28:16,165
- I've been seeing you a lot these days.
- I know.

1388
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,501
Funerals and retirement ceremonies…

1389
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:19,460
A lot's going on.

1390
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,588
Time sure does fly though.

1391
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:25,717
I can't believe our professor's retiring.

1392
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,093
I know.

1393
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,471
It feels like just yesterday
we took his classes in med school.

1394
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,597
Right?

1395
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:34,559
Back then, when we prepared
our simulation training presentations,

1396
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,561
we'd act as the patients.

1397
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,149
Back then, Ik-jun lost his voice
while simulating labor.

1398
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:43,860
A legendary performance.

1399
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,989
Hello.

1400
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:49,073
- Hello.
- Hello.

1401
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,199
- Hello.
- Hi.

1402
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,368
Our first-year residents.

1403
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,788
This is Professor Yang Seok-hyeong
from the main branch.

1404
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,665
- Hello.
- Hello.

1405
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,714
Go get some breakfast

1406
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:06,674
and make sure to be prepped for rounds.

1407
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:07,759
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1408
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:12,138
- Does she dislike Jae-il?
- No, she didn't say that.

1409
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:14,307
Hey. Gosh, I'm so jealous!

1410
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:16,267
Geez.

1411
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,852
So they were first-years.

1412
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,562
Yeah, aren't they cute?

1413
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:21,272
They're good too.

1414
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:23,149
It seemed like it.

1415
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:25,151
Good judgment and fast hands.

1416
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:26,694
And strong nerves.

1417
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,322
Yeah. How did you know?

1418
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,076
I can just tell by looking at them.

1419
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:35,787
Are you a psychic?

1420
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,664
I mean, they're your students,
so it's no surprise.

1421
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,001
You're really good at being a teacher.

1422
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,295
We wouldn't have graduated
if we didn't study with you.

1423
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:47,882
That was centuries ago.

1424
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:52,053
But with teaching,
I think I'm pretty good at it.

1425
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:53,096
I agree.

1426
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,014
I agree too.

1427
01:29:56,766 --> 01:30:00,603
So I'd like to
leave it in your hands this time as well.

1428
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:27,839
So, we're here to say hello.

1429
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:32,677
It's so good to see you!

1430
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,054
We've met often at conferences, right?

1431
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,974
Yes, Professor.
It's so nice to see you again.

1432
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:38,891
Me too.

1433
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,814
But I can't trust you 100 percent yet.

1434
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:46,566
What? Why not?

1435
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:50,027
No matter who I ask about you,
there's only praise.

1436
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,779
Is that even possible?

1437
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,531
Well,

1438
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,742
that's because I always
take people out to eat.

1439
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:58,786
Someone said that too.

1440
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,329
They said you're way too humble.

1441
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:04,709
Doctor.

1442
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,169
I mean, Professor.

1443
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,212
It's been so long.

1444
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,798
Congratulations on becoming professor.

1445
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:13,593
Why are you being so awkward?

1446
01:31:13,676 --> 01:31:15,052
Just be yourself, Do-won.

1447
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,180
How can I? You're a professor now.

1448
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:19,015
I need to get in your good graces.

1449
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,686
I just got here,
and I've met a great fellow.

1450
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,646
I am pretty lucky, aren't I?

1451
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:29,150
I should be the one
who's honored to meet you.

1452
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:32,320
And this is Dr. Myeong Eun-won.

1453
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,072
Right. You were
at the main branch together.

1454
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,450
Yes.

1455
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,244
How have you been, Doctor?

1456
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,372
Moving forward,
I'd really appreciate your help.

1457
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,041
Of course.

1458
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:50,588
I'm glad to be working with you as well…

1459
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:53,049
Professor.

1460
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,135
Yes. Thank you.

1461
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:04,143
Congrats, Professor Chu-chu.

1462
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,812
I asked for something prettier than you,

1463
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:08,856
but those flowers don't exist.

1464
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:19,617
You weren't alone.

1465
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,419
He's my husband.

1466
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,380
He must've thought no one else was here.

1467
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:36,008
He usually does cute things like that.

1468
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:41,764
Thank you for the welcome.

1469
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:43,766
I promise to give it my best.

1470
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:44,809
Let's give her a hand!

1471
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:47,645
Welcome!

1472
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:49,063
Welcome.

1473
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,283
- Bye!
- Bye!

1474
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,412
I honestly didn't think she'd last a year.

1475
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:05,371
Me neither.

1476
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:06,539
Hold on.

1477
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,333
Did she develop an interest in the work

1478
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,253
or a sense of duty?

1479
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,339
That's probably not it.

1480
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:16,924
Right?

1481
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,718
She has 16 million left to pay off.

1482
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:21,554
Let's hope she never pays it off.

1483
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:25,433
We should raise her rent this year.

1484
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:30,896
But why…

1485
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,774
They're holding hands.

1486
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:37,611
Holding hands?

1487
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:44,160
- They made up!
- That must be it!

1488
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:45,995
They must've made up!

1489
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:48,372
Gosh.

1490
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:52,001
They used to ignore each other
like they were sworn enemies.

1491
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,337
- What a relief.
- Right?

1492
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,838
Gosh.

Hey, what took you so long?

1499
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:42,153
Here.

1500
01:35:42,736 --> 01:35:44,071
I bought coffee. Iced, right?

1501
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,030
Yeah.

1502
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:47,950
Hey, your <i>Williams</i> book's new.
Can I give it to the first-year?

1503
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:49,493
No, I need it.

1504
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:51,245
Hey.

1505
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,414
Is that a new top? It looks new.

1506
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:55,749
- I've had it for a while.
- It's nice.

1507
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,334
Did anyone see a pen here?

1508
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:58,836
- Here.
- A blue one!

1509
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:00,379
Here.

1510
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,756
Hey, how's <i>tteokbokki</i> for lunch today?

1511
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,716
Okay!

1512
01:36:03,799 --> 01:36:05,092
Make it spicy. With rice balls.

1513
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,260
Of course.

1514
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,471
Yi-young. You're in, right?

1515
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:10,556
You guys haven't changed at all.

1516
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:15,478
You're the same as when we first met.

1517
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:19,690
It's nice.

1518
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,151
What are you talking about?

1519
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:23,152
Come on.

1520
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:24,737
See you later.

1521
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,697
I think it's nice too.

1522
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,920

Mind.

1530
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:45,693
Blowing.
