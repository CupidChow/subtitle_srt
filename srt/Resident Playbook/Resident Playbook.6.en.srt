RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,438
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,940
What? The July on-call schedule's
out already?

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,734
Yeah, you should check it now too.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,985
You're so quick.

6
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,113
KU DO-WON

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,158
KU DO-WON, OH YI-YOUNG

8
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,499
I guess Sa-bi doesn't know everything.

9
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,254
It's called the law
of total patient volume.

10
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,881
The total number of patients we'll see

11
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,507
- is already set.
- What do you mean?

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,218
A resident sees too many patients
and fills their quota.

13
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,304
Later, they open a practice.
But what will happen?

14
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,431
It would fail,
because they have no patients.

15
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,432
That's right.

16
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,976
- What's that have to do with on-call duty?
- Right.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,313
Every time I'm with Dr. Myeong,
patients come in like crazy.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,940
I'm using up so much of my total quota.

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,525
I need a lot for my practice later.

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,652
But I'm on call twice in July.

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,779
That's nonsense.

22
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,156
You just don't want
to work with Dr. Myeong.

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,240
Well, you're not wrong.

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,368
Hey, I may open a practice in the future,

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,662
so can't you switch
with me just once? Please?

26
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,623
I checked,

27
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,958
and you had zero shifts
with Dr. Myeong in June.

28
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,168
That's why it's twice.

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,837
I can't believe you checked that.

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,049
Hey, Sa-bi.

31
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,261
This is your day, and this is my day.

32
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,930
Couldn't you switch with me just once?

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,892
You think I don't know?

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,395
You want Dr. Ku…

35
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,567
since he's easy to work with, right?

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,362
He takes most of the calls

37
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,822
and even lets you nap.

38
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,574
That's not the only reason.

39
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,784
Then what is it?

40
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,077
What?

41
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,833
It's a Friday. I need to go home
and watch my show.

42
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,210
Watch the rerun.
That's not a good reason to switch.

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,673
Hey, what is this?
Sa-bi, you didn't schedule this right.

44
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,216
I'm the only one on call nine times.

45
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,717
Yi-young and Sa-bi have eight,

46
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,052
and Jae-il has seven.

47
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,011
Oh, that?

48
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,680
You were sick on June 8.

49
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,765
Jae-il covered for you then.

50
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,143
- Right.
- You have to repay him for that.

51
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,103
Hey, Jae-il.

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,606
Can I repay you in August instead?

53
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,150
No!

54
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,529
Hey.

55
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,781
I was really sick that day.

56
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,742
I was here but had no time to be treated.

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,495
I had a high fever and was so weak.

58
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,957
I was in my parka
and passed out in the on-call room.

59
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,959
Then, in August--

60
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,752
No! Repay him in July!

61
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,838
"Shirked on-call shifts
are repaid the next month."

62
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,881
That's our rule.

63
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,132
We have a rule like that?

64
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,633
Rule, my foot.

65
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,011
Jae-il, please?

66
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,388
Just this once.
I promise to repay you in August.

67
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,181
- Okay.
- No.

68
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,558
You'll end up not repaying him.

69
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,475
What?

70
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,352
It happened to me a lot as an intern.

71
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm not like that.

72
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,314
Exactly, so repay him right away.

73
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,317
If you switch shifts,
it messes up the schedule's fairness.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,194
Hey, why are you being
so strict with on-call shifts?

75
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,572
I made this with even weekends
and off days in mind.

76
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,240
There you go again.

77
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,201
Why are you being so uptight
over something so minor?

78
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,786
And there you go again.

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,331
I'm going by the rules.
Why are you getting angry again?

80
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,874
- I got angry?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,292
You're just being uptight!

82
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,419
I was being uptight because you got angry.

83
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,421
I got angry
because you were being uptight.

84
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,881
All I did was make the schedule.

85
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,634
- You're so frustrating. Seriously.
- You make me frustrated too.

86
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,510
- The same goes for me.
- Then let's not talk.

87
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,012
- Fine.
- I'm not changing it.

88
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,141
They're always fighting these days.
Is it the heat?

89
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,393
Heat? The AC's on full blast.

90
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,688
Did being overworked and sleep-deprived
make them both cranky?

91
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,606
No.

92
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,233
They just don't get along.

93
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:55,944
They'll figure it out.

94
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,403
This affects us.

95
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,613
It's not my business.

96
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,991
Leave them be.
It's not our place to intervene.

97
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,162
Yes, Doctor?

98
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,123
Yes, I'll be there. I have time.

99
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
Okay, bye.

100
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,460
Hey, you go on ahead.

101
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,588
- Actually, a few weeks ago--
- Bye.

102
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,215
Bye.

103
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,217
Geez!

104
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,637
Hey, Joo-young.

105
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,722
<i>Are you going to be late?</i>

106
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,181
<i>Our reservation time's almost up.</i>

107
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,391
I'll be there soon.

108
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,101
Do-won's not there yet, right?

109
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,102
<i>He's here.</i>

110
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,855
He is? His car's here though.

111
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,897
<i>He took the subway.</i>

112
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,482
<i>He said traffic gets bad on Fridays.</i>

113
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,109
Why are you telling me this now?

114
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,755
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

115
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,554
Prof. Jo's not here yet, right?

116
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,472
No.

117
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,976
You were on-call yesterday, right?

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,894
Yeah.

119
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,772
Did you talk to Ms. Park Jeong-ju
during post-op rounds?

120
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,607
What did she say?

121
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,031
She had a hysterectomy for fibroids,
but had her ovaries removed too.

122
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,201
"Park Jeong-ju, age 54,
TLH and BSO performed due to myoma."

123
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,118
Her?

124
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,662
Yeah. The professor said to visit her

125
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,998
and explain to her
what the procedure was again.

126
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,167
The professor said that to you.

127
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,337
No, he said it to you.

128
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,838
No, it was you.

129
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,217
It says right here.
"Ward out at 6:30 p.m."

130
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,052
What?

131
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,096
She arrived here at 6:30 p.m.,

132
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,098
so it's during the day,
which is your shift.

133
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,516
That doesn't make sense.

134
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,893
Why is 6:30 p.m. the day shift?
It's the on-call shift.

135
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,938
To be exact,
the on-call shift starts at 6:31 p.m.

136
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,316
If you want to be cheap like that,
then the day shift ends at 6:29:59 p.m.

137
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,361
The patient in Room 1014
was vomiting blood then, so I was there.

138
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
I was busy too
and had a patient in the ICU, okay?

139
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,823
I thought you did it.

140
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,074
I thought you would do it.

141
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,328
Oh, no. The professor's going to be
doing rounds soon.

142
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,413
Hey, first-years.

143
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,207
Didn't I tell you yesterday

144
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,209
to explain to Ms. Park
how the surgery went?

145
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,628
Why is she asking me today

146
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,338
if her ovaries are still there?

147
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,844
Hey!

148
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,263
Who's the attending doctor?

149
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,392
I am.

150
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,727
I'm sorry, sir.

151
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
I was going to do it--

152
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,357
Too busy, right?

153
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,775
That's why you didn't do it?

154
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,485
But you're not the only one.

155
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,028
Everyone here is just as busy.

156
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,488
You call that your excuse?!

157
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,032
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,712
Gosh, we didn't know you were here.
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,173
Why the wheelchair all of a sudden?

160
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,174
Did you fall?

161
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,427
Her feet were swollen this morning,
so her shoes didn't fit.

162
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,345
I thought walking barefoot would hurt.

163
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,680
Just a second.

164
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,807
Be careful.

165
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,018
- Give it a rest.
- Okay. Be careful.

166
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,854
I'm sorry. We'll put it back right away.

167
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,109
The professor asked me
to explain once more

168
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
what she said during outpatient care.

169
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,489
She said you were shocked,
so you may not remember.

170
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,949
Gosh, that scary news again?

171
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,161
You've undergone
dilation and curettage several times,

172
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,121
and since you have placenta previa,

173
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,165
heavy bleeding is expected during surgery.

174
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,001
If bleeding persists
after the placenta's removed,

175
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,420
a balloon will be inserted
into the uterus to stop it.

176
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,842
You know how we use tissues
to stop nosebleeds?

177
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,678
The balloon will be used in a similar way

178
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,804
to stop the bleeding.

179
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,932
But if bleeding still persists,

180
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,142
we'll insert a catheter into your thigh

181
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,395
and perform a uterine artery embolization
to block blood flow.

182
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,233
And if that doesn't work,
the uterus must be removed.

183
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
Don't worry, that won't happen.

184
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,446
If we do either
of the last two procedures I mentioned,

185
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,448
we'll inform your husband during surgery

186
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,242
to obtain additional consent then.

187
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,159
All right.

188
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,871
Doctor…

189
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,749
Please take good care of my baby.

190
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,001
The baby is very healthy.

191
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,295
We're monitoring it daily.

192
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,965
No, I mean my wife.

193
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,341
What?

194
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,467
Don't.

195
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,807
Yes, of course.

196
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,439
Goodness.

197
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Don't worry. Everything will go well.

198
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,660
So sweet, right?

199
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,247
Yes, very.

200
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,084
So sweet and warm.

201
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,253
How can you get that warm?

202
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,005
You add hot water.

203
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,301
The smell of love is in the air.

204
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,802
It smells like apples to me.

205
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,222
I mean Ms. Cha Bo-mi's husband.

206
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,267
I was talking about him.

207
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,187
He gave us this tea too.

208
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,897
It was for taking care of his baby.

209
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,193
I've worked
in the OB ward for seven years,

210
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,155
but I've never seen
a kinder, sweeter husband.

211
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,783
Where do you find men like that?

212
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,035
There are a few.

213
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,162
I don't know if that's good though.

214
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,748
Where? Where on earth are they?

215
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,916
At my house.

216
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,592
Do-won's heading into surgery.
He says he's sorry.

217
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,552
Sorry for what?

218
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,638
Egg retrieval is nothing special.

219
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,473
It's my fifth time. I'm not even nervous.

220
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,308
Should I call your sister?

221
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,225
Don't.

222
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,603
I don't want anything to disrupt my peace.

223
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,021
I didn't tell her on purpose.

224
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,987
She looks about seven months in.

225
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,949
Seven months? Gosh, it's rough.

226
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,370
At that stage,
they say your back, ribs, feet…

227
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,329
Everything hurts.

228
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,289
I heard it's really hard.

229
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,499
How would you know?

230
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,958
I looked it up.

231
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,758
It looks like they're here to give birth.

232
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,343
Birth? Gosh.

233
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,262
After the birth, everyone says

234
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,764
that pregnancy is a piece of cake.

235
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,599
The real hell is taking care of the baby.

236
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,018
They say parents age a year each day.

237
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,062
I don't want to get old.

238
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,563
Right? Me neither.

239
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,942
Should we just cancel and go home?

240
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,859
No.

241
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm still going to do it.

242
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,655
I'm doing it.

243
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,535
I told you not to feel bad.

244
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,121
I'm not doing it for you.

245
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,748
And it's not because
of your mother's nagging either.

246
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,583
I'm doing it for me.

247
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,419
It's because I want to do it.

248
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,212
I want to become a mother.

249
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,549
I'm just afraid
it'll be hard on you like last time.

250
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,009
It won't be.

251
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,845
The saying goes
"all's well that ends well."

252
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,346
It'll be a beautiful finish.

253
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,976
This will be the last time for sure.

254
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,562
Whether it's three or four eggs,

255
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,232
I'll do only
as much as needed for fertilization.

256
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,402
After that, I'm not doing it. I won't.

257
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,325
Keep your chin up too.

258
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,743
I'm not doing anything.

259
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,870
I'm fine.

260
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,496
I'm fine too.

261
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,166
The shot in my stomach
didn't hurt much today.

262
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,795
I'll be asleep for the procedure,
so when I wake up, it'll be over.

263
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,216
It's time. Should we go in?

264
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,343
Yeah.

265
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,100
Ms. Oh, you may go in.

266
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,028
It's 3:40 p.m. now.
We only have 20 minutes left.

267
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm going down again.

268
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,114
You're going up, right?

269
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,532
Yes, I am.

270
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,618
But I think I'm going to die.

271
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,704
You only did four prescriptions,
while I did nine?

272
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,247
Hurry up, will you?

273
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,957
We still have six patients left!

274
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,084
This is the fastest I can go.

275
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,085
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,338
If we don't end before 4:00 p.m.
and chemo is delayed,

277
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,923
you know it'll be chaos, don't you?

278
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,174
Yes, I know.

279
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,551
And we'll be the first to die
if that happens.

280
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,970
Dr. Jo will mow us down with his mouth.

281
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,557
Wait, BSA is 1.5.

282
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
So 1.5 times 135 is…

283
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,227
It's 202.5.

284
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,478
What? Are you a genius?

285
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,355
As Um Jay,
my special talent was mental math,

286
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,940
so I'd compete against calculators.

287
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,733
Hey, keep your hands on the keyboard.

288
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,360
Our hands aren't important right now.

289
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,028
Our necks are on the line.

290
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,238
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,656
Hello, all.

292
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,990
Hello, Professor!

293
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,577
I have a meeting this afternoon,
so I was thinking of doing rounds

294
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,746
for patients who had surgery this morning.

295
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,498
- I see! Right.
- Right.

296
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,499
But we can't.

297
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,543
Who would dare

298
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,295
to thoughtlessly do rounds
at 3:40 p.m. in the GYN ward?

299
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,631
They've lost their minds.

300
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,260
I've lost my mind. I apologize.

301
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,095
Good luck. Continue what you were doing.

302
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,513
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

303
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,515
Hurry! Come on!

304
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,684
Damn it.

305
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,102
Good, we're still okay.

306
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,937
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

307
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,404
Geez.

308
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,656
YEOM
ATTENDING DOCTOR: KIM SA-BI

309
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,116
Hello.

310
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,367
Hello.

311
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,706
You seem to always listen to this song.

312
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,166
It's my favorite hymn.

313
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,211
I see. You're Catholic.

314
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,422
What about you, Doctor?
Do you have a religion?

315
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,674
Yes, mine's shamanism.

316
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,052
Last month,
I followed the Great Orb Fairy.

317
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,388
But this month,
I switched to Gangnam Young Master.

318
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,598
They're truly mystical.

319
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,601
How are you feeling?

320
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,853
Are you having any trouble breathing?

321
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,438
I'm fine.

322
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,149
You must be busy. Why come by so often?

323
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,818
Come on, I have to see you if you're here.

324
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,320
You were my first patient.

325
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,656
And thanks to you, I didn't run away.

326
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,199
Right.

327
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,660
You ran away, but you came back.

328
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,912
You thought I was dead.

329
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,038
Dead?

330
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,205
That's not it.

331
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,374
I knew nothing then.

332
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,251
I came back because I was so scared.

333
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,337
I was a total fool back in March.

334
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,924
Still, it seems you have
a better handle on things now.

335
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,050
You look much better.

336
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,551
It's not the case at all.

337
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,096
When I got used to the work,
things got busier.

338
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,266
Work is one thing,

339
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,977
but people stress me out these days.

340
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,520
Who? Patients?

341
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,606
The professors?

342
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,442
No, my colleagues.

343
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,363
I have the worst luck with colleagues.

344
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,492
One has an attitude,
and another's all over the place.

345
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,993
The last one lacks a human touch.

346
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,412
They're also inflexible
and have zero empathy.

347
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,791
It's like talking to a robot, not a human.

348
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,711
And they have an opinion
on even the smallest things.

349
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,796
They're always saying,

350
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,256
"I read this in a textbook, so I know."

351
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,884
They think they're always right.

352
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,846
It's just so frustrating.
I can't talk to them.

353
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,349
We're completely incompatible.

354
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,061
The professor already came by
on their rounds.

355
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,731
These aren't rounds.

356
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,734
I was asked to explain
the CT scan results again.

357
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,444
The imaging came up normal

358
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,405
and tumor marker levels
are also decreasing,

359
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,615
so this round of chemo should go well too.

360
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,283
I see.

361
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,452
I'll let you rest now.

362
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,506
I'm screwed.

363
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:50,968
Here.

364
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,773
I don't really like pigs' trotters.

365
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,525
I got it because Sa-bi wanted it.

366
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,776
Just eat.

367
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,155
Hey, I thought you had dinner plans today.

368
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,365
I have some time. I'll just have a taste.

369
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,453
But you did wash your hands, right?

370
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,537
Yes.

371
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,206
I washed them
as thoroughly as I do when I scrub in.

372
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,249
Just my hair's dirty.

373
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,045
You didn't go home again?
You weren't on call.

374
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,131
You might not believe it,

375
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,218
but every night these days,
a sort of voluntary on-call shift--

376
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,429
Right! Who's making the August schedule?

377
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,933
Hey, can you take me off
for the third weekend?

378
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,518
I'm telling you in advance, okay?

379
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,645
My dad's birthday is on the third week,

380
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,314
so I was going to ask you too.

381
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,066
I'll think about it.

382
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,985
You don't usually think much.
So why think now?

383
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,236
Don't.

384
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,323
Sa-bi, it's your dad's birthday?

385
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,867
Hey, I asked first.

386
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,702
What does that matter? It's up to her.

387
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,414
Hey! Do you two have to fight
over the schedule every month?

388
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,584
Yi-young, just be fair about it.

389
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,711
You know the senior
on call the third week?

390
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,880
Pick whoever gets along better with them.

391
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,632
Gets along better?

392
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,425
You know Dr. Woo from Orthopedics?

393
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,428
He organizes the on-call schedule
based on compatibility.

394
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,389
But amazingly,
whenever he organizes the schedule,

395
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,141
the number of ER patients drop.

396
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,851
- That's great!
- No!

397
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,228
I'm Christian.

398
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,022
It has nothing to do with religion.

399
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,941
It also has nothing to do
with compatibility.

400
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,442
We're just doing it for fun.

401
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,569
We can't make the schedule based on fun.

402
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,239
Right, since it's not fun,

403
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,491
we should at least try
to make it fun this way.

404
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,118
That won't make on-call duty more fun.

405
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,828
So why would we need to do that?

406
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,997
You're so frustrating.

407
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,749
I feel the same. You frustrate me too.

408
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,924
Yes, ma'am?

409
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,678
Don't be sorry. I'm the grateful one.

410
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,721
I'm leaving.

411
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,474
I actually wanted to
get out of this place.

412
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,600
Yes.

413
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,810
Where are you going?

414
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,312
KU DO-WON

415
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,274
You two make an agreement.
I'm heading out.

416
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,568
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

417
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,084
ULTRASOUND ROOM

418
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,335
Hello.

419
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,670
Hello, Doctor.

420
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,007
Thank you for remembering to call me.

421
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,843
But were you unable to go home
because of me?

422
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,261
Of course not.

423
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,182
I'm busy organizing the imaging data,
so I'm stuck here all week.

424
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,642
That must be really rough.

425
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,061
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

426
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,397
Are you okay?

427
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,899
You look really tired.

428
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,568
I'm fine.
I'll look at the images and go sleep.

429
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,988
By the way, if we do emergency imaging
on OB patients at night,

430
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,364
you want me to keep calling you?

431
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,699
Are you going to keep looking?

432
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,993
Yes, I want to do it for a few more weeks.

433
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,953
Could you help me out?

434
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,290
Sure. It's not a big deal for me.

435
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,791
Thank you.

436
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,126
Around this time,

437
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,921
all the first-years
always get very nervous.

438
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,297
They want to do well.

439
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,341
Not me.

440
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,177
I'm not expecting to do well.

441
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
I just want to pull my own weight.

442
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,349
Doing that

443
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,643
is my goal for this year.

444
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,149
Yes?

445
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,319
Dr. Eun-mi will be here soon.
Send the patient over.

446
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,446
All right, bye.

447
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,700
By the way, what brings the patient here?

448
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,162
I'm sure it won't be anything serious.

449
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
What?

450
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,082
Do you know Ms. Moon Yeong-shin?

451
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,959
She's very famous.

452
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,169
<i>I think she set the all-time OB record</i>

453
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,922
<i>for the most number of ultrasounds.</i>

454
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,132
<i>She comes at least once a week.</i>

455
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,927
<i>And since a few months ago,</i>
<i>she comes twice a week at times.</i>

456
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,680
I just wonder
if you're being too sensitive.

457
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,808
The doctors here seem annoyed with us now.

458
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,226
Look, I know too.

459
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,311
You think I don't?

460
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,522
I don't want to be like this either.

461
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,275
But I'm worried something
may be wrong with the baby.

462
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,196
She doesn't seem to be
moving around as well as yesterday.

463
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,908
My stomach hurts more than last time,
and it feels tight.

464
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,169
She's really fine.

465
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,005
The placenta's in a good spot too.

466
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,090
The placenta's in good position too.

467
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,092
She's not moving around much?

468
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,010
No.

469
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,762
Not as much as yesterday.

470
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,223
And I have pain in the lower area.

471
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,644
There's nothing wrong.

472
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,397
The baby's fine, right?

473
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,608
Yes. Her heart's beating well,
and everything looks good.

474
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,278
You have your regular checkup
in three days.

475
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,573
We'll take another look that day,
so there's no need to come until then.

476
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,283
I made sure and checked thoroughly.

477
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,618
Thank you.

478
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,245
Of course.

479
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,430
Did you wait long?

480
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,848
I had a lot to wrap up.

481
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,850
No, I just finished and came down now.

482
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,268
You're right on time.

483
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,481
I mean, I could've gone alone,
but Seung-won kept insisting.

484
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,650
They made chicken soup today.

485
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,652
It's not even close to <i>chobok</i> yet though.

486
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,156
Maybe they want to help
replenish our stamina.

487
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,157
Not ours.

488
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,411
Your sister had
her egg retrieval this morning.

489
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,288
That was today?

490
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,541
Geez, Joo-young.

491
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,251
Why didn't she tell me she was here?

492
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,380
<i>Please input your destination.</i>

493
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,220
Seung-won's pretty nosy too, right?

494
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,348
I could've taken the subway,
but he insisted you give me a ride.

495
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,100
You're so busy though.

496
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,519
It's such a bother, right?

497
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,853
Tell me about it.

498
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,941
<i>Re-routing.</i>

499
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,026
No, no!

500
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,486
Dr. Oh, that's not what I meant!

501
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,946
Dr. Oh, I mean…

502
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,365
I wasn't saying
you were a bother, Yi-young.

503
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,450
I have to review surgery videos,

504
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,202
and I miss your sister.

505
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,579
But I have to come back…

506
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,997
I still have work left…

507
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,166
That's what I meant.

508
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,543
You're mad again, aren't you?

509
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,295
At the hospital,

510
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,549
you're known to be
a very sincere, empathetic,

511
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,008
and understanding person.

512
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,137
But outside,

513
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,347
you're kind of thoughtless.

514
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,224
You just say anything.

515
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,976
And often.

516
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,270
And only to me.

517
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,399
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean it like that.

518
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,902
I'm going to sleep,
so don't talk to me until we arrive.

519
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,613
You'll bother me.

520
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,119
Let's go.

521
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
I'll drive you there safely.

522
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,261
You like music, right?
Should I turn it on?

523
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,471
No, I said I'm going to sleep.

524
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,224
But you still answered.

525
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,727
DR. MYEONG

526
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,896
Why is she calling now?

527
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,273
It's obvious.

528
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,858
She wants to give you more work.

529
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,527
Hello, Doctor.

530
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,988
Dr. Ku, are you okay to talk on the phone?

531
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,948
Yes. Is everything all right
at the hospital?

532
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,617
<i>This isn't about the hospital.</i>

533
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,870
It's about our paper.

534
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,787
Sorry?

535
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,998
<i>The paper we submitted last month.</i>

536
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,249
Right!

537
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,960
After cleaning things up
before submission,

538
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,421
the difference in the level
of contribution seemed too big

539
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,632
for us to be both lead authors.

540
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,926
<i>There were many insufficient parts,</i>

541
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,595
<i>so I had to rewrite a lot of things.</i>

542
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,512
Pardon?

543
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,017
So I put you
as the second author at the end.

544
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,853
<i>I didn't tell you, did I?</i>

545
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>Gosh, what's wrong with me?</i>

546
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,276
I should have told you
before I submitted it.

547
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,278
Right?

548
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,032
<i>Hello?</i>

549
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,911
Can you hear me, Dr. Ku?

550
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,412
Yes.

551
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,372
<i>Right.</i>

552
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,999
<i>Dr. Ku, I know you worked hard on this--</i>

553
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,043
Doctor, I'm actually driving right now.

554
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,462
<i>Really? Then--</i>

555
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,964
I'll call you back later.

556
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,748
Do-won, want to drink some soju?

557
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,254
There's beer if you want that instead.

558
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,387
Are you sleeping?

559
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,615
I'll have the six-inch veggie sub.

560
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,909
I'll have it on wheat bread
with American cheese.

561
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,245
Please hold just the onions
and bell peppers.

562
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,456
And I'll have some black pepper
and olive oil on it.

563
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,623
Thank you.

564
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,795
Six-inch steak and cheese
on white bread with shredded cheese

565
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,047
and extra meat, please.

566
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,214
I'll have all the veggies.

567
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,342
And I'd like the ranch
and sweet onion sauce.

568
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,093
Extra sauce, please.

569
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,680
They even have opposite tastes.

570
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,143
I'll have this month's sandwich
with everything on it.

571
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,228
I'll take whatever bread
and sauce is recommended.

572
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,731
And it's a six-inch sub.

573
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,109
I'll have the same as him.

574
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,821
But make mine a footlong, please.

575
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,536
HONG GI-DONG
DON'T CALL ME THIS TIME

576
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,041
<i>Tonight at 9:30 p.m. at Yoon's Cafe.</i>

577
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,752
<i>If you don't show, it's over for real.</i>

578
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,843
Man, I'm hungry.

579
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,764
You're clocking in and not out, right?

580
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,766
You all look so shabby.

581
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,435
You're the worst, okay?

582
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,021
How many days
have you worn those same clothes?

583
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,022
Three days.

584
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,984
It's time to go home.

585
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:15,902
You probably can't.

586
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,695
You make the study materials?

587
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,697
No. When's that due?

588
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,534
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

589
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,452
Right.

590
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,330
Did you send the research
progress update to Professor Seo?

591
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,248
No.

592
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,708
Damn it. I'll never have time to do that.

593
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,335
I sent mine!

594
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,546
I'm leaving work on time
no matter what today.

595
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,548
You can't.

596
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,425
You have to organize data
for Dr. Jo's paper.

597
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,427
You're right.

598
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,262
And we have plenty of other work too.

599
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,264
I already looked into it yesterday.

600
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,850
This morning, we have
two multi and primi inductions each.

601
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,269
All delivery rooms will be full
and we'll have C-sections.

602
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,105
There are fifteen surgeries in GYN today.

603
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,023
Of those, five are debulking.

604
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,192
So eat up.

605
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,740
This might be our last meal today.

606
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,919
JONGNO YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

607
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,140
Congratulations, Dr. Myeong.

608
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,224
You too, Dr. Ku.

609
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,101
Great work.

610
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,979
Sorry? For what?

611
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,356
You were listed as a presenter
for the conference.

612
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,362
What, were you going to surprise him?
You still haven't told him?

613
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,365
What's wrong with me these days?
I forgot again.

614
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,452
We were selected to present our paper.

615
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,204
I just got the email a few days ago.

616
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,290
It's all thanks to your help, Professor.

617
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,583
Thank you.

618
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,501
Bullshit.

619
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,336
Since you're presenting second,

620
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,962
I smell a possible award.

621
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,381
I guess you'll be presenting, Dr. Myeong?

622
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,633
You're the lead author.

623
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,135
Yes, I'll do my best to prepare.

624
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,931
Dr. Myeong told me.

625
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,266
If you hadn't been busy at the end,

626
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,894
you would've been co-lead authors.

627
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,229
That's too bad.

628
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,815
Well…

629
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,233
I'm sure I'll get other chances.

630
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,984
Goodness!

631
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,612
It was worth being a corresponding author.

632
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,656
I don't think Jung-min's paper got in.

633
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,492
Ms. Cha in Room 6104's bleeding!

634
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,346
It's acute bleeding
caused by placenta previa.

635
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,140
Labor has started,
so we'll go into surgery now.

636
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,226
What about the baby? Is it okay?

637
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,769
It's fine.

638
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,814
Crossmatch and prep three units of blood.

639
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,107
Bring one universal O blood.

640
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,066
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,985
Dr. Oh, inform the guardian.

642
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:02,902
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,863
Where is your husband now?

644
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,531
He went to buy shoes.

645
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,242
It'll take him 30 minutes to get here.

646
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,326
What do we do?

647
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,547
Has the surgery started?
It's supposed to be tomorrow.

648
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,133
There was sudden acute bleeding
with labor pains.

649
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,593
We have to take the baby out now.

650
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,469
Your wife's in surgery now.

651
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,388
Will they be okay?

652
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,265
My wife and baby?

653
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,435
The professor arrived early
and is monitoring her now.

654
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,562
My goodness.

655
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,480
Why did I buy these?
I couldn't see her off.

656
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,982
As we explained before,

657
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,567
something could suddenly happen,

658
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,860
so please stay near your room.

659
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,280
- Don't stray too far.
- Yes, I won't move an inch from here.

660
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,866
Doctor, wait.

661
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,618
Please take care of her.

662
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,329
Please take good care of my baby.

663
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,122
- I will.
- Thank you.

664
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,373
Please go in.

665
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,794
Oh, God.

666
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,175
Going home?

667
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,303
Yes, for the first time in three days.

668
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,722
Right.

669
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,058
Wash up and get some rest tonight.

670
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,101
I will.

671
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,061
See you tomorrow.

672
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,520
Good night.

673
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,816
MS. TAE-RIM

674
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,610
Yes, ma'am?

675
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,528
Of course, I'll be there.

676
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,656
I'm at the hospital.

677
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,368
Who goes home at this hour?

678
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,498
Does your stomach feel tight again?

679
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,916
Since when has it felt this way?

680
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,585
This morning.

681
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,964
This time, it feels tight all over.

682
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,632
I see.

683
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,344
Ms. Moon.

684
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,638
Everything is fine.

685
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,473
So there's nothing to look at.

686
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,558
Nothing's wrong?

687
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,143
Yes, nothing at all.

688
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,270
You can go home.

689
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,982
We'll see you on Saturday
at your regular checkup.

690
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,495
She didn't take as much time today.

691
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,498
She checked the heart
and amniotic fluid, right?

692
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,791
Yes.

693
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,961
She can read an ultrasound
with her eyes closed.

694
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,380
She checked everything precisely.

695
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,385
Sorry, but I was wondering…

696
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,432
If it's okay with you,

697
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,350
would you like me to take a look?

698
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,019
What?

699
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,397
I'm not as good as her,

700
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,774
but fortunately, I really take my time.

701
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,361
So, I'm an expert
at reading things slowly,

702
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,989
and my specialty is checking
everything multiple times.

703
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,159
If it's not too much for you,

704
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,871
would you like me to take a look
at the area where it feels tight?

705
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,832
I'd be grateful.

706
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,335
Actually, I've wanted to try this,

707
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,254
so I've been hovering around here.

708
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,716
For us,
this is a great opportunity to learn.

709
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,426
All right.

710
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,431
Still, among the first-years,
when it comes to ultrasounds,

711
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,932
I've done it the most.

712
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,726
- Right?
- Yes, he's right.

713
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,103
So, please don't worry.

714
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,397
Okay.

715
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,652
Here's the head.

716
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,489
This is the baby's eyes, nose,

717
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,074
and mouth.

718
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,200
Okay…

719
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,827
The baby's kicking.

720
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,538
Soccer's in the cards.

721
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,833
I'll let you hear the heartbeat.

722
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,168
Okay.

723
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,550
The heart's beating strong.

724
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,969
Right.

725
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,603
- Doctor, can we get the oxytocin now?
- Yes, ma'am.

726
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,899
How's the baby?

727
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,734
Yes, the baby's doing fine.

728
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,987
Placenta adhesion's more severe
than expected.

729
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,656
Dr. Oh, this side too.

730
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,157
Yes, sir.

731
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,040
Tell the intervention team from Radiology

732
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,251
and Dr. Ryu
about the situation in advance.

733
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,418
Yes, ma'am.

734
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,795
- Yi-young.
- Yes?

735
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,630
We'll need consent.

736
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,967
Embolization and hysterectomy.
Tell him we may have to do both. Hurry.

737
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,051
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,013
Is the uterine balloon ready?

739
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,515
Yes, it's ready.

740
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,558
BP's dropping.

741
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,434
- More gauze, please.
- Yes.

742
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,729
There are ten fingers and toes.

743
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,022
The baby's breathing well too.

744
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,315
Congratulations.

745
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,692
Congratulations, sir.

746
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,111
We'll take the baby to the newborn unit.

747
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,530
Thank you.

748
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,127
We're removing the placenta,

749
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,045
but severe adhesion's
causing heavy bleeding.

750
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,755
As we said before--

751
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,174
No, not my wife.

752
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,509
No, I don't want to do it. Please.

753
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,345
We'll insert the balloon.
If it doesn't work, we'll do embolization.

754
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,097
If it worsens, we may do a hysterectomy.

755
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,808
We explained this before. Do you remember?

756
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,561
Is it really bad? How bad is it?

757
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,604
There's heavy bleeding.

758
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,607
We don't know what will happen.
That's why I'm telling you.

759
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,483
Then let me go in for a moment.

760
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,610
Let me just see her.

761
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,569
Sir!

762
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,196
There's no time! You must sign.

763
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,365
Hurry.

764
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,496
Thank you.

765
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,587
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
EXIT

766
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,142
It's better now, right?

767
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,268
Yes, Professor.

768
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,020
Sir, how are her vitals?

769
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,314
BP is 100 over 60, pulse is 100.

770
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,566
Do-won, let's insert the balloon now.

771
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,068
- Let's try.
- Yes, ma'am.

772
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,913
We don't know yet,
so don't cancel the embolization

773
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,165
or the call Dr. Ryu!

774
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,250
Yes, ma'am.

775
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,834
Inserting the catheter!

776
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,754
I got it.

777
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,089
Do-won, start ballooning.

778
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,006
Yes, ma'am.

779
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:46,264
INFLATING WITH SALINE
TO APPLY PRESSURE AND STOP BLEEDING

780
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,850
I've administered 50 cc.

781
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,062
I'll administer 50 more.

782
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,397
Do 100 cc more.

783
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
Yes, ma'am.

784
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,319
That's a total of 200 cc.

785
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,572
Pack and secure the catheter now.

786
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,616
Yes, ma'am.

787
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,537
The 1-0 suture, please.

788
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,788
1-0 REFERS TO SUTURE SIZE

789
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,380
- Hold it steady.
- Yes, ma'am.

790
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,259
- Hold it right. It's coming loose!
- Yes, ma'am.

791
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,318
We've stopped the bleeding.

792
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,697
Then is my baby okay?
She's not bleeding anymore?

793
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,742
There were uterine contractions,
so the bleeding has stopped.

794
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,535
Fortunately, we didn't remove the uterus,

795
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,121
the balloon worked as intended,
and surgery went well.

796
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,165
Thank you, Doctor.

797
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,043
Thank you.

798
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,628
Since there was severe placental adhesion,

799
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,922
she had multiple transfusions
for heavy bleeding.

800
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,215
It was very rough on her.

801
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,926
Is everything okay now?

802
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,262
There are no problems, right?

803
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,430
She's fine now.

804
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,891
She may start bleeding again,

805
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,559
so we'll monitor her for an hour.

806
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,728
If nothing happens,
she'll return to her room.

807
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,689
Doctor, thank you so much.

808
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,150
Thank you for saving my baby.

809
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,031
Goodness, you seem to have aged overnight.

810
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,450
Your wife will be shocked
when she sees you.

811
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,412
Well, not as shocked as I was.

812
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,040
Seriously, I thought my heart
would pop out of my chest.

813
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,186
TONIGHT AT 9:30 P.M. AT YOON'S CAFE

814
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,151
How much is left?

815
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,361
What?

816
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,946
You're tossing it
to me in 30 minutes.

817
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,614
I'm working on it.

818
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,871
But didn't he say
he just wanted this by today?

819
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,998
Then we can just send it before midnight.

820
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:18,916
No.

821
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,586
It means he wants to review it today,
so it's due before he leaves.

822
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,340
Dr. Jo usually leaves at 11:00 p.m.,
so it's due before then.

823
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,719
And I need to combine mine with yours,
so we don't have time.

824
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,138
I'm almost done.

825
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,724
Hey, let's just rest for an hour.

826
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,936
I'm just going to go
to Yoon's Cafe out front

827
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,980
and get a coffee.

828
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,273
I had coffee earlier.

829
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,316
I want some. Me.

830
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,610
You said you're almost done.
Just drink it after.

831
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,199
Or,

832
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,493
since I'm done,

833
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,788
you can send it after combining ours
and call Dr. Jo.

834
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,874
No, you said you'd do that.

835
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,793
You've never called him before,
so you don't know,

836
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,462
but he's always cranky on the phone.

837
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,839
- I don't want to call him either.
- Fine!

838
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,092
I'll just do it fast.
I'm doing it right now.

839
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,886
- Do it.
- Okay!

840
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,313
Honey, are you okay?

841
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,027
It must've been so hard.

842
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,489
I missed you so much.

843
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,200
And our little tot's healthy.

844
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,495
She's so beautiful like you.

845
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,501
You'll have some pain from the balloon.

846
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,544
We'll control it with painkillers,

847
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,546
but let us know if it hurts a lot.

848
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,174
We'll remove the balloon in the morning.

849
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,260
And we'll check again
for bleeding after removal.

850
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,178
Okay.

851
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,140
Honey, I'm going to take care of you.

852
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,058
Okay?

853
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,606
Don't worry about anything.

854
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,943
Let's just focus on our second child.

855
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,781
I prayed so hard
for your uterus to not be removed.

856
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,200
We need to have a son.

857
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,036
One daughter and one son.
That was my dream.

858
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,998
Let's rest for two months
and try for a second.

859
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,833
You can do it, my baby.

860
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,213
Excuse me, sir?

861
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,174
Wait…

862
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,944
You f***ing piece of s***.

863
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,697
Have you lost your damn mind?

864
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,783
How can you say that
at a time like this, you son of a b****?

865
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,128
She asked me to deliver that message.

866
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,298
If not, she was going to
leave the hospital.

867
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,092
I mean, but still…

868
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,344
Honey, are you okay?

869
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,762
Are you still out of it?

870
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,071
She wants me to say the rest.

871
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,870
You a**hole!

872
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,917
Dr. Jo said he'd review it
and get back to us.

873
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,294
Aren't you hungry?

874
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,924
We finished sooner than I thought.

875
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,509
It's only 10:30 p.m.

876
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,427
It is?

877
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,971
It's 10:30 p.m.?

878
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,518
What?

879
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,937
He read it.

880
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,106
Gi-dong read it.

881
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,149
Wait, when did he read it?

882
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,818
He hadn't earlier.

883
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,320
It's past 9:30 p.m., right?

884
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,030
Yeah, it's 10:32 p.m.

885
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,490
Oh, no!

886
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,409
What if he left after waiting?

887
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,785
Who? What?

888
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,911
Forget it.

889
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,955
This is all your fault.

890
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,419
What is she talking about?

891
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,899
Did he come? Or did he leave?

892
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,486
Is he mad at me?

893
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,114
HONG GI-DONG

894
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:49,413
YOON'S CAFE

895
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,544
Dr. Myeong's presentation
is tomorrow, right?

896
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,463
- Yes.
- Which first-year is going?

897
00:45:58,964 --> 00:45:59,798
Oh Yi-young.

898
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,051
Do you have plans,

899
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,013
family obligations,
or a pending illness again?

900
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,891
You've never gone to a conference.

901
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,934
You know it's a requirement
for residency, right?

902
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,894
When will you go?

903
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,729
I'll go next time.

904
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,189
Go to this one. That's an order.

905
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,107
You're going, right?

906
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,025
Sorry?

907
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,776
The second author should be there.

908
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,819
It's a happy day.

909
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,364
Okay. I'll go with Dr. Oh.

910
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,282
Good.

911
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,367
You both worked hard. Have some good food.

912
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,077
Have a drink too!

913
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:29,995
Yes, ma'am.

914
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,630
We've removed the balloon and kept watch.

915
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,257
There is no bleeding at all.
It's great news.

916
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,384
Yes, thank you.

917
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,095
But where's your husband today?

918
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,433
He's very popular in this ward.

919
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,685
Everyone's so jealous of you.

920
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,521
They all wish to be in your shoes.

921
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,025
Everyone said, "He's so sweet."

922
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,694
So I thought "So Sweet" was his name.

923
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,617
I couldn't stand the sight of him
and sent him home.

924
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,285
He won't be coming for a while.

925
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,871
What? Why?

926
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,624
Such caring husbands like him
are hard to come by.

927
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,044
Is he too clingy?
Too outwardly expressive?

928
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,295
And you don't like that.

929
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,630
Gosh.

930
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,548
- Still--
- Professor?

931
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,634
Ms. Han in Room 6107 is waiting.

932
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,554
She believes your words
like the gospel itself.

933
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,222
I'm sure she's been waiting since dawn.

934
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,306
We should get going.

935
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,392
Right, she must've waited
a long time for me.

936
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,393
Let's go.

937
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,310
Goodbye!

938
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,743
This is Um Jae-il from OB-GYN.

939
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,330
Today's…

940
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,001
It's Saturday, so I'm resting.

941
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,088
A patient's asking for you.
I called to see if you were available.

942
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,882
Ma'am.

943
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,802
I'm going to say no just for today.

944
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,722
- Just once.
<i>- Okay.</i>

945
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,599
I'll call Dr. Oh instead.

946
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:14,516
Get some rest.

947
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,019
Wait.

948
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:17,936
But…

949
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,605
She's asking for me?

950
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,316
Someone's asking for me?

951
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,741
Were there any unique symptoms
yesterday or today?

952
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,826
No.

953
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,165
Today's my scheduled
outpatient appointment.

954
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,167
I didn't just come.

955
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,044
I know.

956
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,423
Please be thorough like last time, Doctor.

957
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,884
Yes, I'll do my best.

958
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,222
The baby's heartbeat is strong.

959
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,807
It's moving well too.

960
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,144
The amniotic fluid level is also normal.

961
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,563
And…

962
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,156
What is it?

963
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,034
Is something wrong?

964
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,870
- Ms. Tae-rim?
- Yes?

965
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,246
Please alert the professor.

966
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:19,706
What?

967
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,667
I'm not sure.

968
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,502
But I see something like a blood vessel.

969
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,213
Please tell her she needs to see it.

970
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,465
Okay.

971
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,352
This isn't something easy to find.

972
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,066
Jae-il, this is a uterine rupture.

973
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,193
That's…

974
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,904
Ms. Moon.

975
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,824
We're looking at the umbilical cord now.

976
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,741
Okay.

977
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,702
Along with the amniotic sac,

978
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,037
the cord is slightly protruding

979
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,706
outside the uterine wall.

980
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,625
Luckily, the amniotic sac hasn't ruptured.

981
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,585
What does that mean?

982
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,880
I think it would be best
to deliver the baby via surgery.

983
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:09,881
What?

984
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,383
Should I prep the OR?

985
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,176
Yeah. Someone should be wrapping up.

986
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,178
Okay.

987
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,348
While we prep for surgery,

988
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,351
you'll stay in the delivery room,
so we'll transfer you soon.

989
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
Don't be alarmed.

990
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,774
The baby's not in danger, right?

991
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,152
Everything's fine. Right, Professor?

992
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,988
We're doing the surgery
so the baby will be fine.

993
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,991
Don't you worry.

994
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,452
You can put your trust in me.

995
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:50,881
Yes, Professor?

996
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,008
What?

997
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,510
There's no way any data's missing.

998
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,221
Nam-kyung did that part.

999
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,726
We should have checked one last time.

1000
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,643
I'm sorry.

1001
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,146
We'll fix it and send it back…

1002
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,029
Geez, Nam-kyung.

1003
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,824
Eat up.

1004
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,075
Hello.

1005
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,335
What is it now?

1006
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,378
Dr. Ku.

1007
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,756
I've never fought with anyone in my life.

1008
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,967
But that's all I'm doing these days.

1009
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:37,719
With who?

1010
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,890
I don't think I should reveal who it is.

1011
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,894
Not talking about people behind their back
is my work life rule.

1012
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,647
All right.

1013
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,232
What's the issue?

1014
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,691
I just don't get them.

1015
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,652
What they say and how they act and think.

1016
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,488
Trying to talk to understand them
just makes things worse.

1017
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,782
I have no idea what to do.

1018
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,700
Want me to tell you?

1019
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,372
Don't try to understand.

1020
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,792
Just accept that's how they are. Okay?

1021
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,587
Taking issue with everything
to understand them won't change anything.

1022
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,049
You can leave someone behind,
but you can't fix them.

1023
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,678
Wasting your energy and time
on something that won't ever improve

1024
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,305
is only a loss for you in the end,
so why do it?

1025
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,563
Still, I think I need to
talk it over with them.

1026
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,483
Whether I can fix them or not
is not my problem.

1027
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,652
I have to speak my mind.

1028
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,155
I was the one negatively affected.
Why should I tolerate it too?

1029
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,032
I can't do that.

1030
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,709
The baby is fine.

1031
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,711
At 2.3 kilograms,

1032
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,504
she's small for the gestational age.

1033
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,883
But her heart rate,
breathing, and movement

1034
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,842
are all good.

1035
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,513
I've done so many ultrasounds.

1036
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,474
Well…

1037
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,978
I've reviewed all
the previous ultrasounds,

1038
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,688
and there were no issues.

1039
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,691
Even if you get an ultrasound daily,

1040
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,277
this is something that can come up

1041
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,738
at any time in between.

1042
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,157
I don't mean that.

1043
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:27,245
I've done so many ultrasounds.

1044
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,706
I'd say I was in pain

1045
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,208
and lie every time.

1046
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:38,131
When I'd read online
about bad things happening to babies,

1047
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,843
it felt like I was getting
those same symptoms.

1048
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:46,097
And I'd suddenly start
to feel pain that wasn't there.

1049
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,266
I know it wasn't true.

1050
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,768
But if I didn't get it checked,

1051
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,396
I kept thinking bad thoughts.

1052
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,106
I'm sorry.

1053
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,736
I know you all had a hard time
because of me.

1054
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,363
I apologize.

1055
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,572
It's all right.

1056
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,157
It's completely understandable.

1057
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,285
More so
because it was your first pregnancy.

1058
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,870
This all happened

1059
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,331
because of me.

1060
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,000
I even made my baby feel anxious,

1061
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,378
so something bad happened inside.

1062
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,172
As I told you, that's not the case.

1063
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,133
The baby is healthy. Please don't worry.

1064
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,430
Our baby was born a week early.

1065
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,933
Is it really okay?

1066
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:30,892
Yes.

1067
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,229
The baby didn't go
to the neonatal intensive care unit.

1068
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,814
It's in the nursery.

1069
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,357
I read that if they're born early,

1070
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,068
they'll develop problems with their lungs.

1071
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,196
Is that likely?

1072
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,323
The baby's lungs have fully matured.

1073
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,076
And we've run all the checks.

1074
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,869
There's nothing to worry about.

1075
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,205
You said she's a bit small.

1076
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,207
It's not enough to raise concern.

1077
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,001
She's fine.

1078
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,669
Then…

1079
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,008
Can I finally relax now?

1080
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,596
Now that my baby's born healthy,

1081
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,308
can I live without worrying anymore?

1082
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,729
No, you can't.

1083
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,193
You must've thought the birth was the end.

1084
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,611
It's only the beginning.

1085
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,994
My mother turned 70 this year.

1086
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,372
She still calls every morning
out of concern.

1087
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,293
"Cold water in the morning
will hurt your stomach."

1088
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,587
"You'll get into an accident
if you drive at night."

1089
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,798
"Don't go out when it rains."

1090
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,594
I thought my mom was such a fussy person.

1091
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,431
But I'm doing the same thing
to my daughter.

1092
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,478
She's in middle school now.

1093
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,730
Yesterday, she told me her ankle was sore.

1094
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,524
When I heard that, I thought,

1095
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,359
"Is it an issue with her muscular tissue?"

1096
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,611
"Is it her bone?"

1097
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,490
I was so worried, it kept me up at night.

1098
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,493
But this morning,
she rode her bike to school and was fine.

1099
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,873
There are more things
to worry about after the birth.

1100
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,835
So don't hope
that your worries will disappear.

1101
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,340
That's much better
for a mother's mental health.

1102
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,011
Think of it as the price you pay
for the happiness

1103
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,513
that children bring.

1104
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,431
What else can you do?

1105
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,975
Still, the good thing is

1106
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,979
that most of the things
I worry about never happen.

1107
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,651
Trust me.

1108
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,904
I will. Thank you.

1109
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,743
Honey, I brought it.

1110
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,540
Where did that doctor go?

1111
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,251
The one who read my ultrasound?

1112
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,545
He's the best ultrasound reader

1113
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,005
in this hospital.

1114
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,511
Where did he go?

1115
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,559
Dr. Um?

1116
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,438
- Hello!
- Nice seeing you here.

1117
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,273
How's tennis?

1118
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,108
I haven't been able to go for three weeks.

1119
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,652
Me neither. I've been so busy these days.

1120
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,736
Right?

1121
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,905
First-years don't have time for hobbies.

1122
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,657
They can barely eat and sleep.

1123
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,242
I've been there. I know.

1124
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,869
You're working so hard.

1125
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,122
But what brings you here?

1126
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,166
A baby needed a CS consult.

1127
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,167
You?

1128
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,835
A mother was worried about her baby.

1129
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,880
I came to take a photo to show her.

1130
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,299
But they're so cute I can't leave.

1131
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,971
I've known this one since the ultrasounds.

1132
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,390
And its umbilical cord
was the first one I ever cut.

1133
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,229
Oh, right. About ten minutes after birth,

1134
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,565
the baby's oxygen saturation was only 90%.

1135
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,649
Is that okay?

1136
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,859
That's normal.

1137
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,527
That's a relief.

1138
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,448
Don't you know oxygen saturation
changes by the minute after birth?

1139
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,534
Even 85% is normal after ten minutes.

1140
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,039
We learn this in med school.
Did you forget all that?

1141
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:22,790
Yes.

1142
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,918
That won't do, Dr. Um.

1143
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,503
Sir?

1144
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,338
All right, then.

1145
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,632
A baby that was doing fine

1146
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,468
suddenly turns blue
without any other symptoms.

1147
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,719
What do you do?

1148
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,600
No.

1149
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,728
Check the oxygen saturation of the limbs.

1150
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,980
Right.

1151
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:46,898
I got it, sir.

1152
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,359
Then, if a baby that was fine

1153
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,860
suddenly shows cyanosis,

1154
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,320
what tests should be done?

1155
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,744
An echocardiogram. Right?

1156
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,497
You have to check
for a congenital heart defect.

1157
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,500
Right.

1158
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,210
I'm sorry.

1159
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,631
My bad.

1160
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,634
We don't have any first-years in CS.

1161
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,845
I've always wanted
to quiz my juniors like this.

1162
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,308
But where's your baby?

1163
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,812
The smallest one at the end there.

1164
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,274
She's the shortest

1165
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,025
and weighs the least.

1166
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,777
She's in last place here.

1167
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,157
Who cares if she is?

1168
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,286
That doesn't matter right now.

1169
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,788
She can be in first place when she leaves.

1170
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,335
It's the first day of her life.

1171
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,713
She's only getting started.

1172
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,892
They said pain can persist
for a week after the egg retrieval.

1173
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,440
I'm fine.
There was no fluid buildup this time.

1174
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,032
If the hospital calls, I'll tell you.

1175
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,060
FERTILITY CENTER

1176
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,396
Hello, Doctor.

1177
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,275
How did it go? How many are there?

1178
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,654
<i>The day after egg retrieval,</i>
<i>two eggs were fertilized,</i>

1179
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,863
<i>and as we explained before,</i>

1180
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,741
<i>they were cultured</i>
<i>for a five-day embryo transfer…</i>

1181
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,995
<i>But both embryos</i>
<i>weren't in good condition,</i>

1182
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,497
<i>and it was unsuccessful.</i>

1183
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,582
<i>I'm sure you must be disappointed,</i>

1184
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,586
<i>but embryo transfer</i>
<i>won't be possible this time.</i>

1185
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,258
Excuse me.

1186
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,750
<i>Did you wait long? Are you mad?</i>

1187
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,670
<i>Please pick up.</i>

1188
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,921
<i>Hey!</i>

1189
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,383
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1190
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,396
What now?

1191
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,442
Let's do it tomorrow, okay?

1192
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,860
What?

1193
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,153
Whatever you're going to say,

1194
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,322
I'm not in the mood to talk or fight.

1195
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,116
It's something I have to tell you.

1196
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,160
Fine.

1197
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,120
You just have to say
what you want, don't you?

1198
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:32,707
The professor saw the data we organized
and gave us feedback.

1199
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,625
You omitted about ten people.

1200
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,253
So I added all of them and sent it back.

1201
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,631
Fine. I wasn't fully focused.

1202
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,675
Okay? Thanks.

1203
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,676
Happy?

1204
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,265
This next one's
about the ward out patient.

1205
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,310
If they arrive at 6:30 p.m.,
it's right that you do it.

1206
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:54,937
But…

1207
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,441
I had no idea the professor
would get so angry about that.

1208
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,735
Rather than arguing,

1209
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,737
if I had gone to the patient
and explained,

1210
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,363
you wouldn't have been yelled at.

1211
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,452
I'm sorry about that.

1212
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,246
What?

1213
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,291
What's with you all of a sudden?

1214
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,043
Just go back to how you normally are.

1215
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,504
The facts need to be clearly pointed out.

1216
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,757
Whose fault it is
and who should apologize.

1217
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,010
It's a principle of mine.

1218
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,390
I've said my piece.

1219
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,728
Well, I'm…

1220
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:39,482
sorry too.

1221
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,110
What I said about you to Ms. Yeom,

1222
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,656
about how inflexible you are
and how we're incompatible,

1223
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,200
I didn't mean to talk behind your back.

1224
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,868
I was just venting.

1225
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,788
And as I kept going, I exaggerated a bit.

1226
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,667
I'm sorry.

1227
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,005
I'm done now too.

1228
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,887
So we're all good now, okay?

1229
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,727
That was about me?

1230
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,271
What?

1231
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,147
Not Yi-young?

1232
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,441
It was me?

1233
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,609
What?

1234
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,445
You know,

1235
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,864
talking about another doctor

1236
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,283
in a personal conversation
with a patient is rude.

1237
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:35,413
And I can't accept the fact
you think I'm inflexible.

1238
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,790
- Why? When? Doing what?
- Sa-bi, eat some squid.

1239
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,542
What were the circumstances?

1240
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,419
- I got a call. Hello?
- When was I inflexible?

1241
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,920
Your phone's upside down.

1242
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,171
- Say something.
- Hello?

1243
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,214
- Hang up.
- Wait.

1244
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,757
- Hang up now.
- Wait, I have to go.

1245
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,800
I'm talking to you.

1246
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:49,802
The best presentation award

1247
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,555
goes to Dr. Myeong Eun-won
of Jongno Yulje Medical Center.

1248
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,098
To Myeong Eun-won,

1249
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,934
for researching the feasibility
of cervical elastography

1250
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,270
in prediction of preterm delivery

1251
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,981
in pregnancies with short cervixes
after progesterone treatment,

1252
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,816
we present you
this best presentation award.

1253
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,484
Congratulations.

1254
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,582
Congratulations.

1255
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,918
KOREAN SOCIETY OF MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE
29TH CONFERENCE

1256
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,607
Dr. Ku, just a moment.

1257
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,193
It's not much.

1258
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,528
I think you should take this.

1259
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,863
No, it's all right.

1260
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,366
I want you to have it.

1261
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,117
No, it's really okay.

1262
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,746
It's just…

1263
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,624
I was wondering if you're upset with me.

1264
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,834
You haven't said much
since we talked on the phone.

1265
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,963
You don't mistakenly think
I stole the paper, do you?

1266
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,923
I know you're not like that,
but just in case…

1267
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,843
If the professors heard
any strange rumors,

1268
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,054
it would be embarrassing for us both.

1269
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,060
You don't have to worry about that.

1270
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,853
Thanks, Dr. Ku.

1271
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,939
I'm really reflecting on myself.

1272
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,566
It really was my mistake
for forgetting and not telling you.

1273
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,527
A mistake?

1274
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,945
Yeah, mistake.

1275
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,863
I really forgot.

1276
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,158
I'm not sure
what's wrong with me these days.

1277
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,327
I get you must be very upset.

1278
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,620
I would be too.

1279
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,706
Next time, this won't ever happen again.

1280
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,165
I promise.

1281
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,418
If you're upset, let it go.

1282
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,753
Yeah, if you write a paper next time,

1283
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,338
I'll help you out.

1284
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:51,924
Really.

1285
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,218
All right.

1286
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,137
I should get going.

1287
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,723
Hello.

1288
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,516
Dr. Oh.

1289
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,396
So…

1290
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,524
I wasn't trying to,

1291
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,194
but I've overheard you twice now.

1292
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,448
It just happened.

1293
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,911
But you never apologized.

1294
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:22,955
What?

1295
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,462
You didn't apologize.

1296
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,012
I didn't?

1297
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:38,929
No.

1298
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,312
I'm sorry, Dr. Ku.

1299
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,316
Sorry.

1300
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,572
I should go.

1301
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,335
Let's go home.

1302
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,525
Why did you say that?

1303
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,151
I don't need an apology.

1304
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,736
But I do.

1305
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,700
I finally feel better now.

1306
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:48,332
I'm just worried you'll have
a target on your back now.

1307
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,543
Your life at the hospital going forward

1308
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,669
won't be easy.

1309
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,754
It's fine. I'll just quit.

1310
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:54,755
What?

1311
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,592
Dr. Ku, aren't you angry?
Aren't you pissed?

1312
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,302
Are you some kind of saint?

1313
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,470
I'm a pushover.

1314
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,013
Do-won the Pushover.

1315
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:04,765
Have you forgotten?

1316
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,017
What are you talking about?

1317
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,314
Damn it.
Just thinking about it makes me mad.

1318
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,528
You f***ing piece of s***.

1319
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,447
Have you lost your damn mind?

1320
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,450
How dare you open your yap
and say that, you son of a b****?

1321
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,708
Did you memorize that?

1322
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:31,959
It was easy to remember.

1323
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,336
You're good. You have a knack for it.

1324
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,338
As soon as I heard it,
it rolled off the tongue.

1325
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,841
I must have a knack for swearing.

1326
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,515
I thought you liked me.

1327
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,184
I guess not anymore?

1328
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,105
I mean, who talks like that
in front of someone they like?

1329
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,569
I guess you don't like me anymore.

1330
01:09:58,652 --> 01:09:59,653
That's not true.

1331
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,365
I still like you.

1332
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:10,372
I'm someone who still curses
in front of people I like.

1333
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,045
I guess I'm a lunatic.

1334
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,179
Then can you say that again?

1335
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:30,184
Really?

1336
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,782
Can I like you?

1337
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,338
No, not that.

1338
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,474
Like, "Piece of crap." That stuff?

1339
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:23,070
Listen carefully. I'm only saying it once.

1340
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:23,988
Okay.

1341
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,951
You f***ing piece of s***.

1342
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,787
You've lost your damn mind!

1343
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,999
How dare you open your yap
and say that, you son of a b****?

1344
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,548
That damn bastard.

1345
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,926
What a load of crap.

1346
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,136
She didn't say that.

1347
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,387
I added that one.

1348
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:08,092
THANKS TO OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
BAE HYEON-SEONG, OUR ETERNAL JANG HONG-DO

1349
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:11,387
RESIDENT PLAYBOOK

1350
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,597
<i>You're already preparing</i>
<i>to recruit interns?</i>

1351
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,849
<i>Our current first-years</i>
<i>didn't turn out well at all.</i>

1352
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,810
They're all a bit unwell.

1353
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,396
Are you laughing? You think it's funny?

1354
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,400
I mean, how many times are you going
to call Anesthesiology today?

1355
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,652
I know, but please, just this once.

1356
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,778
- She's here.
- She's here.

1357
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,030
<i>You said it wasn't coming today.</i>

1358
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,658
If they're duds next year too,
we're all screwed.

1359
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,661
<i>You go on leave tomorrow. Right, Dr. Ku?</i>

1360
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,454
Don't call me and ask, "Where are you?"

1361
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,497
Especially you, Jae-il.

1362
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,416
You're gone for three days,
not three months.

1363
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,542
Don't you worry.

1364
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,626
<i>Bye.</i>

1365
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:46,088
<i>Anytime we ask something,</i>
<i>they say to ask the chief resident.</i>

1366
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,257
<i>How many times can we say</i>
<i>Ku Do-won's not here?</i>

1367
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,802
- Geez, OB!
- Why is he mad?

1368
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,179
It's to tell you no.

1369
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,931
Then should we not call you?

1370
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,933
<i>They think we're fools,</i>
<i>because we hold back.</i>

1371
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,936
Right, being patient three times
is too much.

1372
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,521
<i>You'll just go mad.</i>

1373
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,439
<i>No!</i>

1374
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,400
Does your stomach hurt?

1375
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,485
They're in emergency surgery.
What do we do?

1376
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,039
