1
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,280
Ninety-nine prince concubine

2
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:57,841
Slave Su Jin

3
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,441
The wind in the Ninth Prince's Mansion is a little strong

4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,921
Music Su's bun was blown up by the wind

5
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,840
Jiu Ge

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,241
This is the head of the twenty-four squares

7
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,441
Su Leshi

8
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,040
I specifically invited her

9
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:48,680
Playing at Brother Nine's celebration party tomorrow

10
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,281
Brother Jiu is still satisfied

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,001
The person the royal sister is looking for

12
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,161
This king is naturally satisfied

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,840
This was the year

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
The Ninth Emperor's Sister-in-Law gave me the hairpin

15
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,881
Music Su is wearing

16
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,361
It's just right

17
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,361
Brother Nine, what do you think

18
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,720
Jiu Ge

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,321
Su Music was born to be unable to see

20
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,840
Why don't you bother Brother Jiu to look after me more?

21
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,560
I won't disturb Music Su's piano practice today

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Tomorrow's Banquet

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
Let's listen to Music Su play again

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,361
You said you were a blind girl

25
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,880
Then you know how you look

26
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,481
The slave was born blind

27
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,201
Never seen

28
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,361
Just a skin

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,081
Floating Life Vientiane

30
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:02,921
Slave and maid-servant

31
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:04,481
View the world with your heart

32
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,481
Good

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,521
Then look at me

34
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,241
What did you see

35
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:19,400
Inside and outside

36
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,081
Different

37
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,921
Duplicity

38
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,081
What do you mean

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,120
Your Highness

40
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,641
You're afraid

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,201
Joke

42
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,321
On the battlefield

43
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,041
I'm never afraid of the mountain of corpses and the sea of blood

44
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,880
Are you afraid of a little blind girl

45
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:51,801
Your Highness is afraid

46
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,361
This servant discovered that His Highness's heart

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
Sadness

48
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,761
And expectation

49
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:05,201
The sound of the piano bewitches

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,641
Be eloquent

51
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,601
Who on earth are you

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Ask Princess Chaoyu to bring you into the Ninth Prince's Mansion

53
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,160
What are you trying to do

54
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:17,720
Slave and maid-servant

55
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,560
Musician Su Jin

56
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,560
Playing for His Highness

57
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:25,640
To tell the

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,921
Slave and maid-servant

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
Your Royal Highness

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,041
Adore me

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,560
Do you know the people who love me

62
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,041
Less than seven days into the mansion

63
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,721
Were they all carried out

64
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,241
The slaves and them

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,961
Different

66
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:53,801
What's the difference

67
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,361
The servant can feel it

68
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,120
Your Highness's inner sorrow

69
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,000
Slave and maid-servant

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,721
Want to accompany Your Highness

71
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,281
Don't play any more tricks with me

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Otherwise

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll make you survive

74
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,721
I can't beg death

75
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,041
Three years ago

76
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,120
Daddy and sister died unjustly

77
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,520
I want to get justice for them

78
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,401
Be careful

79
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,080
Slave white peony

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,361
Your Highness sent me to serve you

81
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,721
Your Highness is suspicious by nature

82
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
The girl is in the mansion

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,921
Be cautious

84
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,440
In particular

85
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,721
Don't break Your Highness's taboo

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
What is your Highness's taboo

87
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,161
It's the ninth prince's concubine

88
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,401
Su Fengyu

89
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:16,200
Your Highness has a love-hate relationship with the Ninth Prince and Concubine

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,481
But I just won't let anyone mention it

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,161
The residence of the Ninth Prince Concubine

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
It is also a forbidden area in the mansion

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,801
The residence of the Ninth Prince Concubine

94
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,401
Where is it

95
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,560
There

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,801
Just behind the garden

97
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,401
Girl

98
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,120
I am sorry

99
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,401
Su Leshi

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Forget you can't see

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,760
The residence of the Ninth Prince Concubine

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,640
Just northwest of the mansion

103
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,921
Next time you can go around

104
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,120
What's wrong

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
My bracelet is missing

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Bracelet

107
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,640
It's a relic from my mother

108
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:02,120
Can you help me look for it

109
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,361
But I

110
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,361
Don't worry

111
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,401
I'll just stay here

112
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm not going anywhere

113
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
This thing for me

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,401
It's really, really important

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,680
That

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,921
I beg you to help me find it

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,520
And you

118
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,721
Stay where you are

119
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:16,841
I'll go find it for you

120
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:17,640
Is it okay

121
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,080
Three years ago

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,241
A pregnant sister

123
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,361
Being rumored to have an affair

124
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:32,880
Dead inexplicably

125
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,640
The whole Su family was slaughtered

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,801
I'm going to find out the truth

127
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:38,721
Perhaps

128
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Can find clues in her place

129
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,440
Who sent you

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
Come to the Ninth Prince's residence

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you trying to investigate what

132
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,401
Does anyone

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
The room is locked

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,201
I have to find a way to get the keys

135
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:10,201
Su Leshi

136
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,160
I would like to thank Your Highness for your rescue

137
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
This is not the place for you to be

138
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,441
The servant was just walking in the garden

139
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,561
Somehow

140
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:29,721
Just walked here

141
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:31,841
Where is this

142
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,201
If this king knows again

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,841
You came where you shouldn't be

144
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,280
Rather kill the wrong one

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,160
Don't let go

146
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,520
Whether you intend or unintend

147
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,441
This king will

148
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
To kill you

149
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:09,841
I'll walk you out

150
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,640
Ah Yu has no sisters

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,081
But she looks like A Yu

152
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,000
So similar

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,441
Who the hell is she

154
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,120
Your Highness

155
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,081
What are you doing here

156
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,201
The princess said

157
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,321
Let the servant serve Your Highness

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,201
I don't need anyone to serve me

159
00:10:59,081 --> 00:10:59,920
Get out

160
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:03,120
The slave can't see

161
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,920
Your Highness doesn't have to care

162
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,400
Your Highness

163
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,601
To serve

164
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,721
Just wait well

165
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,361
Your Highness

166
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,561
Don't you want to serve me

167
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:00,400
This servant wants to know what Your Highness looks like

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,681
Although the servant can't see it

169
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,120
But the servant can feel it

170
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,880
Your Highness, you are very good-looking

171
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,280
His Highness's Heart

172
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:26,681
Talking

173
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,520
Then listen to it

174
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,961
What is he talking about

175
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:36,481
He's saying

176
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,640
Although Your Highness is fierce and ruthless

177
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,920
But he is the gentlest and most kind person

178
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,800
You are the world

179
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,841
The gentlest and most kind person

180
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Mother and Chaoyu really bothered

181
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
I found someone with Ah Yu

182
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Someone who looks like this is next to me

183
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,681
It's just a pity

184
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,961
You're not her

185
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Roll

186
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,880
But the slave's clothes were wet

187
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:34,000
Then you can bathe in it

188
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,160
This king

189
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,361
Will send someone to send a set

190
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:37,561
Clean clothes for you

191
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:47,640
Doesn't Your Highness shy away

192
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,081
Come and wait on the bath

193
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,800
Take me away again

194
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,561
What are you trying to do

195
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,321
You can't see
