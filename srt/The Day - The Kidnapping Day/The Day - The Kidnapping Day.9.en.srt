THE KIDNAPPING DAY

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,663
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

3
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,029
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,573
THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED
BY THE COMMUNICATIONS

5
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,027
DEVELOPMENT FUND
OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND ICT

6
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,739
Stay healthy, Myeong-jun.

7
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,940
And be a good boy to your dad.

8
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,362
I'll always pray for you.

9
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,165
Okay.

10
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,491
Thank you, Sister.

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,743
Say your goodbyes.

12
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,880
I'll see you again.

13
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,580
-Stay well.
-Thanks.

14
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,510
-You have to be happy, okay?
-You too.

15
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,835
Goodbye.

16
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,343
Come on.

17
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,345
Your dad is waiting.

18
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,847
Okay.

19
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,860
-Goodbye, Myeong-jun.
-Bye.

20
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,946
-Bye!
-Bye!

21
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,697
Have a good life!

22
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,773
-Goodbye, Myeong-jun.
-Stay healthy.

23
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,326
Bye!

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,620
-Bye!
-Bye, Myeong-jun!

25
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,571
Bye, Myeong-jun!

26
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,993
-Myeong-jun!
-Bye, Myeong-jun!

27
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,404
Who are you?

28
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,573
Since when were you hiding in there?

29
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:11,960
What?

30
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,243
Hye-eun!

31
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,253
What's going on?

32
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,182
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,341
I...

34
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,553
Are you Myeong-jun?

35
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,013
Yes.

36
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,433
Then who are you?

37
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,063
Hello, I'm Seo Hye-eun.

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,608
I asked for a boy.

39
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,986
What happened?

40
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,366
She hid herself in the trunk.

41
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,837
Please don't send me back.

42
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,882
You don't have to adopt me.
I'll be your servant if I have to.

43
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm good at running errands,

44
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,510
carrying heavy things, and doing laundry.

45
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,638
I learned how to cook
at the orphanage too!

46
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,921
Quiet.

47
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,719
They must be hungry.

48
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,055
Let's have them eat first.

49
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,390
Yes, sir.

50
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,268
Get up.

51
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,537
Myeong-jun, think carefully.

52
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,956
Who do you think needs a dad between us?

53
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,960
I have trouble digesting food
and get sick very often.

54
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,839
See this? I also have eczema,

55
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,967
so I need someone to look after me.

56
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,728
But you're healthy,

57
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,730
digest food very well, and athletic.

58
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,139
I'm glad.

59
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,559
-About what?
-I was worried earlier

60
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,602
because you weren't there
when I said goodbye to everyone.

61
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,492
I thought you were getting scolded
by one of the sisters

62
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,119
because we played with a towel.

63
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,537
See?

64
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,539
When both of us cause trouble,

65
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,865
I get scolded, but not you.

66
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,994
I'll never be loved
if I'm not adopted, okay?

67
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,246
Then what should we do?

68
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,595
Dr. Choi wants to see you two
after you finish eating.

69
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,046
-Okay.
-Okay.

70
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,476
I have no reason to adopt two children.

71
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,822
My initial decision was Myeong-jun,

72
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,398
so I'll adopt him.

73
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,027
However,

74
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,238
it seems like
you're quite desperate, Hye-eun.

75
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,825
I'll choose one of you...

76
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,994
using my own method.

77
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,336
STANDARD INTELLIGENCE TEST

78
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,262
You've done this at school before, right?

79
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,848
It's an IQ test.

80
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,143
Whoever scores higher

81
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,270
will live with me.

82
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,490
Understood?

83
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,449
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,607
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,110
All right, then.

86
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,947
Try your best and solve the questions.

87
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,343
That was nerve-racking.

88
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,963
STANDARD INTELLIGENCE TEST

89
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,265
CHAPTER 9. THE GIRL

90
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,433
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

91
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,301
Welcome back.

92
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,724
Two days after Kim Myeong-jun
was selected as the experimental subject,

93
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,893
the subject changed to Seo Hye-eun.

94
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,782
The kid who was a candidate
of the experimental subject grew up

95
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,442
and kidnapped
the complete product of the experiment,

96
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,778
as he understands the value of it
more than anyone else.

97
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:03,334
Are you saying
Kim Myeong-jun intentionally kidnapped

98
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,243
and murdered Choi Ro-hee?

99
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,629
That's what the record says.

100
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,530
THE GENIUS CHILD PROJECT NO.2
NAME: SEO HYE-EUN

101
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,885
Don't tell me you still trust him
after he deceived you.

102
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,970
So he killed the man
who knew the value of Ro-hee

103
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,671
and the only person
he could negotiate with?

104
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,964
I know, right?

105
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,312
If he was just going to kidnap her,
then there's no reason to murder Dr. Choi.

106
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,595
Right.

107
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,150
But if you look at how uncanny
the body was,

108
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,309
it feels like he killed him
in the heat of the moment.

109
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,529
If the murder was premeditated,

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,605
he would've died like So Jin-yu.

111
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,408
In other words,

112
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,943
Park Cheol-won's statement
is quite convincing.

113
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,533
The kidnapper is Kim Myeong-jun,
and the murderer is Park Cheol-won.

114
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,255
Isn't it strange that Seo Hye-eun
is irrelevant to this case

115
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,873
when she knows both of these men?

116
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,000
You have a point.

117
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,796
But she has a solid alibi
on the day of the incident,

118
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,140
and we have no evidence.

119
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,216
And we can't request
a search warrant either.

120
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,345
How about you do a cross-examination?

121
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,600
Set up a meeting
between Park Cheol-won and Seo Hye-eun.

122
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,867
CHOI JIN-TAE'S HOUSE CCTV

123
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,796
Choi Jin-tae?

124
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,230
Hee-ae.

125
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,942
I'm in the recovery room.
She hasn't woken up yet.

126
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,113
Thank you for being so strong, my baby.

127
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,628
Hurry up and come.

128
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,538
You should be here when she wakes up.

129
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,749
You know the cops are here too, right?

130
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,293
If you turn yourself in
and be cooperative,

131
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,847
the cops will find Ro-hee.

132
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,498
CHOI JIN-TAE'S HOUSE CCTV

133
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,386
Why aren't you answering me?

134
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,599
Kim Myeong-jun.

135
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,186
Myeong-jun, what are you looking at?

136
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,868
Show me Hee-ae.

137
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,485
Come see her yourself.

138
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,362
Show me Hee-ae.

139
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,585
Come and see her.

140
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,093
I need to check something.

141
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,849
Kim Myeong...

142
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,903
I need to check something.

143
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,159
What was that about?

144
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,455
Come on in.

145
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,761
Dr. Mo, I know it's before working hours,

146
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,554
but you have a guest.

147
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,088
What? Who?

148
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,804
Gosh, what a nice hospital.

149
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,223
You may leave.

150
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,779
Can I ask you where you're standing?

151
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,949
What do you mean?

152
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,744
Whether you're on our side or not.

153
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,039
I can't tell
which side of the court you're on.

154
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,083
It doesn't matter.

155
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,711
I'm not interested in either side's goals.

156
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,089
How's Byeol doing?

157
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,622
Ah.

158
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,010
Are you threatening me?

159
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,847
Don't pressure me by mentioning her name.

160
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,025
I won't stand back.

161
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,517
All right.

162
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,686
Calm down.

163
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,609
I'm here to get your help,
not to threaten you.

164
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,204
Ah.

165
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,078
Here.

166
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,216
This is it.

167
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,793
Five times your initial investment,
ten billion won.

168
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:06,795
It's in cryptocurrency.

169
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,550
You have my deepest gratitude
for your investment.

170
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,680
Take it back.

171
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,151
Is this not enough?

172
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,228
You can have this money.

173
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,480
However,

174
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,775
if you exclude Byeol from this project,

175
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,946
I'll see to it that you and X Capital
will be brought down.

176
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,491
So don't you dare
try to play games with money.

177
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,213
You'll regret this.

178
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,163
Ro-hee won't be in Korea soon.

179
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,707
What do you mean?

180
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,670
Where are you taking her?

181
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,676
You shouldn't get emotional
when there are lethal weapons everywhere.

182
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,057
Let me know if you change your mind.

183
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,105
I can't give you much time.

184
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,041
I'm a foreigner,
so how will my insurance work?

185
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,658
Give me a moment, sir.

186
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,797
I'm here to see Dr. Mo Eun-sun.

187
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,582
She'll know if you mention the name
Detective Park Sang-yun.

188
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,792
-Okay. Hold on.
-Okay.

189
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:32,213
Dr. Mo, we have Detective Park Sang-yun
here to see you.

190
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,766
I see. Okay.

191
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,968
And what should we do with Mr. Jaden?

192
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,596
Okay, understood.

193
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,473
Dr. Mo says you can just leave.

194
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,518
I love Korea and its hospitality.

195
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Bravo.

196
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,106
-This way.
-Okay.

197
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,992
A detective?

198
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,380
Hey, Dr. Mo rejected the offer.

199
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,550
Let's take care of it before we leave.

200
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,606
Please come in.

201
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,694
It's been a while.

202
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,155
I've been keeping up with the news.

203
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,532
You have your hands full.

204
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,826
I'm here to confirm something.

205
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,121
I'll confirm it for you
if it's something I know.

206
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,926
It's about the two billion won
you invested in Dr. Choi Jin-tae.

207
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,929
I'll let you know about that
through my attorney.

208
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,421
The Genius Child Project.

209
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,842
What are you talking about?

210
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,262
I've seen the recent reviews
of your hospital, and apparently,

211
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,765
you weren't accepting patients
for a few days without prior notice.

212
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:10,061
Do I have to share
my personal schedule as well?

213
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,814
If it's related to this case, then yes.

214
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,662
I want to know the connection
between this bizarre kidnapping case

215
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,946
and the Genius Child Project.

216
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,323
I'm here to ask for help.

217
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,243
It's not something I can answer.

218
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,505
I can only answer you
on things that I know.

219
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,497
What is the Genius Child Project?

220
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,504
Dr. Choi always researched
things others didn't.

221
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,674
Regarding the topic of the research,

222
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,769
I don't think it's right
for me to discuss that

223
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,053
since the person in charge of it
is no longer alive.

224
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,268
You can ask questions
through my attorney from now on.

225
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,729
Excuse me.

226
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,439
I have to see my patients.

227
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,318
CAPTAIN

228
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,550
You worked for 13 years
since you graduated,

229
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,125
but you're still a lieutenant.

230
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,919
You failed to get promoted three times.

231
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,547
And you have
quite the disciplinary record.

232
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,309
You failed to catch the culprit twice

233
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,218
and illegally cooperated with others.

234
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,397
Why did you do that?

235
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,972
To catch him.

236
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,611
This may sound weird, but some aspects
of this case are difficult to understand.

237
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,896
I figured I should dig deeper
into the case

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,993
instead of jumping to the conclusion
that the kidnapper is the murderer.

239
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,494
Don't try to weasel your way out of this.

240
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,331
This case has been handed over
to the Regional Investigation Unit.

241
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,366
Do you acknowledge that you caused
a disturbance in the investigation?

242
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,788
What happens if I don't acknowledge it?

243
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,084
You'll be punished more severely.

244
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,724
I'd say three months.

245
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,851
He has to beg on his knees
to get three months.

246
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,843
If he gets lucky, he'll get a warning.

247
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,772
He isn't the type to beg.

248
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,774
He's the most stubborn person
in the country.

249
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,193
But still, he should grovel when he must.

250
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,310
You know being stubborn leads nowhere.

251
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,656
I wonder what the captain got.

252
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,942
I say he got a month.
Ju-hyeok will be on probation for a week.

253
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,913
Goodness, you rookies don't know anything.

254
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,196
Gosh.

255
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,792
Tell me about it.
I was never punished before, so...

256
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,117
Exactly.

257
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,628
You should've told me about this.

258
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,588
I would've joined in on the fun
and made a guess.

259
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,632
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I'm sorry, sir.

260
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,832
Gosh.

261
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,379
Don't look at me with those eyes.
This isn't the first time.

262
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,880
That's not why.

263
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,882
Could you tell us what you got?

264
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,385
I heard you got a month.

265
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,345
Yes, sir.

266
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,557
Goodness. Suspended for a month
and reduced salary for three.

267
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,600
A cheap price to pay.

268
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,311
I'll be going then.

269
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,523
Any plans?

270
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,574
Rest at home.

271
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,829
Bye.

272
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,460
Why is he so nonchalant about it?
It makes me even more sad.

273
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,134
Sir!

274
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,720
Hey.

275
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,930
This is what you asked for earlier.

276
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,436
Thanks.

277
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,896
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,355
For what?

279
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,984
I just thought you'd be lonely.

280
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,381
Set up a meeting
between Park Cheol-won and Seo Hye-eun.

281
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,158
The device you've reached is turned off.
Please leave...

282
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,833
Hello. What brings you here?

283
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,419
I'm here to ask you a favor.

284
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,256
What is it?

285
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,883
It's about Mr. Park Cheol-won.

286
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,678
I see.

287
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,223
I can go to the station
if you want to question me.

288
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,767
That won't be necessary.

289
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,852
If it's okay,

290
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,731
could you meet him?

291
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,043
Excuse me.
You can't watch inappropriate videos here.

292
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,840
You look like a high schooler,
so knock it off and just play games.

293
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,301
Okay. I'm sorry.

294
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,180
Gosh, that loser.

295
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,683
Does he think he owns this place?

296
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,810
Shut up. He'll hear you.

297
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,146
-So damn annoying.
-I know.

298
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,137
I'll take this away.

299
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,879
Okay. Thank you.

300
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,676
Gosh, these bastards.

301
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,929
They smashed the keyboard and took off.

302
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,888
EMERGENCY NUMBER

303
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,012
Here is your change of clothes.

304
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,809
Is Mr. Choi...

305
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,021
dead?

306
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,402
If he was taken to the hospital in time,

307
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,445
then no.

308
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,365
What do I have to do...

309
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,537
to prevent people
from falling into more danger?

310
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,796
Eat up and survive.

311
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,341
And show them what they want.

312
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,553
Then nothing bad will happen.

313
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,449
Cheol-won.

314
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,884
I thought you might want to see her.

315
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,677
I'll give you some privacy.

316
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,198
What?

317
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,920
Why are you only eating now?
What about the others?

318
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,007
Oh, the others ate already.

319
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,250
Gosh, they act like they're so busy.

320
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,669
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

321
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,758
-Eat up.
-Thank you, sir.

322
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,394
Why did you take a wiretapper?

323
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,532
Sorry?

324
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,108
I heard you borrowed a wiretapper.

325
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:19,840
Oh.

326
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,988
-That's...
-Did Park Sang-yun ask you to?

327
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,421
Where is he?

328
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,355
Goodness, I feel so bad.

329
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:58,691
It's okay.

330
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,402
I did it because I wanted to.

331
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,322
I'll look for an attorney.

332
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,117
I won't let you stay here long.

333
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,956
My house is run-down,

334
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,251
so the deposit isn't much.

335
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,922
I told the landlady...

336
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,717
to give you the money

337
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,261
because I care for you like my own.

338
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,516
Stop talking
like you'll never see me again.

339
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,727
I also have a small savings account.

340
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,522
It's matured,
so you can withdraw the money.

341
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,400
Also, I also got my severance pay
in advance.

342
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,944
You can come out and use that money.

343
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,451
Hye-eun.

344
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,082
Be honest with me.

345
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,589
According to the police,

346
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,886
Dr. Choi's safe was completely empty.

347
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,005
Really?

348
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,604
"Really"?

349
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,970
Detective Park.

350
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,224
Yes?

351
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,060
I got a call from Youngin Police Station

352
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,854
that you've never requested this meeting.

353
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,524
Well, that's...

354
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,536
Hold on. Just let them finish talking.

355
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,163
-Stop the meeting.
-Yes, sir.

356
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,571
Hold on.

357
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,750
Just let the meeting finish.

358
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,701
I'll take responsibility.

359
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,745
I heard you're on suspension.

360
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,998
-Sorry?
-I'll report this to the higher-ups.

361
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,928
-Stop the meeting now.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,180
Excuse me.

363
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,630
We'll end the meeting here.

364
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,718
Sir.

365
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:16,186
Oh?

366
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,098
What's wrong with this?

367
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,315
-Did you call?
-Over there.

368
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,235
Some high schoolers
smashed the keyboard and took off.

369
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,737
Goodness.

370
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,322
Where's the CCTV?

371
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,698
Over there.

372
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,793
Excuse me.

373
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,717
Hey, check the CCTV
for the man who just left.

374
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,178
-Yes, sir.
-Excuse me!

375
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,971
Excuse me! Wait!

376
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,816
Damn it, where did he go?

377
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,626
Ms. Seo Hye-eun took a taxi back home.

378
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,212
I'll be taking this.

379
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,757
You're suspended right now.

380
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:38,188
This is an illegal investigation.
You know this will complicate things.

381
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,148
And if you wanted to ask a favor,

382
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,558
you should've asked me
instead of Ju-hyeok.

383
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,935
Do you really not trust me?

384
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,271
Give me a lighter.

385
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:53,931
Gosh!

386
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,535
Will you really not tell me?

387
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,797
Tell you what?

388
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,173
The thing that you only know.

389
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,041
You didn't pick up my call
in the morning either.

390
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,003
I'm worried that you're acting alone.

391
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,382
There's nothing you don't know.

392
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,100
Hey.

393
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,604
Okay. I'll be there.

394
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,406
Attorney Choi is awake.
You want to go together?

395
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:52,210
It's true that Byeol is slower
than those around her age,

396
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,890
but you should be more patient

397
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,175
and keep your eye on her progress.

398
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:03,138
When she becomes emotionally stable,

399
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,599
she'll improve much more than now.

400
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,899
Room 302.

401
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,120
What is it?

402
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,780
I'll head in first. Give me five.

403
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,615
Sir.

404
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,331
Are you feeling better?

405
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:31,959
Yes.

406
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,472
I checked all the CCTVs.

407
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,423
You were with Choi Ro-hee
and Kim Myeong-jun.

408
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,970
Am I being questioned here?

409
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,814
Not exactly.

410
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,432
I just have a few things to ask
before you get questioned.

411
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,152
You're an attorney,

412
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,521
so I'm sure you know
how serious this case is.

413
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,776
Were you with Choi Ro-hee the whole time?

414
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,210
I'm well aware that Ro-hee and Myeong-jun

415
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,619
don't have a typical
kidnapper-victim relationship.

416
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,746
You were with them,

417
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,873
so I just want to confirm some things.

418
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:15,043
I'll tell you the truth
when the investigation begins.

419
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,050
Do you know anything about the experiment
conducted on Choi Ro-hee?

420
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,262
I already know

421
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,140
about where the investment money was used

422
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,060
and what happened in the underground lab
in Dr. Choi's house.

423
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,942
I was Ro-hee's homeschooling teacher.

424
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,746
I don't know anything about Dr. Choi,

425
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,780
including his experiments.

426
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,074
What I want to ask

427
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,494
is if Kim Myeong-jun knows everything
about this project.

428
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,790
Is that an important issue?

429
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,220
He doesn't have anyone to negotiate with,

430
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,296
but the victim hasn't returned.

431
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:03,133
If the kidnapper
knows the value of the child,

432
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,719
and if he wants
something bigger through that,

433
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,055
it would be an issue.

434
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,684
Anyway, can you defend us in court?

435
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,353
Get him the best attorney you can find.

436
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,481
I can pay however much they want.

437
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,036
What I can tell you for certain

438
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,155
is that Mr. Kim Myeong-jun
kept Ro-hee in safety.

439
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,990
That's all I can say.

440
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,913
You'll have to answer everything

441
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,624
when the investigation begins.

442
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,962
Have you found Ro-hee?

443
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,843
The whereabouts of Choi Ro-hee
and Kim Myeong-jun are both unknown.

444
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,639
I have a favor to ask.

445
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,436
What is it?

446
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,606
Ro-hee is an 11-year-old kid.

447
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,984
If the project becomes publicized

448
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,279
and when people find out
Ro-hee is a genius,

449
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,783
that 11-year-old kid...

450
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,786
will become an animal in the zoo.

451
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,124
I haven't told anyone about this project.

452
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,128
As you said, Choi Ro-hee is only 11.

453
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,130
Listen.

454
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:27,509
If grown-ups' twisted desires
are what's making her suffer,

455
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,304
I should save her no matter what.

456
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,725
Please find her.

457
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,365
Did you find out anything?

458
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,535
All attorneys are the same.
Pleading the fifth.

459
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,287
I'll get going.

460
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,663
Yes, sir.

461
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,166
Right, what happened to Ju-hyeok?

462
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,169
He's on probation.

463
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,047
Don't scold him too much. I forced him.

464
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,674
Yes, sir.

465
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,818
By the way, who tailed Ju-hyeok?

466
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,059
Sorry?

467
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,271
I didn't tell anyone.
Only Ju-hyeok and I knew about this.

468
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,523
I think our captain looked into it.

469
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,369
Gosh, it's cold.

470
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,621
It is.

471
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,632
Should I get something to eat?

472
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,583
No, I'm okay.

473
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,755
I think we should.

474
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,506
I'm good.

475
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,091
You can go ahead.

476
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,854
I looked into the case,

477
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,690
and it looks like it'll be closed soon.

478
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,526
By the way,

479
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,571
have you found Ro-hee?

480
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:15,659
I haven't heard any news

481
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,702
since we prepared the ransom.

482
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,459
As I said,

483
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,836
she doesn't exist.

484
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,589
Just consider her dead from now on.

485
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,301
I'm saying she won't hold you back.

486
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,265
What a relief.

487
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,853
Anyway, did you find
what you were looking for?

488
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,823
Here's the key to the house.

489
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:01,121
We'll be renovating
the whole house next week.

490
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:04,874
I'm planning to completely transform it
considering that people died in there.

491
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:08,878
I thought you might want to
take some stuff before that.

492
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,969
What more can I do for this key?

493
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,562
Just make sure...

494
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,315
Ro-hee stays dead.

495
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:25,890
Who are you?

496
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,479
What an expected place to see you in.

497
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,660
How did you come in here?

498
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,902
You took the words right out of my mouth.

499
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,832
Who are you?

500
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,074
I'm the detective in charge.

501
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,577
You know...

502
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,163
what happened in this house, right?

503
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,040
Of course.

504
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,835
You must be a passionate detective

505
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:56,097
to be visiting the scene at this hour.

506
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,298
You still haven't answered my question.

507
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,425
Who are you?

508
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,553
I used to be Dr. Choi's business partner.

509
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,930
I got this key from his family.

510
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,893
That business must be related to Dr. Mo.

511
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,770
We first met at her hospital.

512
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,439
I was injured.

513
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,901
She was introduced to me
as a friend of my business partner.

514
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,321
Why did you come to this house?

515
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,285
We invested a large amount of money,

516
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,331
but we're broke
now that our business partner died.

517
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,335
But it feels like I'm being interrogated.

518
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,879
Should I meet you at the station?

519
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,552
I was just looking around
to see if I could find anything.

520
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,398
Of course, under his family's consent.

521
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,642
We met all the investors
associated with Dr. Choi.

522
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,519
But I haven't seen you before.

523
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,312
Is that weird?

524
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,157
To see someone you've never seen before
for the first time?

525
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,166
It's a joke.

526
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,546
Goodbye, then.

527
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,743
-Hey.
-Sir, we received a tip.

528
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,744
A tip?

529
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:45,039
Kim Myeong-jun
went to an Internet cafe alone.

530
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,489
An Internet cafe?

531
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,324
Did you look into his search history?

532
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,002
He didn't search anything,

533
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,505
but he watched a video
from an external hard drive and left.

534
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:53,830
A video?

535
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,896
No!

536
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,982
Attorney Choi...

537
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,609
Attorney Choi.

538
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,291
Attorney Choi!

539
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,182
Where are you, Mr. Kim?

540
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:57,203
Are you okay?

541
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,334
He tried to fill the car
with carbon monoxide.

542
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:26,107
Why did you come here?

543
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,612
I have to find Ro-hee,

544
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,990
but I have nowhere to go.

545
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,002
By the way,

546
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,703
the man who attacked you

547
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,997
is his lackey, right?

548
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,709
Jaden came to my hospital this morning

549
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,419
to tell me to withdraw my investment.

550
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,297
I refused...

551
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,301
because I have no intention
of excluding myself from this project.

552
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,263
It was probably due to that refusal.

553
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,266
I didn't play along with their plan.

554
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:05,813
Where's Jaden?

555
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,232
I don't know.

556
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,491
Why are you going so far?

557
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,124
What about your daughter's surgery?

558
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,335
I heard it went well.

559
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,878
Then that's it for you.

560
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,923
You should stop now.

561
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:36,511
Your actions may put
Ro-hee in further danger.

562
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,143
I need to keep my promise.

563
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,146
I promised I'd protect her...

564
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,692
and set everything back to normal.

565
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,904
I'm going to keep those promises.

566
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,706
Rest up.

567
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,904
She's just sitting on her bed.

568
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,521
She's not eating or sleeping.

569
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,232
Let her be. She'll have to eat to survive.

570
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,985
She'll end up eating.

571
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,246
What about Dr. Mo?

572
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,696
No news yet.

573
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,031
Should I go myself?

574
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,534
No.

575
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,537
I think the cops are going to take action.
Just let her be for now.

576
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,842
What's the plan?

577
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,430
What if you become useless?

578
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,226
This pendant.

579
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,854
Is it just an ordinary one?

580
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,063
Why?

581
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,692
You think this is a key
to some secret safe?

582
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,362
It may be, or not.

583
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,782
But you should pray that it is.

584
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,243
The first artificial genius
may be meaningful,

585
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,247
but without the genetic blueprint
to create more geniuses like you,

586
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,458
you'll become worthless.

587
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,085
When that happens,

588
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,257
you'll vanish where no one can find you.

589
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,320
Go to the port with Ro-hee tomorrow,
as we planned.

590
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,458
The Russian Branch
got their approval to dock,

591
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,991
so they'll be here on a yacht.

592
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,328
I'll see you
when we get out of this country.

593
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,315
RESTRICTED NUMBER

594
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,446
RESTRICTED NUMBER

595
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,910
MEET ME AT SOKCHO YACHT DOCK AT 15:40

596
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,412
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING?

597
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,765
"Sokcho Dock."

598
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,424
Sokcho Dock?

599
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:06,804
He said Ro-hee won't be in Korea soon.

600
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,676
DETECTIVE PARK SANG-YUN

601
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,496
-Here's your receipt.
-Thank you.

602
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,331
Thank you. Goodbye.

603
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,906
-Hello.
-Hello.

604
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,210
Is Dr. Mo off today?

605
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,129
Yes. She came in the morning,

606
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,705
but she said she had personal errands
and wouldn't be taking patients.

607
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,717
So is she not here right now?

608
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,593
She's probably in her office.

609
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,387
Should I tell her that you're here?

610
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,629
It's fine. I'll call her.

611
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,590
Goodbye.

612
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,765
DETECTIVE PARK SANG-YUN

613
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,946
I tied him up well,
so he won't be an issue.

614
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,646
I'll call you when I find Ro-hee.

615
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,191
No, let's take my car.

616
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,817
It'll be dangerous.

617
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,864
I don't trust you or Ro-hee.

618
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,743
I saved you two from Jaden
despite risking myself

619
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,287
because Ro-hee promised me
Dr. Choi's research materials.

620
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,582
But if you and Ro-hee leave like this,

621
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:20,002
then I'll have nothing left.

622
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,927
It's Detective Park Sang-yun.

623
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,021
What brings you here again?

624
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:41,241
I thought I made myself clear last time.

625
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,900
Talk through my attorney.

626
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:45,861
I met a man at the crime scene yesterday.

627
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,322
I think he was trespassing,

628
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,659
but it was the man I met here yesterday.

629
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,037
I can't tell you personal information
about a patient.

630
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,124
He apparently invested a lot of money
in Dr. Choi's project.

631
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,876
Who is he?

632
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,712
I don't know him.

633
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,298
Goodbye, then.
I have previous engagements.

634
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,012
Hold on.

635
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,724
Is someone inside?

636
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,476
Let's talk outside.

637
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,736
What do you think you're doing?

638
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,542
Kim Myeong-jun.

639
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,284
-Damn it.
-Kim Myeong-jun!

640
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,730
Get ready.

641
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,607
I'm hungry,

642
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:31,610
and there's something
I want to eat before I leave.

643
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,072
Shrimp fried rice.

644
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,345
What's wrong?

645
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,596
Is it hard?

646
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,139
Forget it.

647
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,421
Nice to meet you.

648
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,756
I'm Choi Hye-eun.

649
00:57:02,345 --> 00:57:06,386
THE KIDNAPPING DAY

650
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,340
What the hell are you doing?!

651
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,217
She had difficulty breathing
and collapsed.

652
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,052
Don't you know
what state she's supposed to be in?

653
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,804
I said where's the kid?

654
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,306
I'm here to look for her too!

655
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,348
Ro-hee!

656
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,508
If we don't find Choi Ro-hee,
we'll lose her forever.

657
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,685
What are you doing?

658
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,719
I'm so sorry.

659
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,397
Let us properly introduce ourselves.

660
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,316
-I'm Choi Ro-hee.
-I'm Kim Myeong-jun.

661
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,859
This is so absurd.

662
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,694
What if Ro-hee's memories come back,

663
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,645
and they point to Ms. Seo Hye-eun?

664
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,323
Do me another job.

665
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,450
So the kidnapping was to get your revenge.

666
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:41,119
Dr. Choi's research materials
are in that pendant?

667
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,454
It is a flash drive.

668
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,122
If you want magic, you need to risk it.

669
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,415
Life is about gambling.

670
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,907
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:47,959
Help me!

672
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,002
Who told you to do this?

673
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,171
Hurry up and get moving.
We don't have time.

674
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,288
If those guys hurt Ro-hee,

675
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,591
I won't let it slide.

676
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,999
Where are you, Choi Ro-hee?

677
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,719
If you keep this up,
everyone will end up getting hurt.

678
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,679
The only way to keep everyone safe

679
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,964
is for both of us to disappear.

680
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,392
If you're going to take Ro-hee,

681
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,635
you'll have to kill me first!

682
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,845
Because I'll protect her no matter what!

683
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,558
