00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:00,036
THE KIDNAPPING DAY

2
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,604
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS, GROUPS,

3
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
AND SETTINGS ARE FICTITIOUS,
AND CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED

4
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,399
THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED
BY THE COMMUNICATIONS

5
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,067
DEVELOPMENT FUND
OF MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND ICT

6
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,451
Hee-ae.

7
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,662
Hee-ae, is your arm okay?

8
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:23,584
What's wrong?

9
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,630
Last night, in the alley,

10
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,425
I heard the name Ro-hee.

11
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,224
I have a question.

12
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,605
Who are you?

13
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,077
A kidnapper?

14
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,330
Then who am I?

15
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,626
My name.

16
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:10,840
Ro-hee.

17
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,925
Choi Ro-hee.

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,512
That's all I know.

19
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,098
Sorry.

20
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,724
You're sorry?

21
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,019
You're just a kidnapper.

22
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,692
What about my mom and dad?

23
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,736
My real dad.

24
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,116
Did you kill him?

25
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,286
No, I didn't do it.

26
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,750
Ro-hee.

27
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,046
Ro-hee.

28
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,506
Ro-hee!

29
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,926
Ro-hee!

30
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,970
Ro-hee, wait!

31
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,727
Let go!

32
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,396
I want to go home.

33
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,315
-Ro-hee.
-I want to go home!

34
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,649
Let me go!

35
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,943
I said, I'm going home!

36
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,655
Send me home.

37
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,909
Send me back home.

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,203
I won't tell anyone.

39
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,581
It's not like I can say anything.

40
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,541
I lost my memory anyway.

41
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,211
If you send me home,

42
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,839
I'll pretend

43
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,051
I didn't see or hear anything.

44
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,802
Just...

45
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,097
Just send me home.

46
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,810
Send me home.

47
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,648
I want to go home.

48
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,609
Send me home.

49
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,237
I want to go home.

50
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,161
Send me home.

51
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,789
Okay.

52
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,208
Let's go.

53
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,087
Let's go home.

54
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,264
YOUNGIN GENERAL HOSPITAL

55
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,734
What? Are you smoking?

56
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,113
Sir?

57
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:40,823
Hey.

58
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,201
Hey, the kid ran with Kim Myeong-jun

59
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,037
while holding his hand.

60
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,414
Sorry?

61
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,750
The kid held his hand first.

62
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,380
The kidnapped kid held
the kidnapper's hand first?

63
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,589
Yes.

64
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,721
Hey, we're at a hospital.

65
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,474
Then why do you have it in your mouth?
It's making me want to light it up.

66
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,227
Don't mind me.

67
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,813
Let's look into
what Kim Myeong-jun did that day again.

68
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,898
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,464
What is it?

70
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,386
I think it's best that I go alone.

71
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll go in after five minutes.

72
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,390
In that time, Dad, you...

73
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,439
You can go your way.

74
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,234
-Why? I should--
-You said your child is sick.

75
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,071
And that's why you kidnapped me.

76
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,699
Was that a lie too?

77
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,911
No, it's true.

78
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,955
She has surgery in ten days.

79
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,749
I promise.

80
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,043
I swear.

81
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,671
You said you wanted
to see her get surgery.

82
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,592
It's up to you to turn yourself in
or get caught after that.

83
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,178
Before then, don't let them catch you.

84
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,685
Thanks.

85
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,898
Will you really be okay going alone?

86
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,234
Who are you to worry about me?

87
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,196
You're just a kidnapper.

88
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,372
Hurry up and leave.

89
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,297
Bye.

90
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:19,314
POLICE

91
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,292
Hey, kid. What brings you here?

92
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,982
Excuse me.

93
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,157
Let's be calm.

94
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,159
Be calm!

95
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,327
Excuse me!

96
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,206
This is driving me nuts!

97
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,672
Excuse me!

98
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,883
Jeez.

99
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,010
Dad!

100
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,220
Dad!

101
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,014
Ro-hee?

102
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,562
What?

103
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,106
What?

104
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,279
You...

105
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,037
I'm sorry, Dad.
I won't wander around alone again.

106
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,748
-What?
-I kept calling you from back there.

107
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,751
Why would you ignore me
and keep going your way?

108
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,795
He must've been out of his mind
searching for me.

109
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,380
Right, Dad?

110
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,134
Of course. Yes.

111
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,971
Thank you, sir.

112
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,390
You're welcome. Go home safe.

113
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,601
Don't lose your daughter, okay?

114
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,520
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

115
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:04,998
CHAPTER 3. THE ACCOMPLICE

116
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,960
BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE DAY OF KIDNAPPING BY JEONG HAE-YEON

117
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,185
Sir.

118
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,521
Goodness.

119
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,981
How many times are you looking
at the same footage?

120
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,777
Who knows? The kid in the video
might give us an answer.

121
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,742
Then I'll go pray for an hour,

122
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,911
in hopes to hear God's voice.

123
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, Lord.

124
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,684
What? A cop is the culprit?

125
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,187
I'm not saying I'm certain.
I just remembered a police car.

126
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,440
That's nonsense.
How can a cop be the culprit?

127
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,316
Then who is it? Is it you?

128
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,694
Jeez, I said I'm not.

129
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,867
A police car in front of the house.

130
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,995
The siren light.

131
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,622
Jeez.

132
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,251
Who should we report this to
if a cop is the culprit?

133
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,921
Are you really asking that to a kid?

134
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,424
I mean...

135
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,050
Anyway, do you remember anything else?

136
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,345
Like your relatives?

137
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,016
I don't know.

138
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,059
I haven't fully regained my memories yet.

139
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,399
You should find somewhere safe to stay.

140
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,991
Me?

141
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,578
Not me! I'm a kidnapper.

142
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,497
You kidnapped me,
so you should take responsibility!

143
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,748
Take responsibility for what?

144
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,501
The police should be responsible
for the kidnapping victim!

145
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,586
They're in charge of our safety.

146
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,088
What if a cop killed my parents?

147
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,841
Even if that were true,
there's a ton of cops in Youngin.

148
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,384
I doubt they're all in it together.

149
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,596
Think about it.
You said my family is super rich.

150
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,349
You think some cops ganged up
and killed my dad?

151
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,684
It must've been an order
from the higher-ups!

152
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,773
But still, not me! I'm a criminal.

153
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,192
I'll be turning myself in after ten days.

154
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,152
Then take responsibility for me
for ten days.

155
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,571
Take responsibility for what?

156
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,781
My safety.

157
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,741
And...

158
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,371
help me gain my memories back.

159
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,165
Man, seriously!

160
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,128
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION

161
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,801
Gosh, how filthy.

162
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,052
There's hot water.

163
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,721
Hey, you have to look like
you didn't go home.

164
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,516
If I'm clean like you,
he won't send you home.

165
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,228
The citizens are terrified
at the sight of your filth and looks.

166
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,646
Think about the poor citizens.

167
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,773
-Goodness.
-Hey.

168
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,775
He's right. You should wash up.

169
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,819
You're making all the detectives look bad.

170
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,947
I'd take care of myself
if I looked like you.

171
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,367
And it's attractive for a detective
to look a bit filthy.

172
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,743
Ju-hyeok.

173
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,706
If you keep trying
to make your skin better,

174
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,292
you'll lose your color as a detective.

175
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,252
When will you become a real detective?

176
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,629
Hey, Chang-hun.

177
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,630
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,174
Can you... Oh, my.

179
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,098
Why are you staring?
Have you never seen a face mask before?

180
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,685
What are you guys doing?
We have a meeting with other teams.

181
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,855
We don't want our team
to look the scruffiest.

182
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,899
You guys should go shave.

183
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,403
-And you, wash your hair.
-I did.

184
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:04,779
Come here.

185
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,034
Damn it! Go wash it again!

186
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,329
Right, any word from the inspection?

187
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,957
We have officers in the train
and bus stations and highways.

188
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,334
He's still in Youngin.

189
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,419
I see. What about his house?

190
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,796
He's registered to live
in a gosiwon in Youngin,

191
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,591
but apparently,
he moved out two months ago.

192
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,634
I see.

193
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,223
Why does it look like
something is bothering you?

194
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,352
Tell me about it.

195
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,313
I don't know
what Kim Myeong-jun is thinking.

196
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,484
Goodness.

197
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,155
Gosh, is this mask too small?

198
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,698
Jeez.

199
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,916
Sir.

200
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,293
Mr. Park.

201
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,171
Hello.

202
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,966
Sure, hold on a minute.

203
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,180
I heard the police questioned you.

204
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,556
Yes.

205
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,101
I managed all of Dr. Choi's CCTVs.

206
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,646
-Did they find anything?
-Sorry?

207
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,357
From the CCTV footage in his house.

208
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,902
Did they find anything in the footage?

209
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,158
I know something interesting,

210
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,078
but I was wondering if you also know.

211
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,218
The document I gave you

212
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,180
is the agenda on the asset division
of the late Dr. Choi Jin-tae.

213
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,392
It looks like
he didn't have a notarized will.

214
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,018
No, sir.

215
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,020
The daughter of the family, Choi Ro-hee,

216
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,565
is the sole inheritor of all his assets,

217
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,941
but she is currently kidnapped.

218
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,736
-I see.
-The next page

219
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,239
contains the next steps we should take
if Choi Ro-hee were to die.

220
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,034
Dr. Choi's wife, Ms. So Jin-yu
was an orphan

221
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,828
so she doesn't have blood relatives.

222
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,123
Currently, the only relative
of the deceased eligible for inheritance

223
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,501
is our client, Dr. Choi's uncle,

224
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,336
Chairman Choi Dong-jun.

225
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,424
Normally, kidnapping victims
are released upon paying ransom.

226
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,718
But the kidnapper has no one
to demand ransom from.

227
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,306
That means the goal
of the kidnapping is gone.

228
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,682
Will the kidnapper let her live?

229
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,645
Chairman Choi
must have butterflies in his stomach.

230
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,439
Right?

231
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,613
Here.

232
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,406
Thank you, sir.

233
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,910
You wonder
why we have to take it this far, right?

234
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,829
Just accept it.

235
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,999
Our role is to get the job done.

236
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
Yes, sir.

237
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,255
Right.

238
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,508
You said you know

239
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,802
the kidnapping victim, right?

240
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,389
I taught her for about a year
when she was homeschooling.

241
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,974
I see.

242
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,894
You must be worried then.

243
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,620
What's with my stomach?

244
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,709
What are you doing?

245
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,087
"Agreement."

246
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,130
"Kim Myeong-jun and Choi Ro-hee

247
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,092
will agree to the following regarding
Choi Ro-hee's kidnapping

248
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,803
-and its..."
-"...and its post-incident stages."

249
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,181
"One. Kim Myeong-jun will not commit
verbal or physical violence

250
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,100
against Ro-hee under any circumstances."

251
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,979
"Two. He will do his best
to protect Choi Ro-hee."

252
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:10,441
"Three. For all the decisions
that are to be made after the incident,

253
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,653
he will trust and obey
Choi Ro-hee's orders."

254
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,614
"Four. He will not let Choi Ro-hee
skip her meals

255
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,867
and provide any type of food she demands."

256
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,370
"Five. The termination of this contract
will be decided by Choi Ro-hee."

257
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,414
"Kim Myeong-jun
will read the above statements

258
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,625
and unconditionally agree
and sign the agreement."

259
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,752
Sign it.

260
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,298
What is this, a slave contract?

261
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,675
-At least write down the end date of--
-Sign it!

262
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:36,968
Fine!

263
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,101
MYEONG-JUN

264
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,352
There!

265
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,943
Is he the child's dad?

266
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,820
Yes, he is.

267
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,531
He came yesterday.

268
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,284
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

269
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,452
When?

270
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,412
Around lunchtime.

271
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,456
But what brings you here?

272
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,583
There's been an incident
two days ago, and...

273
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:13,046
He's an important witness
in the case we're working on.

274
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,091
It's been a while since Hee-ae
has been hospitalized.

275
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,552
So the treatment and hospital bills
were overdue.

276
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,596
So he couldn't visit the hospital.

277
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,974
But we can't kick a patient out
without their guardian.

278
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:29,103
But he paid the hospital bills
and pre-paid the surgery fee,

279
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,813
so I'm sure he'll visit more often now.

280
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,649
He pre-paid the surgery fee?

281
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,484
-Yes.
-How much was it?

282
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,612
If you add up the hospital bill
and the surgery fee,

283
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,489
it's a little over 50 million won.

284
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,038
But when he heard
that the bills had been paid for,

285
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,040
he seemed a bit surprised.

286
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,541
YOUNGIN GENERAL HOSPITAL

287
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,923
Kim Myeong-jun
paid for the surgery himself.

288
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,634
He registered himself
as the caretaker as well.

289
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,219
Is that so?

290
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:04,973
Hey.

291
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,725
Okay. I'll be there.

292
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,020
Kim Myeong-jun's actual residence
has been confirmed.

293
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,773
Okay.

294
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,943
What? You set the car on fire?

295
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,237
Keep it down.

296
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,613
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,949
Why would you abandon the car
if you're going to run away?

298
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,119
That car was caught on CCTV.
You want me to keep driving that thing?

299
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,538
I should destroy evidence first.

300
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,376
Thank you.

301
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,343
How did you think of burning the car?

302
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,598
Well, I saw it in the movies.

303
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,601
It caught on fire instantly.

304
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,443
-Just saying.
-Then how will we get around now?

305
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,070
Bus? Taxi?

306
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,240
Well, we can improvise.

307
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,534
You have no plans, do you?

308
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,911
I wonder how you kidnapped me.

309
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,289
It's not like I wanted to. I was told to.

310
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,416
You were told to?

311
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,501
By whom?

312
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,130
What? What did I just say?

313
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,715
You said someone told you to.

314
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,259
Yes, right.

315
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,428
A friend.

316
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,805
Friend who? The brat who never picks up?

317
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,768
I mean, she's not a brat.

318
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,688
It's Hee-ae's mom.

319
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,774
How does she know me?

320
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,026
Because your family's rich.

321
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,569
That doesn't only apply to my family.

322
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,529
Why did she choose me to kidnap?

323
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,658
Tell me about it.

324
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,202
Why was it you?

325
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,081
Are you serious?

326
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,887
I need to meet her.

327
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:09,680
What?

328
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,099
That lady would know...

329
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,227
who I am.

330
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,275
Hello.

331
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,652
-Good work.
-Hey.

332
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,654
-Hey, Chang-hun.
-You're here.

333
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,075
-Did you take a look inside?
-I did.

334
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,999
They're demolishing the area,

335
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,752
so he must've lived off
of the generator and gas cylinder.

336
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,763
There aren't many shattered
pieces of glass out here,

337
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,348
so it must've been broken from outside.

338
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,270
You're right.

339
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,856
It might've broken
when he was with the kid.

340
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,357
Yes, that's a possibility.

341
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,859
This is worrisome.

342
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,736
The nurse told us that the kid was abused.

343
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,166
Give it to the forensics.

344
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:34,098
These are pictures
of Kim Myeong-jun's daughter.

345
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,019
His objective is clear now.

346
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,812
He kidnapped to save his daughter.

347
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,648
But still, how can he murder people?

348
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,193
Let's not jump to conclusions.

349
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,070
According to the CCTV footage,
Kim Myeong-jun didn't go into the house.

350
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,532
All he did was take the girl
who passed out in front of the house.

351
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,661
Does that mean there's an accomplice?

352
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,623
This is Kim Myeong-jun's wife.

353
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,083
-Where is she?
-She never once visited her daughter

354
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,793
at the hospital.

355
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,503
Her whereabouts are unknown.

356
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,006
There's a record of Kim Myeong-jun

357
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,175
reporting his wife as missing
about three years ago.

358
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,845
His kid fell sick and his wife ran away.

359
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:13,888
I see why he went crazy.

360
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,099
We can ask him that when we catch him.

361
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,425
Let's take a taxi.

362
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,844
I don't have money to pay for it.

363
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,517
You and your poverty.

364
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,192
Jeez, where do we sleep tonight?

365
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,404
What are you saying?
We should head to Seoul.

366
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,073
How do you expect to get to Seoul
with cops everywhere?

367
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,075
That's why you should think.

368
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,869
Rather than thinking about
where we're going to sleep,

369
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,830
think about how we're going to
get to Seoul.

370
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,957
You should learn to give up on
what can't be done.

371
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,917
What a good thing to teach a kid.

372
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,711
What a great dad.

373
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,424
Darn it.

374
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,843
Call me what you want.

375
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,887
Just call me uncle

376
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:38,931
or something like that.

377
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,226
Do you have to be my family?
It's offensive.

378
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,103
What else is there then?

379
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,189
Mr. Kim.

380
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,733
Gosh!

381
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,193
These scumbags.

382
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,744
Scumbag.

383
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,288
Scum...

384
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,756
Grandma must've taught you
something weird.

385
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,883
-Goodness, my baby.
-Let me go.

386
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,260
-My sweet baby.
-Let go!

387
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,306
Darn it. Who told you to touch me?

388
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,975
Who told you to say such a thing?

389
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,935
Then why did you kidnap me?

390
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,359
What if someone hears you and reports us?

391
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,571
Hear us and report us?

392
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,698
Jeez, that hurts.

393
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,036
We're around Youngin Lake Park.

394
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,748
Someone suspicious is with a girl
who looks around 11 years old.

395
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,375
How do I sound?

396
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,834
You sound really weird.

397
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,837
Really? Should I lower my voice?

398
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:53,923
Hello.

399
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,842
The CCTV doesn't record your voice.

400
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,222
Do you have to do talk like that
when the cops don't even know your voice?

401
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,099
You're right.

402
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,684
Hurry and make the call.
We don't have time.

403
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,019
Okay.

404
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,073
YOUNGIN POLICE STATION

405
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,539
KIM MYEONG-JUN, CHOI RO-HEE

406
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,195
What are you doing out here?
I was looking for you.

407
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,285
I'm just frustrated.

408
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,580
I looked into Kim Myeong-jun's
bank account.

409
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,915
But there hasn't been a transaction
since two years ago.

410
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,292
He has 1,300 won in his account.

411
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,877
-Only 1,300 won?
-Yes.

412
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,005
I went to the hospital to show them
a photo of him, but they weren't sure.

413
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,591
They can't remember because the person
was wearing a hat and a hoodie.

414
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,260
But apparently,
they paid 50 million won in cash.

415
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,345
All that in cash?

416
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,388
Yes.

417
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,558
I looked into Choi Jin-tae's account
just in case,

418
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:31,937
five people wired two billion won each
around the same period.

419
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:34,482
TRANSACTION RECORD

420
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,317
-Ten billion won in total.
-Yes.

421
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,488
This is the Violent Crimes Division
of Youngin Police Station.

422

VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

423
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,698
Sorry?

424
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,241
Lake Park?

425
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,454
Okay. Thank you.

426
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,289
What was that?

427
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,333
We received a report
of a suspicious man at Lake Park.

428
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,376
Apparently, he's with a girl
who's about 11 years old.

429
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,045
-Eleven years old?
-Yes, sir.

430
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,299
Where's Sang-yun? Call him.

431
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,383
Yes, sir.

432
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,723
The suspect appeared in Youngin Lake Park.

433
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,184
All officers in the vicinity,
mobilize to Youngin Lake Park.

434
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,311
Roger. Let's go.

435
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,529
Let's go.

436
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,572
YOUNGIN STATION

437
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,595
SELECT YOUR DESTINATION
SEOUL STATION

438
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,764
I was so nervous back there.

439
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,433
How did you kidnap me
when you have no guts?

440
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,353
Had you not appeared,
I probably wouldn't have been able to.

441
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,021
Funny, right?

442
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:58,816
Just saying.

443
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,362
-Thank you.
-Sure.

444
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,364
-There's a cop.
-What?

445
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,075
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

446
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,368
Damn it.

447
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,287
What do we do?

448
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,791
They'll only inspect people with a child.

449
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,670
So don't do anything silly
and get to the platform naturally, okay?

450
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,214
How will you get there?
It's weird for a kid to be alone.

451
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,593
Over here.

452
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,052
Come on.

453
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,015
-I won't go in alone.
-Hey!

454
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,975
Eun-myeong!

455
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,768
Eun-myeong!

456
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,438
-You want some help?
-Thanks.

Thank you for your help.

00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,154
Here, tap the card.

460
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,117
Good job. Let's go.

461
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,874
All right.

462
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,387
-Hey, Chang-hun.
-Hey.

463
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,723
-Why are you so busy? Going for lunch?
-Well...

464
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,808
Someone saw a suspicious man at Lake Park.

465
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,436
Apparently, he was with a girl
who looked to be around 11 years old.

466
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,606
We mobilized all the officers
in the vicinity to search the area.

467
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,232
Who made the report? A police?

468
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,359
No.

469
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,778
I think it was a citizen.

470
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,154
A citizen?

471
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,740
How can a citizen tip us off
when the case hasn't been publicized?

472
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,116
Are you all stupid?

473
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,580
If it's near Lake Park,
where are the officers coming from?

474
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,709
The officers from the shopping mall,
the theater, and Youngin Station.

475
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,212
Have them go to Youngin Station.

476
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,130
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. Youngin Station.

477
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:46,799
YOUNGIN STATION

478
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,220
This way!

479
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,557
Split into groups of three.

480
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,906
Sorry. Excuse me.

481
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,915
I found someone who looks similar
to the suspect

482
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,959
bound for Seoul Station on platform 9-2.

483
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,460
Roger.

484
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,640
Excuse me.

485
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,272
Why did you get a divorce?

486
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,858
I didn't get a divorce.

487
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,614
Well, it's practically a divorce.

488
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,410
She suddenly disappeared,
but we're still legally married.

489
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,833
Jeez, what am I saying to a kid?

490
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,335
You know how to
catch me off guard, don't you?

491
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,795
It's a hurtful past for me, you know.

492
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,465
You expect me to sympathize with you
for a mere divorce?

493
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,092
I became an orphan overnight.

494
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,262
I'm an orphan too.
I don't even know my parents' faces.

495
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,724
Gosh, seriously.

496
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,518
Why do I have to pity my kidnapper?

497
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,396
Keep it down. There are people here.

498
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,773
That's none of my business.

499
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:32,237
By the way,
you know where your wife lives, right?

500
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,031
I do.

501
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,117
But I may not know.

502
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,744
Are you kidding me?

503
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,080
Are you purposely
trying to annoy me or what?

504
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,248
Can you be more clear?

505
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,250
She left our daughter behind
and disappeared.

506
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,960
Then she'd suddenly appear out of nowhere.

507
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,962
And then she'd disappear.

508
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,090
So I tailed her once.

509
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,052
I thought it'd be good to know
where she lives.

510
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,762
What a stalker.

511
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,431
Seriously?

512
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,644
YOUNGIN STATION CAM 04

513
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,104
Here he is.

514
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,317
This bastard.

515
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,777
He really screwed us over.

516
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:39,281
Request cooperation. Tell them it's urgent
and ask them to have officers ready.

517
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,407
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,119
Check which train he got on.
I'll ask for cooperation.

519
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,454
Take your car keys!

520
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,165
Let's make the case public.

521
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,626
-What?
-He's out of Youngin

522
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,085
and the golden hour has passed.

523
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:55,047
What if he does something to the kid?

524
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,175
He wouldn't have gone to the ER
if he wanted to hurt her.

525
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,218
You said there were signs of abuse.

526
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,553
What if the kid falls in danger?

527
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,222
This is just my prediction,
but the abuse...

528
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,059
may not have been caused by the kidnapper.

529
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:09,978
What?

530
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,813
But I'm not saying she's safe.

531
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,857
We need to pressure him.

532
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,692
If we make the case public,

533
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:17,986
he'll eventually break.

534
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,956
I really...

535
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,291
I really don't know.

536
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,424
I swear.

537
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,887
Don't do that.

538
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,639
I really don't know.

539
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,724
I really don't know. I swear.

540
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,775
I said I don't know!

541
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,113
He was no ordinary man,

542
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,407
so I was going to sneak her out
when he was out.

543
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,367
But I lost her. I'm serious!

544
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,577
I swear!

545
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,663
Why did you try to take the kid?

546
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,457
I don't know!

547
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,209
I'm serious.

548
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,421
Don't!

549
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,589
Please.

550
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,677
Please spare my life.

551
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,763
I only received money to take her...

552
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,272
I only tailed her because I was worried.

553
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,150
I get it, you stalker.

554
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,319
Think about it! Our child fell sick,

555
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,822
and her mom suddenly disappeared
and would randomly appear.

556
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,366
Forget it.

557
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,992
Why am I saying these things to a kid?

558
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,286
-Seriously.
-Viewers, please take a look

559
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,955
at the face and the name

560
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,540
-What are you doing? Let's move.
-of the child on the screen.

561
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,874
It's dark already.

562
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,710
The kidnapping case of Choi Ro-hee,
an 11-year-old girl,

563
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,796
is now an ongoing public investigation.

564
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,716
The police have decided
to make this information public

565
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,094
to prioritize
and ensure the child's safety.

566
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:33,348
When Choi Ro-hee was kidnapped,
she had a bob cut,

567
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,310
and the housekeeper testified
that she enjoyed wearing dresses.

568
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,104
The police are seeing this

569
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,357
as a kidnapping and murder case
that was carried out

570
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,942
after careful observation and planning.

571
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:48,321
They stated that they will do their best
until the victim returns safely.

572
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,285
Hey, what do we do?

573
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,162
People will recognize us now.

574
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,707
It hasn't been long
since they disclosed our identities.

575
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,501
Not many will recognize us yet.

576
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,211
Hey, he kidnapped a child.

577
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,631
He looks like a normal guy.
Why would he do such a thing?

578
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:07,799
Let's go. Hurry.

579
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,346
-The brutally murdered couple is known
-My goodness.

580
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,433
to have an 11-year-old daughter...

581
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,226
Oh, you're here.

582
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:19,978
You're late for dinner today.

583
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,855
You rarely work overtime.

584
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,565
A bowl of sundaeguk, please.

585
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,608
Sure.

586
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,069
Anyway, look at that.
Whoever did that deserves to die.

587
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,614
They killed her parents
and kidnapped the kid.

588
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,865
Goodness.

589
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,744
The world is getting scarier,
don't you agree?

590
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,705
-Tell me about it.
-How awful.

591
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,802
We, the YTM Newsroom, are also distressed

592
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,304
by this tragedy.

593
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,016
We will continue to keep you
updated on this case

594
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,811
with the hopes
that Choi Ro-hee will return safely.

595
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,189
We look forward to hearing your...

596
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,374
Dr. Mo, Youngin Police Station
called to schedule a meeting with you.

597
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,459
I think it's regarding Dr. Choi's case.

598
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,712
Thanks for letting me know.

599
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,806
Hello, this is Violent Crimes Team 2.

600
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,099
There's no one here by that name.

601
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,308
Stop prank-calling.

602
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,980
Violent Crimes Division
of Youngin Police Station.

603
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,481
Yes.

604
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,110
In the alley next to the convenience store
in Seonghwa-dong?

605
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,446
Right now?

606
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,242
Yes, thank you.

607
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,787
So many prank calls.

608
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,081
Violent Crimes Division
of Youngin Police Station.

609
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,416
There's no one here by that name.

610
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,002
Yes, okay. Thank you.

611
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,428
Sir.

612
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,347
Dr. Mo Eun-sun is here.

613
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,435
The two billion won.

614
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:26,730
She's in the lounge.

615
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,565
Okay.

616
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,778
This is Violent Crimes Team 3.

617
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,781
There's no one here by that name.

618
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,830
Here you go.

619
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,042
I'm sorry for calling you so late.

620
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,796
It's a big case,
so I should help if I can.

621
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:53,882
Thank you.

622
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,010
We wanted to ask you

623
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:58,928
about this.

624
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,723
TRANSACTION RECORD

625
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,144
Do I have to tell you
about something personal?

626
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:11,483
We need to know if it's personal
or relevant to this case.

627
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,318
People died.

628
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,571
Coincidentally, such a big amount
was wired in the same time frame,

629
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,200
so from our perspective,
we must look into it.

630
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,702
A big amount.

631
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,793
The value of Dr. Choi's house
and hospital.

632
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,253
If you take all of those things
into account,

633
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,590
ten billion won isn't enough
to threaten his life.

634
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:42,347
Can you tell me the purpose of this money?

635
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:46,476
He was conducting research.

636
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:51,106
The people on this list, including me,

637
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,649
supported his research.

638
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:58,196
This money was to support his research
and it was also a deposit for the shares.

639
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,281
That's all.

640
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,617
-Deposit?
-20%.

641
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,037
The remaining 80% hasn't been wired yet.

642
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,876
I'm the most disappointed...

643
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,213
about Dr. Choi's death.

644
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:20,301
I was particularly close to him
because we both studied at UCLA.

645
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,346
I truly wanted him

646
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,766
to succeed in his research.

647
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,318
I think I've cleared up
the source of this money.

648
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,154
May I leave?

649
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,989
About that research.

650
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,366
What was it about?

651
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,165
Every job has its rules.

652
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,334
I'm sure the police have rules too.

653
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,672
I will not talk about research
that hasn't been completed.

654
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,469
Do you know Choi Ro-hee well?

655
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,305
Ro-hee.

656
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,140
She's a clever girl.

657
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,185
She's currently missing.

658
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:11,811
By any chance,

659
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,855
do you know him?

660
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,863
No, I've never seen him before.

661
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,366
Is that research

662
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,702
related to Choi Ro-hee?

663
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:32,624
I will answer further questions

664
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,752
with my lawyer present.

665
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,381
Excuse me.

666
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:44,469
This is my card.

667
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,973
Please give me a call
if you change your mind.

668
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,656
Sir, a lawyer is here for us.

669
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,751
Are you in charge
of Dr. Choi Jin-tae's case?

670
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:18,378
Yes.

671
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,880
We're the lawyers of Choi Dong-jun,

672
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:23,925
Dr. Choi Jin-tae's uncle
and the chairman of EI Construction.

673
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,553
We represent

674
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,138
the late Dr. Choi Jin-tae's family.

675
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:30,974
LAW FIRM J
PARK JEONG-HUN

676
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,600
I see. What brings you here?

677
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,977
We're here to file a complaint

678
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:37,063
for making the case public
without the family's consent.

679
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,482
The kid is still kidnapped.

680
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,776
Without ensuring the safety of the victim,

681
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,612
the police autonomously made the case--

682
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:47,115
Making the case public
was the best decision to make

683
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,533
for Choi Ro-hee's safety.

684
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,327
Please stop further coverage.

685
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:54,330
The family's reputation
is being severely damaged.

686
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:56,874
Any other words you want to say?

687
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:58,960
Sorry?

688
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,840
The hardest part of a kidnapping case
is facing the victim's family.

689
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,759
No one can console the hearts
of the families longing for the victims.

690
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,304
You're here on behalf of her family.

691
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,056
Is there no one in her relatives

692
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,435
looking and longing for her?

693
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,147
If you understand how the families feel,

694
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:21,482
don't forget what I said today.

695
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,192
Goodbye.

696
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,242
Jeez.

697
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,164
A child is missing
and her so-called family is...

698
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,459
-Seoul Jungbu Police Station called.
-And?

699
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,669
Kim Myeong-jun and Choi Ro-hee
got off at Seoul Station

700
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,713
and walked to Namdaemun.

701
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,008
But they couldn't find them
through the CCTV from there.

702
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,259
What?

703
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,845
There are CCTVs everywhere in Seoul.

704
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,889
They lost them.

705
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:55,725
Park Sang-yun.

706
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,353
Chief wants to see you.

707
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:06,647
Oh. These stupid cops.

708
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,322
Calm down and eat this.

709
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:14,577
If they publicize this case
and show our faces,

710
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,497
who knows what this scumbag will do to me?

711
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,042
Fine, call me as you like.

712
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,212
Scumbag or dirtbag, call me what you want.

713
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,421
Here.

714
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,006
That's hot!

715
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,091
It's still hot.

716
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:29,342
It is?

717
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:32,929
Here.

718
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,439
Are you sure this is the right place?
Why isn't she coming?

719
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,650
What if she moved?

720
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,112
This is the right place.
And there's nothing we can do if she did.

721
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:50,613
I guess you're right.

722
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,783
I doubt she'd tell her stalker
where she moved to.

723
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,660
I told you I'm not a stalker!

724
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,124
Hey, she's here.

725
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,668
She's here.

726
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,516
Excuse me.

727
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:27,817
Who are you?

728
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,152
You know me, right?

729
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,487
We should talk.

730
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,547
It's chilly outside.
Don't you have anything warm?

731
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,508
Myeong-jun.

732
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,014
Why would you come here?

733
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,142
You want the cops to barge in here?

734
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,226
An accomplice...

735
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,606
should also take responsibility
when things don't go as planned.

736
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,150
Did you tell her everything?

737
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,819
You think that's the issue here?

738
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,488
I heard you came up with the plan.

739
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,997
What is it that you want to say?

740
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,957
I should be the one asking questions.

741
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,960
Why did you plan to kidnap me?

742
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,337
Money, of course.

743
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,006
But why did it have to be my family?

744
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,551
Are you...

745
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:38,137
the murderer?

746
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,150
Because your parents...

747
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,154
wouldn't have reported you missing.

748
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,034
Your dad...

749
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,455
wouldn't have reported it
because he wouldn't want to expose

750
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,166
the fact that he abused his child.

751
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,211
Don't be ridiculous.

752
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,756
He won't report me missing
because of some bruises?

753
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,635
Was my dad that stupid?

754
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:23,558
If my dad was a prominent figure,
he must've had ties to the police,

755
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,810
so he could've come up

756
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,813
with a decent excuse about the bruises.

757
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,984
Impressive,

758
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,320
Choi Ro-hee.

759
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:38,906
So the rumors were true.

760
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,954
Dr. Choi's family
is putting pressure on the higher-ups.

761
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:48,958
They want to keep this case
as private as possible.

762
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,543
Why are they taking it so far?

763
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,462
Dr. Choi Jin-tae was their only son.

764
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:58,426
His relatives all lawyered up,
trying to get a part of his asset.

765
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:01,762
Who do you think
is the greatest enemy in that fight?

766
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,433
Their 11-year-old niece
is their greatest enemy?

767
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,351
I mean, she's been kidnapped.

768
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,270
I'm sure you've heard,

769
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,106
but she's no ordinary 11-year-old.

770
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,236
She's a genius?

771
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,741
No wonder!

772
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,243
My goodness.

773
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:27,079
Why aren't you surprised?

774
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,665
You remember that you were a genius?

775
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,958
I don't.

776
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,878
But seeing that I'm not surprised,
I think it's true.

777
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,507
Stop changing the subject.

778
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,763
What I'm saying is your reasoning
isn't valid.

779
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:45,973
Why not?

780
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,185
Does a kidnapper
need any other reason than that?

781
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,187
I think you'll need one.

782
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:55,149
Or you'll be the one
who murdered my parents.

783
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,318
I'm the witness.

784
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,198
If you say
you only followed this lady's orders,

785
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,658
your sentence will be reduced.

786
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,620
Your family is rich.

787
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,998
And your dad was a director
of a prominent hospital.

788
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,376
You think child abuse means nothing

789
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,878
when your dad has such a noble reputation?

790
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:17,505
Hey, watch what you say to a kid.

791
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,714
What abuse?

792
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,384
What did he do to me?

793
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,471
I don't know anything more.

794
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,517
By the way, do you think a kidnapper

795
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,311
who planned all this
would kill the victim's parents?

796
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,522
-They're the source of money.
-Right.

797
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,023
Wait.

798
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,109
You didn't receive any money?

799
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,277
How am I supposed to?

800
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,072
Then who paid for Hee-ae's hospital bill?

801
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,117
Someone paid her hospital bill?

802
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,245
Yes, including the surgery fee.
Someone paid 50 million won.

803
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,708
I have no idea.

804
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,210
I was in Seoul the whole time.
I wasn't even near Youngin.

805
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,878
What?

806
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,922
You think that's something to be proud of?

807
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,132
That means you left Hee-ae...

808
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,384
Hey.

809
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,761
I told you to stay by her side
until this was all over.

810
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,096
And you didn't even come for a day?

811
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,848
Do you even know she's due for surgery?

812
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,391
You call yourself a mom?!

813
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,642
Lower your voice.

814
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,228
The neighbors call the police
over minor noise disturbances here.

815
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,153
Go to a motel for the night.

816
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,031
Haven't you seen the news?

817
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,658
It's dangerous wherever we go.

818
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,410
Are you insisting on sleeping here then?

819
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,498
Or we can all hold hands
and stay the night at the police station.

820
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:48,262
The girl doesn't
consider the kidnapper hostile.

821
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,851
They're moving together
as if they're a team.

822
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:14,121
MAP OF YOUNGIN

823
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:23,798
What are you going to do now?

824
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:30,971
I should hold out...

825
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,600
until Hee-ae gets her surgery.

826
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,353
But will the police leave you be?

827
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,439
I'm sure they already know...

828
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,485
what kind of person you are.

829
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,624
KIM MYEONG-JUN, CHOI RO-HEE

830
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,424
Sir, take a look.

831
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,056
Kim Myeong-jun has a record.

832
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:22,523
NAME: KIM MYEONG-JUN

833
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,694
CRIME: MURDER

834
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,574
Murder?

835
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,825
THE KIDNAPPING DAY

836
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,342
Kim Myeong-jun has a record?

837
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,552
-Murder?
-You're still doubting me, aren't you?

838
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:34,637
Let's turn ourselves in.

839
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,764
You think we can lay low forever?

840
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,390
So you're going to turn yourself in?

841
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:41,185
You're the only one I can trust right now.

842
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,103
I'll protect you no matter what.

843
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,522
It feels like the kid is taking the lead.

844
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:47,107
It's like they're working together.

845
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,360
What is he hiding?

846
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:52,613
There's only one case where these acronyms
are used all at once.

847
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,240
The Genius Child Project.

848
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,743
We have to find Ro-hee
before the police do.

849
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:59,703
We'll be taking Choi Ro-hee.

850
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:00,663
Ro-hee!

851
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,581
I made a promise with Ro-hee today

852
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:03,707
that I'd protect her.

853
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,586
Stop right there.

854
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,382
