192
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,910
It was not that hard.

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,190
[Motor Vehicle Driving License of the People's Republic of China]

194
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,070
From now on,

195
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,790
your mom and I

196
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,810
will take turns

197
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,910
driving the cab.

198
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,150
Hand me that rod.

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,490
Your mom and I will take shifts

200
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,240
to drive the cab.

201
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,430
As for the affairs at home,

202
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,670
don't worry about them.

203
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,870
Just focus on your studies.

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,910
Dad.

205
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,990
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,930
What trouble have you gotten into now, you brat?

207
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,270
Dad,

208
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,870
I've grown up.

209
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,350
When I get into college

210
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,730
and start earning money,

211
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,260
I'll buy you a big ship.

212
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,510
Alright, I'll be waiting for you.

213
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,990
I want the biggest ship.

214
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
How about a 10,000-ton ship?

215
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,290
Cut the crap.

216
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,740
Can a 10,000-ton ship even run on that river?

217
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,490
You're making empty promises again, aren't you?

218
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,650
You little brat!

219
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,190
Come here!

220
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,960
Put the knife down!

221
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,840
Put the knife down!

222
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,470
How dare you!

223
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,110
Xingchi, what are you doing?

224
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,110
He hit my mom!

225
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,740
You...

226
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,180
Why did you drink during the day?

227
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,790
Indeed.

228
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,050
Your kid is taking the college entrance exam tomorrow.

229
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,040
What are you doing?

230
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,650
If you want to kill me, just do it!

231
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,660
I've long since stopped living like a human anyway!

232
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,030
What are you talking about?

233
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,750
What... what's going on here?

234
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,960
Don't pull me!

235
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,270
Mr. Zhou,

236
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,510
do you know that I'm writing

237
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,630
The Story of Flower Street?

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,030
Yes, I do. I've been looking forward to it.

239
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,380
I was halfway through writing this book

240
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,990
when I went to apply for a cultural project,

241
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,220
but it got rejected.

242
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,810
Today, I found out

243
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,680
that the only spot at the cultural museum

244
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,280
went to Chen Bo.

245
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,420
Guess what he said about me?

246
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,970
He said I was jealous of him.

247
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,060
What does he have that I should be jealous of?

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,240
Why would I be jealous of a guy

249
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,510
who lives off his wife?

250
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,830
Alright. Why did you mention this?

251
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,440
Mr. Shao, Mr. Shao.

252
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,610
Hurry up and go back to studying!

253
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,960
I rely on my own abilities to make a living,

254
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,900
yet my son keeps making sarcastic comments by my side.

255
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,960
Who wouldn't feel bad...

256
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,180
Xingchi, Xingchi!

257
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,620
You were the one being sarcastic first!

258
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,990
You were the one being sarcastic first!

259
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,380
If you're so capable, get into a good university first,

260
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,750
then come and mock me!

261
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,610
To hell with good universities!

262
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,040
You're from a good university, aren't you?

263
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,170
But you have to pay to publish your own books!

264
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,910
How proud you must be!

265
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,160
You bastard!

266
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,230
Stop it!

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,550
Both of you, stop it!

268
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,350
Mr. Shao, what's more important now?

269
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,610
Why are you saying this now?

270
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,710
Don't take frustration you feel at work out

271
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,390
on your wife and kid.

272
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,110
Exactly.

273
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,590
Listen to me.

274
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,390
Apologize to your child.

275
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,030
Go on. Go, go, go.

276
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,870
You just need to apologize to him.

277
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,390
Apologize.

278
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,510
Apologize to him.

279
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,800
I apologize to him?

280
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,500
A father apologizing to his son?

281
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,640
Is there any justice in this world?

282
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,390
I raised him for eighteen years for nothing?

283
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,520
Shao Bingyi!

284
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,450
Remember this!

285
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,710
From now on, I won't need you to support me anymore!

286
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,310
You're selfish and self-centered!

287
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,260
All you have is a degree,

288
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,330
but you're useless at work!

289
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,150
Every time you drink, you end up hitting my mom!

290
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,630
You want me to succeed, right?

291
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm not taking the college entrance exam!

292
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,030
Don't move!

293
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,510
Kid!

294
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,240
Xingchi!

295
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,670
How did this...

296
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,990
Yuling, this...

297
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,500
What should we do?

298
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:17,870
Let's go, let's go.

299
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,340
What should we do?

300
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,830
Quickly, carry her into the room!

301
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,910
Get her inside the room, hurry!

302
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,510
Hurry!

303
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,110
Gosh.

304
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,230
Hurry up.

305
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,230
Hurry up.

306
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,980
Mom,

307
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm not going to college.

308
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,990
Let me take you away.

309
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,960
Where to?

310
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
As long as it's away from here and away from him,

311
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,230
we can go anywhere.

312
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,280
Your dad just has a bad temper

313
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,970
and speaks harshly,

314
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,860
but he did a lot for us!

315
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,880
No matter how much he has done for us, he has worn down our gratitude.

316
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,600
Mom, trust me.

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,540
I have hands and feet.

318
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,900
If we leave him, we'll live better.

319
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,040
I won't let you suffer.

320
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,830
Are you trying to give your mother a heart attack?

321
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,750
You think you've got it all figured out, huh?

322
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,250
College is right around the corner,

323
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,440
and you said you wouldn't go!

324
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,140
You even tore up your admission ticket!

325
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,640
You're unbelievable.

326
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,440
You're so childish.

327
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,960
What am I supposed to do with you?

328
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,520
Going to college or not isn't that important, Mom.

329
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,010
As long as we leave that drunkard,

330
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,660
life will definitely be better than it is now.

331
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,340
Mom, I know.

332
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,790
I know you're afraid I'll suffer,

333
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,630
or be mistreated.

334
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,940
I was a kid before

335
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,190
and couldn't take care of myself.

336
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,990
But I'm different now.

337
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,800
I've grown up.

338
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,830
I've grown up.

339
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,950
From now on,

340
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,360
you have to learn to live for yourself.

341
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,070
Here.

342
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Take a break.

343
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,360
Have the soup before you go back to studying.

344
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,230
I'm not hungry.

345
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
You didn't have dinner.

346
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,430
Are you cultivating?

347
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,340
Drink it up.

348
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,310
What university do you want to go to?

349
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,470
Honghuai Normal University.

350
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,470
With your grades,

351
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,880
you could get into a top university.

352
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm going to a normal university because it's close to home.

353
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,490
You want to stay with your grandma, right?

354
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,330
Well...

355
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,950
now,

356
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,780
you don't have to.

357
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,230
You can choose a university that suits you.

358
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,020
Normal universities suit me just fine.

359
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,350
How much money can you make as a teacher?

360
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,110
Listen to me.

361
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,970
Choose finance,

362
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,070
or accounting.

363
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,390
Go to a university in a big city.

364
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,520
After graduation, work hard

365
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,530
and get a household registration in a first-tier city.

366
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,420
Then you can bring your brother there too.

367
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,150
And I'll...

368
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,540
You don't need to take care of me.

369
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,480
Really.

370
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,470
But your brother is your blood after all.

371
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,200
You should take care of him.

372
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,040
Come on.

373
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,870
How do you want me to take care of him?

374
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,440
Take him everywhere I go?

375
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,320
Spend all the money I earn in the future on him?

Can't I choose not to go to university?

563
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,910
Not...

564
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,600
Not going to university?

565
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,980
Are you going to find a job?

566
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,220
What can you even do?

567
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,200
You can barely support yourself.

568
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,740
You don't need to be concerned about my life.

569
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,590
You didn't care before,

570
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,670
so don't bother me in the future either.

571
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,460
Fine.

572
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,840
You're not going to university, huh?

573
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,060
Okay.

574
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,010
Then quit school.

575
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,210
Just quit.

576
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,270
I should sell this house

577
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,050
as soon as possible.

578
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,420
Why are you selling it?

579
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,950
Flower Street has no future.

580
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,820
And the canal is in decline.

581
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,400
The house prices are dropping day by day.

582
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,170
I've already inquired about it.

583
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,900
This house is worth at least a hundred thousand now.

584
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,330
We can just live off the interest.

585
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,640
Get out!

586
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,320
Get out of here!

587
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,730
Let go of me!

588
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,360
Wait!

589
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,960
It's not your house!

590
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,310
What's going on?

591
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,590
Why are you arguing?

592
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,030
I'm not insisting on doing this.

593
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,180
Why are you getting so worked up?

594
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,010
I have no intention of discussing this with you.

595
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,690
This house is absolutely not for sale.

596
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,750
If you want to invest,

597
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,920
use your own money!

598
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,100
Have you gone crazy from being poor?

599
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,920
This house was left to Siyi by Granny.

600
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,820
What right do you have to sell it?

601
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,010
Siyi, don't worry.

602
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,880
We're all here for you.

603
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,210
She can't take this house away.

604
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,070
We won't let her take it!

605
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,010
I never said I was going to take it.

606
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,090
I'm just trying to discuss this with her reasonably.

607
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,460
Come on, you guys.

608
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,400
Besides,

609
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,290
this house belongs to my mother-in-law.

610
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,390
Technically, I have a right to use it.

611
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,910
You've remarried.

612
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,560
Legally,

613
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,430
Granny Ma is no longer your mother-in-law!

614
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,010
That's right!

615
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Exactly!

616
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,830
Siyi is my own daughter.

617
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,590
Everything I do is for her own good.

618
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,800
If you really want what's best for her,

619
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,790
just keep the house.

620
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,420
Let's not talk about the financial aspect for now.

621
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,780
Emotionally,

622
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
this child surely can't bear to let it go.

623
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,230
Yes. Keeping this house

624
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,050
will at least leave this child something to hold on to.

625
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,910
No matter where she goes in the future,

626
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,830
if she gets tired or feels weary,

627
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,030
she'll have a place to return to.

628
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,530
Exactly.

629
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,310
Although the rent from this house doesn't bring in much,

630
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,670
it's still Siyi's home.

631
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,670
You, as her mother...

632
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,830
A home is where family is, okay?

633
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,590
They are my real family!

634
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,350
You abandoned me

635
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,570
when I needed you the most!

636
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,830
How can you expect me to treat you as my mother?

637
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,150
Blood is thicker than water.

638
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,550
No matter what,

639
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,910
I'm still your biological mother.

640
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,580
Grandma is gone,

641
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,470
but I'm still here.

642
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,640
No matter what happens,

643
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,190
I won't

644
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,630
leave you all alone, uncared for.

645
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,390
You?

646
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,270
How are you going to take care of me?

647
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,510
By selling the house, swindling all the money,

648
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,920
and disappearing again?

649
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,390
In the past, you always went to Grandma when you were in trouble.

650
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,680
Now it's me.

651
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,930
You have to squeeze every last bit out of me

652
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,030
before you're satisfied, don't you?

653
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,860
How could you say that?

654
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,010
Every family has its own difficulties.

655
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,240
Then don't be my family!

656
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,290
Who asked you to?

657
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,670
From now on,

658
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,070
you are you and I am me!

659
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,220
We'll live our separate lives.

660
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,710
No matter how difficult or tough it gets for me,

661
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,020
I will never ask you for help!

662
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,130
Siyi,

663
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
you didn't even get into university.

664
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,310
I'm not well-off either.

665
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,830
Who's going to support you in the future?

666
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,910
I will!

667
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,670
From now on,

668
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,750
you don't need to worry about Siyi.

669
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
She has me,

670
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,810
brothers and sisters,

671
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,790
and the neighbors.

672
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,910
As long as we're here,

673
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,250
we won't let Siyi suffer!

674
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,600
The kid is right!

675
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,120
Yes.

676
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,820
Exactly.

677
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,160
We're all here for her.

678
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,060
You're all family.

679
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,450
You're all family.

680
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,650
Is that enough?

681
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,580
I'm her only enemy here.

682
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,410
You heartless kid.

683
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
Fine. I'll get lost.

684
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,870
Siwei!

685
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,650
Your sister finds you annoying!

686
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,060
Let's get lost!

687
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,720
Come on, pack your things!

688
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,170
Pack your things!

689
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,150
Siyi,

690
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,000
don't make me leave!

691
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,280
I'll be good!

692
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,780
I'm not trying to make you leave.

693
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,910
When I get back on my feet,

694
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,180
I'll come to pick you up, okay?

695
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,230
No!

696
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,270
I don't want to go with her,

697
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,220
Siyi.

698
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,030
I'm not capable enough right now.

699
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,630
But when I am,

700
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,320
I'll come to get you, okay, Siwei?

701
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,870
No!

702
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,870
Pinky swear, pinky swear.

703
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,250
I'll definitely come.

704
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,290
Cross my heart, hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.

705
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,270
Take good care of yourself, okay?

706
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,020
I gave birth to her, and now I'm the bad guy.

707
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,270
Isn't it just because I'm poor?

708
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,370
I'll get lost. Is that enough?

709
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,340
Stop crying!

710
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,250
Take this!

711
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,570
Siyi!

712
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,110
Let's go!

713
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,310
Take good care of yourself, okay?

714
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,750
Siyi!

715
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,350
I'll just pretend I never gave birth to her!

716
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,730
Siyi!

717
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,570
Let's go!

718
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,870
Siyi!

719
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,210
Siyi!

720
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
Be careful not to step on his face.

721
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
Both of us are going to Beijing.

722
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,960
What about you?

723
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm going to Beijing too.

724
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,950
To work and make money.

725
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,210
You're really not going to repeat the year?

726
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,300
Let's talk about the future when it comes.

727
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,300
Anyway, I can't stand staying in Flower Street for even one more day.

728
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,760
Because of your dad?

729
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,230
Now, whenever I see his face,

730
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,760
I get so angry I can't hold it in.

731
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm really afraid that one day I...

732
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,020
Actually, your dad is pretty good to you.

733
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,210
He's just a bit naggy,

734
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,910
but he's not a bad person.

735
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,790
I know.

736
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,620
But every time he's drunk, he hits my mom.

737
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,500
I really can't stand it.

738
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,480
I tried to persuade my mom to leave,

739
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,700
but she refuses to.

740
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,960
Why?

741
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe she just can't let go.

742
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,550
I don't know either.

743
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,590
I'll go to Beijing first.

744
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,680
When I make some money and buy a house,

745
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,130
I'll bring my mom over.

746
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,070
They call that capable?

747
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,340
Slow down!

748
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,030
The whole of Flower Street is picking on just me?

749
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,560
Hurry up!

750
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,920
If you don't move fast, your sister will kick you out!

751
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,350
Have you no shame?

752
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,810
Are you bullying me because I don't have a husband?

753
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Siwei.

754
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,570
Siwei.

755
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,800
You're picking on me alone!

756
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,080
Brother-in-law!

757
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,530
What Brother-in-law?

758
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,530
Let's go!

759
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,949
Brother-in-law!

760
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,290
What's wrong?

761
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
I want Brother-in-law!

762
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,400
You little shameless brat!

763
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,310
You're so young and already calling someone Brother-in-law!

764
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,440
What's wrong with her mom now?

765
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,110
Brother-in-law!

766
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,110
When I make it big one day,

767
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,040
you won't be able to kiss my ass!

768
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,190
What's going on?

769
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,429
What brother-in-law?

770
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,790
Where is she taking Siwei?

771
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,780
You ungrateful little brat,

772
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,300
let's go!

773
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,510
Your sister likes you, huh?

774
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,139
Then go and live with her!

775
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,889
Get lost!

776
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,590
Get lost!

777
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,310
You said it yourself.

778
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,340
Brother-in-law!

779
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,320
Brother-in-law!

780
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,150
Come back!

781
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,300
Ge Siwei!

782
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,630
Come back here!

783
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,429
Little brat!

784
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,429
Come back here!

785
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,730
Come back!

786
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,520
Ge Siwei!

787
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,570
Come back!

788
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,480
Don't climb over!

789
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,990
Get down!

790
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,230
-Siwei, it's dangerous!
-Stop!

791
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,950
-Siwei!
-Get down! It's dangerous!

792
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,660
-Siwei!
-It's dangerous!

793
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,310
Get down!

794
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:09,830
There's a ship!

795
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,590
Don't jump!

796
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,450
Siwei!

797
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,270
Siwei!

798
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,790
Siwei!

799
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,300
Siwei!

800
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,410
Siyi!

801
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,100
Siyi!

802
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,670
Your brother...

803
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,010
What happened to my brother?

804
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,310
Your brother, he...

805
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,260
What happened to him?

806
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,630
Why did you call him?

807
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,740
Auntie!

808
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,270
Give me back my son!

809
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,190
Auntie!

810
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,230
Auntie, calm down!

811
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,630
If you hadn't called him, he wouldn't have jumped!

812
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,350
Calm down, calm down!

813
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,910
What do you want?

814
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,390
Give me back my son!

815
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,140
Where's Siwei?

816
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,750
They're still conducting the search and recovery.

817
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,840
So far, only some of his remains have been found.

818
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,610
My condolences.

819
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,700
Your brother's fate...

820
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,620
was so tragic.

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,690
They killed him!

822
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,070
They killed him!

823
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,910
Nonsense!

824
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,680
He died because you were chasing him!

825
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,350
He jumped off the bridge to get away from you!

826
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,650
No!

827
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,810
Siyi,

828
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,140
it was not like that.

829
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,070
They killed him!

830
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,740
You bastard!

831
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,470
It was all your fault!

832
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,600
Bastard!

833
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,350
Bastard! Bastard!

834
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,950
Auntie.

835
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,510
Why did you call him?

836
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,660
Calm down, calm down.

837
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,230
If you hadn't called him, he wouldn't have died!

838
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,220
Give me back my son's life!

839
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,460
Give me back my son's life!

840
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,060
Siyi!

841
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,280
Siyi!

842
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,820
It was not your fault.

843
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,890
If anyone's to blame, it's his mother.

844
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,900
She actually had the nerve to turn things around and blame us.

845
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,470
I shouldn't have called him.

846
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,030
If he had just walked straight over,

847
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,620
maybe he wouldn't have jumped.

848
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,670
I've told you

849
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,350
several times

850
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:15,790
that it wasn't your fault.

851
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,630
Are you out of your mind?

852
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,910
Are you a nagging widow?

853
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,270
If his mom hadn't chased after him,

854
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,610
would Siwei have jumped?

855
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,800
The root cause is his mother.

856
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,270
Stop it.

857
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,880
Siyi,

858
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,240
my mom made wontons

859
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,670
with shepherd's purse filling.

860
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,350
Have some.

861
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,420
At least eat a little.

862
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,130
Otherwise, you won't be able to hold up.

863
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,340
I'll have to go to the hospital to take care of you.

864
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,220
Be good. Just eat ten of them.

865
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm just worried she won't be able to handle it.

866
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,070
Why don't we...

867
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,680
go down and talk to Siyi for a bit?

868
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,770
What should we say when we see her?

869
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,030
Then what should we do?

870
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,350
Fenghua is with her.

871
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,210
Siyi won't do anything drastic.

872
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,480
Mom, hurry up.

873
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,610
Get me two more.

874
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,500
Siyi,

875
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,000
open the door.

876
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,340
Siyi?

877
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,360
Siyi.

878
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,250
Have some wontons.

879
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,430
I'll leave them here for you.

880
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,990
My mom said,

881
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,930
if you want to cry, just cry out loud.

882
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,030
Don't hold it in.

883
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,200
It's bad for your health.

884
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,120
I've already cried.

885
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,490
How come I didn't hear you cry?

886
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,790
If you don't know what to say, then say nothing.

887
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,840
Let's sleep together tonight.

888
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:56,900
You can hide under the blanket and cry.

889
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,780
And I'll be with you.

890
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,010
No need. I'm really fine.

891
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,410
Stop it. You've always been like this since you were a kid.

892
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,800
When you're hurt,

893
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,010
you always keep it inside and never tell anyone.

894
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,430
My mom said it can cause breast cancer.

895
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,780
Can I ask you a favor?

896
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,130
Go ahead.

897
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,420
Go out with me for a walk.

898
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,240
Before the college entrance exam,

899
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,590
Siwei dreamed of Grandma.

900
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,010
He dreamt of her

901
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,210
riding a bike with Grandpa.

902
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,260
I was so angry.

903
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,940
Why were you angry?

904
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,020
Grandma appeared in his dream

905
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,430
but ignored me.

906
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,670
She didn't want you to be sad.

907
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,510
She couldn't bear to see that.

908
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,120
Look ahead.

909
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,180
Granny's gone,

910
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,650
but we're still here.
