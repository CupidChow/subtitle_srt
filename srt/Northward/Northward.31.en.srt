[NORTHWARD]

2
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,030
[Episode 31]

3
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,590
Hit me all you want.

4
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,390
I won't fight back. Come on.

5
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,460
Does it kill you to

6
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,200
stay out of trouble?

7
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,470
You didn't even ask me why.

8
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't care why!

9
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,190
You beat someone up

10
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,680
and they posted it online right away!

11
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
I had a hard time stopping it from trending!

12
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,360
He didn't see us as human.

13
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,430
He deserved it!

14
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,470
Shao Xingchi.

15
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,300
Even now,

16
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
do you still not get the severity of the situation?

17
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,460
I'm ignorant.

18
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,630
I don't understand the strange rules

19
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,870
of your big company!

20
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,820
Then

21
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,800
you can ask me.

22
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Forget it, Xie Wanghe.

23
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,320
I wish you'd hear me out instead.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,650
Go ahead.

25
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm listening.

26
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,040
Let's hear what grievances you have.

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,920
I hope

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
that everyone who follows me

29
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,770
can be treated as human beings,

30
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,150
be accepted

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,430
and respected.

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,690
But you...

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,360
you just treat them as tools

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
for profit and expanding capital.

35
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,690
And then?

36
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,270
You weren't like this before.

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,800
You were tough on the outside but soft-hearted.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,990
You were kind to everyone!

39
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,800
I thought even if nobody understood me,

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
you would!

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,810
So what?

42
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,730
We can't talk if you're going to be like this.

43
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,079
Listen up.

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,230
Do you know

45
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,810
how many job opportunities

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,740
Bee alone provides in a year?

47
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,190
Do you know how many people

48
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,240
make a living by delivering food?

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,740
I understand you have a kind heart,

50
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,390
but you can't be selfish!

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,290
Back then,

52
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,360
you said you wanted to be the station chief.

53
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,310
I used stock options as collateral

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
to make that happen.

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,770
But what did you do?

56
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,270
You led everyone with a heart of gold

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,930
and almost

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,990
ran the station into the ground.

59
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,240
And your subordinates couldn't make money!

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,810
All you talk about is making money.

61
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,530
What about your conscience?

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,090
Is making money that important?

63
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,900
When you're very rich,

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,950
you have the luxury to think money isn't important.

65
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,950
But when everyone

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,570
is waiting for their next meal,

67
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,320
money

68
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,519
is very important!

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,910
I know

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
you mean well.

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,610
And then?

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,500
They don't appreciate it.

73
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,810
Then you

74
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,200
pity their misfortune

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,770
and bemoan their lack of ambition.

76
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,610
You feel your well intentions are being treated like dirt.

77
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,070
Do you feel particularly wronged?

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Delivery riders are humans too.

79
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,850
They also need care

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,159
and someone to protect

81
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,210
their legal rights,

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
you know?

83
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,310
Did I withhold their pay?

84
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,450
I even enhanced their commission and rewards!

85
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,190
I provide job opportunities.

86
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,770
If they take the job, they have to work.

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,060
If they don't like it, they can leave.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,050
No one is forcing them to work themselves to death.

89
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,100
The rules you set are inducing them to do that,

90
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,970
you know?

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,680
Listen up.

92
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,810
In a competitive society,

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
you're compensated according

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,630
to the effort you put in.

95
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,710
We're adults now!

96
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
We're not kids playing house!

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,500
We still can't satisfy everyone!

98
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,370
Shao Xingchi.

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,700
We're both Beijing drifters.

100
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,780
After all these years,

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,430
you know how much we've suffered.

102
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,700
That's why I especially treasure this opportunity.

103
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,780
I want to do a good job

104
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,130
and prove myself.

105
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,880
But what about you?

106
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,580
With the opportunity I fought hard for,

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,040
you want to realize a utopia.

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,750
No problem.

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I support you.

110
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,070
I hope your dreams come true.

111
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,270
But...

112
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,060
use your own money and resources to play house

113
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,330
from now on.

114
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,300
I wish you success!

115
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,050
Where are you?

116
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,330
What are you doing?

117
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,630
Where are you?

118
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,750
I'll come find you.

119
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,390
Don't.

120
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,290
Where are you?

121
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,950
[Haikuo]

122
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,570
Guess.

123
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,720
I'll tell you if you guess right.

124
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,000
What's wrong with you?

125
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,300
We broke up.

126
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Who dumped whom?

127
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,180
What do you think?

128
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,910
Why?

129
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,280
Speak up.

130
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,130
Because I'm poor.

131
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,160
What else could it be?

132
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,230
Did you tell her you have stock options now?

133
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,130
Do I need money to keep her?

134
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,850
What else do you think you could rely on?

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,179
Your good looks?

136
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,870
Your abs?

137
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,809
Do you have any?

138
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,080
Stop trying to test human nature.

139
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,750
It's pointless.

140
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,880
Cut the crap.

141
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,490
What's the matter?

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,690
Xingchi and I...

143
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,470
fell out.

144
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,110
Aren't you surprised?

145
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,430
How many times have you two fallen out?

146
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,350
And you always say,

147
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,330
"I'll never see him again!"

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,770
And what happens?

149
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,240
This time

150
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,280
might be different.

151
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,270
This incident

152
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
has seriously

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
damaged our company's image.

154
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Public opinion is spreading the issue.

155
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,200
Mr. Meng.

156
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Come in.

157
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,390
The Series D funding was about to be finalized,

158
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,060
but because of Shao Xingchi's incident,

159
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,120
it's been delayed again.

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,320
He's already resigned.

162
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,120
As for his issue,

163
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,440
I'll handle it appropriately.

164
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,270
It's about time.

165
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,630
That bastard

166
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,590
is a bad apple.

167
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,750
Alright.

168
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,870
Let's talk business.

169
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,090
Lately,

170
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
the competition with Yuntu has intensified.

171
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,220
The pressure is immense.

172
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,250
I plan to apply for subsidies.

173
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,770
Finally caved in, huh?

174
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,390
Who was it

175
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,640
who insisted on not taking subsidies?

176
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,040
Times have changed.

177
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,300
This time, the subsidies

178
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,790
aren't for the delivery riders

179
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,360
but for the businesses.

180
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,370
We'll subsidize three to five yuan each

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
for businesses who've worked with us.

182
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,870
Also,

183
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,000
we'll require them

184
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,600
to sign exclusive contracts with us.

185
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,570
That won't be easy.

186
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
I've done some research.

187
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,590
It's promising.

188
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,930
Haikuo has analyzed it based on big data.

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,010
Your buddy again?

190
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,020
Can we trust him

191
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,230
not to harm us this time?

192
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,020
I firmly believe

193
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,830
it'll work out this time.

Mom? Why are you here?

577
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,480
Your aunt saw news online

578

that said you beat up customers and got sued.

Mom, can you not listen to that nonsense online?

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
It's all rubbish. I didn't hit anyone.

726
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,400

To win this battle,

730
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,300
the company has invested heavily.

731
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,070
They've raised the subsidies to the max limit.

732
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,410
If we lose,

733
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,380
the investors will abandon us.

734
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,930
We'll have to forget about Series D funding.

So if we fail this battle,

736
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,850
we'll be doomed.

738
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,730
Okay. Okay.

how tough it is on us riders?

00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,700
We have no choice.

00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,070
The new hires are all rookies.

755
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,600
When the orders start pouring in,

756
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,840
we can't handle it.

757
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,170
I've brought this up with them.

758
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,480
The company is in a tight spot too.

759
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,400
We're already short-staffed.

760
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,950
Other platforms are poaching people everywhere.

761
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,840
We have to figure it out ourselves.

762
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,070
An order for two.

763
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,120
Sorry, Mr. Xie. Thank you for waiting.

764
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,460
Take a look.

765
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,150
Isn't business booming?

766
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,390
When lunchtime comes around,

767
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,380
our dozens of franchises receive

768
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,800
thousands of orders.

769
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,870
Your platform alone

770
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,930
might not be able

771
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,170
to handle such a large volume.

772
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,870
Why don't I sign with some others too?

773
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,460
Don't worry about that.

774
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,380
We can handle any number of orders.

775
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,030
Either we're exclusive

776
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,610
or we terminate our cooperation.

777
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,930
The choice is yours.

778
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,550
Must it be this way, Mr. Xie?

779
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,780
I think if everyone does business

780
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,120
the way you do,

781
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,620
our industry will eventually be ruined.

782
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,070
Just make your choice.

783
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,110
No need for opinions.

784
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,290
Mr. Xie!

785
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,070
Give me more time to consider.

786
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,820
-Mr. Xie.
-Mr. Xie.

787
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,630
Mr. Xie.

788
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,510
Our market share in Haidian

789
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,030
is basically on par with Yuntu now.

790
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,190
The last leg of the journey is the toughest.

791
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,280
We've just caught up with them.

792
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,110
There are even tougher battles ahead.

793
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,610
This noon, we're basically on par with Yuntu,

794
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,360
but they're pushing hard on their delivery speed.

795
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,130
They've reduced it to 32 minutes.

796
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,160
Are they out of their minds?

797
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,550
The weather forecast shows

798
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,410
heavy rain in Beijing for the next three days.

799
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,010

800

For the food delivery industry,

801
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,070
bad weather is our peak season.

802
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,970
Even the heavens are helping us.

803
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,760
Issue a notice immediately.

804
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,230
Mobilize everyone.

805
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,150
We have to face the challenge of the upcoming bad weather.

806
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,440
Within these three days,

807
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,340
we must take our business volume to a new level.

810
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,870
We're just one push away

811
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,450
from defeating Yuntu.

812
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,600

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,440
Yes!

Go with your wife for a prenatal check-up.

820

I can't.

822
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
I can't rest. Bye.

Mr. Xie, there are too many orders today.

We can't handle it.

How about extending the delivery time by one minute?
