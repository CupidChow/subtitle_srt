1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,200
Mom, you're back.

3
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,350
Let's eat.

4
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,150
Okay.

5
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,150
It seems we've got ourselves a little Cinderella in the house.

6
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,150
Here. I didn't use soybean oil to stir-fry it.

7
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,430
I used rapeseed oil.

8
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,840
Stir-frying with rapeseed oil makes it more delicious.

9
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,310
You've learned well from me.

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
You're looking at it again.

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,840
You really want to be a model?

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,079
Mom, I also told Siyi about it just now.

13
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,710
If she could also do the shoot,

14
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,910
that would be awesome.

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,079
It's much faster money than working a regular job.

16
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,680
Aren't you worried they might prefer Siyi

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
and eliminate you?

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,630
That's not likely, is it?

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,079
Who would choose a Xiali when they could have a Mercedes?

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Mom!

21
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
I was just teasing you.

22
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,470
In my heart,

23
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,190
my daughter Fenghua is the prettiest.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Even prettier than Gong Li or Zhang Ziyi,

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
or anyone else.

26
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,400
What's wrong?

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,190
Are you worried?

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,840
If they could only choose one of us for the ad shoot,

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,680
I'd rather they choose Siyi.

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,470
I'm okay with that.

31
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,630
Why?

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,280
I have parents and everything.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Siyi needs the money more than I do.

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,840
What?

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,470
Is it wrong for me to think this way?

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,000
No, it's not wrong.

37
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,470
If you treat her as a friend,

38
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,750
it's right to think of her needs more.

39
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,470
Money-making opportunities,

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
if lost, can be found again.

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,310
But it's just,

42
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,800
if one day,

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,000
you need to give up something else...

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,960
Something else? What do you mean by that?

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,280
It's nothing.

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,000
What is it?

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,150
Never mind.

48
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,360
Fenghua, are you home?

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm not!

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Fenghua.

51
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Go away.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,560
Let's talk for a bit.

53
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,600
Not available.

54
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,400
Come on, just a quick chat.

55
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,630
Come on.

56
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,750
Alright, who wants to go first?

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,390
What is this?

58
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,390
A reimbursement voucher for Chris Lee's concert ticket.

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
What does that mean?

60
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,720
From now on, when you buy concert tickets,

61
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,950
no matter how much they cost,

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
we'll reimburse you.

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,480
That's not necessary.

64
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,270
I don't need your money.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,830
This is our way of showing we care.

66
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,800
Sorry!

67
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,510
We were wrong.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,310
Is Chris good?

69
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,159
Yes.

70
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Does she sing well?

71
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,470
Yes, she does.

72
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
If any one of you dares to mess with me again,

73
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,950
I...

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,910
I'll sneak into your rooms at night

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
and shave all your heads one by one.

76
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
Why aren't you dodging?

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,360
Why are you laughing?

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,950
Don't let this happen again.

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,750
Fixed that. Let's go.

80
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,950
What's got you so happy?

81
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,920
Nothing.

82
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,680
Cheers.

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,070
Alright.

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
The other day,

85
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,240
I ran into Siyi at the hospital. She was going to tutor Chen Rui.

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Well,

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know what I was thinking.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
I... I just

89
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,830
blurted out to Siyi,

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,310
"Why don't you come stay at our place?"

91
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,030
You invited Siyi to live with us?

92
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you trying to kick me out?

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Or are you

94
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,800
trying to create an opportunity for her and our son?

95
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,310
No, it's not like that.

96
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I only did that for our son's studies.

97
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,950
His tutoring while in the hospital is the most important thing right now.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
That girl has been helping Chen Rui.

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,680
And I thought since she's going through a lot,

100
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,159
I wanted to help her out too.

101
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,240
After all, I have a car.

102
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,870
Stop, just stop.

103
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,390
You're meddling too much.

104
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Our son has complained to me many times in private,

105
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
saying you meddle in everything,

106
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,040
from his studies,

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,600
his life, to his friendships.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,430
He's fed up with it.

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,680
Boys need to be given more freedom, you know?

110
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
If I don't take care of those things, who will?

111
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm his mother.

112
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
And speaking of his friendships,

113
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,630
just look at those friends he made,

114
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,720
like Xie Wanghe.

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,270
Is there even one good student among them?

116
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,800
They'll all have a bad influence on him.

117
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Poor grades don't mean they're bad people.

118
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,240
That's a different matter.

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,150
We are all neighbors. We know each other very well.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Besides, Ma Siyi

121
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,390
hangs out with them every day.

122
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
It hasn't affected her studies.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
She got into the same school as our son,

124
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,720
No. 1 High School, right?

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
Oh, please.

126
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,789
Can't you tell your son's got a crush

127
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,840
on Ma Siyi?

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,270
I can.

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,150
So what?

130
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,150
"So what?" Let me tell you.

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,150
This little spark of our son's puppy love

132
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,080
must be strangled at birth.

133
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
It's non-negotiable.

134
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,390
You're too cold-hearted.

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,390
You know what?

136
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,150
I was also

137
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,390
once our son's age.

138
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,720
It's normal for a boy to like a girl.

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
As the ancients said,

140
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,910
"A beautiful and virtuous woman

141
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,790
is what a gentleman pursues."

142
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,910
Back in my day...

143
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,390
What happened back in your day?

144
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,870
Back in my day...

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Which year do you mean exactly?

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
And who's in that story?

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,390
Why haven't you ever told me about this?

148
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,440
Back in my day,

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,390
I didn't have the chance for puppy love.

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
But times are different now.

151
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,720
Our son is at this age when

152
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,910
the more you try to control him, the more he'll rebel, you know?

153
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,870
He'll do the opposite of what you say.

154
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,910
So according to you, I should just leave him alone

155
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,720
and let him be?

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
Free to date like you were?

157
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,440
You need to use the right approaches and methods.

158
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,360
We should learn wisdom from the ancients.

159
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,870
Look at how Yu the Great controlled the floods.

160
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,360
He mainly adopted the method of diversion and channeling instead of...

161
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't give me that useless talk.

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,630
Let me tell you.

163
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,150
Regarding our son's puppy love,

164
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,360
you better handle it well.

165
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,670
Show me what great wisdom you have.

166
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,720
If you can't handle it properly,

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,550
we'll deal with it from the root.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
Then you'll have to come clean with me:

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,440
Who was your puppy love?

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,840
What's her name?

171
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,480
Where is she now?

172
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,910
Are you still in contact?

173
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Is our son taking after you?

174
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,750
Please rest assured, Boss.

175
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,480
I promise I'll complete the mission.

176
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,360
Dad.

177
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,960
What's up?

178
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,480
Can you do me a favor?

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,150
Go ahead.

180
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,750
Could you help me deliver this letter?

181
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,720
A love letter?

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,960
No, it's not.

183
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,840
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Don't make wild guesses.

185
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,910
It's nothing like that.

186
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
We're just good friends, nothing more.

187
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,000
There's really nothing going on.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
There's absolutely nothing ambiguous, you know...

189
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,870
Alright, forget it. Just give it back to me.

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,440
It's just the other day,

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,960
my mom said something inappropriate to her, right?

192
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,630
So I thought I'd explain to her.

193
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,480
You understand, right?

194
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,750
Why are you so nervous?

195
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
I'm not your mom.

196
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, right.

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Still...

198
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,720
Besides,

199
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,960
even if it is a love letter,

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,750
so what?

201
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,870
Everyone's written a love letter at some point.

202
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,030
You want to hear my story?

203
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,870
I promise I won't tell Mom.

204
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
When I was in senior high school,

205
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,240
there was also

206
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
a female classmate I was close to.

207
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,200
Back then, I wrote to her a lot, too.

208
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
Just the stamps alone,

209
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,390
I collected enough to fill a small, thick notebook.

210
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
So you'll be a second-generation celebrity?

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,750
I can't say whether I'll be a second-generation celebrity or not,

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,320
but I surely will have connections in the entertainment industry.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,070
Isn't that Siyi?

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,750
Siyi!

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,270
Stop there!

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,030
Siyi!

217
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,750
What are you doing?

218
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you working part-time?

219
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,000
It's none of your business.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,720
Does Grandma know about this?

221
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,480
If you dare to tell her, I won't forgive you.

222
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,720
Siyi.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,720
How much more money do you need?

224
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,720
We'll make up the difference for you.

225
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,240
Go back to school immediately.

226
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you hear me?

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
You should be the one to go to school and study, okay?

228
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
You don't have to worry about me.

229
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
I won't be able to get into university. I only need a diploma.

230
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,120
But you are different.

231
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,670
This last year is very important for you.

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,960
You can't waste a single minute.

233
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,510
Go home!

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,630
If you don't go home, I'll tell your homeroom teacher.

235
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,520
I'll have her contact Grandma.

236
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,200
Let go.

237
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,120
Go home!

238
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Let go of me!

239
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
Can't you just listen to me?

240
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
Xie Wanghe!

241
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,240
You may be able to help me once or twice,

242
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,600
but do you think you can take care of me for a lifetime?

243
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,240
I can!

244
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,200
But I can't.

245
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,910
Siyi!

246
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,750
So,

247
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,440
in the end, which one of you

248
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,960
changed your mind first?

249
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,120
We...

250
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
We never confessed our feelings to each other.

251
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
So

252
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,750
we can't really say who fell out of love first.

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,360
Why didn't you confess your feelings?

254
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,360
How should I put it?

255
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
your generation,

256
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,440
when it comes to relationships,

257
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,630
is more...

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,840
Casual.

259
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,360
If you like someone, you just get together.

260
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,480
If you don't feel it anymore, you break up.

261
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,960
It was different back in our time.

262
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,960
Even if you liked someone,

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,030
you had to weigh it carefully in your mind.

264
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
Weigh it.

265
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,030
Weigh what?

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,870
What is it?

267
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,600
Whether you can make that person happy or not.

268
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,390
If you like someone,

269
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
you only need to be thick-skinned

270
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,550
to confess your feelings.

271
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,550
But if you truly like someone,

272
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,360
you must be clear about

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,480
what you can do for that person.

274
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,000
But if there's something I can't do now,

275
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,870
it doesn't mean I won't be able to do that in the future, right?

276
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,240
Right.

277
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,080
So if you want to make that person happy,

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
you must do everything you can

279
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
to make yourself stand out.

280
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
In a responsible relationship,

281
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,750
actions speak louder than words.

282
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,750
Right now,

283
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,240
you're relying on your parents.

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
If you can't provide that person

285
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,840
with enough support and care

286
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,600
on your own,

287
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,670
then it's not the time to start a relationship.

288
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you alright?

289
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,600
How are you feeling?

290
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,150
What time is it now?

291
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,750
We have to hurry up.

292
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,480
I still have to meet Jiu for the card game.

293
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,360
You're annoying.

294
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
Crippled Sun!

295
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,840
Xie Tiancheng, what are you doing here?

296
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,240
If you don't give me the money today,

297
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,080
I'll kill you!

298
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,910
I told you I have no money. Which part of that you don't understand?

299
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,910
No money? You have no money, but you are fooling around with women?

300
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,150
You even drive a Mercedes.

301
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,510
You've got some nerve, Xie Tiancheng.

302
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,720
You even dare to break in and steal.

303
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,829
Murder! Murder!

304
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
It's not very serious.

305
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,240
Rest more at home.

306
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,400
Keep that in mind, okay?

307
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,920
Alright.

308
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,190
Come on, come on.

309
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,830
Have a seat.

310
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,480
Come on, come on.

311
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,830
Have a seat.

312
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,600
Sit.

313
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
What are you looking at?

314
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,160
It doesn't seem

315
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
like a big deal.

316
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
I'm fine,

317
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,830
but you're not.

318
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,790
Aggravated assault.

319
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,510
That's enough for a few years in prison.

320
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
I only kicked you once.

321
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,400
You lost your balance.

322
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,070
You fell

323
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,510
and injured yourself.

324
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,640
How did that become an aggravated assault?

325
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,680
W-What do you mean I did it to myself?

326
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,270
I didn't take these X-rays, did I?

327
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,920
I got seven stitches

328
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
and a mild concussion.

329
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,480
Let me tell you something.

330
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,160
If I report this to the Public Security Bureau,

331
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,240
it would be assault and battery,

332
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,870
where the victim doesn't accept mediation.

333
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,270
Think about the consequences yourself.

334
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,680
Give me back the money first.

335
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,440
I'll take full responsibility.

336
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,270
Taking full responsibility?

337
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,680
Can you really handle it?

338
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,640
Let me ask you,

339
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,920
you hit me first, didn't you?

340
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,790
You kicked me, didn't you?

341
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,550
You could have sued me

342
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,350
for not paying you.

343
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,790
Why did you have to use violence?

344
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm telling you,

345
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,310
if I were less decent,

346
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,880
I could add another charge against you.

347
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,510
Burglary.

348
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,790
Even if it was just an attempt,

349
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,880
that would be enough to convict you.

350
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,590
Xie.

351
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,750
We're both reasonable people,

352
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,000
so I won't beat around the bush.

353
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,200
This beating,

354
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,400
to put it bluntly,

355
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,510
I had it coming.

356
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,350
The money I owe you,

357
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,400
let's consider it as my medical expenses.

358
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,110
This matter between us,

359
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,350
let's put an end to it, okay?

360
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,830
What? What?

361
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,110
What do you mean put an end to it?

362
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,550
On what grounds?

363
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,350
This won't do!

364
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Let's go then.

365
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Let's go!

366
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,440
Where are you going?

367
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,200
To the Public Security Bureau.

368
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,830
What?

369
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
To assess injuries and determine sentencing.

370
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,750
Come on, let's go.

371
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,720
You'd better think about

372
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,400
where you're going to borrow money for legal fees.

373
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,400
You...

374
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,000
What are you doing?

375
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,880
You...

376
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,310
Are you going to continue causing harm to me?

377
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
You, you...

378
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
How many stitches did you get?

379
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,110
Seven stitches.

380
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,550
What?

381
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,640
Are you going to remove them for me now?

382
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,550
Take it.

383
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,550
Take it

384
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,400
and make

385
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,480
a cut right here.

386
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
I'll pay you back those seven stitches.

387
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,270
I don't want it.

388
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
I'll do it myself.

389
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
Give it to me!

390
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,590
Xie!

391
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,680
W-What are you doing?

392
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,830
Cripple.

393
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm begging you one last time.

394
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
Please give me back that money.

395
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,590
That money may seem like a small amount to you,

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,440
but for me,

397
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,880
it's life-saving money.

398
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,550
Cripple.

399
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,110
Please?

400
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,790
Xie!

401
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,110
I'm a victim too.

402
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,030
What did you say?

403
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,960
You're a victim?

404
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,240
I'll be honest with you.

405
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
My supplier

406
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,630
abandoned his construction project

407
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,830
and ran off with the money.

408
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,070
He still owes me the final payment.

409
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,750
My Mercedes

410
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,760
will have to be used to pay off debts.

411
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,880
It'll be taken away the day after tomorrow.

412
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,960
Xie.

413
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,830
It's like the hot potato game.

414
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,110
The potato is in your hands now.

415
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm back.

416
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,920
Have you had dinner?

417
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,590
Yes, I have.

418
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,200
Have you eaten?

419
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,400
Our son wasn't home tonight,

420
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,200
so I didn't cook.

421
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,640
I had a bite at Yan's place.

422
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,270
About that money...

423
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,680
Come on and take a look. Soy milk and fried dough sticks.

424
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,160
Freshly fried dough sticks.

425
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,270
Yan'er, take a rest. Sit down and save some energy.

426
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,600
There's even no place for me to use my energy, you know?

427
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,110
We make so many every day,

428
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,400
but we can't sell any of it.

429
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,480
Forget about making money. We're just suffering losses.

430
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,590
It will get better.

431
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,000
Everything will be fine.

432
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,750
How about I sing a little for you

433
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,480
while there's no one here?

434
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,720
Sure. That's great.

435
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,160
It's been so long since I last heard you sing.

436
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,150
The 'Amusement park nightmare' again?

437
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,110
Sure.

438
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,350
I love hearing this one.

439
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,000
Alright.

440
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,590
♫Originally♫

441
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:34,200
♫The purple♫

442
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:45,270
♫And red blossoms bloom everywhere♫

443
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,790
♫Everywhere♫

444
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,750
Look.

445
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,070
I'm old now.

446
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,310
I can't even catch my breath anymore.

447
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,880
It's beautiful.

448
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,560
Take a rest.

449
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,110
Could you watch the stall for me for a bit?

450
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,590
I have a pot on the stove at home,

451
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,110
simmering some lotus root soup.

452
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,310
I'll go back and check on it.

453
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,350
Be careful.

454
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,350
Be careful.

455
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,350
Okay, okay.

456
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,200
You go.

457
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,790
Go. Don't worry.

458
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,350
Take a rest at home.

459
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,240
We're here.

460
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,600
Let me.

461
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,110
It's okay. Look.

462
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,110
This one's burnt.

463
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,720
What's wrong with Granny?

464
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
She doesn't look well.

465
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,710
Look at these fried radish cakes.

466
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,510
She put them in and forgot to take them out.

467
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,960
Later,

468
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,750
I'll have Wanghe call a traditional Chinese doctor

469
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,030
to check on Granny Ma.

470
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,590
Let me see your tongue.

471
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,960
How have you been sleeping lately?

472
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,000
I've always slept quite well.

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,310
But recently, in the middle of the night,

474
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,470
I'd wake up around three or four o'clock.

475
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,310
Come on, squeeze my hand.

476
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,240
Harder.

477
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,590
This one.

478
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,550
I... I... I...

479
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,880
What's wrong with me?

480
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,310
Don't worry. It's nothing serious.

481
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,480
As people get older,

482
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,750
some symptoms start to show up.

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,110
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

484
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,550
Take it for now.

485
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,110
Okay.

486
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,070
As for the physical labors at home,

487
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,640
try to do less of them from now on.

488
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,590
Alright.

489
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,200
Thank you.

490
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,160
You're welcome.

491
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,310
Thank you, Doctor,

492
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,510
for coming all this way.

493
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,200
How is Granny's condition?

494
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,400
Are you all her relatives?

495
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,830
Yes, we all are.

496
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,880
Any immediate family members?

497
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,790
She's our biological grandmother.

498
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,000
The elderly lady may have had a cerebrovascular event recently.

499
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,510
In other words, a stroke.

500
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,110
If it's severe, it could lead to hemiplegia.

501
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,310
At her age, if she has a stroke,

502
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,510
it'll be a disaster for the family.

503
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,110
You need to keep a close eye on her.

504
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,200
Also, be mentally prepared.

505
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,590
You are finally home.

506
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,750
Why don't you just live outside? Do you know what time it is?

507
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,110
I had things to do.

508
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,200
What could you possibly have to do?

509
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
All you do is eat and mess around.

510
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,070
Even trust fund babies don't waste their time like you do.

511
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,070
Oh, right.

512
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,590
What did the traditional Chinese doctor say?

513
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,200
Is Granny Ma alright?

514
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,030
Granny Ma...

515
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,160
May have a stroke soon.

516
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,070
The doctor said

517
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,590
Granny Ma is showing signs of an impending stroke.

518
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,830
We need to be prepared.

519
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,880
A stroke?

520
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
That's no small matter.

521
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,440
The doctor suggested

522
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,880
we take Granny Ma to the hospital

523
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,160
for a comprehensive examination.

524
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,590
Yes.

525
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,750
We must do it.

526
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll find a way to take her there for the examination.

527
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,830
Also, Mom,

528
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,480
starting tomorrow, Granny Ma can't work at her stall anymore.

529
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,790
She can't overexert herself.

530
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,750
And there has to be someone

531
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,070
watching her at all times.

532
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,400
If she really has a stroke

533
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,480
and doesn't receive immediate treatment,

534
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
the consequences could be severe.

535
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
But with her family's financial situation,

536
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,480
how will they make ends meet without working?

537
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,200
I'll figure out a way to handle the money issue.

538
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,920
What are you up to this time?

539
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,510
Mom.

540
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,680
You're not allowed to drop out of school.

541
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,590
I'm telling you again,

542
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,680
I won't allow it.

543
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,750
Your father and I

544
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,590
are still here.

545
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,360
It's not your turn to meddle in this.

546
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,680
I'm not dropping out.

547
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,350
I'll just apply for a one-year leave of absence.

548
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,310
Once I make enough money...

549
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,110
That's a hard no!

550
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,200
Granny Ma is in a dangerous situation right now.

551
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,350
If anything happens to her,

552
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,440
Siyi will have no way out.

553
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,160
I have to help her.

554
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,270
How are you going to help her?

555
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,110
I have many ways to make money.

556
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,680
As long as I have enough startup capital

557
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,550
and time.

558
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,680
One year will be enough.

559
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,560
I can not only help Siyi,

560
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,590
but I can also fill the financial holes in our family.

561
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,790
Please trust me, Mom.

562
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,310
No means no!

563
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,160
This matter is not up for discussion!

564
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,000
Why are you being so unreasonable?

565
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,070
Your father said

566
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,510
he'd be able to collect the outstanding debts soon.

567
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,510
Once we get the money back,

568
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,200
everything can be resolved.

569
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,350
You only need to study hard

570
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,720
and bring home your diploma.

571
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,920
After that, you can do whatever you want.

572
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,320
I won't interfere anymore.

573
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,510
What are you doing?

574
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,400
Just staying here for a bit.

575
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
What's there to stay for in the middle of the night?

576
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,750
You have school tomorrow.

577
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,790
Come on, go to bed.

578
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,680
Dad,

579
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,550
don't go yet.

580
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,790
Let's talk for a bit.

581
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,440
Talk about what?

582
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,960
How did you earn

583
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,640
your first pot of gold?

584
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,350
Well, back then,

585
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,960
when I was about your age,

586
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,750
I went to Guangdong

587
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,000
with your Uncle Maotian

588
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:33,990
to buy goods.

589
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,830
Do you know what we bought?

590
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,400
What?

591
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,000
Gauze and silk scarves for women.

592
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
We bought them there

593
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,160
and sold them here.

594
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Do you know how big the price difference was?

595
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,200
Do you remember

596
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,680
our family's first small boat?

597
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,920
It was bought

598
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,440
with that money.

599
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,960
That was our first pot of gold.

600
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,110
Not bad, Dad.

601
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,590
Has mom been captivated by these silk scarves?

602
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,640
She wasn't captivated,

603
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,160
she was trapped.

604
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,790
Dad,

605
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,590
I need to tell you something.

606
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't get angry.

607
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,200
Go ahead.

608
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,400
I want to take a leave of absence from school.

609
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,240
Just for a year.

610
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,000
I told you not to get angry.

611
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,590
Take a leave of absence?

612
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,000
Why?

613
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,440
Siyi.

614
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,030
I've warmed up some milk for you.

615
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,440
You haven't finished your homework yet?

616
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,070
Almost done.

617
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,350
Grandma, you should go to bed first.

618
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,070
It's alright.

619
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,070
I'll

620
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,640
knit a sweater to keep you company.

621
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,920
Siyi,

622
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,880
actually,

623
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm not against you getting a part-time job.

624
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,920
Grandma.

625
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,200
We didn't have enough food at home when your father was young,

626
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,590
so he went out to earn money.

627
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,710
I won't scold you.

628
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,310
After all, you're both doing it for the family's sake.

629
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,440
Don't worry, Grandma.

630
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,480
I won't let it affect my studies.

631
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,110
Are you sure it won't affect your studies?

632
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,960
I've been watching you from the doorway for a while.

633
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,680
Usually when you're doing homework,

634
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
you're very focused.

635
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,880
You can write for an entire evening.

636
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,630
How many times have you yawned just now?

637
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,750
A person's

638
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,480
energy is finite.

639
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,680
I know you're thoughtful,

640
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,400
and that you're trying to ease my burden.

641
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,640
But child,

642
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,160
everything has its priorities.

643
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,070
If your grades are poor

644
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,920
and you can't get into college,

645
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,350
then I would accept it.

646
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,960
But your grades are so good.

647
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,920
Wouldn't you be missing out on such an opportunity?

648
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,160
If you go to work part-time

649
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,160
and ruin your future,

650
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,200
I would feel like I've let your father down.

651
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,720
Your father would blame me too.

652
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
Alright,

653
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,960
get back to your homework now.

654
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,550
How much?

655
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,510
The medicine from before 1993

656
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,920
cost more than 8,000 yuan per pill.

657
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
It might not even be enough for a pill.

658
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
If someone really gets sick,

659
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,680
it can be a big expense

660
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,200
for hospitalization,

661
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,160
nursing staff

662
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,480
and so on.

663
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,590
Given Granny's family situation,

664
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,750
even if Siyi gets into college,

665
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,320
they can't afford it.

666
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,400
So I have to plan ahead.

667
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,070
These...these troublesome matters,

668
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,670
l-let us adults handle them.

669
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,710
Dad,

670
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,360
you used to make money seafaring,

671
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,190
but now?

672
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,960
The highway is open,

673
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,880
and our family business isn't very good.

674
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,550
What are you planning to do about it?

675
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,110
Well, any industry

676
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,360
has its ups and downs.

677
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
I believe the canal will improve.

678
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
It might get better in the future,

679
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
but I can't wait.

680
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,190
You...

681
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,150
Making money isn't that easy.

682
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,150
It's not something that just comes to you

683
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,590
whenever you want it.

684
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,550
Well, I have to try.

685
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,480
I have confidence.

686
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
I believe in myself.

687
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,320
It's not about confidence.

688
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,440
You... you need a plan.

689
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,030
I have.

690
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,960
I have several, actually.

691
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,920
I just don't know which one to use right now.

692
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,070
Look at you.

693
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,840
Several plans, huh?

694
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,110
Tell me one of them.

695
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,150
Let's see if it's feasible.

696
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,070
I'll tell you one that doesn't require seed money.

697
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,670
Creating a website.

698
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,760
What kind of website?

699
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,670
Online smart question bank.

700
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,550
It's something that can help students

701
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,880
quickly improve their grades.

702
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
If such a thing exists,

703
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,960
can it improve your grades first?

704
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,670
Of course.

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,400
I can not only help myself,

706
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,630
but I can help a lot of people.

707
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,710
I can also make big money.

708
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,880
How much can you earn?

709
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,550
At least I'll be the richest person in Honghuai.

710
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,550
Son,

711
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
you should

712
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,840
focus on getting into college.

713
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
Don't worry about our family matters.

714
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,790
You really don't need me to?

715
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,400
No matter how useless your father is,

716
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
he can still provide for the family.

717
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,030
Is that all the ambition you have?

718
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,920
Are you

719
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,040
really disappointed in your father now?

720
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,590
Yes.

721
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,840
Dad,

722
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,920
making no money isn't a big deal,

723
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,960
but you can't lose your aspiration.

724
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,880
As long as you have the spirit,

725
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,550
starting a new business won't be a problem.

726
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,760
Also,

727
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,710
I...

728
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,320
Oh no.

729
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,710
What's wrong?

730
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,280
Your mom must be awake.

731
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,230
she's probably looking for me now.

732
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,920
Where is she?

733
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,230
You two even have telepathy?

734
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,070
Look at you.

735
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,550
I'm telling you, I know what your mom's going to do.

736
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,000
even if she just turns over in bed.

737
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,280
Seems like everything's fine now.

738
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,480
Nope.

739
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,150
Maybe there's too much going on now.

740
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,840
It's not working this time.

741
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,230
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

742
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,190
Son,

743
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,960
I'll be honest with you.

744
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm unable to do anything but seafaring.

745
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,550
If you don't know, then learn.

746
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,320
My dad is so smart and capable.

747
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,760
Once you set your mind to something,

748
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,000
just keep pushing forward,

749
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,550
you'll definitely succeed.

750
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,840
Really?

751
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,590
Really.

752
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,360
Fenghua, wake up.

753
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,110
It's so late. Why aren't you up yet?

754
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,190
What's the matter?

755
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,000
Look at you, dawdling around.

756
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,480
You're so slow.

757
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,110
I'm resting.

758
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,190
Hurry up!

759
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,590
There are so few people on Flower Street.

760
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,190
Business is getting worse.

761
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,320
Let's not set up the stall on weekends anymore.

762
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
If you don't set up the stall, what are you going to live on?

763
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,480
You're always saying useless things.

764
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,590
I'm so tired.

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,110
Morning, little white girl.

766
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,040
That photographer you mentioned the other day,

767
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,920
is he reliable?

768
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,880
Of course he is.

769
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,000
Why don't we give him a call and ask?

770
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,920
Okay.

771
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,030
Just a moment.

772
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,590
Yes.

773
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,070
Yes, yes.

774
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,630
Alright.

775
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,710
Great, great, great.

776
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Okay, goodbye.

777
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,000
How did it go?

778
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,590
He said we should go over there.

779
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,400
He wants to talk face to face.

780
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,590
To the city?

781
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,000
Well, you're asking to be a model.

782
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,280
If they don't see you in person,

783
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,670
how will they know if you're suitable?

784
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,480
That's true.

785
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,000
If you're scared,

786
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,670
we can ask Shao Xiaopang to come with us.

787
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
That guy can keep a secret.

788
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,190
No way.

789
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,710
We can't let too many people know about this.

790
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,000
It wouldn't be good if word goes out.

791
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
What's the big deal?

792
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
Being a model isn't illegal.

793
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,350
Besides,

794
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
once you've taken the photos,

795
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,480
they can be seen online anyway.

796
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,320
Even if you don't say anything now,

797
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,400
everyone will find out sooner or later.

798
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,230
If you want to make money, don't be afraid of losing face.

799
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,110
If the teacher asks later, just say

800
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,030
your relatives opened a shop

801
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,960
and you're helping out.

802
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
What era are we living in?

803
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,110
As long as we're not breaking the law,

804
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,590
the more money we make, the more glorious it is.

805
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,320
Let's go.

806
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,960
Time to make some money.

807
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,000
Put them on.

808
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Here.

809
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,760
Take a good look.

810
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,190
What?

811
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,070
The business plan I wrote last night.

812
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,670
Take a look now.

813
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,400
If there are any issues, just say it.

814
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,360
Don't hold back.

815
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,110
Wake up.

816
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,150
Come on, come on.

817
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,190
Hurry up, take a look.

818
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,230
Online question bank.

819
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,320
What do you think? Is it feasible?

820
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,070
There are two key points.

821
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,840
The quality of the questions and intelligent data processing.

822
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,230
We can get questions from major key high schools.

823
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,550
As for the program automation, we can only rely on you.

824
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,880
You think he's Bill Gates?

825
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,110
Studying and working at the same time.

826
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,590
Even if you work him to death

827
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,480
he can't finish it all.

828
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,550
We'll start small.

829
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,030
We can use existing programming templates.

830
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,480
Once we have money,

831
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,630
then we can spend it

832
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,000
to hire programmers from outside.

833
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,590
There are virtual servers online,

834
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,960
but if you want to guarantee storage and internet speed,

835
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,710
you must rent a dedicated server.

836
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Then let's go to Beijing.

837
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,350
I've already talked to my dad.

838
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,710
He didn't agree.

839
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,960
But he didn't object either.

840
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,400
What's the use of your dad agreeing?

841
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,360
You won't get your mom's approval.

842
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,990
We have to try, right?

843
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,590
I don't believe

844
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,280
When Bill Gates dropped out from Harvard,

845
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,360
his mom could agree.

846
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
To do great things,

847
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,800
we must all forge ahead through difficulties.

848
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,360
Anyway, I must do this.

849
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,030
If we really can make money,

850
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,920
how do you want to spend it?

851
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,920
First, pay off debts.

852
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,710
I haven't finished paying off

853
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,880
my mom's debts yet.

854
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,710
I plan to buy a phone,

855
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,920
the latest model.

856
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,800
Then,

857
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,070
I'll make calls in front of Xie Wanghe every day.

858
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,430
Hello, darling,

859
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,280
have you been missing me these days?

860
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,480
Which darling?

861
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,920
It doesn't matter.

862
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,190
The point is to make him see my new phone.

863
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,760
I'll make him so jealous.
