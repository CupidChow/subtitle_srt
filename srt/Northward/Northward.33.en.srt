4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,120
Sleeping in the bedroom.

5
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,870
What's up with her?

6
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,680
She's been feeling dizzy lately, sometimes even unable to stand.

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,850
She might be worn out.

8
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Why are you here?

9
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,030
Let me take you to the hospital

10
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,400
for a check-up.

11
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,810
I've already had one.

12
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,290
Nothing serious.

13
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,490
This constant dizziness is no small matter.

14
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,220
Granny Ma used to have the same symptom.

15
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm still young. How can you compare me to her?

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,530
Do you think someone at my age could have a stroke?

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,740
Just mind your own business.

18
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll handle my own affairs.

21
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,090

22

and contacting a funeral parlor.

Has Bee made any effort at all?

25
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,360
Did it occur to you that, given his family's situation,

26
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
it was even uneasy for them to arrange a funeral?

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,810
Have you thought about giving He some final dignity?

28
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,970

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes, you're right.

32
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,700

33

I wasn't thoughtful enough.

34
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,530
I was wrong.

00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,840
I'm really sorry.

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,430
I'll listen to your advice.

37
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,829
And I'll adapt.

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,920

39

How much compensation can there be?

46
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,270
We're still working on it.

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480

Mom,

62
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,800
if the people from Yuntu are not good,

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
are the people from Bee any better?

64
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,750
How can you believe those people will settle it?

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,270
Haven't you seen the attitude of their company?

66
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
If they had any conscience,

67
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,720
would Tianming have had an accident?

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,840
But I think

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,360
something's fishy about this matter.

70
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,190

74

You're breaking your promise if you go now.

75

What did I promise her?

76
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,510
She said Xie Wanghe would get us compensation.

77
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,330
So where's the money?

78
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,360

What does she want to do?

85
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,000
Someone came here

86
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,950
and said they'd pay for our lawsuit

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,390
to claim compensation from Bee.

88
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,390
They also talked about holding a press conference

89
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,430
to make this issue blow up completely!

90
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Who said that?

91
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,340

They're genuinely trying to help us.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,190
They've put in money, effort, and labor.

97

Don't be ungrateful.

98

You believe that?

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
This is apparently a business battle.

100
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,690
They want to use this case

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,420
to completely ruin Bee's reputation.

102

We can pay as much as they want personally,

For a businessman,

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm not asking for your forgiveness,

190
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,900
but I will do what I should.

191
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,740
I'll pay off your mortgage

192
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,430
for the house,

193
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,010
all at once.

194
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,680
And also for the babies Mrs. He's carrying,

195
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,140
I'll also sponsor their tuition.

196
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,530
This is my letter of commitment.

197
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,750
Just with a worthless piece of paper,

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
you want us to let go of Bee?

199
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,970
Dream on!

200
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,570
We won't let you go!

201
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,240
Mrs. He,

202
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,400
the company has already initiated the compensation process.

203
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,420
There will be bereavement payments.

204
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
This letter of commitment

205
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,230
is my personal promise.

206
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,170
If you don't trust it,

207
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,990
you can have a lawyer notarize it.

208
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,020
You have my word.

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,070
I'll definitely fulfill it.

210
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,900
My poor son...

211
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,470
I miss you!

212
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,880
My poor son...

213
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,360
I feel something's off.

214
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,710
A host of netizens are denouncing you

215
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,700
with particularly harsh words.

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,280
Isn't that normal?

217
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,240
I am responsible

218
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
for He's death.

219
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,420
But,

220
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,080
it feels like it's organized.

221
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,200
Too many newly registered users.

222
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,420
I think

223
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,970
someone must have organized an army of trolls.

224
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,870
You mean Yuntu?

225
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,020
No matter who it is,

226
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,750
if we don't handle it soon,

227
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,420
things will surely get out of hand in the media.

228
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,900
A-Actually, no one expected

229
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,100
such extreme weather that day.

230
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,280
We also lost one of our colleagues.

231
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,750
The company didn't even have time to celebrate before...

232
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,960
I see.

233
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
We're well aware

234
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,670

the juicy information we want to know.

You get it, right?

about three years ago, right?

263
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, three years ago.

264
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,080
When did you start working

265
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,440

Mr. Xie must treat you well, right?

Yeah...

Not bad...

272
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,070
Did he give you a raise?

273
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,160
Nope.

Given your relationship with him,

278
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,450
you must get at least triple pay, right?

279
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,440
Li,

280
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,140
from the first day you joined the company three years ago,

281
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,480
I could tell

282
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
that you were a loyal young man.

283
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,880
But don't you think

284
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,160
it's too foolish to stick to this loyalty?

285
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,410
As your senior,

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,750
I must tell you

287
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,470
you need to remember this.

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,930
Despite Wanghe's radical way of doing things,

560
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,350
he definitely has his principles.

561
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,320
I guess the public opinions were out of their control this time,

562
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,390
so the company

563
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,930
made him a scapegoat.

564
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,830
That must be the case.

565
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,110
Yeah, Wanghe's been righteous and kind-hearted

566
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,590
since he was a kid.

567
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,200
He knows when to hold back

568
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,820
instead of acting recklessly.

569
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,680
-Exactly.
-He must have been wrongly accused!

570
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,910
Yeah! He's such a good boy!

571
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,490
It's not a big deal.

572
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,230
After all, internet trends

573
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,290
will die down in a few days.

574
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,310
Or we can have him back

575
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,810
to lay low for a while!

576
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,370
The internet never forgets.

577
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,100
With a record of this incident,

578
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,030
it'll be hard for Wanghe to find a job again.

579
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,920
Why bother finding a job?

580
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,250
As quick-witted as Wanghe is,

581
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,250
can't he come back to start a business on the Flower Street?

582
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,780
Let them all come back,

583
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,630
like Fenghua

584
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,510
and Haikuo!

585
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,770
Doesn't Haikuo do programming?

586
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
He can do this job anywhere!

587
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,000
Let them join hands.

588
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,430
I'm sure they'll succeed!

589
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,360
Well said! I totally agree.

590
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,380
Fenghua just said that the life in Beijing had worn her out.

591
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,720
Ask them all to come back.

592
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,950
Beijing may be great,

593
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,550
but it can't beat home sweet home.

594
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,140
What are you talking about?

595
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,270
Beijing is still better.

596
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,270
It's the capital, after all!

597
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,310
What's so good about Beijing?

598
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,880
The high cost of living?

599
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,590
For a bowl of noodles with shredded eel,

600
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,640
h-how much does it cost here?

601
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,310
And how much is it in Beijing?

602
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,960
How much?

603
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,790
Well, Mr. Zhou usually doesn't even charge us.

604
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,750
Right?

605
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,550
You guys go on. I'll go make you some noodles.

606
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,570
That's easy to say!

607
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,790
But if you want them to come back and start a business,

608
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,290
will you provide the startup funds?

609
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,240
So why do you want them to come back?

610
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,790
-We can look after them if they're back!
-Yeah!

611
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,290
Does that really help?

612
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,680
What do they do?

613
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,000
Well, then just look at the status quo!

614
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,680
No one is developing anything anymore.

615
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,420
I think our hometown is quite good.

616
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,700
A place with complete facilities,

617
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
lush mountains,

618
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,640
crystal-clear waters, skyscrapers, and everything we need.

619
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,680
On our Flower Street, we have tofu pudding

620
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,550
and noodles early in the morning, shredded eel at noon.

621
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,030
Isn't it wonderful enough?

622
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,200
Look at Wanghe...

624
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,550
Don't worry, I'm fine.

625
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,790
Then I'll go now.

626
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,950
Fenghua,

627
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,720
don't make any other plans

628
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,780
for this weekend,

629
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,430
Why?

630
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,870
As I said before,

631
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,060
you should go to Xiehe Hospital

632
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,480
for a full medical check-up.

633
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,320
And as I said before, it's unnecessary.

634
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,560
If you don't go, I'll tell your mom.

635
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,830
Whatever.

Please, I'm begging you.

638
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,490
You really don't look well lately.

639
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,640
No sparkling eyes.

640
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,139
Even your voice is weak when you speak.

641
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,429
It's heartbreaking to hear.

642
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,380
I'm just jaded.

643
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,400
Can you stop pestering me?

644
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,139
It's just one day.

645

It's just one day.

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm begging you.

647
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
After the check-up,

648
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,340
we can go shopping together.

649
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,440
I'll buy you anything you want, okay?

650
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,449

Don't forget.

660
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,080
of this place I found?

661
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,940
A nice shelter from wind and rain.

662
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,940
In the future, this whole area

663
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,030
will be filled with shelves for parcels.

664
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,420

00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,470
it's a brilliant idea to let you

672
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,700
take over the station.

673
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,990
Have you made up your mind?

674
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,200
Are you really quitting?

675
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,460

Okay!

I believe

686
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,920
you've all heard about our station's merging

687
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,640
with Mr. Sun's station.

688
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,710
It's great to have two strong parties join forces.

689
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,660
From now on, for all the steps like sorting, delivery, signing, to after-sales service,

690
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,020
you should follow the standards and requirements

691
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,410
stated in this manual.

692
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,210
So who do we listen to from now on?

693
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,670
After merging, you'll be one big family.

694
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,410
I've already talked to Mr. Sun.

695
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,250
You should all follow his lead from now on.

696
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,110
What does that mean?

697
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,110
After the merger, you...

698
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,690
You won't be in charge anymore?

699
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,100
I should step down.

700
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,460
Mr. Sun will be in charge from now on.

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,670
Then we're done for...

00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,480

Don't worry, everyone.

709
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,270
and also year-end performance evaluations and awards.

710
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,590
As long as you work diligently,

711
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,860
your benefits won't be any less than those of big companies.

712
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,630
It's okay if you don't wanna stay.

713
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,340
I still have some connections with HQ.

714
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,050
if you need,

715
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,530
I can help you negotiate it

716
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,380
and get you into a nearby parcel delivery station.

717
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,850
I still say the same thing.

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,130

00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,910
I hope you all take care of yourselves.

Please, please,

721
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,310
be careful and stay safe.

722
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,220

723
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,220

Home.

00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,550
She's not coming back to Beijing after leaving.

733
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,340
What?

734
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,000
I wrote a time management software for her

735
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,880
and asked her to find someone to test it.

736
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,370
She told me to send it to Mr. Sun as she had quit

737
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,230
and wouldn't be managing that business anymore.

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,930
♫And my heart♫

744
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,200
Did you get through to her?

745
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,560
♫The wind blows gently♫

746
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,730
She's not answering.

747
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,170
♫Blowing through summer♫

748
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,480
♫Blowing through the eaves♫

749
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,780
Fenghua, Fenghua, answer my call.

750
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,560
♫It blows past me♫

751
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,210
♫Warm love♫

752
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,470
♫How many years♫

753
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,600
♫Have you changed?♫

754
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,530
Slow down.

755
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,330
♫I love you♫

756
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,750
♫In dreams or in the south♫

757
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,810
Take care, Fenghua.

758
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,800
Take care, Fenghua!

759
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,540
♫The wind blows gently♫

760
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,530
♫On you♫

761
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,840
♫That's me♫

762
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,330
♫Missing you deeply again♫

763
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:54,470
[Fenghua Express]

764
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,960
♫That's me♫

765
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,540
Put them down!

766
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,050
♫Missing you deeply again♫

767
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,130
Who let you move them?

768
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,380
Put the things down!

769
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,580
Oh, Mr. Xie!

770
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,430
We've met before.

771
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,760
Mr. Sun.

772
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,440
Who let you move these?

773
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,310
You don't know that yet?

774
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,100
Ms. Xia has quit!

775
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,780
We used to work for the same company.

776
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,950
I've taken over this station.

777
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
No way!

778
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,240
Calm down, please.

779
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,800
Ms. Xia and I made this decision together.

780
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:26,930
Just a few days ago,

781
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,540
we went to inspect a factory.

782
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm quite touched by this.

783
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,550
If she had stayed

784
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,900
to work here, things would have turned out even better!

785
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,700
So she really left, huh?
