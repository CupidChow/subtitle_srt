00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,870
[NORTHWARD]

2
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,030
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,420
No.

4
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,990
I want to play with the dog.

5
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,280
Fenghua!

6
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,330
Look.

7
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,180
Here.

8
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,570
This is your little brother.

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,340
When you have time,

10
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,950
take him for a walk around the street.

11
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,950
It's his first time here.

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,750
Fenghua is busy.

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,810
She needs to do her homework.

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,690
The college entrance exam is next year.

15
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,550
She doesn't have time.

16
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,610
I have time. I have time.

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,320
Homework can be done anytime.

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,030
Let's go, little brother.

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll take you out to play.

20
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,070
There's no need to be polite with your sister.

21
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,950
I want to go play by the river.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,750
Fenghua.

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,710
You don't have to buy too many of those osmanthus cakes that I like!

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,570
Two catties would be enough!

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,470
I haven't heard her call me Grandma since I got here!

26
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,990
Who taught her such manners?

27
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,830
What do you mean she didn't?

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
She called you as soon as she came in.

29
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,740
You didn't hear it?

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,720
My ears are deaf. I didn't hear it!

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,180
Sister-in-law,

32
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,430
I didn't hear it either.

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,890
Then your hearing must be pretty bad.

34
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
Alright, Mom,

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,710
don't be angry.

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,510
What kind of mother is she?

37
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,270
She's just a bad person.

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,980
Can't even raise a child properly.

39
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,329
Like mother, like daughter.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,020
She's always been like this.

41
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,720
What's your name?

42
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,170
You mean my original name or my current one?

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,000
How many names do you have?

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,770
I used to be called Xiaojun,

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,070
but now Grandma calls me Xiaobao.

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,150
Bao as in "baby."

47
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,540
Here you go, kid.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,560
Are you from the same village as my grandma?

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,360
Then where do you live?

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,270
I forgot.

51
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,790
Adopted?

52
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,030
What were you thinking?

53
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,310
Calm down.

54
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,760
Aren't I here to discuss it with you?

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,710
What's there to discuss?

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,070
It's already been decided!

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm going to talk to Maotian.

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,770
Why isn't he back yet?

59
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,430
Mom.

60
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,470
I'm in charge of this family now.

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,510
If there's anything going on, you should tell me.

62
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,670
What is there to tell you?

63
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,350
It's a major matter of the Xia family!

64
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,170
Outsiders should keep their mouths shut!

65
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,130
Mom, Mom, calm down.

66
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,640
Let me talk to my sister-in-law.

67
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,579
Sister-in-law.

68
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,220
I have to criticize you a bit.

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,150
Our Xia family has three branches with over a dozen people,

70
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,230
with my brother being the only male...

71
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,990
Wasn't it originally five branches?

72
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,410
Why are there only three branches now?

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,640
Where did the other two go?

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,950
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

75
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,420
Whether it's three branches or five,

76
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,000
shouldn't we all live our own separate lives?

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,700
When Maotian and I first came here,

78
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,980
life was so hard,

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,620
yet I didn't see any of you guys caring about us.

80
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,850
Who told you guys to leave back then?

81
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,790
If you didn't drag him away,

82
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,740
would Maotian have left home to make a living?

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,760
Why don't you take him back then?

84
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,290
I'm not getting involved in this.

85
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,170
Mom.

86
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,130
Honghong.

87
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,120
Son, you're back!

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,110
I missed you so much.

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,140
Gosh.

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,770
You've lost weight.

91
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,590
Look how thin you've become.

92
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,300
Look at my brother, he's all sweaty.

93
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,700
-He's sweating all over.
-Mom,

94
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,010
there must be a reason why you and Honghong are back, right?

95
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,310
You're finally back.

96
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,590
Listen to what your mother has to say.

97
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,110
It's good news, wonderful news!

98
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,950
Wonderful news!

99
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,240
You couldn't find better news even if you searched with a lantern!

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,290
You couldn't!

101
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,710
What good news?

102
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,159
Your mother

103
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,920
thinks Fenghua isn't good enough because she's a girl,

104
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,190
so she bought you a boy from someone else

105
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,800
to be our son.

106
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,020
Isn't it great news?

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,290
It's great, isn't it?

108
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,060
Now you have a son.

109
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,180
The family line will continue.

110
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,070
You're a father again!

111
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm an aunt again!

112
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,840
I have a grandson now!

113
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,150
Look how happy my brother is.

114
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,070
What?

115
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,230
Is that true?

116
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,410
Grandma told me that

117
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,430
your family only has one daughter

118
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,220
and there is no male heir, so I'm here to be the son.

119
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,760
In the future, I'll get all the family inheritance.

120
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,510
Family inheritance?

121
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,240
Did my grandma not tell you

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,150
about our family's situation?

123
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,480
Your family has a big ship,

124
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,840
weighing around a thousand tons, right?

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,560
This kid is so mischievous.

126
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,840
Fenghua, who is he?

127
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,580
Mom!

128
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,710
What were you thinking!

129
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,950
What era are we living in?

130
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,090
How can your thinking still be so feudal?

131
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,610
I'm not being feudal!

132
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,710
It's because

133
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,670
girls

134
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,620
can't be recorded in the family genealogy!

135
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,750
If you don't have a son,

136
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,430
who will continue your family line when you get old?

137
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Who will?

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,270
If it can't be continued, then so be it!

139
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,800
I don't even know what I'm doing with my life yet!

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Isn't that Fenghua's grandma?

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,909
Who can control what happens after death?

142
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,010
Son!

143
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,950
Then our Xia Family

144
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,820
will have no descendants!

145
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,290
Back in the Jiajing period, our Xia Family

146
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,340
was a prestigious clan!

147
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,700
The family genealogy is this thick!

148
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,110
I can't allow our bloodline to stop here

149
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,060
just because of you

150
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,630
and your good-for-nothing wife!

151
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,730
Aren't you worried that your father wouldn't be able to rest in peace?

152
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,910
Our father wouldn't be able to rest in peace!

153
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,490
My father wouldn't be that petty!

154
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,020
God! God!

155
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,450
Mom. Mom.

156
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,850
Oh, my darling!

157
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,690
Come out and see this!

158
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,330
Mom.

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,610
Stop crying. Stop it.

160
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,040
Look at your good-for-nothing son!

161
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,970
Mom.

162
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Mom.

163
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,990
Get up.

164
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,710
You're just upset that we don't have a son, right?

165
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,140
It's simple. Just let your son divorce me

166
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,980
and find someone else to give birth to a son for your family!

167
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,659
What are you talking about?

168
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,130
Let me tell you.

169
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,050
I, Li Yan, am content with just having a daughter.

170
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,370
I absolutely won't raise someone else's child!

171
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,000
Enough, can't you just endure a little?

172
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,670
Haven't I endured enough?

173
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,770
You don't get to decide!

174
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,600
You don't get to decide.

175
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,909
I don't get to decide my family's affairs?

176
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,230
What, so you're to decide them?

177
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,110
Mom, look, the neighbors are all here.

178
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,090
Let's talk back inside.

179
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,750
I'm not going inside! I'm not going inside!

180
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
Look at her! Just look at her!

181
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,830
She's doing this on purpose!

182
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,930
It's all your fault!

183
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,870
Stop it, okay?

184
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,660
You wicked woman!

185
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,510
What do you want?

186
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,910
All of you, stop it!

187
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,500
Who are you putting on a show for?

188
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,670
Sister.

189
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Don't call me that.

190
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,870
I'm not your sister.

191
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,080
My father won't let you in our family.

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
Why?

193
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,270
You're just a little kid.

194
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,820
I don't need to explain myself to you.

195
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,170
I don't eat much, and I'm easy to feed.

196
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,230
I also won't take the family inheritance away from you.

197
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,500
Then why are you here?

198
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,110
Before Grandma bought me,

199
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,520
I hadn't eaten for three days.

200
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,760
I want to live. I don't want to die.

201
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,750
What do you want to eat?

202
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,000
Let me think.

203
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,850
Let's go.

204
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,790
Fenghua!

205
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,570
Fenghua!

206
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,100
Do you know something happened to your family?

207
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, he just told me.

208
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
So it's you.

209
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,880
Behave yourself, you hear me?

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,790
Pretty impressive.

211
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,830
Your grandma must be crazy.

212
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,310
How can she do something like this?

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,150
You once said

214
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,730
that you'd fight anyone who dared to bully me.

215
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,820
My grandma, I'll leave her to you.

216
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,020
You guys, give up already.

217
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,539
I won't give birth to or raise any more children.

218
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,110
I'm content with having one daughter in my life.

219
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,809
If you want to complain about only having one male in three branches,

220
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,010
you can raise him yourself.

221
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,039
Let him be Maotian's little brother.

222
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
Listen to her. Just listen.

223
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,030
Is that how a human being talks?

224
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
You're right.

225
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,010
I'm not a human being.

226
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,950
Ever since I married into Xia Family,

227
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,270
I've been treated like a dog.

228
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,730
I'm even worth less than a dog!

229
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,130
The year I gave birth to Fenghua,

230
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,410
during my postpartum confinement,

231
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,240
did any of you ever cook a meal for me

232
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,770
or wash a single diaper?

233
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,570
Fenghua would cry all night long,

234
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,500
and I would spend night after night

235
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,500
pacing back and forth in the room, holding her.

236
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,810
How many days did I go without a full night's sleep?

237
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,570
But did any of you guys ever help me?

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
Poor Fenghua had it even worse.

239
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,510
Other children were loved by their grandma and grandpa,

240
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,000
but not her.

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,530
As soon as she was born and you saw she was a girl,

242
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,700
you didn't even look at her.

243
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,910
You just left.

244
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,950
Whenever you saw her, you always belittled her with snide remarks.

245
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,640
How do you think that made she feel?

246
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,400
When she was little, she used to ask me,

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,840
"Why does Grandma hate me so much?"

248
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,220
"Am I really your child?"

249
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,700
"Was I picked up by the river?"

250
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,960
I wouldn't have picked her up even if I found her.

251
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,490
I wouldn't have taken her even if she were given to us for free.

252
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,190
I dare you guys to say that again!

253
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,550
What if I say it again?

254
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,190
I wouldn't have taken her even if she were given to us for free.

255
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,750
Don't you dare

256
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,910
say things like that about my daughter again!

257
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,390
If you are so capable, give birth to a son yourself!

258
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

259
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,870
You know what?

260
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,630
He is my son!

261
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,550
I can't stand you people anymore!

262
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,310
If you've got the guts, give me a boy!

263
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,630
I'm very happy with the daughter I gave birth to!

264
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,030
Why must I have a son?

265
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,010
-Enough!
-I'm not ashamed at all!

266
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,420
Will you guys ever stop?

267
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,430
I'm begging you guys.

268
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,760
Save me some face, okay?

269
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,810
We'll discuss the child matter later.

270
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,740
There's no room for discussion!

271
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
Let me tell you, Xia Maotian.

272
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,730
I, Li Yan, will only have one child in this lifetime,

273
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,950
and that's our Fenghua!

274
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,380
As for other people's children,

275
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,630
whoever wants to raise them can do so.

276
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,680
If you dare to give in,

277
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,870
I'll divorce you!

278
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,350
Brother.

279
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,620
You are the head of the household.

280
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,160
Eat slowly.

281
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,290
Here you go.

282
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,650
[Special price for a set: 18 yuan]

283
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,070
What are you going to do?

284
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,750
Don't worry.

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,540
My mom will never agree.

286
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,880
If she really gets pushed to her limit,

287
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,150
she will divorce my dad.

288
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,390
That's exactly what makes it troublesome.

289
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,750
Your dad is filial.

290
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,170
He always listens to your grandmother.

291
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,880
If they really end up divorcing,

292
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,680
you'll feel guilty, right?

293
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,860
This kind of thing would never happen in your family.

294
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,950
Things would be so much better if I were a boy.

295
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,070
I think,

296
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,120
your dad might not be able to handle this alone.

297
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,380
We need to get help from the outside.

298
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,070
What kind of help?

299
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,480
Maotian.

300
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,260
Maotian!

301
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,680
Don't be a coward this time.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,670
Otherwise, your wife and daughter

303
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
will be bullied to death by your mother.

304
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,700
Boss Xie.

305
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,790
I'm not stupid.

306
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,800
How could I possibly agree to such a ridiculous thing?

307
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,470
What did you tell your mother just now?

308
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,160
You said you'd discuss it later!

309
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,930
That's my mother.

310
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,660
How can I disobey her?

311
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,620
Well, disobedience,

312
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,910
in the ancient times and

313
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,700
in the Confucian culture,

314
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,730
was considered unfilial.

315
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,670
If you were unfilial,

316
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,690
people might laugh at you,

317
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,030
and you might even end up in jail.

318
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,270
But what era are we living in now?

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,240
You need to have a broader vision

320
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,430
when tackling issues.

321
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,060
You can't just stick to the old ways.

322
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,220
No matter how society develops,

323
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,590
people still need to be filial, right?

324
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,170
Sure. Of course you should be filial,

325
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,440
but you can't be blindly filial.

326
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,550
Exactly!

327
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,750
Let me tell you,

328
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
at a time like this,

329
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,840
if you don't think from your wife and daughter's perspective,

330
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,400
and their hearts end up getting broken,

331
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
there will be no turning back.

332
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,670
It's too late already!

333
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,040
Xia Maotian, listen to me.

334
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,980
Go back and be your mom's filial son.

335
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,970
From now on,

336
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,440
I'll take care of Fenghua,

337
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,350
and we'll live on our own.

338
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,660
You go your way, and I'll go mine.

339
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,150
From this point on, we part ways!

340
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,700
Mom!

341
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,070
What are you doing?

342
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,910
You guys...

343
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,430
Alright, stop it.

344
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,550
We can live just fine without a man!

345
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,390
Let's go! Let's go!

346
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,830
Mom!

347
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,340
Dad! Talk some sense into Mom!

348
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,780
She's not just saying this out of anger!

349
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,470
You see?

350
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,560
She's always talking about getting a divorce!

351
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,630
Always threatening to divorce me!

352
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,930
I can't live like this anymore!

353
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Hey, you guys...

354
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,660
Stand up!

355
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,100
Act like a man!

356
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,470
Mom, I...

357
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,770
What kind of photo is this?

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
So ugly.

359
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,740
Mom.

360
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,390
I've made up my mind.

361
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,360
Yan and I can't raise this child.

362
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,510
You must raise him!

363
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,100
Our Xia family

364
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,360
can't end with your generation.

365
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,430
If you don't raise him, I'm not leaving!

366
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm going to live here!

367
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,040
Living here seems quite nice.

368
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,190
The bed is so soft and comfortable.

369
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,050
Brother, why didn't you buy one for Mom?

370
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,770
He doesn't care about me at all!

371
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,950
Brother,

372
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,670
don't get so worked up.

373
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,090
We're not asking you to raise this child for real.

374
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,800
We're going to take him back to the village with us later.

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,970
All you need to do

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,390
is transfer money to my card every month.

377
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,670
This child's name

378
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,830
will still be recorded in your family genealogy.

379
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,910
Isn't that great?

380
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,350
What era are we living in?

381
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,030
Who still cares about family genealogy?

382
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,070
I do!

383
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,350
Your children

384
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,150
and every following generation will!

385
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,020
When we're alive, we are members of the Xia family,

386
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,950
and even after we die,

387
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,600
we'll be buried in the Xia family's ancestral grave!

388
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,520
We... We cannot forget our ancestors!

389
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,790
We can't.

390
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,950
There are no outsiders here.

391
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,490
You don't have to keep up the act anymore.

392
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,550
What are you talking about?

393
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,940
What act am I putting on?

394
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,300
Stop acting, okay?

395
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,900
Last week,

396
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,860
the village secretary called me.

397
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,850
What's a village secretary?

398
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,620
He explained everything very clearly.

399
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,270
What did he tell you?

400
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,550
He said someone's interested in our village's land

401
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,560
and wants to invest in developing a photovoltaic base.

402
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,830
What's a photovoltaic base?

403
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,570
Stop talking.

404
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,180
The relocation compensation

405
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,230
isn't a small amount, is it?

406
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,950
Don't listen to

407
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,950
his nonsense!

408
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,540
Nothing has been decided yet!

409
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,180
It's not even close to being finalized,

410
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,910
yet he's already making plans for it!

411
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,710
Don't listen to him!

412
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't you worry.

413
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,340
I won't take a penny of that relocation money.

414
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,900
You and Honghong can take it all.

415
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,520
Brother!

416
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,860
Keep your voice down!

417
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,810
Brother...

418
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,910
Brother, sit down.

419
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't be anxious.

420
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,020
Listen.

421
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,660
I won't agree with this.

422
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,790
No matter what,

423
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,220
you're still a part of the Xia family,

424
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,580
and you're the only male. As long as...

425
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,640
Let me finish first.

426
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
We won't take the money,

427
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,040
but you have to take the child with you.

428
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,840
If you don't trust me,

429
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,190
we can go to the notary office

430
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,490
and sign a transferring contract for the relocation compensation.

431
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,170
But I'm begging you guys,

432
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,550
from now on,

433
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,570
don't come and upset my wife and daughter anymore.

434
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,570
Can you do that?

435
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,700
Those two... They're my life.

436
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,300
Brother. We won't do that. We won't.

437
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,230
Mom is just looking out for you,

438
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,070
you know?

439
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,550
Don't interrupt.

440
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,640
Does Yan agree to this?

441
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
If you take this child away,

442
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,790
we can earn the money ourselves.

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,150
So, this is settled then.

444
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,110
Don't come saying that I forced you into this.

445
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,110
Do you hear me?

446
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm doing this willingly.

447
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,900
I won't go back on my word!

448
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,230
Fenghua.

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,860
It's okay.

450
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,980
You know,

451
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,310
your father actually loves you very much.

452
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,220
Don't worry.

453
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
He won't let anyone hurt you.

454
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,130
Why are you crying?

455
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,110
You're usually so talkative,

456
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,850
but you fall apart at crucial moments.

457
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,610
Alright, alright.

458
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,590
I'm scared...

459
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,500
Why are you scared?

460
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,860
Your parents are still alive!

461
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,230
Whoever dares to bully my daughter,

462
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,460
I'll fight them to death!

463
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,380
Fenghua.

464
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,380
Fenghua.

465
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,700
Let me say a few words.

466
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,240
A good dog doesn't block the way.

467
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,609
Sorry, I'll make way for you.

468
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,040
I'm not talking about you.

469
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,560
Fenghua.

470
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,000
Grandma was thoughtless this time.

471
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,540
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you two.

472
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,730
I was wrong.

473
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,390
From now on,

474
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,329
just

475
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,220
listen to your parents

476
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,200
and be filial to them.

477
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Grandma's leaving now.

478
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,390
You talk.

479
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,430
What about the child?

480
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Didn't you say you wouldn't raise this child?

481
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,290
I'll take him back, and someone will raise him.

482
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,860
Our family isn't the only one in the village short of male heirs.

483
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,880
If you don't want him, others will.

484
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,030
Sister!

485
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,890
Let's go, let's go.

486
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,740
We're leaving.

487
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,390
Take care.

488
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,760
Come on.

489
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,430
Maotian.

490
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,390
This... I just bought this!

491
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,990
Buy another one.

492
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,490
The rice is still in the cooker!

493
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,870
Mom! Mom!

494
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
Alright, I'm leaving now.

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,490
I was cooking, too.

496
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,490
Alright. Alright.

497
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,990
So they gave in?

498
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,630
Yeah, they did.

499
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,080
Hey.

500
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,260
We'll buy another one.

501
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,910
Don't give everything...

502
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,790
Alright, alright.

503
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,110
Go back, no need to see us off.

504
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,070
Give this to me.

505
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,780
Hurry up and go.

506
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,130
No need to see us off.

507
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,190
Uncle, it's that kid!

508
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,930
Okay.

509
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,150
Don't block the way.

510
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,690
If we're late, we'll miss the bus.

511
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,260
Don't rush, old lady.

512
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,660
Excuse me, may I ask

513
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,880
what your relationship with this child is?

514
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,790
He is...

515
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,390
He's my relative's child.

516
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,620
Do you have his ID card?

517
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,860
He's too young,

518
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,630
so we haven't had the chance to get him one yet.

519
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,570
She bought me...

520
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,550
Don't talk nonsense!

521
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,590
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll beat you!

522
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,030
I'll actually beat you!

523
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Come here.

524
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,560
Come on.

525
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,030
Little boy.

526
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,590
-I'm a police officer.
-What's going on now?

527
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,610
Don't be afraid. Say whatever you want.

528
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,630
Officer.

529
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,990
I lied to you just now.

530
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,560
We actually picked up this child on the street.

531
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,640
I've heard of picking up money,

532
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,520
but picking up a child?

533
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,810
You think police officers are that easy to fool?

534
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,380
Officer, please save me!

535
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,230
Bad people kidnapped me.

536
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,530
My dad's name is Zhang Liangyong.

537
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,940
My mom's name is Liu Cuiying.

538
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,510
I don't know where my home is. I've forgotten everything.

539
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,110
Come on.

540
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
Come with me.

541
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,390
Come here.

542
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,910
Child trafficking, huh?

543
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,570
No, Officer!

544
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,480
Get up first.

545
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,070
Come on, get up.

546
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,590
Stand up and talk.

547
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,820
Our family needs a male heir,

548
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
and the neighbors had two boys,

549
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,140
so they gave us one.

550
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,660
I even had to pay them!

551
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,630
I don't know anything else!

552
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,390
Brother, help our mom!

553
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,710
Shen.

554
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,410

This must be a misunderstanding.

This must be a misunderstanding!

557
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,640
My mom is uneducated and doesn't understand the law.

558
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,580
She's old and muddled.

559

Please forgive my mom.

Whether to forgive her or not is not up to me to decide.

562
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,390
It depends on what she's done.

Alright then.

I'll ask the court to reduce her sentence by a few years.

Don't catch a cold.

The police looked into the situation

596

and gave your grandma a punishment and a reprimand.

597
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,310
It almost scared the old lady to death.

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,150
Are we not paying them back?

742
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,560
Then what?

743
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,030
Our whole family just

744
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,900
run away from debts?

745
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,310
I know you care about me

746
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,910
and worry about me suffering.

747
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,390
But now,

748
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,730
we really have no way out.

749
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,630
In the past, you carried the burden alone.

750
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,990
Now,

751
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,650
let's carry it together.

752
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,140
You can save some energy.

753
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,990
Xia's floating supermarket

754
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,250
has already started making a profit.

755
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,720
How about...

756
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,880
[The main framework of China's national highway network, the "five vertical and seven horizontal" national trunk lines, is basically connected.]

757
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,830
The traffic industry development statistics announcement

758
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,710
released by the Ministry of Transport in 2006 shows that

759
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,950
by the end of 2006,

760
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,190
the total length of highways in China was

761
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,490
3,457,000 kilometers.

762
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,070
The number of commercial vehicles on highways nationwide was

763
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,910
8,025,800.

764
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,110
The completed highway investment was

765
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,190
623,105,000,000 yuan.

766
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,850
The total investment exceeded 1,500,000,000,000 yuan.

767
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,430
It is estimated that by 2010,

768
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,550
the operational mileage will reach 85,600 kilometers.

769
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,630
The highway mileage in various regions continues to grow.

770
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,040
The length of the expressways in the eastern region

771
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,070
is 20,279 kilometers.

772
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,450
The length of the expressways in the central region

773
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,880
is 13,339 kilometers.

774
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,230
The length of the expressways in the western region

775
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,380
is 11,717 kilometers.

776
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,420
New achievements have been made in expressway construction.

777
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,270
Sir. Sir.

778
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,090
The results are out.

779
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,810
Our class's results.

780
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,970
Please stop writing and take a look at this first.

781
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,470
How is it?

782
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,870
Drilling is starting to pay off.

783
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,840
For this set of practice test from Jiangxi,

784
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,870
I initially estimated the average score to be be around

785
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,360
84 points or so.

786
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,690
But it turns out to be

787
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
[Average score: 92]

788
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,390
92!

789
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,540
Our class's average score has passed 60, Sir!

790
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,000
For real.

791
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,730
There's another joint exam next week.

792
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,120
No. 1 High School will also be participating.

793
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,980
I'm already looking forward to it.

794
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,980
If you can really catch up with No. 1 High School's scores,

795
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,500
that would make me so proud.

796
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,520
It seems I'll have to make a visit

797
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,570
to Principal Fang's school next to us.

798
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,090
I'm looking forward to it.

799
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,620
As long as your class's average score passes 60,

800
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,700
I'll treat you to a meal.

801
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,490
Alright!

802
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,940
If we pass, you'll treat our whole class to a meal.

803
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,560
Deal.

804
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,950
What?

805
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,690
Isn't that what you just said?

806
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,530
Treat us to a meal.

807
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,070
Thank you, Sir!

808
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,180
[Striving unceasingly with steadfast integrity]

809
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,220
[Striving unceasingly with steadfast integrity]

810
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,590
Alright, alright.

811
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,310
Stop writing now.

812
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,350
Time's up.

813
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,170
Hand in your papers.

814
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,370
Well...

815
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,270
There's another set of practice exam tomorrow.

816
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,700
It's from Jiangxi Normal University Affiliated High School.

817
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,520
There's more?

818
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,910
Drilling every day, we're going to die from this!

819
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,690
Teacher, I haven't slept well for over a week.

820
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,380
I didn't sleep well either.

821
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,219
Alright, alright, everyone stop complaining.

822
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,489
You're just being delicate.

823
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,830
Do you know how much effort

824
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,260
the principal put into getting these test papers?

825
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,010
Don't take your blessings for granted.

826
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,080
Everyone, be safe on your way home after school.

827
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,790
Okay...

828
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,710
Why are you looking at me?

829
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,790
Is there something on my face?

830
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,469
Your grades are poor,

831
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,770
so of course you need drilling.

832
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,199
Why are you dragging us down with you?

833
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,900
You can slack off if you don't want to do the practice test.

834
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,010
No one's forcing you.

835
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,460
They rank our scores after each practice test,

836
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,800
three times a week.

837
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,060
Are you trying to drive us mad?

838
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,760
Hey, this is the school's arrangement.

839
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,760
What does it have to do with me?

840
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,360
You wrote the proposal, didn't you?

841
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,820
Fine, you can blame everything on me.

842
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,760
Alright, alright. I wrote it.

843
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,790
It's my fault for dragging you down.

844
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,910
I apologize to all of you.

845
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,770
How about I treat everyone to a late-night snack?

846
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,770
Drilling every day is so exhausting.

847
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,170
No one will be grateful to you for this.

848
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,390
When the time comes

849
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,590
and everyone gets into college because of this drilling you proposed,

850
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,770
they still won't be grateful to you.

851
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,710
I will.

852
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,170
I'll thank your whole family.

853
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,080
Let's go. Let's go.

854
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,850
Fenghua.

855
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,670
Fenghua.

856
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,020
Go home and sleep. You've been sleeping all day.

857
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,840
Where's my test paper?

858
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,870
Already handed in.

859
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,900
Why didn't anyone wait for me?

860
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,210
Stop laughing.

861
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,810
I'm going to the internet cafe

862
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,410
to look up some information on ship selling.

863
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,060
Also, there's a test problem from today

864
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,110
which I think has a better solution to it.

865
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,360
You can't be serious.

866
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,110
Are you planning a chakra explosion or something?

867
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,110
What else can I do?

868
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,390
It's not like I have Sharingan.

869
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,230
If I don't power up soon,

870
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,070
who am I going to copy from during the official exam?

871
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,690
What...

872
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,940
I'm coming, too.

873
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,660
What's wrong with these guys?

874
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,330
Xie.

875
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,670
It's not that I don't want to help you.

876
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,530
But, indeed,

877
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,110
I'm willing but unable to.

878
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,210
You know that I used to have over a dozen ships.

879
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,480
But later,

880
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,510
I didn't make any profit, you know?

881
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,170
I've gradually sold six of them already.

882
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,620
I'll be honest with you,

883
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,540
I don't know

884
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,370
what to do with the rest.

885
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,510
So,

886
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,510
as for your ship,

887
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,500
I really can't take it on.

888
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,070
Well,

889
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,180
how about a discount?

890
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,080
How much of a discount?

891
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,990
15%.

892
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,720
How much? 15%?

893
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,800
Xie.

894
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,630
Let me tell you something you might not want to hear.

895
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,380
That old ship of yours,

896
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,860
how many years has it been running?

897
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,660
Do you know that no one would take it even at half price?

898
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,350
When you have time,

899
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,190
go out and see the world more.

900
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,810
Who's still

901
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,080
using ships for cargo transportation these days?

902
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,630
Every trip by ship is guaranteed to lose money.

903
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,190
Alright.

904
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,310
I'll do you a favor and ask around in Taizhou.

905
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,140
Convert that old ship of yours

906
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,610
into a fishing boat.

907
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,390
But converting the ship costs money, too.

908
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,070
Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?

909
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,300
Look.

910
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,910
I'll be honest with you.

911
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,110
The money from my neighbors,

912
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,560
the dividends, I haven't paid them back yet.

913
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,400
My wife asked me whenever she saw me

914
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,190
when

915
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,820
I could bring the money home.

916
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,040
What kind of life is this?

917
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,070
Xie.

918
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,910
At least

919
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,460
it's a desperate solution, right?

920
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,650
G-Give it more thought.

921
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,780
Eat.

922
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,950

925
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,580
Will it work now that we put this online?

926
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,750
It's better than just waiting at home, right?

927
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,320
Ships are hard to sell these days.

928
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,660
It might be able to sell

929
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,520
on the internet.

930
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,870
Hey.

931
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,230
If you really sell it,

932
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,720
what about your dad?

933
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,160
We'll see about that.

934
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,600
A grown man can't be defeated so easily.

935
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,130
I don't have any other ideas right now anyways.

936
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,240
I'll give it one last shot.

937
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,160
If I can get into college,

938
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,370
my dad will definitely be able to pull himself together.

939
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,860
I'll set an example for him.

940
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,870
Your dad is a capable man after all.

941
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,920
He doesn't need you to set an example for him.

942
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,160
Have you guys seen what my dad looks like on the ship?

943
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,390
Head held high,

944
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,410
full of vigor,

945
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,680
as if he dug the canal himself.

946
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,880
When the ship was sold,

947
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,120
my dad would be dispirited.

948
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,590
I can't bear to see him like that.

949
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,660
My mom is suffering, too.

950
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,250
New gray hair grows at her temples every day.

951
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,490
Can't even pluck it all.

952
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,310
When I see the gray hair,

953
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,570
my heart feels like it's being pricked by needles.

954
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,360
Right now,

955
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,870
I don't have any grand plans.

957
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,310
I just wish

958
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,670
my parents don't have to work so hard.

959
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,390
As for everything else,

960
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,160
I don't think it's that important anymore.

961
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,190
Why did you drink so much?

962
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,980
Here, water.

963
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,190
Son...

964
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,200
I

965
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,970
am sorry.

966
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,330
If only

967
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
I were more capable

968
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,610
and could make money,

969
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,510
I wouldn't...

970
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,460
I wouldn't hold you back in your studies.

971
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,790
But

972
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,570
But I

973
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,570
really tried my best.

974
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,200
I've done my best.

975
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,900
In my life,

976
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,010
apart from seafaring,

977
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,630
I don't know how to do anything else.

978
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,180
But...

979
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,580
But you... You have potential.

980
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,170
Y-You can do it.

981
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,710
Your father...

982
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,200
Your father is useless.

983
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,780
Looked down upon by others...

984
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,910
But my son...

985
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,700
Y-You must be successful.

986
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,480
You need to...

987
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,190
Regain the face I've lost

988
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,010
for me.

989
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,520
Please.

990
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,640
Please.
