Cut it thinner.

4
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,060
Are you braising it or stir-frying it?

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,479
Braising.

6
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,479
You're using such high heat for braising?

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,259
Alright. Got it.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,950
Control the heat.

9
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,380
Boss!

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,729
Someone's looking for you.

11
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,180
Our boss is here.

12
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,710
Siyi.

13
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,670
Uncle Zhou.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Why are you here?

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,210
I'm here to find a job.

16
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,220
A part-time job.

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,720
I can wash dishes, serve tables, and sweep floors.

18
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,860
Except for cooking,

19
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,710
I can basically do all the other jobs.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,990
H-Hold on a second.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,410
What's wrong? What happened?

22
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,530
Besides, I can come to work every weekend.

23
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,230
I'll also take half the usual wage.

24
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,480
It's just I was wondering if I could get an advance payment.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,620
An advance payment?

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,420
How much do you want?

27
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,820
4,700.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,510
Why such an odd amount?

29
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,240
What exactly happened?

30
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,800
I can lend you the money,

31
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,840
Siyi,

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,440
but I can't offer you a job.

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,960
Why?

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,250
You tell me.

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,190
You're in your final year of senior high school.

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,030
Your only task right now

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,510
is to study hard,

38
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,290
okay?

39
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,710
Never mind then.

40
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,470
If you can't give me a job,

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,750
I'll try somewhere else.

42
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,190
Don't tell Grandma about this.

43
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,670
Sorry for bothering you.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
Stop there.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,530
Even your grandma doesn't know about this?

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,590
What exactly happened?

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,450
It's your mother who needs the money,

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,470
right?

49
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,350
How about this?

50
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,300
You can come here on weekends

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,790
and see if there's anything you can help with.

52
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,550
But

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,790
when there's no work to do,

54
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,329
be good and do your homework properly.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,430
Okay.

56
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,329
Alright?

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,630
You're welcome.

59
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,980
Give me the money.

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,150

Here you are.

64
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,780
You didn't even take the money.

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,870
Are you trying to learn from Lei Feng?

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,660
Thank you.

67
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,270
This kid.

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,980
Your teacher called me today,

69
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,630
saying that during class,

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,680
you were using Morse code to send secret messages to a female classmate.

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,970
Is that true?

72
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,260
Why are you smiling?

73
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,750
Did you teach him that?

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,900
It's not like that.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,190
I only taught him that

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,830
as a hobby.

77
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,690
How was I supposed to know he'd use it for this?

78
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,440
Which classmate?

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,520
Ma Siyi?

80
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,270
It's a bit too early.

81
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,710
Is this how you teach children?

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,960
No dinner for you.

83
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,840
You eat.

84
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,110
Don't let this happen again.

85
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,950
Haven't I told you

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,810
not to hang out with those who play around all day?

87
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,320
Ma Siyi is alright.

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,260
She got into No. 1 High School.

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,510
Her grades are pretty good.

90
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,030
But look at those other kids.

91
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,530
They'll affect your grades.

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,410
It's not that serious.

93
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,600
Those kids are all pretty decent.

Don't push the bike any further.

96

It's too noisy. Just leave it there.

97

Okay.

98

This one.

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,950
Are you sure this ship is unclaimed?

102
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,120
We don't want to get caught later.

103

Don't worry.

104
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,870
I'll go down and take a look.

No, no.

106
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,190
I'll go. I'll go.

Hold this for me.

Be careful.

112
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,570
Slowly.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
It's okay.

114
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,470
Be careful.

115
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,550
Give me the bucket.

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,900
Here.

117
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,620
Check if there's any over there.

118
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,740
Shine some light for him.

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,800
Be careful.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,830
Be careful, Wanghe.

121
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,710
Are you alright?

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,330
Be careful.

123
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,910
How is it? Did you find any?

124
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,630
Is there any?

125
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,780
Yes, a lot.

126
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,870
Here, here.

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,000
Give him the bucket.

128
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,810
Keep an eye out for people.

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm going down.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Give him this bucket too.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,310
I'll take this.

132

The police are here. Run!

135
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,190
Hurry up!

136
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,940
Go that way!

137
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,910
Run!

138
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,000
Leave it, leave it!

139
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Go that way!

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,280
Stop right there!

141
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,110
Go that way!

142
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,910
Go that way!

There are more people down there!

144
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,500
Stop!

145
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,180
Freeze!

146
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,580
Run! Haikuo!

147
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,640
Don't run!

148
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,510
Go that way!

149
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,150
Run!

150
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,940
Stop there!

151
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,370
Go that way! Go that way!

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,790
Go that way!

153
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,550
Stop!

154
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,500
Freeze!

155
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,530
We were just passing by.

156
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,470
We were just passing by!

157
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
We didn't do anything!

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,460
You little brat.

159
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,910
Officer, I was just passing by.

160
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,670
Passing by? Passing by with an oil bucket?

161
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,520
You know what?

162
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,700
There have been a lot of oil thieves lately.

163
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,060
It's not just you guys.

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,990
Sir. Sir.

165
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,950
Please, I'm begging you.

166
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm still in school.

167
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,540
I'll get expelled.

168
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,900
Now you remember you're a student?

169
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,920
Get in!

170
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,460
What do we do now?

171
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,200
How about

172
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,340
we call Chen Rui

173
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,030
and let him ask his mom to find a way to bail Wanghe out?

174
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,810
Right. His mother is the district chief. She must know the police.

175
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,290
What if his mom refuses?

176
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,920
We won't know if we don't try.

177
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,030
If Wanghe gets detained today,

178
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,670
his dad might beat him to death.

179
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,460
Hello?

180
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,920
You want to speak to Chen Rui?

181
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,780
He's at home.

182
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Who is it?

183
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,590
Hello?

184
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,300
I don't know.

185
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,470
You didn't even ask who it was.

186
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,980
Don't be too strict with the kid.

187
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,410
It's just a phone call.

188
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,010
Who allowed you to sit here?

189
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,870
What happened?

190
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,320
My friend got arrested by the police.

191
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Who?

192
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,600
Which friend?

193
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,500
What for?

194
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,350
It must be a misunderstanding.

195
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,570
Why did he call you?

196
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,539
They want me to help?

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,210
Do you think I'm going to the police station to bail someone out for you?

198
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,250
You've done this kind of thing many times before, haven't you?

199
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,340
No.

200
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,110
This is the first time.

201
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,700
Sir.

202
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,100
Please let me go.

203
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,990
I won't dare to do it again.

204
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,340
Now you're begging for mercy?

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,620
It's a bit too late for that, don't you think?

206
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,360
You're not a child anymore.

207
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,430
You think you can just get away with it?

208
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,310
Sir.

209
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,790
Why don't you just beat me up

210
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,920
and consider it my punishment?

211
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,300
If I

212
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,900
personally send you to prison,

213
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,310
when your father finds out,

214
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,950
I suppose his expression would be quite amusing.

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,970
You know my father?

216
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,770
More than just knowing him.

217
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,720
Your father and I have a bit of a past.

218
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,790
Your father used to bully me a lot when we were kids.

219
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,070
He'd corner me every day

220
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,990
and take my stuff.

221
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,970
I got beaten up by him quite a lot.

222
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,340
Do you think there's a chance?

223
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,910
I don't know.

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,010
But Chen Rui is quite loyal to friends.

225
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,220
I think he'll do his best.

226
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,790
Let's take it one step at a time.

227
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,660
The college entrance exam is just around the corner.

228
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,160
If something goes wrong,

229
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,120
his life will be ruined!

230
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,280
This won't do.

231
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,390
I'll go find him.

232
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,410
What do you want to do?

233
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:19,950
Let go of me!

234
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,390
You can't go!

235
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,080
You'll only make things worse!

236
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,500
Let go of me!

237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,640
-Don't be anxious.
-It's useless to be anxious.

238
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,310
Fenghua...

239
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,140
It's okay, Fenghua.

240
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,940
There's no point in being anxious now.

241
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,200
Tell me.

242
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,060
If I had insisted on not letting you go out today,

243
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,140
would he have avoided this trouble?

244
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,510
No.

245
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,270
It was everyone's decision.

246
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,090
It wasn't your fault.

247
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,750
You couldn't have stopped us.

248
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,570
If Wanghe really gets detained,

249
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,370
I'll drop out of school!

250
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,340
They say

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,220
life in prison is extremely hard.

252
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,860
Without money, it's impossible to get by.

253
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,140
If his parents give up on him,

254
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,430
I'll take care of him.

255
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,650
I believe Chen Rui

256
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,180
will take it seriously.

257
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,800
He should be working on it already.

258
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,740
We might as well go home and wait for news.

259
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,100
Let's go home first.

260
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,880
Wanghe is a lucky boy.

261
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,720
He always manages to turn bad luck into good.

262
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,910
Where are you going?

263
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,850
Get back here!

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,680
I'll be right back, Mom.

265
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,990
Chen Rui, stop right there!

266
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,310
Mom, I'll be back in no time.

267
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,910
I promise.

268
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,750
What do you want to do?

269
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,090
I just want to go check on him.

270
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
Are you going to bail him out?

271
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,150
I'm not capable of that, Mom.

272
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,510
He's my best friend.

273
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,310
Even if I can't help,

274
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,390
I have to be there.

275
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,230
I won't allow it.

276
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,150
Please, Mom.

277
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,710
I'll really be quick.

278
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,390
Come home with me.

279
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,190
I'll be back...

280
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,470
I'll be back right away.

281
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:15,990
Mom.

282
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,150
Stop pulling and tugging.

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,510
What if the neighbors see?

284
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,900
Alright, keep your voice down.

285
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,670
Son!

286
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,030
Son!

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,120
Where are you hurt?

288
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,840
Keep it down.

289
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,850
Are you hungry?

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,870
You'd better eat something first.

291
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,110
Once you get there,

292
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,750
there's not much to eat at the police station.

293
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,380
[Police]

294
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,150
Come on.

295
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,920
Get off.

296
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,740
Let's go.

297
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,950
[Police]

298
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,640
Sit here.

299
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,940
I want a Stir-fried Shredded Pork with Green Pepper,

300
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,880
a Fried Stinky Tofu,

301
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,840
and a Cold Beef Salad.

302
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,340
Two bottles of drinks.

303
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,850
Make sure they're ice-cold.

304
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,620
[Public Toilet]

305
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,810
Why are they eating?

306
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,530
What's going on?

307
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,450
Let's go up. That way.

308
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,440
Don't just sit there.

309
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,440
Eat.

310
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,420
How are your grades?

311
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,060
I'm ranked third in the whole grade,

312
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,630
to last.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,290
Doesn't your dad beat you?

314
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,290
He does.

315
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
He's been beating me since I was little.

316
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,840
He's broken several belts beating me.

317
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,250
But later he found that beating me was useless,

318
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,640
so he gave up.

319
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,510
And you started to give up on yourself.

320
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,310
It's not that bad.

321
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,160
My grades are poor

322
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,570
because my mind isn't on it.

323
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,980
Where is your mind then?

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,060
Making money.

325
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,210
You are still a kid.

326
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,310
Why are you thinking about making money at such an early age?

327
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,520
Let me tell you.

328
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,610
It's not too late

329
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
to think about this kind of thing

330
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,430
in a few years.

331
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,110
It'll be too late then, Uncle.

332
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,040
Before the Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway was put into operation,

333
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,580
river transport was really booming.

334
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,890
My dad has a ship.

335
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,450
He used to make money off of it easily.

336
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,010
But now,

337
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,220
breaking even is considered a victory.

338
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
My dad used to be so impressive.

339
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,940
Wherever he went, people would offer him cigarettes.

340
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,480
Everyone called him 'boss.'

341
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,460
But what about now?

342
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,440
Now he's the one offering cigarettes to others wherever he goes.

343
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,220
Every time he sees contractors,

344
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,640
he grovels to them.

345
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,880
He's not manly at all.

346
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,760
Don't you dare talk more nonsense!

347
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,500
When I was a kid,

348
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,850
your father

349
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,600
used to set up a stall at the old pier,

350
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,920
selling fish and shrimp.

351
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,710
Every day, he'd get up before dawn

352
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,200
and take the best spot.

353
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
Only after he finished selling

354
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,750
would he let others sell there.

355
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,850
By the time I set up my stall,

356
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,260
the fish and shrimp would already be dead.

357
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,800
At that time,

358
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,820
the person I disliked the most was your father.

359
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,340
I remember when I was in my senior year of high school,

360
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,110
my mother fell ill.

361
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,910
No one in my family could take care of her,

362
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,700
so I had to drop out of school to look after her.

363
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,660
Later, I don't know who

364
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,230
told your father about this,

365
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,870
but one night, your father

366
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,740
suddenly came to my house.

367
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,180
I didn't dare to open the door.

368
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,030
Unexpectedly, he kicked the door open with a bang.

369
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,130
What do you want, Xie Tiancheng?

370
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,400
At first, I thought

371
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,990
it contained bricks.

372
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,819
I only realized after I opened it that

373
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,099
it was filled with cash.

374
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,710
A full 600 yuan.

375
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,470
It was 1987.

376
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,280
That was a huge sum of money back then.

377
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,050
I was completely stunned at the time.

378
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,099
I had no idea what he was up to.

379
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,190
Guess what your father said to me at that time.

380
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,040
He pointed at me and said, 'Kid,

381
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,360
don't you drop out of school.

382
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,030
Take this money and hire a caregiver.

383
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,750
If it's not enough,

384
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,630
let me know.'

385
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,380
I was completely dumbfounded at that moment.

386
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,440
Get into a good university

387
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,030
and find a decent job.

388
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,770
Things like street vending

389
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,750
are not for you.

390
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,720
Thank you.

391
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,590
During that time my mom was ill,

392
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,880
it cost us about 2,000 yuan in total.

393
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,010
During her entire hospital stay,

394
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,080
your dad

395
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,590
and his friends

396
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,540
took turns taking care of my mom.

397
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,330
Every time your dad came,

398
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,860
he'd bring the soup he made

399
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,460
for my mom with the fish he caught.

400
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,010
When my mom was discharged,

401
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,030
she secretly told me that

402
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,320
she'd never want to eat fish again in her life,

403
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,360
that she had had enough.

404
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,730
Kid.

405
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,690
Your dad was a jerk back then.

406
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,580
Of course, he still is now.

407
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,580
But in his life,

408
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,350
he's never owed anyone favors.

409
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,700
It's always others who owe him.

410
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,750
You're in your rebellious phase now.

411
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,510
You may be annoyed by him, and you may look down on him.

412
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,650
That's all normal.

413
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,060
But I hope you can understand that

414
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,260
no matter when,

415
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,510
and no matter what you become,

416
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,810
your dad is, and will always be,

417
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,790
a man of great integrity.

418
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,370
In the past,

419
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,590
your dad never brought shame to you.

420
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,530
In the future,

421
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,570
I hope you won't bring shame to your dad either.

422
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,270
If you dare to be such a jerk again,

423
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,120
I'll break your legs myself.

424
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,450
Boss, bill please.

425
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,930
Thank you.

426
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,920
It's truly a case of "raising a father for a lifetime and using him for a moment."

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,960
Wanghe.

428
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,420
You must kowtow to your father when you get back.

429
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,870
Tell me about it.

430
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,920
Uncle Xie is no ordinary man.

431
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,780
In the early years of seafaring, there were scammers

432
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,160
who put fishing nets deep in the river.

433
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,770
When a ship passed by, they'd rush out demanding compensation.

434
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,970
But our ships

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,320
have never been stopped, not even once.

436
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,130
Everyone knows Boss Xie isn't someone to mess with.

437
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,740
That's really true.

438
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,710
Wanghe.

439
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,050
Back in the day, your father was like Ghost Foot Seven.

440
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,790
Your dad is Ghost Foot Seven.

441
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,260
Uncle Xie is Wong Fei-hung.

442
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,210
Wong Fei-hung?

443
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,100
The Shadowless Kick.

444
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,780
You... I dare you say that to me again!

445
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,220
We can't count on the ships anymore.

446
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,950
We need to think of some other way to make money.

447
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,820
Maybe we don't have to give her money.

448
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,910
What do you mean?

449
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,920
When we were little, you bought her a schoolbag.

450
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,890
She didn't say anything at the moment.

451
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,590
She saved her pocket money for a year

452
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,710
and collected and sold Coke cans.

453
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,510
You remember, right?

454
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,770
In the end, she paid you back with a Casio digital watch.

455
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
This shows she doesn't like owing favors.

456
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,020
But we can't just ignore her situation, can we?

457
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,240
As the saying goes, give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

458
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,500
Rather than giving her money,

459
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,700
maybe it's better to help her find a way to make money.

460
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,240
She's in her final year of senior high school.

461
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,750
This year is especially important.

462
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,590
She can't be distracted.

463
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,470
She's in the key class at No. 1 High School,

464
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,540
and she made it to the top three.

465
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,230
With a bit more effort, she could get into a top university.

466
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,840
If worst comes to worst, I'll sell

467
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,800
my equipment in the game Fantasy Westward Journey.

468
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,580
My five-digit QQ number

469
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,700
should be worth something.

470
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,080
My dad's Jialing motorcycle that he never rides

471
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,180
can also be sold.

472
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,330
No need, I have a plan.

473
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,350
What kind of plan?

474
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,500
Do you need my help?

475
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,110
No.

476
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,300
The only thing I need you to do is to keep your mouth shut.

477
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,200
That's right.

478
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,970
We must keep this under wraps and not let anything slip,

479
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,050
especially to Siyi.

480
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,670
What could I possibly say?

481
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,430
"Siyi.

482
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,070
Wanghe tried to steal oil for you

483
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,730
and almost got caught by the police."

484
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,890
Do you think I'm stupid?

485
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,690
You went to steal oil?

486
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,430
No, I didn't.

487
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,220
Of course not.

488
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,700
We were just taking a walk and happened to pass by.

489
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,030
Right?

490
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,520
Yes, these... These are all things we picked up.

491
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,710
Siyi!

492
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,430
Siyi. Siyi.

493
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,870
Stop hitting him.

494
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,550
Siyi!

495
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,580
Wanghe was just trying to help you.

496
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,790
He was worried you'd sell blood.

497
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,310
Yes, right.

498
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,650
Then the police came.

499
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,590
And then the police left.

500
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,110
It was a false alarm.

501
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,070
Right, right, it was a false alarm.

502
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,700
Yes.

503
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,570
Siyi.

504
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,350
I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me.

505
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,990
From now on, don't interfere with my business.

506
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,610
Xie Wanghe, you'd better watch yourself.

507
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,010
Siyi!

508
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,490
Why are you looking at me?

509
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,090
Siyi.

510
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,580
What's wrong?

511
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,600
Let me see.

512
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,320
You're crying?

513
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,740
Alright. Alright.

514
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,290
Who did you have a fight with?

515
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,110
You had a fight with Wanghe, didn't you?

516
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,300
No.

517
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,390
No?

518
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,500
If not, then why did you say

519
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,990
'Watch yourself' to him?

520
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,470
I'm not deaf.

521
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,030
I heard everything.

522
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,320
I'll go talk to Wanghe's mother then.

523
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,630
How dare he mistreat my granddaughter?

524
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,370
I'll give him a beating.

525
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,410
Grandma, Grandma, it's not like that.

526
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,630
He really didn't mistreat me.

527
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,360
His heart is in the right place. It's just he's an idiot.

528
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,690
He's always doing inexplicably stupid things.

529
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,310
So no one mistreated you?

530
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,180
Wanghe has been like that since he was little.

531
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,480
A bit of a fool.

532
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,990
He becomes a scatterbrain every time he sees you.

533
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,250
You might not see it,

534
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,500
but I can.

535
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,140
Don't you remember? When you were little, to cheer you up,

536
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,580
he almost crippled himself.

537
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,380
You might not see it, but I can.

538
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,230
Siyi.

539
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,210
Why are you so late, Wanghe?

540
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,760
We're almost done eating.

541
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,110
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

542
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,030
Let me ask you a question.

543
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,980
Do you all know Sun Wukong?

544
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,280
Sure we do.

545
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,080
Then do you know how Sun Wukong flies?

546
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,440
On his somersault cloud.

547
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,360
Correct.

548
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, what I have in my hand

549
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,080
is a seven-colored auspicious cloud.

550
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,430
I can fly too.

551
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,760
Xie Wanghe, you're just bragging.

552
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,390
You don't believe me, right?

553
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:44,990
No, we don't.

554
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,810
No.

555
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,990
Follow me!

556
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,540
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

557
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,860
[Dangerous behavior. Do not imitate.]

558
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,090
I'm coming!

559
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,620
Does it hurt?

560
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,860
Are you okay?

561
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,460
-Are you alright?
-Are you okay?

562
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,830
-Are you alright?
-Are you okay?

563
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,110
Are you okay, Wanghe?

564
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,960
I was just messing with you guys.

565
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,860
It hurt like hell when I fell earlier,

566
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,990
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

567
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,710
The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet, right?

568
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,580
It'll be very painful once it wears off.

569
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,230
It's fine. I'm not afraid of pain.

570
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,690
You're not afraid of pain?

571
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
Then why did you cry?

572
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,840
Who cried?

573
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,900
You didn't cry.

574
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,480
It's just your eyes were sweating.

575
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,430
Can you stop doing this in the future?

576
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,620
What did I do?

577
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,830
Being naughty and making adults angry.

578
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,480
You were lucky this time.

579
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,340
You only broke your leg.

580
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,350
If you had fallen headfirst, you would have died.

581
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,370
Don't worry.

582
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,890
I'm a lucky person with a charmed life.

583
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,670
Shut up!

584
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,050
This time you broke your leg,

585
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,860
your mom's eyes are swollen from crying at home.

586
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,590
Grow up a bit, okay?

587
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,750
Have you all forgotten?

588
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,810
Didn't the teacher say

589
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,720
science comes from practice?

590
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,110
Aren't human inventions done

591
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,010
thanks to brave people like me?

592
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,290
They are brave,

593
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,590
while you're just trying to get yourself killed.

594
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,650
If you don't understand, don't talk nonsense, okay?

595
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,840
You understand?

596
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,710
Of course I understand.

597
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,150
Do you know the principle of the lightning conductor?

598
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,310
We learned about it in science class.

599
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,110
Then explain it.

600
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,860
What principle is that?

601
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,480
As if you know.

602
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,850
Of course I know.

603
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,820
Can someone get me a piece of wire?

604
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,050
I'll go.

605
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,450
You all know about conductors and insulators, right?

606
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,160
The plaster on my leg is an insulator.

607
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,270
If I electrify the wire, since the plaster insulates,

608
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,120
there's no way I can get electrocuted.

609
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,510
Let me demonstrate for you.

610
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,460
Everyone step back.

611
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,950
Witness with me

612
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,780
the great power of science.

613
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,920
[Dangerous behavior. Do not imitate.]

614
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,710
Watch carefully.

615
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,190
-Doctor!
-Doctor!

616
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,300
Help!

617
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,510
-Help!
-Help!

618
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,550
Mom.

619
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,870
You are still up?

620
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm used to it.

621
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
Son.

622
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,050
How about

623
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,800
I rent a small house for you?

624
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,070
Staying up like this too often can lead to mental exhaustion.

625
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,330
Rent a house?

626
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,520
The two of us move out

627
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,230
and leave Dad alone at home to sleep?

628
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,330
It'd be better to have him move out.

629
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,360
From now on,

630
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,700
let him sleep on the ship.

631
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,210
Ask him not to come home unless necessary.

632
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,410
Did we make any profit this month?

633
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,780
It's good enough if we didn't lose money.

634
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,940
The gas price has increased again.

635
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,230
Labor costs are high too.

636
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,850
There's no shortage of work at construction sites in the city.

637
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,840
I've been thinking,

638
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
if worst comes to worst,

639
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,040
we can't keep this ship anymore.

640
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
We'll sell it, withdraw our shares,

641
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,660
and switch to a heavy truck for land transport.

642
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,170
Help me look it up online later.

643
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,620
No, Mom, don't.

644
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,550
Why are you unhappy about it?

645
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,190
Weren't you the one who kept telling me

646
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,510
to cut our losses if river transport wasn't profitable?

647
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,300
What happened?

648
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,850
You've changed your mind?

649
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,050
It's not that I've changed my mind.

650
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,090
I'm just worried Dad won't be happy.

651
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,820
Normally,

652
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,710
I feel like Dad is always listless.

653
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,700
But once he gets on the ship,

654
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,370
he becomes full of energy,

655
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
like he's a different person.

656
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,550
Your dad once told me

657
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,120
that in his previous life, he was a loach.

658
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,250
He can't stay too far from water,

659
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,540
or

660
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,500
he'll suffocate.

661
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,070
Mom.

662
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm sorry.

663
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,630
I'm so useless.

664
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,340
What's wrong? Why are you saying such things?

665
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,370
Back in the day, a lot of people

666
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,730
were already successful at my age.

667
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,170
They could take care of their families.

668
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,770
But I'm still in school,

669
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,690
and I can't help with anything.

670
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,290
Silly boy.

671
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,110
The fact that you care

672
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,990
is enough to make me content.

673
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,830
Mom.

674
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,010
Please rest assured.

675
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,240
I'll definitely be successful in the future.

676
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,410
I'll make you and Dad proud of me.

677
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,220
In the future, when you go out,

678
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,790
you can have your nose in the air.

679
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,790
Alright.

680
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,560
Having our nose in the air.

681
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,860
I'm Xie Wanghe's mother.

682
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Let me help you calculate.

683
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,100
When is Grandma coming?

684
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,440
Don't bring this up to me.

685
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,820
Just thinking about them coming

686
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,170
makes me shudder all over.

687
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,220
Last time when your grandma left,

688
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,590
she complained to you about being poor again, didn't she?

689
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,610
No, she didn't.

690
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,310
I heard it all.

691
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,290
Saying things like

692
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,630
the roof of her house was leaking again,

693
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,460
the villagers didn't care,

694
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,680
and they were demolishing her pigsty forcibly and such.

695
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,480
Why are they so mean?

696
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,560
Nonsense.

697
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,040
Your grandma built the pigsty right in the wind's path.

698
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,860
When the wind blows, it stinks up the whole village.

699
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,550
How can the villagers not hate it?

700
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,520
But she left you the family heirloom.

701
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,250
A jade bracelet.

702
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,360
At our wedding,

703
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,570
she wrapped it in layers and layers,

704
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,080
and solemnly handed it to me,

705
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,480
saying it was

706
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,990
a mutton-fat jade

707
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,770
from the Han Dynasty.

708
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,590
I was so happy.

709
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,480
Later, when I had it appraised,

710
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,520
it turned out to be majestic white jade.

711
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,420
It's even cheaper than this bag we are making.

712
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,260
Mom.

713
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,470
How much can we earn from this batch?

714
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,370
Why do you care?

715
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,280
How much can I get?

716
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,420
How much do you want?

717
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,210
200.

718
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,370
How about 250?

719
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,560
Sure.

720
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,300
Go look in the mirror.

721
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,210
You'll see an idiot staring back at you.

722
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,770
Mom, I'm not asking for much.

723
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,550
200.

724
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,860
Just 200.

725
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,550
Please.

726
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,160
What does a student like you need so much money for?

727
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,360
I want to buy jeans.

728
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,410
Didn't I just buy you a pair last year?

729
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,990
The style is outdated.

730
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,280
It looks a bit unfashionable.

731
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,680
You can't blame the clothes if the person wearing them is unfashionable.

732
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,330
Look at Siyi.

733
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,710
Even if she wears a big cotton padded jacket,

734
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,500
she can still manage to look like she's from Milan or Paris.

735
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,800
So who do you think is prettier, me or her?

736
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,120
How can you ask such a question?

737
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,480
Who gave you the courage?

738
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,630
Was it Fish Leong?

739
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,500
Mom!

740
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,640
Alright. Alright.

741
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,830
You're prettier.

742
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,590
Of course my daughter is prettier.

743
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,700
You're youthful,

744
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,170
radiant,

745
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,380
and smart.

746
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,100
Of course my daughter is the prettiest.

747
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,410
Anyway,

748
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,260
I have a better figure than Siyi.

749
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,460
My legs are longer than hers,

750
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,440
and my waist is slimmer too.

751
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,290
If your grades were better than hers,

752
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,040
let alone jeans,

753
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,350
I'd even buy you a cell phone.

754
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,390
Being good at studies is useless.

755
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,800
Why is that?

756
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,410
Wanghe's grades are at the bottom of our grade,

757
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,920
but in a few years,

758
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,150
he'll definitely be

759
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,610
the most, most promising one among all the students.

760
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,260
One 'most' is not enough?

761
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
You had to use it twice?

762
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,630
He has so many brilliant ideas in his head.

763
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,130
Any one of his ideas could make a lot of money.

764
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,230
You know what?

765
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,130
Today, Mr. Xu gave him a hard time,

766
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,949
but Wanghe left him speechless.

767
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,179
It was so satisfying.

768
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,239
Quite promising.

769
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,360
What about you?

770
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,650
You can't get into college,

771
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,179
your family is so poor,

772
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,550
you're not gentle,

773
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,800
and you don't want to work.

774
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,070
So, in the future,

775
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,770
who will want to marry you?

776
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,409
Who says I can't work?

777
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,469
Granny Ma said

778
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,760
my fried radish cakes are much better than Siyi's.

779
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,530
Well, that's true.

780
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,659
In the future,

781
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,949
Siyi will get into a top university,

782
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,900
and Wanghe will make a lot of money.

783
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,340
By then, he'll drive a Mercedes

784
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,060
to pick up Siyi

785
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,740
and come to your little stall

786
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,310
to eat your fried radish cakes.

787
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't forget to give them a discount.

788
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:11,850
♫Oh, my dear dad♫

789
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:20,250
♫I love that handsome boy♫

790
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,430
♫I'm willing to go to Rosa Gate♫

791
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,950
♫And buy a wedding ring♫

792
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,740
Keep the change.

793
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:43,280
♫Yes, I must go♫

794
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,760
♫If you don't agree♫

795
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,160
Why hasn't she come out yet?

796
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,510
Where's Siyi?

797
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,070
Her grandma said

798
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,220
she left by herself early in the morning.

799
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,490
Is something wrong?

800
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,110
Would she have left on her own if nothing was wrong?

801
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,990
Full of nonsense.

802
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,360
So she's really angry with us?

803
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,730
You're talking nonsense too.

804
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,470
If Wanghe dared to treat me like this,

805
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,230
I'd beat him up too.

806
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,790
I'd give him a flying kick right away.

807
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,710
We've waited here for you for ages.

808
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,630
Why can't you wait for me?

809
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,890
So she's really angry?

810
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,210
She really doesn't want us to interfere anymore?

811
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,760
That can't be, right?

812
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,560
It's time to eat after finishing this.

813
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,520
Lao'er.

814
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,390
Let's go.

815
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,390
Time to eat.

816
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,590
Come on.

817
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,400
Give it to me.

818
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,030
Alright.

819
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,140
Here you go.

820
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Peanuts.

821
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,670
Beef.

822
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
What's wrong?

823
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,110
Got bitten again?

824
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,620
That woman.

825
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,640
She bites when she's happy,

826
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,730
and when she's not happy,

827
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,520
she bites too.

828
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,550
So this time, was it

829
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,960
because she was happy or unhappy?

830
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,850
A mix of both.

831
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,760
You can't keep living like this, right?

832
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,810
I've told her a million times.

833
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,940
She just can't break this habit.

834
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,220
This time it's not so bad.

835
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,870
Look, it's not even swollen.

836
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,960
Last time, it swelled up this big.

837
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,870
Took a whole week to go down.

838
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,870
Do you know why?

839
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,880
Why?

840
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,040
Let me tell you.

841
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,310
Human teeth and dog teeth are both poisonous.

842
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,920
Really?

843
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,950
Of course.

844
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,520
Should I get a shot then?

845
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,590
I've heard of rabies vaccine,

846
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,620
but I've never heard of the vaccine for crazy people.

847
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,950
But since you keep getting bitten,

848
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,070
I suppose you should have developed antibodies by now.

849
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,640
Next time she does this to you,

850
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,050
give her a good scare.

851
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,130
How should I scare her?

852
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,270
Threaten to divorce her.

853
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,470
That won't work.

854
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,510
What if she agrees?

855
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,250
How is that possible?

856
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,180
Women don't divorce

857
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,520
at the drop of a hat, okay?

858
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,520
You're giving them too much credit.

859
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,760
However,

860
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,950
no matter what,

861
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,390
you need to set rules at home.

862
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,120
So

863
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,420
you have rules in your house?

864
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,650
Of course.

865
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,220
Go ask Haihong if she dares

866
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,540
to raise her voice at me.

867
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,260
She'd be out of line if she did.

868
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,290
If you don't believe me, go ask her

869
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,550
who the boss at home

870
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,970
is.

871
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,870
You need to let him know

872
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,000
that at home,

873
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,520
women are the boss.

874
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,910
In front of men,

875
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,750
we need to establish rules.

876
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,960
Anything is allowed at home,

877
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,080
but absolutely no physical violence.

878
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,650
Yes, right here.

879
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,730
The two of us

880
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,760
just got carried away in our conversation.

881
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,440
And he had been drinking.

882
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,470
It wasn't intentional.

883
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,710
That's still not acceptable.

884
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,210
Next time,

885
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,390
if he lays a hand on you again,

886
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,980
you come stay at our place.

887
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,230
If he dares to come to our place to get you,

888
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,670
you'll see how I'll deal with him.

889
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,900
Actually,

890
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,120
I understand him to some extent.

891
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,380
Recently, he's been having a hard time at work.

892
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,570
He's under a lot of pressure.

893
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,670
Just because

894
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,440
he's frustrated outside,

895
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,920
he comes home to take it out on his wife?

896
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,320
That's sick.

897
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:00,740
Shao.

898
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,130
I really envy you.

899
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,430
What do you envy about me?

900
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,070
I envy you for your wife.

901
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,310
Your wife

902
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,990
cooks various kinds of delicious food for you every day.

903
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,830
As for my wife,

904
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,850
she'd probably burn down the kitchen just frying an egg.

905
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,120
What delicious food are you having today?

906
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,410
Share some with me.

907
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,280
She had a fever yesterday.

908
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,610
She didn't have time to cook.

909
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,150
Why don't you hurry home and take care of her then?

910
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,460
What a great opportunity.

911
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,590
Show her some love.

912
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,950
We've been married for so long. We don't care about this anymore.

913
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,350
The longer you've been married,

914
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,890
the more she cares about this.

915
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,970
And you need to have a sense of ritual.

916
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,950
Remind yourself and your partner

917
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,500
that your feelings for each other haven't faded.

918
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,990
Is that really necessary?

919
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,180
Women

920
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,230
are emotional creatures.

921
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,720
If you show just a little bit of care,

922
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,790
they'll be incredibly touched.

923
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,030
My wife is just like that.

924
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,070
She really falls for this kind of thing.

925
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,220
Granny Ma, are you going home?

926
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,070
[Clock Fixing]

927
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,250
I'm going to get something.

928
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,130
Yanlin.

929
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,690
Granny Ma.

930
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,070
You've closed up? Let me help you.

931
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,350
No, I'm just going home to get some stuff.

932
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,740
Yanlin.

933
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,170
Well...

934
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,230
When Zhimei left,

935
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,230
why didn't you see her off?

936
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,500
She didn't ask me to.

937
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,700
From now on,

938
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,280
come by my place every day after work.

939
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,390
[Huihuang Tailor Shop]

940
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,990
Before Zhimei left,

941
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,350
she went to see an experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctor

942
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,670
who prescribed some medicine for you.

943
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,560
It's for liver protection.

944
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,640
She asked me

945
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,240
to brew it for you every day

946
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,560
and make sure you drink it.

947
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
She said you don't listen to your father,

948
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,360
but you'll listen to me.

949
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,830
My liver is fine.

950
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,370
She's just concerned about you.

951
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,970
Being a married couple is like this.

952
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not easy, you know.

953
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,820
You support each other

954
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,630
and help each other.

955
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,300
How great this is.

956
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,670
Call her more often from now on.

957
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,380
Otherwise, being so far apart,

958
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,400
your feelings might fade.

959
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,440
Right.

960
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,560
But it's not like she's never coming back, right?

961
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,200
Yes, I know.

962
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,670
You still need to call her.

963
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,690
I know, I know.

964
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,500
I'll call her in a bit.

965
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,000
Alright, give it to me.

966
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,200
Be careful.

967
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,980
Alright.
