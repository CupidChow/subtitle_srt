00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,370
At what?

Nothing.

I found him!

10
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,980
He's in that barbershop we just passed.

11
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,840
What's he wearing?

12
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,850
What does he look like?

13
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,590
I didn't really notice

14
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,300
what he's wearing.

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
He's big and burly,

and wearing a silver earring.

17
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,920
Okay. Go home.

Go home.

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,250
Was it you who led the attack on Xie Wanghe,

Yes. What about it?

Apologize properly when you go in there.

of his life if it's serious.

What's with all this racket?

186

No idea.

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,680
You know him, right?

188
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm sorry, Xie.

189
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,890
I did wrong.

190
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,830
You beat him up like that,

191
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,270
and you think a simple "sorry" will do?

192
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,390
I won't beat him again.

193
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,880
If I break your bones,

194
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,930
and casually say "sorry" to you,

195
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
will you let me off?

196
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,580
This is a society governed by law.

197
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,770
You've beaten Wanghe to this state.

198
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,760
If we don't accept mediation,

199
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,860
you'll end up in jail, you know that?

200
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,370
Did you hear that?

201
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,540
I did.

202
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,670
From now on, when I see Xie,

203
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,350
I'll keep out of his way.

204
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,890
Get lost!

205
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm really sorry about this.

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,880
What's your problem?

207
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,790
Seriously.

208
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,590
Mr. Xie,

209
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,830
I'm really sorry.

210
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,910
If you need anything else later,
just let me know.

211
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,840
This kid came to apologize.

212
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,230
Maotian.

213
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,220
It's been a while.

214
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,910
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,950
My son...

216
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,510
Well, if you'll excuse me.

217
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay.

218
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,100
Alright, we're done.

219
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,830
All settled.

220
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,670
You can go back now.

221
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,810
Uncle Xie.

222
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,290
Get lost.

223
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,510
Bye, Auntie.

224
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,070
Bye, Uncle.

225
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,910
What are you having?

226
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,950
Home-style tofu.

227
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,670
Tofu.

228
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,590
You had dinner yet?

229
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,700
I've got bread.

230
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,590
Fenghua.

231
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,990
Make sure he takes his meds.

232
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,550
They're paying

233
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,570
all the medical bills.

234
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,510
And that guy,

235
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,950
Hai,

236
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,150
is now in custody.

237
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,820
Let's consider this as settled now.

238
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,700
If we don't accept mediation,

239
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,190
they will have to pay even more.

240
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,430
Otherwise we'll send that guy straight to jail.

241
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,800
That would create a feud.

242
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,710
Not ideal.

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,600
You're very generous indeed.

244
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,970
If this happened to me,

245
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,380
my mom would try to kill them.

246
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,540
We used to run ships on the same canal.

247
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,570
There's no need to make things so tense.

248
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,030
Oh, Wanghe,

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,250
don't let your mom know about this.

250
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,720
Just tell her

251
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,140
you got injured playing basketball.

252
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,320
I was thinking the same thing.

253
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,260
Why?

254
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,530
Your mom would try to kill them.

255
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,700
So would my mom.

256
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,950
As if things aren't bad enough already.

257
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,410
Give me the meds.

258
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,910
Go home.

259
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,470
Wait.

260
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,730
Can you manage on your own?

261
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,780
I'll be fine.

262
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,810
Remember to take your meds.

263
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,370
Almost forgot my bowl.

264
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,160
Uncle, I'm off!

265
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,300
Dad.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,620
Who is this Xie guy?

267
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,450
Why are you so afraid of him?

268
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,550
It's not fear.

269
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,750
It's respect.

270
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,350
Why?

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
When we were young and making a living on ships,

272
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,430
the upstream guys

273
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,450
ganged up on us.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,270
Boss Xie decided it was too much

275
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,500
and risked his life to seek justice for us.

276
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,680
He had three ribs broken.

277
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,920
I owe him.

278
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,040
Many people on Flower Street

279
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
owe him.

280
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,250
The once much revered "Water Dragon King"

281
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,870
is now

282
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,030
like a piece of driftwood fallen from a ship.

283
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,940
Drifting aimlessly all day long,

284
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,870
without any direction for the journey.

285
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,740
My dad

286
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,430
is dejected.

287
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,630
My mom is sticking it out alone for the family.

288
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
I wonder

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,370
when this state of life

290
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,390
is going to end for us.

291
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,670
Seven seven zero nine five.

292
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,610
This is the one.

293
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,030
Who are you

294
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,910
to get in the truck?

295
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,140
Chen has a fever.

296
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
I'm his buddy.

297
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,910
I'm covering

298
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,510
for him.

299
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,620
Why didn't he tell me about this?

300
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,610
You're Liang Haihong, right?

301
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,360
Yes.

302
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,040
Then there's no mistake.

303
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,200
So whose job

304
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,510
will this be?

305
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,390
It's mine.

306
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's go.

307
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,620
You have the licenses with you?

308
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,580
Yes.

309
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,640
That's him!

310
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,480
What's the big occasion...

311
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,150
Xie Tiancheng!

312
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,339
Xie Tiancheng!

313
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,260
Xie Tiancheng!

314
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,599
Mr. Xie.

315
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,630
Our savior!

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,790
It was my mother-in-law who
jumped into the canal yesterday.

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,230
Our kid was misbehaving

318
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,430
and had a little argument with her.

319
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,070
We never thought she would take it so hard

320
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,110
and jump into the canal.

321
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,630
It was nothing.

322
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,030
If it weren't for you,

323
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,670
our family would have been ruined.

324
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,190
We're indebted.

325
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,950
Please, please, don't.

326
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,630
We're indebted to you.

327
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,910
Please get up.

328
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,510
I was just passing by and lent a hand.

329
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,470
It's nothing, really.

330
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,270
Sir.

331
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,460
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

332
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,830
What are you doing?

333
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,760
What are you trying to do?

334
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,470
Come on.

335
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,820
It's not like you're still a virgin.

336
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,610
We're always out driving around.

337
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,360
I mean...

338
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,690
I wanted something exciting for us.

339
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,260
Get out.

340
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,600
I said get out.

341
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,940
You hear me? I'm asking you to get out!

342
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,930
Don't be unreasonable!

343
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,040
Don't you know

344
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,730
how old you are?

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,960
Stop being so pretentious!

346
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,190
Don't you dare!

347
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,070
Don't I dare?

348
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,590
What are you doing?

349
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,830
I'm going to have my way with you today!

350
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,620
Who do you think I am?

351
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
What are you trying to do?

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,910
I'm so going to have my way with you today!

353
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,060
You wish!

354
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,940
How dare you!

355
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,060
Who do you think I am?

356
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,340
I'll let you have your way.

357
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Get out, now.

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,010
Get out.

359
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,130
Open the door!

360
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,050
Open the door!

361
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,820
You're crazy!

362
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,650
How are you going to get to Changsha
by yourself?

363
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,510
Open the door. Come on, open it!

364
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,840
Open the door!

365
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,670
You...

366
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,430
Stop!

367
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,040
Stop now!

368
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,500
Stop!

369
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,850
Stop!

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,700
Stop!

371
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,680
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

372
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,630
Hey, son.

373
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,750
Come out and take a look.

374
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,770
Is it beautiful?

375
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,170
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

376
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,210
Honestly,

377
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,130
can you be any more insincere?

378
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,050
You're back.

379
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,750
You're back. Let me.

380
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,300
Mom. You're back.

381
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,140
What happened to your arm?

382
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,670
I'm fine.

383
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,390
How did it happen?

384
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,430
I fell while playing basketball.

385
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,390
Right, Dad?

386
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,990
I'm fine.

387
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,860
I'll go back to my homework.

388
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,900
You're not a kid anymore.

389
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,790
I'm fine, really.

390
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,230
Listen,

391
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,350
it takes a lot of time to recover
from a fracture.

392
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,270
Don't mess...

393
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,580
I know.

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,550
Alright.

395
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Come on.

396
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,420
[To Xie Tiancheng, for his bravery to risk his life to save others]

397
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,600
Well...

398
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,470
You went into the canal to save someone again?

399
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,320
I just happened to be there

400
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,990
and lent a hand.

401
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,740
Come have a drink with me.

402
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,200
It'll help get you refreshed.

403
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,410
Here.

404
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,790
You promised me before, didn't you?

405
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,640
Do you remember?

406
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,430
Do you remember what you promised me?

407
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,630
It's not winter now, right?

408
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,350
And it was by the canal.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,630
There were lots of people around.

410
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,070
Lots of people?

411
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,510
There was no danger.

412
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,270
Why didn't anyone else get in there?

413
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,180
Only you could do that?

414
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,160
"Those who can swim drown, and those
who're stubborn get beaten to death."

415
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,350
Who is that saying meant for?

416
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,280
It's exactly meant for people like you.

417
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,670
Okay, okay, okay.

418
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,150
You know that?

419
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,540
From now on, when I see

420
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,150
someone fall into the water, I won't save them.

421
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,950
I'll just let them drown. Okay now?

422
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,780
Okay.

423
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,830
Do whatever you want from now on.

424
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,830
I won't nag you again.

425
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,870
I mean...

426
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,590
This makes no sense.

427
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,030
It was wrong of me to save someone's life.

428
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,870
It wasn't wrong.

429
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,150
You're a great hero.

430
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm the one who's wrong.

431
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,030
If you have time to save other people,

432
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,190
have you ever thought about saving me?

433
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,110
Saving you?

434
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,890
From what?

435
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,100
You think I'm doing fine, don't you?

436
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,950
Are you not?

437
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,870
Every time I come back from a trip, I tell you

438
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,590
how much money I've made.

439
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,420
In your eyes, apart from being a bit tired,

440
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,910
I don't have any other problems, right?

441
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,720
Xie Tiancheng,

442
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,500
come on,

443
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,270
look at me.

444
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,490
Do I even look like a woman now?

445
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,910
Look!

446
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,850
I'm practically a man now!

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,910
Why am I

448
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,350
making myself look like this?

449
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,140
This is the only way for me

450
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,490
to be a bit safer out there.

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,860
Do you know that?

452
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,860
But I'm still a woman after all!

453
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,230
Now I'm out all day

454
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,390
on the highway from dawn to dusk.

455
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,020
Have you ever worried about me at all?

456
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
Have you worried at all?

457
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,470
During the day, when I'm out driving,

458
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:09,910
I...

459
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,630
I have to keep my eyes wide open like a cow,

460
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,710
not daring to be distracted for a moment.

461
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,670
But at night,

462
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,670
I'm torn between sleeping

463
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,830
and staying awake.

464
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,870
If I'm deep in sleep, someone might steal
my gas in the middle of the night.

465
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,670
If I sleep lightly, I might be
too tired the next day

466
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,480
to drive safely.

467
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,560
But even so,

468
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,200
when I'm half asleep,

469
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
there are still people who can

470
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,670
take advantage of me.

471
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,310
So tell me...

472
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,510
Hold on.

473
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,390
What did you just say?

474
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Someone took advantage of you?

475
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,270
Who was it?

476
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,050
Tell me now.

477
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,590
Who?

478
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,640
Mom.

479
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,210
Mom, are you okay?

480
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,950
You.

481
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,960
Get away.

482
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,930
You get away!

483
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,820
Go on!

484
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,720
What are you doing?

485
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,310
Go on!

486
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,510
Xie Tiancheng, that's enough!

487
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,790
If you're mad, hit me!

488
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,760
Hit me!

489
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,200
Don't hurt my son!

490
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,650
Hit me instead!

491
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,380
Are you even a man anymore?

492
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,750
Do you know how dangerous it is for a woman

493
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,730
to do long-distance truck runs?

494
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,530
Do you know how hard it is?

495
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,360
If you were serious with the supermarket,

496
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,600
I wouldn't say anything.

497
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,810
But look at you.

498
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,070
Occupied with eating,

499
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,830
drinking,

500
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,870
and playing!

501
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,100
One month into running the supermarket
and you're losing money every day!

502
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,770
I printed out reference materials
on the retail industry for you.

503
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,760
Did you ever read them?

504
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,840
You come home and drink

505
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,480
until well past midnight every day.

506
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,720
You think you're the only one who's suffering?

507
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,890
You're the only one in the world
who's suffering?

508
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,830
Mom is out there on the road,

509
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,340
enduring it all alone for this family.

510
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,650
If you can't take care of her,

511
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,680
I will!

512
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,600
I can give up the college entrance exam!

513
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll accompany Mom on her truck runs.

514
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,320
I'll protect my mom!

515
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,330
Son...

516
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,550
Haihong.

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,480
Breakfast is ready.

518
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,420
Haihong.

519
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,830
Haihong.

520
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,960
It's me!

521
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,780
It's me!

522
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,350
A nightmare, isn't it?

523
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,260
I've decided.

524
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,910
Starting tomorrow,

525
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,180
I'll accompany you on your truck runs.

526
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,440
For a woman,

527
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,270
this work is too hard.

528
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,890
I'm losing money

529
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,560
running that floating supermarket anyway.

530
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,990
And Maotian and his wife

531
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,610
are arguing about this all the time.

532
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,750
It'd be best if I

533
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,210
got out of this.

534
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,550
I've thought it all through.

535
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,490
At my age,

536
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,230
I can't really

537
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,220
accomplish much anymore.

538
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,680
Why are you crying?

539
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,810
What's wrong?

540
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,120
I don't want you to suffer.

541
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,630
How would I be suffering?

542
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,150
You're the one who's been suffering.

543
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,700
I'll try to get a driver's license too

544
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,910
sometime soon.

545
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,530
We'll bite the bullet for two more years.

546
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,510
We need to earn enough

547
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,870
for our son's tuition, right?

548
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,030
Right.

549
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,180
Let's eat.

550
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,080
I've made breakfast.

551
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,970
I'll go get the rice.

552
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,020
Wait for your mom.

553
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,800
From now on,

554
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,440
take good care of yourself.

555
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,320
Don't make us worry about you.

556
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,840
That would be a great help to us.

557
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,800
Understood?

558
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,290
Understood.

559
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,310
I promise not to upset the teachers.

560
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,040
Stay out of trouble and don't
go to internet cafes too often.

561
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,050
For meals,

562
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,740
go eat at Fenghua's place.

563
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,890
Don't upset her.

564
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,490
I'm not a three-year-old.

565
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,590
You can rest assured.

566
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,560
I actually wish you were three years old.

567
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,590
Dad.

568
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,810
What's this?

569
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,550
If you get bored,

570
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,030
have a listen for some amusement.

571
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,820
Well?

572
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,730
Are we ready?

573
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,050
Don't rush me.

574
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,500
We have everything now.

575
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,730
Son...

576
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,390
Let's go, come on.

577
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:18,870
Be good.

578
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,590
Come on, let's go.

579
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,760
Be good!

580
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,930
Be safe.

581
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,750
Drive slowly in the rain. Don't rush!

582
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,770
I know!

583
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,330
Take care of yourself!

584
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,470
What's wrong?

585
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,510
Nothing.

586
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,980
All good.

587
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,010
Just keep driving.

588
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,540
What's that?

589
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,130
Before we left, our son

590
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,770
gave me this tape.

591
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,370
He said I could listen to it on the road.

592
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,770
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

593
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,040
I forgot.

594
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,590
Okay, next up,

595
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,630
Xie Wanghe, a student from
Honghuai No. 7 High School,

596
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,360
has dedicated a song to his father.

597
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,750
This song is called

598
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,929
"Love You Dad."

599
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,600
Let's listen together.

600
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,230
♫Dad, you've got a big belly♫

601
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,239
♫A bad temper and no hair♫

602
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,440
♫You do not bend easily in life♫

603
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,310
♫You grow the hard way♫

604
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,960
Am I bald?

605
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,230
♫I'll be by your side♫

606
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,389
Isn't my hair still

607
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,070
right here?

608
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,949
♫Even though you're getting balder every day♫

609
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,690
♫I love you, Dad♫

610
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,750
It's just a song.

611
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,150
That's just one of the lines.

612
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,429
Don't take it so seriously.

613
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,730
♫I love you, Dad♫

614
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,950
♫I love you, Dad♫

615
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,190
♫Love your hair♫

616
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,830
♫I love you, Dad♫

617
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,870
♫Be sure to come home soon after work♫

618
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,760
Not bad.

619
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,240
Out of 17 calculation questions,

620
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,900
you only got two wrong.

621
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,470
Wanghe,

622
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,590
if you work a little harder,

623
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,190
you might really have a chance.

624
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,640
Remove the "might."

625
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,330
I definitely have a chance.

626
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,950
Do you think Siyi

627
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,170
is acting strange lately?

628
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,850
Remove the "Do you think."

629
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,940
Something's off with her.

630
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,640
Right?

631
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,620
Even though she's never been talkative,

632
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,820
she used to talk back when we teased her.

633
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,510
These past couple of days, she's been gloomy

634
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,480
and hasn't said a word.

635
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,440
I hope it's not because of her mom again.

636
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,680
Should I ask Fenghua to check on her?

637
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,860
That works.

638
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,350
Go get her.

639
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,090
I'll talk to her.

640
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,190
I, I, I...

641
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,510
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

642
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,690
Wanghe,

643
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,520
your math and English should be fine.

644
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,540
But your Chinese needs some work,

645
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,550
especially the writing part.

646
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,880
How do I work on that?

647
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,290
Maybe you could ask Xingchi's dad?

648
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,290
No way.

649
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,440
Uncle Shao can't speak without using archaisms.

650
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,260
It gives me a headache.

651
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,860
What?

652
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,430
Fenghua,

653
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,770
is something wrong with Siyi lately?

654
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,080
What's wrong?

655
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,550
She seems a little down.

656
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,470
She's not talking

657
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,500
or smiling.

658
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,410
Isn't she always like that?

659
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,440
Well,

660
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,460
I feel like it's been worse
these past couple of days.

661
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,470
Go ask her if everything's okay.

662
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,180
If there's anything wrong,
we can work it out together.

663
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,430
She shouldn't keep it to herself.

664
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,080
Go now.

665
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,710
Hurry up.

666
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,480
Mind your tone.

667
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,950
Go, go, go. Just go ask her.

668
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,160
Fenghua,

669
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,500
just go ask her.

670
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,540
Busy?

671
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,320
Not really.

672
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,040
Can we talk somewhere else?

673
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:30,910
Wanghe

674
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,950
asked me to ask you

675
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,330
if there's something going on at home.

676
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,310
Like what?

677
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,410
He thinks your mood has been off
these past couple of days.

678
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,870
He's a bit worried.

679
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,710
Oh.

680
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Just "oh"?

681
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,330
What do you want me to say?

682
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,270
Why don't you come up with an excuse for me?

683
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,160
Actually, I'd like to know as well...

684
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,380
what's on your mind.

685
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,020
What can be on my mind?

686
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,720
I just want to focus on the college entrance exam.

687
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,630
Nothing else matters.

688
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,300
What about after the exam?

689
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,910
We can leave that for later.

690
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,270
I don't have time to think about
anything else right now.

691
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,880
I see.

692
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,390
What exactly do you want to ask?

693
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,990
Just say it.

694
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,680
So... do you like him?

695
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,240
The word "like"...

696
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,290
is too much of a luxury for me.

697
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,890
At least for now...

698
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,840
I don't deserve it.

699
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,070
As for you,

700
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,440
whether you see me as a rival or not,

701
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,490
I don't care.

702
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,370
I've always seen you

703
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,260
as my closest and best sister.

704
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,520
Other than my grandma,

705
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,230
you're the person I'm closest to.

706
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,210
If one day

707
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,840
we really fall out,

708
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,630
I hope it won't be over something so trivial.

709
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,540
What else then?

710
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,080
You really want to fall out with me?

711
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,010
Fenghua,

712
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,160
I have only one piece of advice for you.

713
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,550
Work hard, and then harder.

714
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,030
Always look straight ahead.

715
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,820
Don't look up to people.

716
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,460
Being humble is a disease,

717
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,750
a terminal one.

718
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,060
You'll understand when you're older.

719
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,110
Why are their lights off?

720
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,800
Come on now. Let's figure it out tomorrow.

721
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,470
You've been brushing your teeth there
for half an hour now.

722
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,310
Your teeth must be smoking.

723
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,510
Fenghua,

724
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,960
I waited for you till midnight last night.

725
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,730
Let me get that for you.

726
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,250
How did your chat go?

727
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,980
Come on, tell me what you two talked about.

728
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,890
Don't bother me, I'm so tired.

729
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,750
Just tell me.

730
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,710
Fenghua.

731
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,160
Siyi!

732
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,100
Wait for me!

733
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,780
Siyi.

734
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,750
I haven't got my backpack yet.

735
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,560
Move aside.

736
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,060
What did you talk about?

737
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,070
Are you not going with me?
