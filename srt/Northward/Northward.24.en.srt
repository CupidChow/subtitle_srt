Hey.

6
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,289
Why did you stop me?

7
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,270
We're delivery riders,

00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,390
not an F1 racing team.

9
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,830
They're obviously picking on us.

10
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,950
Wanghe isn't here right now.

11
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,820
Whatever we say won't make a difference.

12
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,030
Let's just listen to whatever they have to say.

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,670
We'll figure something out when he gets back.

14
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,270
But we can't give them something to hold against us.

15
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,070
I said we'll think about it.

16

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,470
He got a few stitches.

It was all about you.

150
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,130
This proves

151
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,430
that Fenghua likes you

152
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,450
and it's not something that just happened recently.

153
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,420
If it wasn't for you,

154
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,370
she would have gone back home long ago.

155
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Don't you want to give it a try with her?

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,380
Give it a shot.

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,580

00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,409

167
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Indeed.

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,060
Have you made any new discoveries?

171
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,810
Here's the thing.

172
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,830
These past couple of days,

173
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,470
I just sent an email to the local

175
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,290
But they haven't replied to me yet.

176
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,730
So I looked it up on their foreign website.

177
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,580
During the Qing Dynasty,

178
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,110
there were indeed quite a few merchant ships

179
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,510
traveling between China and Italy.

180
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,610
Some documents were destroyed during World War II.

181
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
However, some customs records still remain.

182
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,440
I think we can look into it.

183
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,230
We still need to know who those families are.

184
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,140
Thank you.

185
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,110
Be careful.

186
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,500
Don't we already know this?

187
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,710
Little Polo, right?

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,850
Mr. Zhou

189
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,940
the name Polo is very common in Italy.

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,230
if you go to the police station to look for someone named Wang Jianguo.

192
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,630
If you only know the person is called Wang Jianguo

193
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,570
and nothing else,

194
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,770
it would be exhausting to search.

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,650
Yes.

196
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,720
I have an idea.

197
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,790
Don't a few families

198
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,590
in the notebook have surnames?

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
Let's start with the

200
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,510
county records and family genealogies along the canal.

201
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,160
We can look for some clues.

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,250
Right.

203
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,240
Let's start by investigating our own families first.

204
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,120
I remember

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,660
our family has a genealogy book.

206
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,290
Let me make a call to my hometown

207
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,120
and ask them to make a copy and send it over.

208
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,840
Just the genealogy book might not be enough.

209
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,770
Let's also check if there are

210
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,380
any related old items in our own homes.

211
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,760
Like the old silver coins in our family.

212
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,270
We also have a shoehorn at home.

213
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,270
Ask your mom to check her side of the family.

214
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,230
But because of her work,

215
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,540
she moves a lot.

216
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,410
They might not have been able to keep old items.

217
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,250
I remember Xingchi told me

218
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,220
that the Xie family has a small wine flask, right?

219
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,800
The Xia family has one with a foreign language too.

220
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
Xingchi knows about it too?

221
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,820
We talked about it in Beijing.

222
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,970
He was so excited when he heard about it.

223
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,250
Said he'd give us great credit for it.

224
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,330
Did he say when he'll be back?

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,900
No, he didn't mention that.

226
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,380
Well, whatever.

227
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,360
Let's see how long he can hang in there for.

228
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,080
The kids have grown up.

229
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Don't force them.

230
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,110
If parents are too strict,

231
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,850
it's easy to create resentment.

232
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,310
If he could be sensible

233
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,480
like Chen Rui or Haikuo,

234
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,640
I wouldn't worry.

235
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,190
As long as he doesn't cause trouble, I'm content.

236
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,110
Even if he stays at home all day,

237
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,270
doing nothing,

238
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,010
I'll be happy if he just lies around at home.

239
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,440
Shipping has resumed.

240
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,320
When can Boss Xie return to the river?

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Master Zhou!

242
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,070
Ms. Bian.

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,780
What brings you here?

244
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,600
Do you have a moment?

245
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,220
I'd like to take up a few minutes of your time.

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,710
I have time.

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,270
You taught me a few quick dishes last time, right?

248
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,030
I tried them at home, but they didn't turn out well.

249
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,500
Why not?

250
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,010
It just didn't taste good.

251
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,220
I was wondering if

252
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,750
there was something wrong with my method.

253
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,130
I bought some groceries again today.

254
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,000
Please teach me.

255
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,570
Could you demonstrate it for me once?

256
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,030
Listen, Ms. Bian,

257
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,400
you're underestimating the complexity of cooking.

258
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,850
It's not that simple.

259
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,130
You need to learn gradually,

260
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,570
practice little by little.

261
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,010
When I first started learning to cook, it was the same for me.

262
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,220
My food wasn't good either.

263
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
I had to learn too.

264
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,600
I even had to find a master to teach me, right?

265
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,850
Then let me become your apprentice.

266
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,170
I've been really interested in cooking lately.

267
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,390
Please teach me.

268
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,210
I'm quite easy to teach.

269
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,960
Ms. Bian,

270
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,020
I think we should

271
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,270
stop beating around the bush.

272
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,080
Becoming an apprentice is fine,

273
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,130
but

274
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,060
I don't think we're a good match.

275
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,430
Well...

276
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,640
You haven't even tried.

277
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,760
How do you know we're not suitable?

278
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,640
There are many things about my situation that you might

279
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,680
not be aware of.

280
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,050
I

281
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,270
still want to wait for her a bit longer.

282
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,770
I know.

283
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,760
But she's been gone for a long time.

284
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,720
Master Zhou,

285
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,600
I think

286
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,910
you have the right to pursue your own happiness.

287
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,670
Are you saying

288
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,650
you plan

289
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,320
to just keep waiting like this?

290
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,730
Until when?

291
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,490
Don't tell me

292
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,950
you're going to wait your whole life.

293
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,920
I don't know if I'll wait for my whole life or not,

294
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,290
but I know if I stop waiting

295
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,800
and she happens to come back,

296
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
I'll definitely regret it.

297
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Understand?

298
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,850
[Fenghua Express]

299
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,630
He, you're back.

300
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,630
Yes, I'm back.

301
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,270
Are you okay?

302
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,590
Is Auntie alright?

303
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm fine.

304
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,460
It's nothing. Just a slight fracture, no big deal.

305
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,280
It's okay.

306
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,830
Come, come.

307
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,890
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,020
Go on with your work.

309
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,830
Take it easy.

310
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,620
Let me do it.

311
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,820
Fenghua.

312
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,820
Did you get all the medical checkups done?

313
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes, we had X-rays taken.

314
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,660
It's nothing serious.

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,470
X-rays can only show bones.

316
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,710
You should've taken this opportunity

317
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,150
to have a thorough physical examination.

318
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,430
What's the point of a checkup?

319
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

320
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,920
You can't be too sure about that.

321
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,080
When I was young,

322
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,110
one of the neighbors in our courtyard,

323
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,190
an old lady,

324
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,130
she seemed fine normally,

325
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,140
but one day, she suddenly had a stroke.

326
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,440
That's not a very auspicious thing to say.

327
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,170
Let's not talk about it anymore.

328
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,590
Anyway, you need to be careful.

329
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,370
Find some time to get a full physical examination.

330
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,670
I got it, Fenghua.

331
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,050
Go back to your work.

332
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,380
Go.

333
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,990
Will you be alright?

334
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,950
Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

335
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,970
Hello, Fenghua.

336
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,750
Mom.

337
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,290
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

338
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,030
I miss Granny Ma.

339
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,460
Could you burn some joss paper for her later?

340
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,490
It's not Qingming Festival today.

341
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,670
I insist.

342
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,000
Alright, alright.

343
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,070
I will.

344
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,290
Don't use the paper money.

345
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,520
I want the gold ingots.

346
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,810
Take a basin.

347
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,080
Go burn it at Granny's doorstep.

348
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,510
Okay, okay, I got it.

349
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,580
I'm cooking.

350
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,480
Siyi.

351
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,910
Where are you?

352
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,140
I miss you so much.

353
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,570
What?

354
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,710
Work injury?

355
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:15,770
Yes.

356
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,670
This, this...

357
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,080
That doesn't seem appropriate.

358
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
What's inappropriate about it?

359
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,170
You were injured while working, after all.

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,620
Make the company pay a bit more.

361
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,240
Our finances

362
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,470
can ease up quite a bit.

363
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,110
I mean...

364
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,830
Ms. Xia has been good enough to us.

365
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,600
We shouldn't cause trouble for her at this time.

366
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,640
Fenghua has been good to us.

367
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,920
That's because our family is willing to work hard.

368
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,410
We're valuable to her.

369
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,830
Why isn't she good to others then?

370
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,710
Who isn't she good to?

371
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,700
She's wholeheartedly devoted to everyone.

372
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,010
What's the use of being so devoted?

373
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,680
Yuanbao went to Bee.

374
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,260
He's earning several thousand more a month.

557
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,630
it was Granny Ma who reconciled them.

558

Would firing you solve the problem?

Mr. Meng, I think

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,620
our strategy for dealing with Yuntu's subsidy war

586
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
still needs optimization.

They're hoping to force us to burn money.

00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,720
it's been almost three years since you graduated, right?

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,900
Since it's been almost three years,

658
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,080
you should understand what society is

659
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,610
and what a company is by now.

660
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,270
A company

661
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,760
is like a machine,

662
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,940
a precisely

663
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,750

that runs on schedule.

665
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,160
Therefore, it cannot tolerate

666
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,210
any part malfunctioning.

667
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,800
But the parts aren't malfunctioning now.

668

Not keeping up with the machine's operating intensity

669
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,030
doesn't count as malfunctioning?

00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,400

or replace it.

675
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,290
We can't wait until the machine stops

676
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,010
to reflect on it.

that you don't care about the company, and such.

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,030
It's okay.

746
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,410
You finish up and have dinner first.

747
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,250
I'll deliver them.

748
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,390
[Loading Area]

749
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,380
Wanghe?

750
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,090
Wanghe!

751
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,240
What's the meaning of this?

752
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,720
You came here and didn't say anything.

753
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,150
Are you playing undercover or something?

754
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,810
Still a fan of Chris Lee, huh?

755
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,220
You're quite loyal.

756
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,160
You think

757
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
everyone's like you?

758
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,240
What are you doing here?

759
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,150
Just passing by.

760
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,470
Passing by?

761
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,110
From where to where?

762
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,370
How could you possibly be passing by here?

763
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,370
Are you my boss?

764
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,080
Do I need to report to you where I go?

765
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,910
Fine, don't tell me.

766
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,070
They pissed me off.

767
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,440
Who?

768
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,630
Those two pissed me off.

769
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,650
You piss me off too.

770
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,389
How did I piss you off?

771
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,679
Don't falsely accuse me.

772
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,280
I rarely come here.

773
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,510
You won't even offer me a cup of tea.

774
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,840
You don't deserve it.

775
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,909
Did I offend you or something?

776
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,810
The employees I worked so hard to train

777
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:39,889
have all been taken away by you.

778
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,850
You think you're so great just because you're rich, huh?

779
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,719
It's not me.

780
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,070
It's market demand.

781
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,260
The volume of food delivery orders is much larger than that of express delivery.

782
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,730
It's normal for people to go where

783
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,989
the wage is higher.

784
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,320
I heard your company is going public.

785
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,390
Next year, if things go well.

786
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,970
Congratulations, then.

787
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,810
Going public is just the first step.

788
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,890
The real challenge comes after that.

789
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,160
We have to fight to the bitter end.

790
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,150
We need to dominate this market,

791
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,560
and become the sole leader,

792
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,800
for us to catch a breath.

793
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,940
When you reach that point,

794
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,340
you should be very rich, right?

795
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,370
Money doesn't matter.

796
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,590
It just needs to be enough to spend.

797
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,790
What I want is industry status.

798
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,970
Many years from now,

799
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,600
I want to look back to today

800
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,070
and find that I, Xie Wanghe,

801
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,390
have made a contribution to this world.

802
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,010
What?

803
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,560
You don't believe me?

804
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,090
I do believe you.

805
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,890
You've always dreamed of the future.

806
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,590
I had doubts before,

807
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,450
but mostly, I wish you well.

808
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,070
I think if you really made it big,

809
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,240
you could help us out.

810
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,610
Even if there were no real benefits,

811
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,010
we could at least brag about it.

812
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,760
You know Xie Wanghe, right?

813
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,300
He's my childhood friend.

814
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,800
We lived across from each other.

815
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,940
We could even hear each other sleep talking at night.

816
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,890
Alright, I'll work hard then.

817
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,930
In the future, if you get drunk at a dinner party,

818
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,420
just video call me.

819
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,740
I'll definitely answer.

820
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,630
I'll greet each of them.

821
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,820
You'll definitely look impressive.

822
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,390
That day will never come.

823
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,880
Why?

824
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,550
I need to stay away from a company that doesn't treat

825
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,690
its employees as human beings.

826
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,130
Or else I'll have bad karma.

827
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,710
Did they call you?

828
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't need them to tell me.

829
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,560
Anyone can see

830
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,990
Bee's performance

831
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,520
this past half year.

832
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,160
Let me say something harsh.

833
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,820
Even Emperor Qin building the Great Wall wasn't as ruthless as you.

834
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,750
Capital has its demands.

835
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,520
Once we've raised funds, we must expand rapidly.

836
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,790
We need to seize the market.

837
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,400
The market is only so big.

838
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,670
If we don't grab it,

839
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,140
others will survive instead.

840
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,070
I don't want to become

841
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,350
a stepping stone for others' success.

842
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,590
You won't be.

843
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,150
You already have the potential for success.

844
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,910
Cold-bloodedness.

845
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,310
You say that too?

846
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,750
What do you all mean?

847
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,980
Don't be angry.

848
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,900
I'm not insulting you.

849
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,410
I'm praising you.

850
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,880
All you've ever thought about since childhood was success.

851
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,230
I guess you got what you wanted.

852
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,410
Then what do you think I should do?

853
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,220
Increase the commission?

854
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,080
Reduce pressure?

855
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,570
Should I be a philanthropist

856
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,140
and have everyone wait to die together?

857
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,920
I don't care about others,

858
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,910
but don't be too harsh

859
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,650
on my old employees.

860
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,670
Don't just drink.

861
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
Eat something.

862
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
He's under a lot of pressure too.

863
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,150
Who isn't under pressure?

864
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,270
When I resigned,

865
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,750
Xiaohui disagreed with it from the bottom of her heart.

866
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,170
Why did she disagree?

867
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,810
For startup companies,

868
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,870
only one or two

869
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,550
in the same category can survive in the end.

870
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,920
Bee just raised its Series C funding,

871
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,500
but the money is almost burned through.

872
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,270
If it's burned through, just raise Series D then.

873
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,450
You think raising funds is that easy?

874
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,350
Each round dilutes the shares.

875
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,980
When shares are diluted to a certain extent,

876
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,130
and you can't go public,

877
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,610
you can only sell to a big company.

878
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,420
By then, the management will all be replaced.

879
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,750
Wanghe has equity.

880
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,510
Even if Bee is acquired, he won't lose out.

881
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,010
I know you want to talk about us two.

882
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,160
That's not what I meant.

883
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,570
You had a proper career before,

884
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,770
so you feel like you've lost out.

885
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,970
I had nothing,

886
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,430
so even if we fail,

887
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,980
I don't feel like I've lost anything.

888
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,960
We have different mindsets.

889
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,360
I just feel that...

890
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,930
Wanghe has changed.

891
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,070
That's normal.

892
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,790
Before, we were brothers.

893
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,970
Now, he's the boss.

894
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,890
We look at issues from different angles.

895
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,400
So what if he's the boss?

896
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,360
Does being a boss mean he can be unreasonable?

897
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,750
Can he just run his mouth without any consideration?

898
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,200
If this was back in the day,

899
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,350
someone like Wanghe would…

900
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
Enough.

901
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,760
Has your grandpa's spirit possessed you?

902
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,140
I really want to go to his house right now.

903
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,240
What for?

904
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,920
I...

905
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,190
I... I want to stuff chewed gum

906
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,610
into his keyhole.

907
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,840
I…

908
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,630
I'll go too.

909
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,740
I'll put cockroaches

910
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,400
in his bed sheet and quilt cover,

911
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,840
and pull out the fuse.

912
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,490
Eat something.

913
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,140
Boss!

914
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,760
Give me a pig brain.

915
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,570
Sure thing!

916
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,940
Nourish your brain and appease Xiaohui.

917
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,720
Open the door.

918
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,270
Who is it?

919
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,810
It's me, your dear old dad.

920
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,940
My dear old dad?

921
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,250
We don't have anyone like that here.

922
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Cut the crap and open the door.

923
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,470
I'm holding in my pee.

924
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,270
Apologize.

925
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,950
What should I apologize for?

926
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,470
"If you want to do it, do it. If not, get lost."

927
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,690
Who said that?

928
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,850
I wasn't talking about you guys.

929
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,730
That won't do.

930
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,600
Haikuo and I are both law-abiding citizens.

931
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,950
We don't associate with reactionary bullies,

932
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,390
landlords, or capitalists.

933
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,540
Are you going to open it or not?

934
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,260
What can you do if I don't?

935
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,090
What are you doing?

936
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,670
Stop it.

937
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,670
Are you crazy?

938
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,210
My bladder was about to burst.

939
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,570
You really drank the Latour?

940
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,490
What's Latour?

941
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,830
Do you know?

942
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,010
I don't know.

943
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,140
Never heard of it.

944
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,610
Not a drop left for me.

945
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,230
You're sitting on my leg.
