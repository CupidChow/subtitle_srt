[NORTHWARD]

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,009
[Episode 18]

3
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,380
There's some more here.

4
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,180
Here.

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,600
I forgot I left it in my pocket.

6
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,200
Boss, Haihong.

7
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,870
You haven't eaten?

8
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,829
This is not much.

9
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,910
You can use it first.

10
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,990
No, no.

11
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,829
You need it yourself too.

12
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,270
No.

13
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,350
No, take it.

14
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,190
Boss.

15
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,030
This matter

16
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,420
happened because of this 10,000 yuan.

17
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,890
As her mother, I made a mistake.

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
I didn't stop her

19
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,300
from doing such a stupid thing,

20
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,010
implicating Wanghe.

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,040
Wanghe did it for Fenghua.

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,390
So take it.

23
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,150
Saving the child is more important.

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,310
As you know,

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,430
our money is on the goods.

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,960
Yes.

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes, we...

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,230
Gathering money?

29
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,730
Here.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,430
What are you doing?

31
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,829
You always meddle when something happens.

32
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,150
Your money didn't fall from the sky.

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,910
No, it's an emergency.

34
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,390
Why are you talking so much?

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,550
Take it. I'm leaving.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,860
Don't worry, Haihong.

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,550
Sorry.

38
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,180
We're really sorry.

39
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,030
Don't worry.

40
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,750
Yanzi.

41
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,990
Let's stop at that.

42
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,350
I won't stand on ceremony.

43
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,190
I'll take

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,310
this money.

45
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,310
Also,

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,910
I remember

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,430
everyone's kindness.

48
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,430
We'll pay you back later.

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,430
No need.

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,110
We should pay for it.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,870
Don't worry.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,790
Eat first. Your health is more important.

53
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
I'm leaving.

54
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,430
Hurry up and eat.

55
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,310
Give it a count.

56
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,350
How much?

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,230
Siyi.

58
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,950
Grandma.

59
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,790
This is 2,000 yuan.

60
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,750
It's not much.

61
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,150
It's just to show our sincerity.

62
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,230
Take it to Ms. Liang.

63
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,829
Go.

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,750
I can't take this.

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,270
You owe too much. You don't want to live anymore?

66
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,110
We are lending this to you. Not like you're not returning this.

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,910
Right?

68
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,110
We're live in the same courtyard, I'm not afraid of you running away.

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,390
Pay me back when you have money.

70
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,590
Don't pay it back if you don't.

71
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,950
Thank Mr. Shao for me.

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,550
Alright, go back.

73
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,340
Siyi, you're here.

74
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,020
Aunt Liang.

75
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,410
Grandma asked me to bring 2,000 yuan here.

76
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,230
Take it back.

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,880
Take it back.

78
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,149
Grandma said it's our sincerity.

79
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,640
We got it.

80
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,670
But bring the money back.

81
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,150
Take it.

82
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,990
Bring it back.

83
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,990
Tell Grandma

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,070
when I leave to drive the trucks,

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,950
allow Wanghe to have meals at your place.

86
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,510
We'd appreciate that.

87
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,310
Yes.

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Take it.

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,000
Bring it back.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,190
Siyi, they've got us.

91
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,310
Go back and tell Grandma.

92
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,310
We're here. Don't worry.

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,480
Go back in.

94
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,530
Be good.

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,830
Reassure your grandma.

96
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,710
They've got us, you don't have to do anything.

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,270
Granny...

98
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,420
Let's go back.

99
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,970
That's all?

100
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,600
It's about 100,000 yuan. There's a long way to go.

101
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,740
Then let's

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,980
borrow more.

103
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,590
Anyway,

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,720
I'll go drive with you.

105
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,620
Let's earn it slowly.

106
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,030
We can pay them back no matter what.

107
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,100
I've borrowed everything I could.

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,140
Who else can I look for?

109
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,380
It's not enough.

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,170
Can you give me another 20,000 yuan?

111
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,830
I'm afraid you won't be able to pay back more than that.

112
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,340
By driving the truck,

113
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,880
I earn about 100,000

114
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,350
I can make quite a lot of money.

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,150
I'll pay you back the principal and interest together when the time comes.

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,210
Not a penny less!

117
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,420
It would be better if you had some collateral.

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not that I don't trust you,

119
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,930
but I need to explain it to my family.

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
How about this?

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,930
At home,

122
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,950
I have two pieces of gold jewelry.

123
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,810
You can have them as collateral. How's that?

124
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,300
Fly!

125
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,510
Fly!

126
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,980
Fly!

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,940
Fly!

128
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,930
The big plane is taking off!

129
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,950
Grandma,

130
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,030
I'll take you to fly over the Pacific Ocean.

131
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,870
All right, let's fly over the Pacific Ocean.

132
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,860
Play by yourself.

133
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,790
I'm tired. I'll take a rest.

134
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,230
Okay.

135
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,030
Go play.

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm going to hit you!

137
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,950
Fly!

138
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,720
Fly!

139
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,170
Fly!

140
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,670
Fly!

141
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,280
Take my

142
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,310
punch!

143
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,830
Take my kick!

144
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,710
Oh no!

145
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,450
My hand has fallen off.

146
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,290
Lao'er even went to ask Fenghua's aunt.

147
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,590
It's still not enough.

148
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,140
We still have a lot to go despite adding it all together.

149
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,480
They said

150
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,070
they didn't have much money left.

151
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,470
They said they're going to go borrow money.

152
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,909
Who knows how much they can borrow?

153
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,830
Don't borrow money from loan sharks.

154
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,070
With the interest,

155
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,180
you could go bankrupt.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,520
Haihong must have gone to borrow money.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
She can do anything

158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,380
for Wanghe.

159
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,210
This morning,

160
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,000
I saw her leave Flower Street.

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,190
She was in a hurry.

162
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,909
What should we do?

163
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,830
I saw those who borrowed from loan sharks

164
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,530
would have their houses

165
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,320
taken away in the end.

166
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,140
Those people

167
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,020
have no conscience, they smash and burn everything.

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,560
They can do anything.

169
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,550
Exactly.

170
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,390
One can never repay their high-interest loans.

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,850
Even when Wanghe's released from jail,

172
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,000
he'd still have to shoulder this debt.

173
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,110
Then this child

174
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,740
will be doomed.

175
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,260
Wanghe only took on this matter for Fenghua's sake.

176
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
Look at the mess we're in now.

177
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,150
Watch this.

178
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,970
How dare you hit me!

179
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,280
Watch me turn into a fighter jet too!

180
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,309
Siwei, Grandma is resting.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,390
I'll take you to Fenghua's house for some treats.

182
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,110
Okay.

183
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,010
To Fenghua's house!

184
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,390
Can you keep an eye on him for me?

185
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,600
I need to go out and take care of something.

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,310
Make sure you do your homework properly.

187
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,960
What are you going to do?

188
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,150
Grandma is sick.

189
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,030
She can't cook.

190
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,460
You're in charge of his dinner.

191
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,600
Sister.

192
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,810
Siyi.

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,950
What's wrong?

194
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,060
Is your offer to lend me money still valid?

195
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,580
Of course, it still stands.

196
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,830
I have over 30,000 in my account.

197
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,510
How much do you need?

198
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,090
20,000.

199
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
I'll pay you back with bank interest later.

200
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,270
No need.

201
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,780
No, I've already–

202
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,770
Let's do it your way, okay?

203
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,790
All right, I'll go get my card.

204
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,570
Wait for me.

205
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,520
Sis.

206
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,320
Sis?

207
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
Fenghua!

208
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,770
I want to go see a movie.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,120
"Iron Man."

210
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,220
It's interesting.

211
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,230
Everyone in my class has seen it.

212
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,910
I'm the only one who hasn't.

213
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,100
Have you finished your homework?

214
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,610
Yes, I have.

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,550
Let's go then.

216
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm going to see "Iron Man"!

217
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,780
Hurry up!

218
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,020
Slow down, slow down.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,190
Sister, the Iron Man in there...

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,500
Ms. Liang.

221
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,830
Please take this money.

222
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,090
Get Wanghe out quickly.

223
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
We can't let this affect his college entrance exam.

224
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,200
Where did you get so much money?

225
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,440
I didn't steal nor rob,

226
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:53,990
don't worry.

227
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,870
It's within my personal means.

228
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,730
No.

229
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,350
You must explain clearly where this money came from.

230
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,150
Ms. Liang,

231
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,480
Wanghe's grades have improved rapidly recently.

232
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,650
If nothing goes wrong,

233
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,920
he will definitely get into college.

234
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,990
At this time,

235
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,910
freedom is the most important thing for him.

236
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,000
You don't need to see me out, Ms. Liang.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,910
I'll be going now.

238
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,100
Get some rest early.

239
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,730
Grandma.

240
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,550
I'm back.

241
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,050
Grandma, have you had dinner yet?

242
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,350
Grandma?

243
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,470
Grandma!

244
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,940
Granny.

245
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,040
[Police]

246
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,960
Thank you.

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:32,890
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

248
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,350
Uncle.

249
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,530
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,720
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

251
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,010
You need to use your brain when you do things in the future.

252
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,140
[If you admit your mistake, you can turn over a new leaf.]

253
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,470
Go on.

254
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,510
They're waiting for you at home.

255
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,770
Don't worry about Fenghua.

256
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,030
We've watched him

257
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,900
delete all the photos in his records,

258
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,180
and punished him according to the law.

259
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,230
[Police]

260
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,800
Wanghe.

261
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,990
Have a good talk with your father when you get home.

262
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,680
Don't make him angry.

263
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,370
Thank you, Uncle.

264
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,330
Where's your uncle?

265
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,660
He said he had something to do and left early.

266
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,430
Dad.

267
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Mom.

268
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,290
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,610
I've caused trouble for the family again.

270
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,670
Sit down and eat.

271
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Sit down, sit down.

272
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,970
Come on.

273
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,230
Thank you, Dad.

274
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm not used to the food inside.

275
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,110
You should eat too, Mom and Dad.

276
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,970
In the future,

277
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,820
before you do anything,

278
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,630
you need to use your head.

279
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,660
You can't be so impulsive anymore.

280
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,590
For your college entrance exam,

281
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,370
we had to pay that Pang Dahai

282
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,500
100,000 yuan in compensation.

283
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
100,000?

284
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,150
On what grounds?

285
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,110
Do you know what that bastard did?

286
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,110
If we didn't pay the 100,000,

287
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,550
they would refuse mediation,

288
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,360
and you would...

289
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,710
You would be kept in there.

290
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,130
It would affect your college entrance exam.

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,570
So what?

292
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,390
Let them keep me locked up!

293
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,220
I'll stay in jail!

294
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,990
What are they going to do, execute me?

295
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
I'd rather die

296
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,220
than bow down to these thugs and scoundrels!

297
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,220
Can you be mature?

298
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,150
Isn't that what you taught me, Dad?

299
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,680
You said a person should have a sense of responsibility.

300
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,870
Yes, I was impulsive this time,

301
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,640
but my intentions were good.

302
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,660
If you back down from these thugs,

303
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,600
they'll just take advantage of it!

304
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,670
Enough!

305
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,030
You really know where to go.

306
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,140
I'm not hungry.

307
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,190
At the end of the day,

308
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,830
it's really my fault.

309
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,330
You

310
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,990
are quite like me when I was young.

311
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,390
I did a lot of stupid things back then,

312
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,980
and was even proud of it.

313
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,770
Standing up for justice, huh?

314
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,089
Well,

315
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,829
you did that

316
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,430
for your friend too.

317
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,180
To prevent them from being wronged,

318
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,990
you resorted to violence

319
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,390
without considering the consequences.

320
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,900
This is a problem that needs to be solved.

321
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,470
Dad,

322
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,460
I was impulsive this time,

323
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,350
but I don't think I was wrong.

324
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,530
That bastard bullied Fenghua

325
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,900
and uploaded those photos.

326
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,660
If I were a coward,

327
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,490
who knows what might happen in the future?

328
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,830
So I absolutely refuse to bow down to such people.

329
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,400
I was protecting my family and friends.

330
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,310
Was I wrong?

331
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,890
To compensate them that 100,000,

332
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,700
the neighbors

333
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,270
chipped in.

334
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,830
We also

335
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
borrowed

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
some money

337
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,270
but it still wasn't enough.

338
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,510
After Siyi learned about this,

339
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,800
she ran out

340
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,030
to borrow money from her classmate.

341
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,960
By the time she came back,

342
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,450
Granny Ma had already passed away.

343
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,250
It was cerebral hemorrhage.

344
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,870
Because there was no one around,

345
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,790
she didn't get timely rescue.

346
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,220
I feel...

347
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780
Grow up quickly.

348
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,090
Your mother and I are old.

349
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,820
We can't keep up with your antics anymore.

350
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,300
Eat up.

351
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,060
I'm not hungry.

352
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,650
You haven't eaten for a whole day.

353
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,440
Hurry up.

354
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,550
I said I'm not hungry.

355
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,330
Grandma.

356
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,710
I'm back.

357
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,440
The doctor said

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
Grandma passed away in her sleep.

359
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,380
She left peacefully.

360
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,960
Last night,

361
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,590
I dreamed about Grandma.

362
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,300
She told me

363
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,340
she's been very tired lately

364
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,330
and wanted to take a break.

365
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,980
She asked me not to blame her.

366
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,350
I knew it was a dream,

367
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,350
so I told her in the dream

368
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,330
not to leave.

369
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,490
But she left anyway.

370
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,960
I just went out for a moment,

371
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,300
how could I lose my grandma just like that?

372
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,490
Dad...

373
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,630
Mom...

374
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,670
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,690
I was wrong.

376
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,810
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

377
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,210
This matter,

378
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,950
at the very bottom of it,

379
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,150
is your responsibility.

380
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,630
From now on,

381
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,310
be better to Siyi.

382
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,210
Do your best in this lifetime

383
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,260
to spare her from suffering.

384
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,520
This is what you owe Granny Ma.

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,050
Don't cry anymore.

386
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,950
Go to bed early.

387
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,390
You have school early tomorrow morning.

388
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,820
I feel terrible inside.

389
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,800
We all do.

390
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,630
All these years, Granny Ma

391
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,580
has been so good to us.

392
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,580
She left so suddenly.

393
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,050
We didn't even have a chance to be good to her.

394
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,470
That day...

395
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,950
Siyi asked me to watch her place...

396
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,650
I didn't take it seriously...

397
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,050
I even took Siwei to watch a movie.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,230
If we had been at home,

399
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,030
Granny Ma wouldn't have passed away...

400
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,990
Don't think like that.

401
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,880
Cerebral hemorrhage is very dangerous to begin with.

402
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,800
Even if we had taken her to the hospital,

403
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,640
we might not have been able to save her.

404
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,430
At least there would have been a glimmer of hope.

405
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,600
It's all my fault.

406
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,680
I shouldn't have gone out.

407
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,150
Don't cry.

408
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,460
Sister.

409
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm hungry.

410
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,430
There are instant noodles. Make it yourself.

411
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,490
I don't want instant noodles.

412
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,830
They give me a stomachache.

413
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,330
Go buy something to eat yourself.

414
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,390
Are you eating?

415
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,020
I'm not hungry.

416
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,990
But you haven't eaten for two days.

417
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,620
Go and come back quickly.

418
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,040
Sis,

419
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,590
please go and eat something with me.

420
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,670
Fine.

421
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,510
I'll go eat by myself then.

422
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,500
Hello, Grandpa.

423
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,420
Go to the shop for a bowl of eel noodles later.

424
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,770
You can't keep starving yourself.

425
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,400
No need.

426
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,960
I'm not hungry yet.

427
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,310
Thank you, Grandpa Zhou.

428
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,270
If you get hungry,

429
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,080
your grandma will come to our dreams and scold us.

430
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,470
She wouldn't do that.

431
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,160
Who says she wouldn't?

432
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,430
Don't you remember?

433
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,030
That year,

434
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,990
when you and Wanghe went down to the river

435
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,370
to learn how to swim

436
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,020
and choked on some water,

437
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,850
someone mimicked it to your grandma

438
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,120
and it made her so mad.

439
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,450
She went door to door scolding everyone, young and old.

440
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,670
None of us had a peaceful meal that day.

441
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,030
I remember Wanghe and Haikuo both got hit.

442
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,800
Xiaopang ran away from home after just two hits.

443
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,790
That incident scared me too.

444
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,670
You were your grandma's soft spot.

445
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,740
Except for her,

446
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,660
no one could touch you.

447
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,980
Last month,

448
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,880
on a night,

449
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,350
your grandma suddenly came to my house.

450
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,780
Mr. Zhou,

451
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,860
I

452
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,970
have had someone write a power of attorney. Have a look.

453
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,590
In case I...

454
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,220
I'll have to trouble you...

455
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,270
to help me sell that house.

456
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,830
You can keep the money,

457
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,950
and you can give it to Siyi monthly.

458
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,770
We must ensure Siyi finishes university, no matter what.

459
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,440
If...

460
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,340
If this money isn't enough,

461
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
then

462
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,830
I'll have to trouble everyone.

463
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,140
I'm sorry to everyone.

464
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,980
I...

465
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,240
I can only repay this in my next life.

466
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,250
I'm counting on you.

467
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,990
We'll talk about whether we have to sell the house later.

468
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,740
This time, I represent

469
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,370
the neighbors from this courtyard

470
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,370
to tell you that you

471
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,900
don't need to worry about money.

472
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,780
Even if you study for a doctorate,

473
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,630
we'll support you.

474
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,700
I know

475
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
if this happened to another family,

476
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,840
and if another child was left alone,

477
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,820
as long as Granny Ma was around,

478
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,030
even if she had scrimp and save,

479
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,460
she wouldn't stand by and watch.

480
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
We all know

481
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,210
you're independent and strong-willed,

482
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,330
but

483
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,930
you should accept everyone's kindness

484
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,940
on behalf of

485
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,750
your grandma.

486
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,340
From this moment on,

487
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,240
you,

488
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,910
Ma Siyi,

489
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,320
are the child

490
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,870
of all of us.

491
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,590
Grandpa Zhou...

492
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,260
Look, look.

493
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,230
What are you doing?

494
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,750
Shoo.

495
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,210
Don't cause trouble here.

496
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,140
Go over there.

497
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,710
You messed it up.

498
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,530
You're back?

499
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,020
How did it go?

500
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,830
How was it?

501
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,770
Mr. Zhou.

502
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,100
I've talked to Siyi.

503
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,190
Her emotions were relatively stable.

504
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,600
So,

505
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,780
later,

506
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,840
everyone should pay more attention.

507
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,230
Communicate with her regularly.

508
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,670
It's the last semester.

509
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,190
It's crucial.

510
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,260
We must not let it affect her grades.

511
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,020
Siyi is a good child.

512
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,640
She has always been sensible.

513
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,330
If it were just her alone,

514
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,710
there's no need to worry.

515
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,770
But she has

516
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,270
a younger brother.

517
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,810
Someone needs to pick him up from school.

518
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,460
She has to cook when they get home.

519
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,030
And help with his homework.

520
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,970
I feel for this child just thinking about it.

521
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,620
Siyi is still just a teenager herself.

522
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,480
It's not easy for her to take care of herself,

523
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,440
let alone look after her brother,

524
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,510
and preparing for the college entrance exam.

525
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,850
It's definitely too much.

526
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,440
Actually, if you ask me,

527
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,250
we should all try to persuade Siyi's mother

528
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,430
to take Ge Siwei back with her first.

529
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,540
At least for this semester.

530
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,540
We can't let this affect Siyi's studies.

531
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,960
What if she refuses?

532
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,950
That mother of hers

533
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,910
is not a good person.

534
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,070
How can you talk like that?

535
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,590
No matter what,

536
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,710
they're still her own children.

537
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,080
When Granny was around,

538
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,710
she left him here.

539
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,750
Now that she's gone,

540
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,130
she still won't take care of her own son?

541
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,580
You never know.

542
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,110
Given the old lady's situation before,

543
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,630
she still had the nerve to come asking for money.

544
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,410
That's right, she was extorting the old lady.

545
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,560
As if the old lady owed her something.

546
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,510
Exactly.

547
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,180
Well then,

548
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,130
let's see her attitude first.

549
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,020
If she's friendly,

550
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,760
we'll be polite to her.

551
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,950
Right?

552
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,740
Let's try not to fall out with her.

553
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,740
Yes, yes.

554
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,560
If she's unreasonable,

555
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,240
we'll pressure her together.

556
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,030
We won't let her bully the children.

557
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

558
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,380
Exactly.

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,550
Siyi can't keep pushing herself like this.

560
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,290
If she continues like this, her health will collapse.

561
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,600
I've tried to persuade her, but she won't listen.

562
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,710
My mom told her to go back to sleep,

563
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,900
but she got up again after lying down for just a moment.

564
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,610
She stays up all night when she does that.

565
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,480
If this continues,
