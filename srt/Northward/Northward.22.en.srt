00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,220
Traffic Radio.

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,460
Sorry, there was a bit of a traffic jam.

6
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,020
Where are the employees?

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,470
We didn't dare to be idle even though you hadn't arrived.

8
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,420
You told us yourself that

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
even without subsidies,

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,430
you could increase the market share

11
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,770
to 50%.

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,810
We'll definitely fully cooperate

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,350
with such a good plan.

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,710
Therefore, before you arrived,

15
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,590
I'd already notified the chiefs of each station

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,750
and the managers of each business line

17
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,630
to come down there

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,850

If you have any thoughts,

20
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,660
you can tell us in advance.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,750
We can discuss it internally first.

22
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,010
There's no need for discussion.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,990
Before coming here,

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,190
we've already used big data

25
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,310
to do a convergence.

26
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,670
Starting tomorrow, we'll adjust the delivery time.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,140
Each order's delivery time will be shortened by eight minutes.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
After the adjustment,

29
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,720
the commission will increase.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,530
I've calculated it.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,490
The average commission per order can reach six yuan.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,660
That's wishful thinking.

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,200
The profit of the food delivery business

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,520
is already very low,

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,390
yet he wants to increase the commission for delivery riders.

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,520
So I want to ask,

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,250
what money will the company be making?

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,470
I've already discussed this with

39
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,910
the technical department.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,110
The delivery time will be adjusted from 50 minutes

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,590
to 42 minutes.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,590
That's two minutes shorter than Yuntu's.

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,940
If everything goes as planned,

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,540
the order volume will increase significantly.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,750
Even if we increase the commission for delivery riders,

46
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,070
the profit won't decrease.

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,829
Don't blame me for not telling you then.

48
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,560
The original 50-minute delivery time

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,990
was already wearing the riders out.

50
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,030
Now you want to compress it to 42 minutes.

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,550
If you really dare to do this,

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,020
it will cost lives.

53

the commission was 5.9 yuan.

If you take 30 to 40 orders a day,

78
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,930
you'll make a bit over 200 yuan per day.

You know Mr. Shao from our neighborhood, right?

What did I tell you?

196
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,350
Fenghua is

developing her own career in Beijing now.

198
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,570
How could she have time for dating?

women's independence and autonomy.

204
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,580

Why is this holding her back?

211
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,110
Not getting married at this age is what's holding her back.

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,930
have all been bottling it up.

372
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,600
Aren't you afraid it'll make you sick?

373
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,740
You're right.

374
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,130
Are you still mad at me?

375
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,880
No, I'm not.

376
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,220
Then why aren't you talking?

377
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm tired.

378
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,220
If you're tired, take a rest.

379
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,170
The competition among express delivery stations isn't as fierce now as before.

380
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,720
As if you've worked in express delivery before.

381
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,610
Every industry has its peak period.

382
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,300
The express delivery industry has passed its peak.

383
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,640
Staying stable is enough.

384
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,350
We're different.

385
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,760
We still need to grit our teeth and push forward.

386
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,520
In the end,

387
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,900
only a few companies will survive.

388
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,200
It's okay.

389
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,870
If your company fails,

390
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,540
I'll take you in.

391
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,660
Bah! God forbid.

392
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,820
I'm telling you, this time,

393
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,230
I'm putting everything on the line.

394
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,150
It's do or die.

395
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,030
In our senior year,

396
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,750
when you and Haikuo were doing ground promotion,

397
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,829
you said the same thing.

398
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,410
You lost everything,

399
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,750
but I didn't see you "die" then.

400
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,819
Although we lost money that time,

401
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,940
the boss saw my potential.

402
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,380
That's why I am where I am today.

403
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,069
So essentially, I didn't lose.

404
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,450
But Haikuo did lose.

405
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,710
He spent all that time and put in all that effort with you,

406
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,970
and got nothing out of it.

407
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,840
He almost missed his graduation defense.

408
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,980
Did he tell you that?

409
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,940
He's not the type to complain behind others' backs.

410
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,750
Even though he didn't say anything,

411
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,050
you should be aware of it.

412
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,020
When you make it big in the future,

413
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,320
these are all favors

414
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,600
you'll need to repay gradually.

415
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,020
Of course.

416
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,050

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,820
I need to repay you as well.

419
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,190
You don't owe me anything.

420
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,280
There's no need to repay any favors.

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
I do owe you.

422
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,480
A lot.

423
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,560
For example?

424
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,090
Think about it carefully.

425
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,470
If you can't remember,

426
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,540
then let's pretend I don't owe you anything.

427
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,620
You're a big shot now.

428
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,560
It's good to have drive when starting a business,

429
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,230
but everything needs moderation.

430
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,420
You need to leave yourself a way out.

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,970
I just arrived.

I brought you some scallops.

I put them in the kitchen. Go cook them yourself.

Just those annoying things at the company.

Well, he's got to work.

At the beginning,

461
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,140
the salary won't be too high,

462
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,280
but there will be bonuses if you do well.

463
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,110
You'll definitely have to work harder,

464

Bro, there's a lot to do.

Right? And think about it.

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,870
Mr. Zhou has an Italian silver coin.

My grandfather has an Italian-made dagger.

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,860
Xie Wanghe's family has a wine flask.

558
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
It's also made of silver.

559
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,530
There's foreign writing on it.

It also has foreign writing on it.

No problem.

567

After I return, I'll go check them out.

568
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,520
If they all have Italian writing on them,

569
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,770
then we're on to something.

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,410
Now you don't think it's a waste of time, do you?

Oh my god.

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,260
If you can really connect all these families

573
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,630

A typical Italian name.

582
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,670
So what does the D stand for?

583
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,410
D...

584
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,900
That's hard to say.

585
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,640
But you can use the method of exhaustion

586
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,940
to trace all surnames that start with D.

587
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,780
Okay.

588
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,960
I remember he mentioned in his diary

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,320
a place named Verona.

590
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,900
Verona?

591
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,000
That makes it easier to search.

592
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,750
You can contact the local authorities in Verona

593
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,090
and ask them to help you with the research.

594
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,440
Yes, right.

595
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Think about it.

596
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,210
In that era,

597
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,080
he was able to travel across the ocean

598
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,990
and afford so many attendants.

599
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
This indicates that he was

600
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,430
from a wealthy family there.

601
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,220
Italy's historical records of the nobility,

602
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,950
especially their family history, are relatively well-preserved.

603
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,070
I think it should be easy to trace.

00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,460
Exactly.

924
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,110

925
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,010

Please listen to me first!

927
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,210
Rewards and punishments go hand in hand.

928
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,960
They complement each other.

929
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,120
I've increased the commission,

930
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,550
but the premise is to arrive on time.

931
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,880
Did you manage to do that?

932
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,620
If you can't accept it,

933
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,290
let's not make any changes.

934
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,530
We'll stick to the previous delivery time and commission rates.

935
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,580
Do you want that?

936
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,870
Mr. Xie.

937
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,580
I think this blame

938
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,030
shouldn't be put on everyone.

939
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,550
Right?

940
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,230
Yes, that's right.

941
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,440
Don't be hasty!

942
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,980
Mr. Xie knows

943
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
why you couldn't deliver on time

944
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,800
better than anyone.

945
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,620
First,

946
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,220
we haven't signed any agreements

947
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,150
with the nearby restaurants, right?

948
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,550
That's right.

949
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,530
So the orders we can take

950
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,850
are all several kilometers away.

951
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,640
Second,

Alright. How about this?

957
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,340
By the end of the month,

958
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,910
we will secure

959
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,730
all the neighborhoods within three kilometers to the east.

960
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,670
As for the system,

961
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,070
we'll also do a major upgrade as soon as possible.

964
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
In return,

965
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,310
I need you to promise me

966
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,090
to reduce the overtime rate to 5%.

967
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,650
Otherwise,

968
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,630
the penalties will continue to increase.

969
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,590
Mr. Xie!

970
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,820
I want to ask you a question on behalf of everyone.

971
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,710
If what you said

972
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,420
can't deliver, what then?

973
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,320
Exactly. Right.

974
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,250
Then I'll cancel the penalties.

975
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,860
If I can't do it,

976
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,070
I have no right to make things difficult for you.

977
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,110

Sit.

996
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,240
Why did he sound like he was picking a fight?

997
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,700
Does he have a grudge against you?

998
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,240
He's a local boss.

999
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,300
He was in charge of this area before.

1000
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,540
I suddenly parachuted in,

1001
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,560
so it's understandable that he wants to give me a hard time.

1002
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,000

1003

He didn't make any mistake.

1005
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,830
How can I just fire him?

1006
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,460
Contradicting his leader face to face

1007
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,220
and embarrassing you in front of the employees.

1008
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,480
Isn't that considered a mistake?

1009
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,230
I'd have given him a good slap if it were me.

1010
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,360
