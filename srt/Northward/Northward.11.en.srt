back then, we were all graduates from top universities.

189
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,590
Wanghe, you're back.

190
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,310
Hurry up and make some tea.

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,110
Please, have a seat.

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,280
Mr. Xu, please have a seat.

193
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,120
Alright.

194
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,440
Please, sit.

195
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
Is his leave request ready?

196
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,660
Yes, it is.

197
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,280
Wanghe went to Beijing to see an exhibition this time.

198
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,250
He didn't even inform you teachers.

199
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,700
Please excuse him.

200
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,230
-I'll go...
-What exhibition?

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,670
I went to Beijing to rent servers.

202
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,510
Mr. Xu.

203
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Thank you.

204
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you.

205
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,170
Wanghe's mom, please sit.

206
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,340
Wanghe, you sit too.

207
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,190
Sit, sit.

208
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,630
Wanghe's mom.

209
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,950
The reason I came here

210
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,030
is to have a good talk

211
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,120
with you parents.

212
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,500
I want to know your honest thoughts.

213
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,210
Feel free to say anything.

214
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,020
There's no need to hold back.

215
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,600
Sure. No problem.

216
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,010
This kid has been willful and disobedient since he was little.

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,610
It's all my fault. I've spoiled him.

218
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,340
This time, he skipped school to go to Beijing

219
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,910
without telling either of us.

220
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,670
His father and I were both furious about it.

221
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,480
Right.

222
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,470
The principal was furious too.

223
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,140
But we all know Wanghe is a good kid.

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
If it were someone else,

225
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,830
the punishment would at least be a warning.

226
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,220
Wait.

227
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,570
Are you saying

228
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,770
this time,

229
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,580
there won't be any punishment?

230
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,190
Are... Are you serious?

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,750
Great! Many thanks to the principal.

232
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,830
Thank you, thank you.

233
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,750
Come on, say thank you to your teacher.

234
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,230
I traded my business plan for this.

235
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,790
What plan could you possibly have?

236
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,390
Thank you.

237
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,850
It's nothing.

238
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Wanghe is very smart.

239
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,620
It's just he prefers certain subjects over the others.

240
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,280
When he treats math, physics, and chemistry exams seriously,

241
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,870
he gets pretty good grades.

242
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,350
It's just his Chinese grades are a bit unsatisfactory.

243
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,800
I think

244
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,040
if Wanghe starts working hard

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,950
from now on

246
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,550
and makes a final sprint,

247
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,250
it's not impossible for him to get into university.

248
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,950
Really?

249
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,310
Mom, don't listen to his nonsense.

250
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,150
Shut up.

251
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,480
Mr. Xu, please continue.

252
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,850
Once,

253
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,430
Wanghe fell asleep in class.

254
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,450
I scolded him,

255
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,490
saying "Rotten wood cannot be carved."

256
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,420
"Rotten wood"

257
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,100
means deadwood.

258
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,300
It's useless.

259
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,850
This is what Confucius

260
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,290
said to his student Zai Yu when he scolded him.

261
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,540
It's a famous quote.

262
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,940
The main point was to express his anger at the student's lack of effort,

263
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,830
hoping he could put his mind on the right things.

264
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,870
As soon as I finished speaking,

265
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,110
Wanghe

266
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,550
raised his hand and stood up.

267
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,350
He gave me a long speech,

268
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,590
providing examples to explain

269
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,980
that even rotten wood

270
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,710
has its own value and uses.

271
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,390
He gave more than ten examples.

272
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,070
When I heard that,

273
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,360
I realized each example

274
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,470
could develop into an industry.

275
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,070
Many of his classmates were stunned.

276
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,660
Just wait until your father gets home.

277
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,770
Wanghe's mom, the reason I'm telling you this

278
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,520
is to let you know that

279
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,150
I believe Wanghe is very talented.

280
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,230
As long as he starts working hard now,

281
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,510
it's not too late for everything.

282
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,790
I mean it.

283
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,310
What?

284
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,740
You don't have confidence in yourself?

285
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,310
Do you know

286
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,430
Google?

287
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,430
Yes, I do.

288
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,830
The best search engine in the world.

289
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,460
When Google started,

290
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,310
Yahoo was already there,

291
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,430
which was the world's number one search engine,

292
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,970
an internet giant.

293
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,070
Even Silicon Valley investors tried to dissuade Google,

294
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,630
saying that with Yahoo ahead,

295
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,030
they'd have no future.

296
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,930
But they didn't give up.

297
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,070
They persevered in the search engine field

298
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,030
and carved out their own space.

299
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,040
Let me ask you,

300
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,970
what was the key

301
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,580
to their success?

302
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,320
Technology, I guess.

303
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,020
And what's the source of technology?

304
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,940
Knowledge.

305
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,250
And

306
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,660
deep thinking.

307
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,750
In terms of mere knowledge,

308
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,600
I believe with your IQ,

309
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,750
even if you study at home,

310
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,020
you can still manage.

311
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
But systematic learning

312
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,830
can help you establish

313
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,210
a scientific and effective thinking framework in the shortest time.

314
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,450
It's like the foundation.

315
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,050
How tall a building can be

316
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,330
depends on how deep its foundation is,

317
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,060
right?

318
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,980
Last time,

319
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,730
you mentioned that ebony wood

320
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,180
is priceless.

321
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,240
It was a great point.

322
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,380
But have you thought about this?

323
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,770
For a tree to become ebony wood,

324
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,220
it's not just about the passage of time.

325
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,820
First, it has to be a tree,

326
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,490
and it has to grow well.

327
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,470
If it were green foxtail,

328
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,050
even after thousands of years,

329
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,950
it still wouldn't become ebony wood.

330
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,970
Right?

331
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,910
Mr. Xu, this...

332
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,830
This is great.

333
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,690
Did you hear that?

334
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,020
Mr. Xu was praising you,

335
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
saying you're promising.

336
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,850
Mr. Xu.

337
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,950
Did you hear that?

338
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,450
You must study hard.

339
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,660
If you don't study well,

340
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,130
your dad and I will beat you up together.

341
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,100
Mr... Mr. Xu.

342
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,370
Please take extra care of him at school.

343
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,480
Alright.

344
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,550
I'll also count on you, Wanghe's mom.

345
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,630
After all, with the support of parents,

346
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,000
we teachers

347
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,630
can do more with less,

348
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,350
right?

349
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,130
Sure. Sure.

350
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,920
P-Please take extra care of him.

351
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
Well,

352
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,390
since we're not at school after all,

353
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,170
we don't know what's going on in there.

354
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,270
If he misbehaves at school,

355
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,750
just discipline him as needed.

356
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,950
His father and I

357
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,820
don't mind.

358
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,370
But Mr. Xu does.

359
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,490
Alright, I'll be on my way.

360
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,360
Alright.

361
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,020
Thank you for everything.

362
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,390
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

363
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,520
Alright, goodbye.

364
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I won't hit you,

365
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,860
but with your father's temper,

366
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,020
you better think about what to do.

367
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,750
Mr. Xu has left?

368
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,450
Yes.

369
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,520
How was it?

370
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,820
Are you two alright?

371
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,740
You owe us both a beating.

372
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,670
How was Beijing?

373
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,250
It was alright.

374
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,440
Did you go to Zhongguancun?

375
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,790
I did.

376
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,130
It's not quite what I imagined.

377
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,620
Don't leave already.

378
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,530
Tell us about it.

379
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,910
How's it different from your imagination?

380
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,010
Before going to Beijing,

381
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,210
I thought I was smarter than everyone else.

382
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,200
I thought I could see further into the future than anyone.

383
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,860
But after I got there, I realized

384
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,290
there are too many smart people.

385
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,890
Taking a stroll around Zhongguancun,

386
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,470
I saw graduates

387
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,340
from top universities across the country

388
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,880
all struggling

389
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,620
and working hard.

390
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,510
Everyone already knows

391
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,260
those little tricks I learned online,

392
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,230
and they're already putting them into practice.

393
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,120
Only after going there did I realize

394
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,810
I was just like a frog in a well.

395
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,520
So what are you thinking now?

396
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,260
I haven't figured it out yet.

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,970
I think

398
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,640
maybe you should give it a shot

399
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,280
and try to get into university.

400
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,810
Even if it's not for your parents,

401
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,450
you'll have more options in the future.

402
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,270
That's right.

403
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,790
With your brains,

404
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,859
if you really work hard for the exam,

405
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,170
you could at least get into a second-tier university.

406
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,780
Is it a matter of taking the exam or not?

407
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,630
Given my family's situation,

408
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,130
and Siyi...

409
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,910
Siyi is going to try to get enrolled in a normal university, which is tuition-free.

410
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,310
Your dad should be able to make some money

411
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,740
from selling the ship.

412
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,560
When our parents tell us

413
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,829
they're doing things for our own good,

414
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,869
isn't it really annoying?

415
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,380
It's the same the other way around.

416
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,480
When you do things for your parents' good,

417
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,720
don't they get annoyed too?

418
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,700
They do.

419
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,190
Don't take this the wrong way,

420
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,430
but what you're doing

421
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,410
is called emotional blackmail.

422
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,400
Why are you wearing so much in this weather?

423
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,620
Are you going to the North Pole or what?

424
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,410
Wanghe is definitely going to get a beating tonight.

425
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
Your Uncle Xie said

426
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,920
he wanted to teach him a lesson.

427
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,640
I have to try to stop it a bit,

428
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,290
right? We can't let the kid get hurt too badly.

429
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,280
He won't.

430
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,520
Do you think Wanghe is the type to take a beating quietly?

431
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,160
If it really hurts,

432
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,310
he'll beg for mercy.

433
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,440
There are things you don't know.

434
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
Your Uncle Xie has been

435
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,810
in a bad mood lately.

436
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm worried he might not stop once he starts beating him,

437
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,840
unable to control himself.

438
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,810
He's in a bad mood?

439
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,920
Are you really going to sell the ship?

440
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,550
How do you know?

441
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,610
My mom told me.

442
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,230
Has Uncle Xie agreed?

443
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,000
Business hasn't been good lately.

444
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,640
After selling the ship, we'll see if we can

445
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,910
find something else to do.

446
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,390
Besides seafaring,

447
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,370
what else can you do?

448
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,420
Why would you say that?

449
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,370
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

450
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,890
Let me tell you,

451
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,360
Fenghua, back in the day, your Uncle Xie and I

452
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,050
traveled all over the country.

453
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,210
We've done so many businesses,

454
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,960
like electronic watches and foreign cigarettes.

455
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,170
You don't know how many of those we bought and resold.

456
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,390
We even ran a video hall once,

457
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,630
showing Hong Kong and Taiwan films, action movies, and romance movies.

458
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,990
Your mom loved watching those the most.

459
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

460
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,220
It was "The Legend of the Condor Heroes", right?

461
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,950
We did whatever was profitable back then.

462
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,990
So why can't you do it now?

463
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,270
Well...

464
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,980
It's not that we can't do it now.

465
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,660
But after all, times have changed.

466
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,780
right?

467
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,350
We need to find a new way to make a living.

468
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,350
In recent years, so many people lost their jobs,

469
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,260
but I haven't seen anyone starve to death.

470
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,710
Dad.

471
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,540
I actually have an idea.

472
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,570
You don't have to sell the ship.

473
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,250
Really?

474
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,160
If this idea can be implemented,

475
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,920
Uncle Xie won't feel so bad anymore,

476
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,750
and Wanghe might be able to avoid this beating.

477
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,170
♫Girl, you sit on the bow♫

478
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,530
♫I tow the boat on the shore♫

479
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,160
♫In deep love♫

480
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,810
Bro.

481
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,010
You went drinking again.

482
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,340
Lao'er.

483
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,240
You're still up?

484
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,430
Yeah.

485
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,430
There's something I want to discuss with you.

486
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,330
Be careful.

487
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,100
Alright.

488
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,090
Go ahead.

489
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,310
Here's the thing.

490
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,630
It's my daughter's idea.

491
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,250
A floating supermarket.

492
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,070
That is to say, we stock up on goods

493
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,430
and sell them on the ship.

494
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,740
We can make extra money

495
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,790
while seafaring.

496
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,250
It'll be killing two birds with one stone, right?

497
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,590
Let me finish, bro.

498
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,170
Tell me, how many seafaring ships

499
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,150
are there on the river now?

500
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,850
Talking about setting up a floating supermarket.

501
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,680
Who are you going to sell the goods to?

502
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,380
You'd be better off setting up a roasted sweet potato stand by the roadside.

503
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,690
It would be more profitable than this.

504
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,950
It's not like that, bro.

505
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,440
About this matter,

506
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,670
Yan also thinks we could give it a try.

507
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,370
You're listening to

508
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,360
women's opinions now?

509
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,470
Don't worry.

510
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,760
Even if we can't do seafaring business anymore,

511
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,930
as long as you stick with me,

512
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,820
you won't be poor.

513
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,280
How did it go?

514
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,150
He didn't agree?

515
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,790
I'll talk to him again later.

516
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,230
How about we ask Wanghe to talk to him?

517
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,460
He's quick-witted.

518
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,260
When it comes to making money,

519
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,410
I think Uncle Xie will listen to him.

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,530
Why bother talking to him?

521
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,560
He used to make the call on everything on the ship,

522
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,800
and now we still have to listen to him about opening the supermarket or not?

523
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
It's none of his business!

524
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,220
We're so poor that we can barely put food on the table.

525
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,210
If we still don't have any income in the near future,

526
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,750
the whole family will be left with nothing to eat.

527
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
What's wrong with you?

528
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,610
Why are you saying these things

529
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,670
in front of our daughter?

530
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,750
You're just too easily swayed.

531
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,750
You're a grown man, yet you don't have your own opinions.

532
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,180
You always listen to Boss Xie on everything.

533
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,190
Who's listening to him?

534
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,670
You just won't let it go, will you?

535
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,990
This is ridiculous.

536
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,390
Don't go in yet.

537
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,270
I have something to ask you.

538
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,730
Wait until I'm done beating him up.

539
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,670
You're not listening to me anymore, are you?

540
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,900
Wanghe mentioned his idea of dropping out of school

541
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,880
to you before, right?

542
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,430
He mentioned it briefly.

543
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,220
Why didn't you tell me about it?

544
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,030
Well,

545
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,190
I didn't expect him to just

546
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,990
go through with it.

547
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,610
Wanghe said

548
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,810
you didn't object at the time.

549
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,550
Is that true?

550
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,240
But I didn't agree either.

551
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,710
What kind of talk is that?

552
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,890
Xie Tiancheng, what were you thinking?

553
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,840
Are your brains damaged from all the drinking?

554
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,790
It's his last year of senior high.

555
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,240
You can't wait for such a short time?

556
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,430
You even said we were both useless,

557
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,630
and we'd need our son to provide for us.

558
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,890
What were you thinking?

559
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,260
What kind of talk is that?

560
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,470
What are you talking about?

561
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,230
This... You...

562
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,910
Let me beat him first.

563
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,630
Don't beat him.

564
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,950
Beat me instead.

565
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,630
I deserve to be beaten.

566
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:45,950
What are you doing?

567
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,710
I don't earn money,

568
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,910
and I failed to raise our son well,

569
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,230
making him worry about the family.

570
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,110
Beat me. Beat me.

571
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,150
Just beat me to death.

572
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,830
Dad!

573
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,800
Mom!

574
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,030
I'm sorry.

575
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,270
I was wrong.

576
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,380
I was wrong!

577
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,060
What are you doing?

578
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,030
Get... Get ready.

579
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,830
If you

580
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,410
truly realize your mistake,

581
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,850
make up for the time lost.

582
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,870
Don't make your mother worried and angry anymore in the future.

583
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,490
Dad.

584
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,940
Aren't you warm?

585
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,570
I am. I am.

586
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,480
Let's go.

587
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,590
Haihong.

588
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,750
Why did you get up so late?

589
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,950
Do you know what time it is?

590
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,050
Yan.

591
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,980
I have something to tell you.

592
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,760
Go ahead.

593
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,960
I don't want to run my stall anymore.

594
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,010
Why?

595
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,960
There are too few customers, so I can't make enough money.

596
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,260
I want to get a driver's license

597
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,140
and go drive a truck.

598
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,030
Are you out of your mind?

599
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,140
Is truck driving a job for women?

600
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,720
I've asked around.

601
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,360
Zhang who lives at Flower Street has a truck.

602
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,950
He's sick and can't drive long distances anymore,

603
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,970
so he rented his truck to a transport company.

604
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,610
He complains that the rent is too low.

605
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
I've talked to him,

606
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,580
and once I get my driver's license, I'll rent his truck.

607
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,120
I'll rent his first, then buy my own after I've made enough money.

608
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,840
This is no small matter.

609
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,040
Have you discussed this with your husband?

610
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,870
I'm not discussing it with him.

611
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,050
He won't agree to this kind of thing.

612
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,570
I'll get the license first.

613
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,480
And once I start driving and making money,

614
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,040
it'll be too late for him to object.

615
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,870
As long as it's your decision,

616
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,210
I'll support you.

617
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,490
Oh, right.

618
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,510
Don't worry about Wanghe's meals.

619
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,140
I'll take care of them.

620
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,390
Then I...

621
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,740
I'll thank you in advance.

622
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,210
Don't worry.

623
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,400
Also, one more thing.

624
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,270
Don't tell anyone about this for now.

625
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,270
Understood.

626
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,270
I'm off.

627
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,390
Oh, right.

628
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,580
Haihong.

629
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,140
There's something I want to tell you too.

630
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,930
Well,

631
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,640
I've discussed with my husband Maotian,

632
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,530
and we're planning to open a floating supermarket.

633
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,970
Can you make money from that?

634
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,540
Fenghua looked it up online.

635
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,680
It should work.

636
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,770
It's just we'll have to work harder.

637
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,310
We'll have to work from dawn to dusk.

638
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,910
As long as you can make money,

639
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,030
a little hardship is fine.

640
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,650
Just do it.

641
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,080
We've got plenty of strength, right?

642
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,650
I'm off.

643
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,580
Let me try one.

644
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,460
Be careful.

645
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,980
Be careful. It's very hot.

646
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Look how greedy you are.

647
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,220
Not bad, Siyi.

648
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,980
Your skills are almost as good as Granny Ma's.

649
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,410
Mom, can you teach me too?

650
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,730
Whenever you do anything, I'll have to clean up after you.

651
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,550
Good morning, Granny.

652
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,140
Good morning, Granny.

653
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,750
Good morning, aunties.

654
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,590
Good morning, aunties.

655
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,030
-Morning, Granny.
-They're all here.

656
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,010
Xingchi, can't you behave yourself?

657
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,810
Come and taste this.

658
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,450
-Have a taste.
-Okay.

659
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,200
Come on.

660
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,330
You even know how to make this?

661
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,710
Not bad.

662
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,060
It looks pretty good.

663
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,180
And it's delicious.

664
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,910
It's delicious.

665
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,610
One more.

666
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,240
Amazing.

667
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,690
[Breakfast]

668
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,150
Not bad, right?

669
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,340
Don't get cocky.

670
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,920
Fried radish cakes are so simple to make.

671
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,130
By the time you learn how to make

672
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,990
our Ma family's braised meat,

673
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,470
that's when you'll have real skills.

674
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,310
Count me in.

675
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,950
I want to learn it.

676
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,430
Well,

677
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,390
after I learn it, I'll be your assistant.

678
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,020
Really?

679
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,400
Are you up for it?

680
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,190
[Breakfast]

681
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,950
Let me tell you.

682
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,630
[Breakfast]

683
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,720
Our Ma family's braised meat

684
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,260
is a secret recipe passed down through generations.

685
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,470
Do you really want to learn it?

686
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,230
I do.

687
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,970
Then you'll have to marry into our family first.

688
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,400
Then I'll learn it too.

689
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,480
Really?

690
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,790
I've loved Granny's braised meat since I was little.

691
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,810
Once I've learned it,

692
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,780
I won't starve wherever I go.

693
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,030
Got it.

694
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,740
Well, you better work hard then.

695
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,560

696
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,280

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,890

698
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,550

700
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,730
Cage.

701
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,690
Cage.

702
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,120

703
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,790
Captain.

704
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,340
Captain.

705
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,800
Cage.

706
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,430
Check. Check. Check.

707
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,870
Captain.

708
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,620
Check. Check.

709
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,930
It's really English, huh?

710
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,640
I don't see pigs flying.

711
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,760
Xie Wanghe is actually studying hard.

712
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,660
English is important, okay?

713
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,750
Nowadays, top talents in Beijing and Shanghai

714
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,670
all speak English.

715
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,130
So I must learn English well.

716
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,310
Otherwise, when the time comes,

717
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,110
I won't even be able to understand financial statements.

718
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,890
If I go out to raise funds and meet a foreigner,

719
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,550
I won't even last one round.

720
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,750
How can I fool them then?

721
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,620
If you really think like that,

722
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,070
you might as well work on other subjects too.

723
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,910
And while you're at it, get yourself into a Project 985 university.

724
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,990
Hey, are you really serious?

725
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,520
Don't joke with me.

726
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,770
What do you mean?

727
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,010
Don't you want me to get into college?

728
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,350
No, it's not that.

729
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,470
But this is too sudden, isn't it?

730
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,970
How did you come to this decision?

731
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,400
It's just that one day,

732
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,640
you'd suddenly realize that besides studying,

733
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,910
there's nothing else you can do.

734
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,600
Mr. Xu is also to blame.

735
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,740
During the home visit, he went so far saying good things about me.

736
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
He gave my parents hope.

737
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,440
Anyway,

738
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,410
I'll give it my all and go for it.

739
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,810
I must get into college.

740
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,190
Otherwise,

741
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,280
I'll have to see my dad sulking at home all day.

742
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,480
It breaks my heart.

743
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,110

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,620
I'll let it slide that you got physical with me.

930
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,800
But she must pay back the 10,000 yuan she took from me.

931
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,050
What if we refuse?

932
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,940
You're students.

933
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,440
Your main task is to study.

934
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,960
Don't make trouble for yourselves.

935
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,390
Trying to frighten me?

936
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,860
You did such filthy things,

937
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,950
and you still have the guts to come ask for money?

938
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,150
How can you be so shameless?

939
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,430
So you're not paying back, huh?

940
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,570
She'll be expecting a summons then.

941
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,260
What summons?

942
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,420
For breach of contract.

943
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,710
It's not just that 10,000 yuan.

944
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,420
You also owe me 50,000 in liquidated damages.

945
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,550
50,000? Are you insane?

946
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,690
Then go ahead and sue.

947
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,330
Don't you know

948
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,470
what you've done?

949
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,190
What have I done?

950
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,600
I merely had students model for advertisements.

951
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,870
That's not illegal.

952
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,100
It's not up to you to decide whether it's illegal or not.

953
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,270
By the way,

954
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,990
we've already taken screenshots of that album of yours.

955
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,500
We'll hand them over to the Public Security Bureau

956
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,880
and let them decide whether what you did is illegal or not.

957
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,260
What album?

958
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,630
What nonsense are you talking about?

959
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,040
Are you legally illiterate?

960
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,460
It's called lingerie advertising.

961
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,310
It's legal.

962
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,460
Is that so?

963
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,260
Alright.

964
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,880
I guess I'll see you in the newspapers then.

965
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,480
I've even thought of a headline for you.

966
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,490
"Minors

967
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,270
Coerced by Unscrupulous Photographer to Take Indecent Photos,

968
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,510
Tearfully Forced to Have Drinks with Adults."

969
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,210
What a sensational news story.

970
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,290
Local portal websites,

971
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,110
photography sites,

972
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,950
advertising sites,

973
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,310
and any site related to your business,

974
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,030
I'll make sure

975
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,030
every single one of them sees the news.

976
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,430
Let's see how you'll manage after that.

977
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,670
Don't you dare!

978
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,930
You started this,

979
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,270
and I'll finish it.

980
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,460
We're students.

981
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,830
We have nothing to lose.

982
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,270
Try it if you dare,

983
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,980
and see if we dare.

984
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,310
Let's see who has more to lose.

985
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,500
I'm warning you.

986
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,150
If you dare to bully Xia Fenghua again,

987
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,960
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

988
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,670
Let's go.

989
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,540
Next time, it'll be the three of us who beat you up.

990
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,570
What's wrong?

991
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,190
You confronted him like that.

992
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,150
Are we going to be okay?

993
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,630
As I said,

994
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,560
we've got nothing to lose.

995
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,210
But I'm scared.

996
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,580
Don't worry.

997
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,850
They wouldn't risk losing their business over 10,000 yuan.

998
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,190
Anyone with half a brain wouldn't do that.

999
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,930
I'm just worried they might do something desperate.

1000
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,150
What could they possibly do?

1001
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:12,810
Ambush us?

1002
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,270
Rob us? Kidnap us?

1003
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,370
They wouldn't dare.

1004
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,640
Fenghua.

1005
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,940
Remember this.

1006
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,140
Except for the three of us,

1007
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,690
no one can bully you.

1008
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,670
If anyone dares to bully you,

1009
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,460
we'll take him down.

1010
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
We'll destroy him!

1011
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,850
We'll pour tar on his head

1012
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,890
and pluck out all his hair.

1013
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,030
What, are you preparing a roast suckling pig?

1014
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,450
Let's go home.

1015
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,650
You eat.

1016
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,670
Eat.

1017
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,390
I'll eat it then.

1018
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,990
Eat up.

♫At moonset cry the crows♫

1020
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,330
Don't be stubborn.

1021
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,830
Just do as I say.

1022
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,690
How much do you think she makes in a day?

1023
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,230
Who cares how much money she makes?

1024
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,950
As long as she treats Fenghua's father well.

♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

1026

Granny, Auntie.

1027
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,470
When did you arrive?

1028
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,280
We just got here.

1029
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,830
Fenghua.

1030
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,200
It's only been a few years since we last saw you,

1031
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,860
and you've grown so much.

1032
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,700
Girls really do change a lot as they grow up.

♫Dimly lit fishing boats♫

1034
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,470
I remember back then, Sister-in-law, your daughter

1035
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,910
was only about this tall,

1036
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,150
and now she's grown so tall.

1037
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,750
She's getting uglier as she grows.

1038
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,150
Not even as good-looking as she was when she was little.

♫Sadly lie beneath maples♫

1040
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,830
Back then, she still looked like a girl.

1041
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,790
But now,

1042
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,590
look at her.

1043
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,630
What did she do to her teeth?

1044
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,320
She's doing great, okay?

1045
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,390
Just the other day, someone invited her to shoot a commercial.

1046
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,590
They even wanted to sign her as a model.

1047
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,080
Her, a model?

1048
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,030
She even shoot a commercial?

1049
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,300
What kind of commercial?

1050
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,100
Pig feed?

1051
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,590

Do you need something?

1055
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,940
What are they doing here?

1056
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,360
What else? Of course for money.

saying the village was going to build two-story houses,

1060
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,440
all part of a unified plan.

1061
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,960
Just different ways to trick me out of my money.

1062
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,430
Who's that child?

1063
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,450
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

1064
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,840

I'll flip the table on them.
