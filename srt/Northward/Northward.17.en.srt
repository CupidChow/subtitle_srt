[NORTHWARD]

00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,039
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,750
If you're sleepy, take a nap in the back.

4
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,920
If you're done drinking, put the lid back and place it here.

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't spill water on yourself.

6
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,190
After finishing this trip

7
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,700
and deducting all the expenses,

8
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,870
we'll have about 700 yuan left.

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,660
While on the road,

10
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,900
I've been thinking about something.

11
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,350
Driving a truck is really tough.

12
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,990
Let's

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,230
work hard for a few years.

14
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,710
After we put our son through college

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,130
and he finds a good job,

16
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,030
we can take a breather.

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,079
We'll stop driving

18
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,430
and take a good rest.

19
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,700
Or

20
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,390
we can buy a small ship.

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,310
It doesn't matter how many shipping deals we can get.

22
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,670
If we can't get any deals, we'll just enjoy the scenery on the ship.

23
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,710
You like the idea?

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,690
Mom.

25
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,940
You're back.

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,840
Son, you're back.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,750
Where's Dad?

28
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Sleeping.

29
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,000
Did everything go smoothly?

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah.

31
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,829
The client wanted to dock my pay because I arrived late.

32
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,650
Your dad rolled up his sleeves and made him pay the full amount.

33
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,750
He's like your bodyguard.

34
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,820
Great.

35
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,990
Luckily, it didn't come to blows.

36
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,079
Otherwise,

37
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,430
the money we earned

38
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,579
couldn't even cover the medical bills.

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,750
Dad is experienced in this.

40
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,120
Back when he was a seafarer,

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,270
there were also people who tried to skip out on paying.

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,350
He just got physical.

43
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,090
What's wrong, Mom?

44
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,570
Did you two have a fight?

45
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,830
No.

46
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,500
I wish we had.

47
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,750
Your dad didn't give me the chance.

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,890
What do you mean?

49
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
During the trip,

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,490
over 2,000 kilometers in total,

51
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,730
your father kept a long face

52
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,040
the whole time.

53
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,159
And he said to me a total of maybe…

54
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,880
200 words?

55
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,370
Boss Xie.

56
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,280
Mr. Shao.

57
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,260
Are you off work?

58
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,310
I thought it was you from afar.

59
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,060
It's really you.

60
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,730
You're in charge of

61
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,940
buying groceries now?

62
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,360
Well, Haihong

63
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,390
is busy driving the truck.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,270
I'll do what I can to help.

65
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah.

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,030
Well,

67
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,580
how's the publication of your book going?

68
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,350
It's in the works.

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,270
I don't have any publishing experience,

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,110
so I'm learning as I go.

71
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,170
Oh, right.

72
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,480
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.

73
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,340
Can we have a talk here?

74
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,770
Okay.

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,530
Come, sit here.

76
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,950
Alright.

77
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,420
Sit.

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,190
Here is the thing.

79
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,020
I have a suggestion

80
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,940
that might seem immature.

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,960
I'd like to share it with you

82
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,000
to see if it's feasible.

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,410
You're being so polite. What's it?

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,210
You know, every year, many people

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,590
drown in the canal.

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,190
Yesterday, another person drowned upstream near Liu Village.

87
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,540
No one is willing to retrieve the body.

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,830
Here's what I'm thinking.

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,940
Could you consider being an initiator

90
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,070
to get some volunteers

91
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,900
to form a canal rescue team

92
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,490
that helps those

93
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,390
who fall into the water?

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,560
What do you think?

95
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,910
Hold on, M-Mr. Shao.

96
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,040
What exactly are you getting at?

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,540
Here's the thing.

98
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,550
As you know, the authorities are currently applying for

99
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,190
World Heritage status for the canal.

100
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,290
The heritage is not the canal

101
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,440
but the canal culture.

102
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,230
Speaking of culture,

103
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,550
look at our Flower Street.

104
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,930
What culture does it have?

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,060
There were a few famous local female entertainers in history,

106
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,300
but we can't

107
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,650
use romantic tales to make our case.

108
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,510
However,

109
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,560
with good people who did good things,

110
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,350
we can say this is a town

111
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,640
with kind-hearted folks.

112
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,300
That could be a characteristic of Flower Street,

113
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:05,890
right?

114
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,270
Mr. Shao,

115
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,010
are you planning to write and publish something?

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,050
No.

117
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,430
Good people and good deeds

118
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,870
are highly commendable.

119
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,050
You'll do good things,

120
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,180
and I'll praise you.

121
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,480
It's a win-win.

122
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,050
Then I should get half of the writing fee, right?

123
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,530
Forget about that little bit of money.

124
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,250
What matters is the honor.

125
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,830
Alright, it's settled then.

126
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,060
The honor goes to you,

127
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,580
and the writing fee goes to me.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,110
If you say so,

129
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,909
you're making me speechless.

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,990
I'm just joking with you.

131
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,470
No matter what,

132
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,640
this is a serious matter.

133
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,430
After I go home,

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,230
I need to discuss it with my wife.

135
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,090
I can only do it if she agrees.

136
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,700
Alright.

137
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,340
Then I'll wait for your reply.

138
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,210
If the canal gets World Heritage status,

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,950
it'll be able

140
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,760
to flourish again.

141
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,040
By then,

142
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,300
you can truly return to the river.

143
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,950
Alright.

144
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,230
I'll be going.

145
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,360
See you.

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,070
Bye, Boss Xie.

147
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:42,820
Boss Xie.

148
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,280
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,460
I came out for some fresh air.

150
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,900
You're drinking?

151
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,630
I'll grab a few more bottles.

152
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,540
A few more.

153
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,420
How's everything? Good?

154
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,710
Just so-so.

155
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,590
It's still cold.

156
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,830
How about you?

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,410
How's the long-haul driving going?

158
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,060
Compared to seafaring,

159
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,520
it's much more tiring.

160
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,350
Is that so?

161
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,590
With seafaring,

162
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,060
ships don't go very fast,

163
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,300
right?

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,460
You don't have to

165
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,830
stay focused all the time.

166
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,110
Driving is different.

167
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,810
When driving, you always have to keep your eyes on the road.

168
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,240
After a whole day,

169
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,920
you're sore all over,

170
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,820
and your head buzzes.

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,230
It's not so unbearable

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,190
as long as you can make money.

173
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,460
Right?

174
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,270
Is your supermarket going well?

175
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,550
Kind of.

176
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,430
I can make about 200 yuan a day.

177
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,250
That's pretty good.

178
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,160
Your wife must be happy now.

180
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,100
I guess you could say that.

181
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,950
I haven't been told off for over half a month.

182
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,050
To be honest, I'm not used to it.

183
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,110
That's not good for your health.

184
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll remind Yan

185
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,680
to nag you more often.

186
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,230
No, no, no.

187
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,400
To give you a hard time.

188
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,950
Will that make you feel better?

189
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,830
Boss Xie, I'm begging you.

190
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,310
Please.

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,470
These days,

Didn't Mr. Zhou say

220
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,920

221

We should pay our respects.

222
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,460
Of course.

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,910
No.

385
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,350
Why not?

386
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,440
The same reason as your dad's.

387
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
Not everyone likes Beijing.

388
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,310
Some people are just not suited for that place.

389
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,550
Wait. You've never been there.

390
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,910
How do you know you're not suited for it?

391
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,550
I went to Beijing.

392
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,670
I gave it a try.

393
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
So I know

394
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm just an ignorant fool.

395
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,310
But when I'm ready, I'll go there again.

396
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,180
This time, I'll start from scratch

397
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,170
and make a name for myself.

398
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,120
Not everyone wants to make a name for themselves.

399
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,310
Exactly. I don't want to.

400
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,090
Then you can just stay at home.

401
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,670
But you're different.

402
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
You still have a chance.

403
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,490
Xie Wanghe,

404
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
you always talk about success.

405
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,650
That's not wrong.

406
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,190
But everyone's definition of success

407
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,450
is different.

408
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,570
Making a lot of money is just one type of success.

409
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,910
For me,

410
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,130
success is

411
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,180
living the life I want. That's enough.

412
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,550
So what kind of life do you want?

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,120
Just the life now.

414
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,340
Every day I wake up, I can see Grandma and my brother,

415
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
and I spend most of the day

416
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,960
doing things I enjoy.

417
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,850
Like memorizing vocabulary,

418
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,030
doing schoolwork,

419
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,620
and chatting and fooling around with Fenghua.

420
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,020
I'm very satisfied with my current life.

421
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,010
And I'm content.

422
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,590
People with big dreams like you

423
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,420
can never understand the goals of someone like me.

424
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,150
Well said!

425
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,940
Shut up.

426
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,270
Ma Siyi.

427
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,510
You should try to see the bigger world,

428
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,590
understand?

429
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,210
You're not just someone.

430
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,700
What on earth did you two talk about?

431
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,170
What's wrong with the two of them?

432
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,260
Guys,

433
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,540
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

434
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,470
this is your final semester

435
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,500
in high school

436
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,630
and the last stretch before the college entrance exam.

437
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,860
The school has decided

438
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,950
to implement full closed-off management for senior students

439
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,200
from Monday to Friday.

440
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,830
Morning reading will start at 6:30 AM,

441
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,390
and you will stay at school overnight.

442
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,270
No one

443
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,790
is allowed to leave the school unless necessary.

444
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,880
Please summon all your strength

445
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,260
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

446
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,150
and be 100% focused.

447
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,590
Concentrate your time and energy

448
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,390
on the final battle of the college entrance exam.

449
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,920
Do you have confidence?

450
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,310
[Final battle in June. Let's meet at Tsinghua and Peking.]

451
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,910
Yes!

452
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,030
Day student?

453
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,990
No way.

454
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,100
It's against the school's rules.

455
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,070
But my brother is very young.

456
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,270
He needs someone to take care of him.

457
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,680
And my grandma isn't in good health.

458
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,070
I have to look after them at home.

459
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,310
Siyi,

460
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,830
your school performance is quite good,

461
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,270
but your family

462
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,230
has been such a burden on you.

463
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm worried that if this continues,

464
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,990
it'll affect your performance in the college entrance exam.

465
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,230
It won't. My ranking didn't drop this time.

466
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,870
I promise to study hard at home.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,960
Alright, I'll apply to the school

468
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,910
to make an exception for you,

469
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,870
allowing you to be a day student.

470
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,670
But you must remember,

471
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,670
don't waste a minute.

472
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,710
Make the most of the last semester.

473
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Thank you, madam.

474
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,630
Siyi.

475
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,230
Do you have a moment?

476
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,390
Let's talk.

477
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,590
You'd better not be a day student.

478
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,150
This semester is crucial.

479
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,460
You know how things are with my family.

480
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,030
Are there no other options?

481
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,860
What options do I have?

482
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,310
My brother needs to go to school.

483
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,040
Grandma might be hospitalized at any time.

484
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,180
If I don't go back to keep an eye on things,

485
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,690
something could go wrong at any moment.

486
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,060
What about hiring a caregiver?

487
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,790
Do you think I can afford a caregiver?

488
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,950
I can lend you money.

489
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,640
Don't worry.

490
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,600
I won't ask my parents for it.

491
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,910
I'll lend you the pocket money I've saved up.

492
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
It should be enough.

493
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,440
Chen Rui.

494
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,510
You've always been very nice to me.

495
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,310
I'm grateful.

496
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,310
I already felt indebted to you

497
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,210
when I went to your house for free classes.

498
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,260
I shouldn't take advantage of your kindness.

499
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,760
Thank you.

500
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,190
I don't know how it happened.

501
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,910
It just suddenly popped up, you know?

502
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,590
Look, she's wearing a floral bra.

503
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,060
She even has boobs.

504
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,510
Yeah.

505
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,030
Fenghua isn't like this.

506
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,400
What are you looking at?

507
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,360
Show me.

508
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,070
Show me!

509
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,760
Fenghua, did someone take your picture without you knowing?

510
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,510
What's it?

511
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,870
Give it to me!

512
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,230
Fenghua!

You think I'm crazy?

517
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,680
Dressing like that for photos.

518
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,330
They're obviously photoshopped.

519
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,990
Then it's no big deal, Fenghua.

520
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,210
File a complaint.

That takes time.

527
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,310
Word has spread.

528
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,790
I'm afraid it'll affect Fenghua's reputation.

544

Aren't you afraid of karma for doing such a thing?

545
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,760
She should've returned my money.

546
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,070
Every action has consequences. She deserves it.

Still downtown. He's been detained.

603

They asked him

604
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,390
for his family's number.

605
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,190
He gave them my number.

606
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,310
I guess he didn't want you to worry.

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,230
A photographer.

Not only did he beat him,

610
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,470
but he also trashed his photo studio.

611
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,950
This is very serious.

He has a strong sense of justice, just like you.

But he's got quite a temper.

He acts without considering the consequences.

618

Wanghe wouldn't be the one who started it.

what Wanghe did is understandable,

734

and then posted the photos online.

735

Wanghe went on his own.

758

He didn't tell us.

759
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,550

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,340
How did you know it was that guy?

761
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,630
Yeah.

762
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,290
Is there any evidence?

763
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,030
No.

764
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,400
I checked the IP address.

765
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,989
He used a proxy server,

766
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,030
so it's hard to trace.

767
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,230
But I think

768
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,830
he's the one who took the original photos.

769
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,850
That's a clue.

770
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,520
But we need to file a police report first.

771
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,150
Report it to the police!

772
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,770
We must report it to the police!

773
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,679
He should be arrested!

Will that help?

775
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,300
This isn't evidence.

776
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Can you prove he broke the law?

777
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,830
He was just trying to give us trouble.

Wait.

782
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,040
Yes, yes.

Let's get him out first.

784
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,170
He's the most important now.

785

Right.

786

What did the police say?

787
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,440
The police said

788
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,020
we should pay for the damage

789
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,680
and try to meet all his conditions.

790
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,110
This way, Wanghe might be able to come out

791

and not miss the college entrance exam.

947
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,230
That should settle this matter.

948
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:16,980
100,000?

949
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,960
Why don't you just rob a bank?

950
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,130
100,000 it is.

951
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,040
Let's sign the agreement now.

952
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,600
Are you sure?

953
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,670
Wait.

954
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,580
Listen.

955
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,400
It must be paid in full at once.

956
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,290
Paid in full at once?

957
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,240
You're really pushing it, aren't you?

958
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,320
No problem.

959
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,450
If you hadn't done that despicable thing…

960
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,070
No problem.

961
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,570
could my son have beaten you up?

962
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,330
Alright, stop.

963
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,610
This is the police station.

964
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,670
This is the police station!

965
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:43,950
Stop yelling.

966
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,910
It's already settled. Stop arguing.

967
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,990
Do you know where you are?

968
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,990
Alright. Don't listen to him.

969
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,350
I can make the decision on this matter.

970
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,270
You can't!

971
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,150
Don't get yourself arrested!

972
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,990
It's 100,000 yuan!

973
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,790
Shut up!

974
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:58,630
I'll sign.
