00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,280
I think we can

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,400
plant vegetables

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,780
or something like that here.

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,070
Plant vegetables? It's a garden.

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,150
And raise some ducks and chickens.

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,070
It can be lively here.

9
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,840
Right?

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,789
You'll ruin the environment if you build a vegetable garden.

11
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,990
Look.

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,950
I think if we're going to make a vegetable garden...

13
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980

14
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,070

Thank you.

23
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,030
Thank you, Director.

24

You are...

58
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,230
Long time no see.

59
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,460
Yeah.

Mom.

61
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,920
Wait for me.

62
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,780
Before I left,

63
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
I begged the God of the Land

64
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,390
to ask him to bless me.

65
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,380
Otherwise, I wouldn't return the soil.

66
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
Look at her.

67
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,390
You even threatened the God of the Land.

68
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,630
This is the rule Granny Ma taught me when I was little.

69
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,870
She told me and Siyi when we were young.

70
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,480
She said if we were weak,

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,190
we should take some soil with us.

72
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,040
It can replenish our energy.

73
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,770
When we move,

74
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
we should take all the soil away with us

75
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,070
to let the God of the Land

76
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,300
continue to bless us.

77
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,040
Yes, bless us.

78
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,669
Dad said you liked it.

79
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I just bought it.

80
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,390
Drink it while it's hot.

81
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,150
Are you still busy with the shipwreck?

82
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,600
It goes well.

83
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,360
I've found the origin of the families on the ship.

84
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,630
It's such a coincidence.

85
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,240
They were on the same ship 100 years ago.

86
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,630
Now their descendants

87
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,200
are living in the same courtyard,

88
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,600
like a family.

89
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,670
No wonder they don't want to be apart.

90
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,360
Have a seat.

91
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,540
It's good.

92
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,320
Back then, you refused to listen to me

93
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,910
and insisted on going to Honghuai Normal University.

94
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
I was really sad.

95
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,230
After graduation,

96
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,790
you didn't want to work.

97
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,980
You tell me yourself.

98
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,030
Whose parents

99
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,860
would like that

100
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,030
to happen?

101
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,390
Seeing you idle around all day,

102
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,390
I felt more anxious than anyone else.

103
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,080
You are my son.

104
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,790
But I couldn't do anything about it.

105
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,670
My words didn't work.

106
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,360
I couldn't change your mind at all.

107
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,390
Your dad always talked to me

108
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,510
to make me believe what you did is meaningful.

109
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,510
He said I didn't believe you.

110
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,670
You proved that

111
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,000
what your dad said is right

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,150
with your persistence.

113
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,840
The history of families along the canal

114
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,320
has been ignored.

115
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,510
You have studied it

116
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,480
on your own

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,510
for so long.

118
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,440
I know it's not easy.

119
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,270
You suffered a lot.

120
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,510
You felt wronged.

121
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,170
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

122
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,790
And I'm proud of you.

123
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,550
All right.

124

I just gave you a couple of compliments.

125
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,790
Are you that easy to be so moved?

126
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,180
All right.

169
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,490

177
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,820
At first, we heard that you went to Italy.

178
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,160
We thought we'd never find you again.

180
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
never gave up.

How did you force me back then?

183
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,160
You asked me to...

The man of great credit.

185

186
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,030
after the canal's successful application for inscription on the World Heritage List,

187
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,960
Flower Street will be renovated.

188
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,510
She asked me to come back if I was available.

189
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,650
Like you won't come back if Auntie Gu doesn't ask you.

190
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,840
Do you know how much we miss you every year?

191
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,630
Every New Year, we bet

192
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,200
Siyi would come back this year,

193
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,960
but every year...

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,680
You lost the bet.

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,550
Enough. Enough.

196
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,240
Now,

197
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,510
she's right sitting here.

198
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,910
That's good, right?

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,670
It's good that she's back.

200
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,570
Siyi,

201
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,380
you're not leaving

202
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,360
this time, right?

203
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,240
I haven't thought

204
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,710
about the future.

205
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,630
I've focused on what happened before

206
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,440
all these years.

207
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,140
Ever since I left Flower Street,

208
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,240
I've asked around

209
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
on my trip.

210
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,240
Now the truth has finally come to light.

211
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,970
My ancestors did have something to do with Little Polo.

212
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,350
They were Italians

213
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,840
from the Dimarks.

214
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,320
They lived in Verona, Italy,

215
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,410
a city near Venice.

216
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,670
My great-great-grandfather's name

217
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,340
is Fidel Dimark.

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,510
To trace Marco Polo,

219
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,240
he traveled thousands of miles to come to China

220
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,660
with a business firm engaged in the porcelain trade.

221
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,270
When he was in China,

222
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,550
he wrote many letters to his family in Italy.

223
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,150
The letter recorded

224
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,840
his life in China in detail.

225
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,960
In Beijing and Tianjin,

226
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,370
he witnessed the suffering of China back then.

227
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,750
The cruelty of war

228
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,960
made him suffer and fear.

229
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,510
He tried to return to Italy,

230
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,510
but failed to buy a ship ticket.

231
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,490
During his flight for life,

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,640
he didn't give up writing to his family.

233
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
But because of the war,

234
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,220
all the letters were mailed back.

235
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,390
At that time,

236
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,360
he had a Chinese name,

237
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
called Marford.

238
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,150
He also married a Chinese girl,

239
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,890
called Qin Ruyu.

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
Their children

241
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,890
is my great-grandfather.

242
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,320
The last letter mailed to home from Marford

243
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,440
caused his brother,

244
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,220
Paul Dimark, concern.

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,030
So they decided to go to China

246
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,200
to look for their younger brother.

247
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,630
This person is

248
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,550
Little Polo everyone has talked about.

249
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,250
Look.

250
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,890
It's the one your grandpa talked about.

251
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,510
Later, we found there were four people

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,270
on the ship of Little Polo:

253
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,790
Translator Xie Pingyao,

254
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,090
Porter Shao Changlai,

255
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,730
Ship Boss Xia...

256
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,480
Boss!

257
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,510
I'm the boss!

258
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,550
And his disciple,

259
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,510
Zhou Yiyan.

260
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,420
He's here.

261
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,210
Boss.

262
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,829
Boss, here, here, let me toast you.

263
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,980
Now, the boss has changed.

264
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,720
Really.

265
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,380
Xie Pingyao was a translator.

266
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,410
He was entrusted by his best friend

267
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,300
to go north with a foreigner.

268
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,869
This foreigner

269
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,000
was Paul Dimark.

270
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,310
He preferred people to call him Little Polo.

271
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,610
At first,

272
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,960
he only said he was a canal expert

273
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,790
who came all the way to China because of Marco Polo

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,400
to inspect the Grand Canal.

275
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,030
Along with him

276
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,440
were Shao Changlai,

277
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,720
the porter he hired in Hangzhou,

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,590
Xia, the shipman he met in Suzhou,

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
and Xia's disciple and the sailor,

280
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,920
Zhou Yiyan.

281
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,640
On their way north,

282
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,070
Little Polo saw

283
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,920
China experiencing a huge change.

284
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,070
With the soul-capturing cannon he brought,

285
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,070
now called camera,

286
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,960
he photographed various Chinese people

287
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,030
in his mind.

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,030
Every scenery

289
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,510
and every dock

290
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,030
were a new experience

291
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
to Little Polo.

292
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,350
Soon,

293
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,510
Xia's disciple Zhou Yiyan

294
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,400
was very interested in Italian.

295
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,350
He studied the foreign book Little Polo brought.

296
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,550
He thought

297
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
as long as he mastered English,

298
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,790
his descendants

299
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,440
can possibly become translators as well

300
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,000
and lead a carefree life

301
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,790
for generations.

302
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,790
When staying away from the shore,

303
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,350
they sailed and cooked.

304
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,270
All they talked about were daily necessities.

305
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,590
When Little Polo had nothing to do,

306
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,070
he liked to sit on the board of the ship,

307
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,080
getting to feel the breeze while drinking some tea

308
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,350
with a square table

309
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,880
and a bamboo chair,

310
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,720
reading the Poetry Collection in the Year of Jihai in a desultory way,

311
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,070
or teaching Zhou Yiyan Italian.

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,270
He wrote his diary every day.

313
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,550
They traveled together for days

314
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,350
and established sufficient trust

315
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,590
and extraordinary friendship.

316
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
One night,

317
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,630
the ship stopped at the shore.

318
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,120
A few bandits got on the ship in the dark.

319
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,730
They wanted to rob them of their property.

320
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,780
When one of them took Little Polo's cane,

321
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,200
Little Polo suddenly stood up resisting him

322
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,520
and tried to get it back.

323
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,720
They had a fierce fight

324
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,550
with the bandits.

325
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,190
Little Polo was injured and he was bleeding non-stop.

326
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,780
Everyone had no choice

327
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,100
but to take him and run away without taking the ship back.

328
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,260
When they turned around,

329
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,330
the huge ship that traveled with them along the way

330
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,780
had already sunk to the bottom of the river

331
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,510
amidst the raging flames.

332
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,790
Little Polo's injury gradually deteriorated.

333
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,660
He told Xie Pingyao

334
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,480
that he cherished

335
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,010
the cane he always carried

336
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,350
because the last letter

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,260
that his little brother wrote to him was in it.

338
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,300
He came to China

339
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,240
just to find his little brother,

340
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,900
Fidel Dimark,

341
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,590
also called Marford.

342
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,960
Soon,

343
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,180
at the last stage of his life,

344
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,830
Little Polo admitted

345
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,920
that he had fallen in love with this canal.

346
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,260
He distributed his belongings

347
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,670
to his traveling companies.

348
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,480
On August 4, 1901,

349
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,790
the Italian man Paul Dimark died.

350
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,550
That tomb

351
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,070
stuck with a cross

352
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,220
facing the vast canal

353
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,200
is just like Little Polo

354
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,590
still sitting in the mud

355
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,880
and enjoying Chinese tea,

356
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,360
while getting to feel the breeze from the canal.

357
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,910
More than 100 years later,

358
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,850
the descendants of the four families on the ship

359
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,390
and Marford's descendants

360
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,420
met in the courtyard on Flower Street.

361
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
Maybe, it's fate.

362
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,460
The canal led them

363
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,130
to reunite.

364
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,270
The path that stretches for thousands of miles still exists,

365
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,150
[By the Canal]

366
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,700
while people come and go over a decade.

367
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,040
Little Polo couldn't find Marford.

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
The descendants of Little Polo's friends

369
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,870
[By the Canal]

370
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,660
found Marford's descendants

371
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,200
under the mysterious arrangement of fate.

372
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,450
The brothers who never had a chance to meet again

373
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,910
[Flower Street]

374
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,550
have got reunited

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,330
in this way.

376
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,130
Grandpa.

377
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,680
Grandpa.

378
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,260
Grandpa.

379
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,860
Look who's back.

380
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,730
Grandpa Zhou.

381
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,070
Siyi, you're back.

382
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,530
Why did the school get out so late today?

383
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,640
You need to work harder for the college entrance exam next year.

384
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
But don't push yourself.

385
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,190
You're a smart girl.

386
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,050
You can be admitted

387
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,830
to any school you want.

388
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,670
Don't listen to what your grandma said.

389
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,310
Your grandma has never been educated.

390
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,580
♫Far away, so far away♫

391
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,040
She doesn't understand that taking a rest is as important as studying.

392
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,890
♫The hometown I can never return to♫

393
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,760
As for studies,

394
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
you have to listen to me.

395
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,440
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

396
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,760
♫Listening to the river flow♫

397
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,590
Are you crying?

398
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,790
What's wrong?

399
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,780
Did you feel wronged in school?

400
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,070
Who bullied you?

401
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,740
♫Hometown, oh hometown♫

402
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,050
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

403
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,990
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

404
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,900
♫Now a distant place I can't go back to♫

405
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,350
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

406
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,590
I'll go find them at school tomorrow.

407
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,500
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

408
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,070
All right, stop crying.

409
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,400
Your grandma will suffer

410
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,770
♫Listening as time drifts by♫

411
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,580
if she sees you like this.

412
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,640
Good girl. Don't cry.

413
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,510
Don't cry.

414
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,420
♫The sunsets in the city♫

415
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,070
♫Hold no poetry, no distant dreams♫

416
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,280
♫Walking through a world like a song♫

417
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,100
♫From oblivion to oblivion♫

418
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,280
♫The love that passed through those remaining years♫

419
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,640
♫Without complaints or piano music♫

420
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,160
♫The coolness after the gentle breeze♫

421
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,540
♫I'm destined to be like you♫

422
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,240
♫Far away, so far away♫

423
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,360
♫The hometown I can never return to♫

424
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,230
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

425
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,430
♫Listening to the river flow♫

426
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,920
Look who's back!

427
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,960
Where have you been these years?

428
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,640
My name is Fenghua.

429
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,590
What's your name?

430
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,200
Ma Siyi.

431
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,160
What?

432
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,110
Louder, I can't hear you.

433
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,720
Are you deaf? Her name is Ma Siyi.

434
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,110
Let's go to school together,

435
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,960
go home together,

436
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,590
and do homework together at home.

437
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,090
It's decided then?

438
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,970
Let's go.

439
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,440
Go to sleep.

440
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,170
Siyi,

441
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,750
go!

442
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,710
When will you and Wanghe hold a wedding?

443
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,320
I haven't decided yet.

444
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,070
I need to get better first.

445
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,930
You're not allowed to leave.

446
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,030
This is the most important moment in my life.

447
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,150
You must be there.

448
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,790
It's said

449
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,640
bridesmaids can't be prettier than the bride.

450
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
Who is prettier?

451
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Speak honestly.

452
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,880
It has to be you.

453
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,550
Really?

454
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm telling you,

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,550
don't bring your girlfriends back.

456
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,190
Otherwise, I'll uncover your lie.

457
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,110
What's wrong?

458
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,250
Nothing.

459
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,650
Put it on.

460
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,790
I'm fine.

461
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,060
Sit down and take a rest.

462
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,740
Don't tire yourself out.

463
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,940
You are so annoying.

464
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,510
What is depicted in a poem written by Su Shi

465
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,000
is just a perfect description of the relationship between Fenghua and Wanghe.

466
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,630
"Suddenly I heard the fierce roar of my shrewish wife,

467
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,920
and my walking stick dropped from my hand, leaving me in a state of bewilderment."

468
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,920
Come on, Siyi, don't just stand there. Come on.

469
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,400
Sit down, Siyi.

470
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's drink. Here.

471
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,510
Come on.

472
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,350
Let's drink. Come on.

473
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Not with him.

474
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,750
What do you mean? Come on.

475
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,270
Here.

476
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,630
Cheers!

477
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,400
Cheers!

478
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,790
Come on. Come on.

479
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,720
Although I'm toasting with a cup of water.

480
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,600
Come on.

481
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,480
Cheers. Cheers.

482
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,870
Welcome home!

483
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,720
Welcome home!

484
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,030
Come on.

485
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,750
Siyi, have some.

486
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,310
It's freshly roasted.

487
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,000
Suit yourself.

488
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,790
Siyi.

489
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,830
Try this. It's not spicy.

490
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,590
Okay. Okay. Okay.

491
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,480
I'll take my time.

492
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,070
Are you not used to it?

493
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,750
How about

494
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,820
Xingchi cooking some dishes for you?

495
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,730
Like pasta?

496
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,240
Tell me what you want to eat.

497
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,480
I can cook anything you want.

498
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,880
When you were not back,

499
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,310
I was the female lead.

500
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,610
They were all focusing on me.

501
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,300
Yet the moment you're back, I'm neglected.

502
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,700
Why don't you leave?

503
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,000
Where should I go?

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,640
Have you left me a room in the new courtyard?

505
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,240
Yes.

506
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,150
You're still staying in the central hall.

507
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
My grandpa told me

508
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,110
to keep it for Granny Ma.

509
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,480
And there must be

510
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,810
an air conditioner

511
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,340
and a new TV.

512
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,310
Even the model was picked by my grandpa.

513
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,440
Isn't the old man awesome?

514
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,150
He could even pick a model when he has such a bad memory.

515
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,270
He just remembers this.

516
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,960
Be careful.

517
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,830
I'm fine.

518
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,610
All these years,

519
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,960
I've bought postcards

520
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,150
wherever I went.

521
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,720
I didn't have the courage to send them back.

522
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,860
So you can see a thick stack of postcards here.

523
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,030
It's all

524
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,270
I wanted to tell you back then.

525
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,440
See for yourselves.

526
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,740
Let me see. Let me see.

527
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,030
Don't grab it.

528
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,680
We all have the chance.

529
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,480
Don't grab it.

530
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,220
Our friendship is so deep while we're separated.

531
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,490
Long time no see.

532
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,140
The official account you made

533
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,260
is great.

534
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,900
I watched every issue.

535
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,880
Really?

536
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,760
I heard you have a lot of collections about the canal.

537
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,920
Can you show me when it's available?

538
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Of course.

539
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Anytime.

540
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,980
I'm waiting for you.

541
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,030
Okay.

542
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,220
Deal.

543
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,440
You're still so charming on stage.

544
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,360
But the rehearsal time is too short.

545
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,270
If I had more time,

546
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,590
I could have sung better.

547
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,270
I finally understand what you said before.

548
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,420
[To build a successful life, learning takes precedence, and at the core of learning lies reading]

549
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,940
Stage

550
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,910
is so important

551
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,340
to you.

552
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,070
Actually, over the years,

553
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,820
I've been to many places.

554
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,960
I didn't expect

555
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,710
that I would be

556
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,370
the happiest

557
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,940
and most relaxed

558
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,790
when I'm on this small stage.

559
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,050
Well,

560
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,420
according to what you said,

561
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,650
you have to

562
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,270
sing more here.

563
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,930
Of course.

564
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,780
I've promised Dad.

565
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,930
He's here.

566
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,300
Boss Xie!

567
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,400
Boss Xie!

568
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,170
Boss Xie!

569
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,060
Boss Xie!

570
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,710
Boss Xie, hurry!

571
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,000
Your son is looking for you!

572
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,960
Hurry!

573
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,960
Boss Xie!

574
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,670
What are you doing here?

575
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,070
We've finally found you. Hurry!

576
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,460
Your son has something to tell you.

577
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,400
Hurry. Hurry.

578
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,640
Lao'er, ask him to walk quickly.

579
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,310
Boss Xie, we're waiting for you.

580
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,640
Your son is looking for you.

581
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,060
Look at this.

582
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,940
Your son asked us to bring you here.

583
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
So what do you bring me here

584
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,810
for?

585
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,120
Dad!

586
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,390
Happy birthday!

[Grand Canal]

588
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,610
This cruise ship

589
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,210
is your birthday present!

590
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,500
Let me tell you, Wanghe.

591
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,720
Don't joke around.

592
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,670
Don't think I won't beat you up because you're married!

593
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,030
Is it fun?

594
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,500
What?

595
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,040
[Grand Canal]

596
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,250
Really!

597
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,890
Really!

598
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,240
What do you mean?

599
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,810
It's really for you!

600
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,960
I can also drive it.

601
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,850
Hurry and come up!

602
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,680
Come and have a look!

603
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,160
This is his kindness. Hurry!

604
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
Hurry. Let's take a look.

605
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,640
Hurry. Hurry.

607
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:25,920
Son.

608
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,100
Go upstairs and have a look.

609
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,080
This is...

610
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,280
Hurry. Hurry.

611
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,400
Don't make yourself fall.

612
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,350
Dad.

613
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,480
What's going on?

614
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,170
How is it?

615
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,310
This ship

616
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,210
is not only for you

617
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,530
but also for our whole courtyard.

618
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,100
We used to

619
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,750
buy a ship together before.

620
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,480
When we sold it,

621
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,240
you were not

622
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,460
proud of us.

623
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,480
Seems

624
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,160
you were in a daze all the time.

625
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
It's not that serious.

626
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,410
I'm not... Not that fragile.

627
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,140
Dad.

628
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,130
Now that Flower Street

629
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,810
has been included in the World Heritage List,

630
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,400
it's going to embrace prosperous development.

631
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,850
Mayor Gu said,

632
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,780
we can start with the tourism industry.

633
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,980
So we can use this ship

634
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,060
to offer catering services,

635
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,170
produce embroidered products,

636
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,830
and perform

637
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,460
small-scale shows.

638
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,310
Let me show you around the cockpit.

639
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:21,880
Let's go!

640
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,580
Embroidery...

641
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,030
We can just do it here.

642
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,460
I just saw

643
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,820
the sunset is beautiful outside.

644
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
Let's go take some photos.

645
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,070
Let's go.

646
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,760
Let's go.

647
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,920
Let's go.

648
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,880
There...

649
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,030
There...

650
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,930
There are so many electronic devices.

651
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,150
I'm not familiar with them.

652
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,590
I've never... Never...

653
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,730
I've never operated them.

654
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,750
Just learn how to do it.

655
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,110
The basic principles are the same.

656
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,960
Take your time.

657
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,000
You're so smart. You'll master it soon.

658
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,150
You're right.

659
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,550
Come on, sit down and feel it.

660
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,340
Okay.

661
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,200
It's different from your previous one.

662
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,160
Of course.

663
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,020
I can see far away by sitting here.

664
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,970
You're holding it upside down.

665
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,450
Yes.

666
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,210
Interesting.

667
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,300
So interesting!

668
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,520

670
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,280
Let's go. Let's go.

671
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,750
I saw it when I was young.

672
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,000
It can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty.

673
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,060
It's my dad's precious thing.

674
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,920
You guys,

675
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,410
come up and have a rest.

676
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,740
Let's go up and take a rest.

677
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,750
Are you tired?

678
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,340
Have some soft drink.

679
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,880
You should drink it.

680
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,440
Thanks, but no.

681
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:42,750
Chen Rui,

682
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,630
let me give you a massage.

683
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,510
You must be exhausted.

684
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,030
Let me give you a massage.

685
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,000
Go away.

686
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,610
The central hall of the new courtyard seems much bigger than this.

687
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,870
It's much higher.

688
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,320
Yes, we demolished and rebuilt it.

689
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,580
The foundation has also been reinforced.

690
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,500
If you have any opinions,

691
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,030
remember to tell us in advance.

692
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,920
Or it'll be too late to make any changes after we move in.

693
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,960
I don't have any opinions.

694
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,080
What about you?

695
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,199
Me?

696
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,630
Why?

697
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,780
You don't want to live in the courtyard?

698
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,590
Fine.

699
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,170
If you don't, I'll stay with Siyi.

700
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,030
You can sleep in your museum as you want.

701
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,870
What happened?

702
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:26,679
When did that happen?

703
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,550
Why would Siyi

704
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,030
be willing to be with you?

705
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,230
What did you do behind our backs?

706
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll give you a rear naked choke!

707
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,960
Shameless!

Show us the evidence!

713
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,230
Enough! Enough!

714
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,320
When was that?

715
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,250
Stop it. Stop it.

716
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,000
Be careful not to spill it.

717
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,590
You should

718
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,510
think about

719
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,400
what you haven't done

720
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,320

721
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,880
I remember something.

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,710

when she came here,

725
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
she dug some soil from the dock of Linqing

726
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,280
and sprinkled it

727
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,550
under that tree.

728
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,800
I want to take it away.

729
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,920
Otherwise,

730
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,840
Grandma will get lost.

731
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,910
Turn around.

00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,900
Fenghua, slow down!

948
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,580
Xingchi!

949
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,280
Run faster!

950
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,800
Thank you for coming to the wedding of the groom Xie Wanghe

951
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,360
and the bride Xia Fenghua.

952

Now, please applaud

953
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,280
to welcome the beautiful bride!

954
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,830
♫Inexplicable and strange♫

955
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,410
♫I can't both love you and let you go♫

956
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,040
♫I want to say something but keep silent♫

957
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,190
♫Just quietly listening to my heart thudding♫

958
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,760
Okay. Bride and groom, please get ready.

959
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,730
♫But you don't know♫

960
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,440
Then I have a question

961
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,430
♫When I turn around, my eyes water too♫

962
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,190
for the bride and groom.

963
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,060
The groom Xie Wanghe,

964
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,670
will you marry the beautiful Miss Xia Fenghua,

965
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,870
♫I was already giving my all♫

966

♫To maintain a final bit of dignity♫

967
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,240
whether in poverty or wealth,

968
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,720
and never be separated from her?

969
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,510
♫Fortunately♫

970
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,090
♫You once gave me a warm hug♫

971
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,880
Yes, I do.

972
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,280
The bride Xia Fenghua,

973
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,240
♫Unfortunately♫

974

♫How can I decide♫

977
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
whether in poverty or wealth,

978
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,620
♫Which is messier♫

979
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,440
♫The beginning or the end?♫

980
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,960
and never be separated from him?

981
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,830
♫Both are unforgettable♫

982
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,190

Great!

987
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,690
♫How could you leave me so heartbroken♫

992
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,920
♫Maybe it's a relief that we're not meant for each other♫

993
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,280
Should the bride and groom

994

♫No need to suffer too long♫

995
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,670
