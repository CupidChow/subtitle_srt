There's no rush.

193
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,460
Let me...

194
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,740
take care of matters

195
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,550
in Beijing.

196
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,830
Then I'll come home.

197
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,630
Fenghua.

198
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,480
This is a serious matter.

199
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,180
Don't just joke about it.

200
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,020
You have to think carefully.

201
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,360
Don't worry.

202
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,530
It's not that complicated.

203
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,760
Soon,

204
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,270
I'll deliver myself back to you

205
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,490
as an urgent package.

206
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm hanging up.

207
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,600
Fenghua just said

208
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,810
she doesn't want to work in Beijing anymore.

209
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,150
She wants to come back.

210
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,090
Did something happen to her company?

211
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,600
She didn't mention that.

212
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,510
She just said she missed home.

213
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,080
Hello, Mr. Qiu.

214
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,920
Mr. Xie!

215
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,420
Your buddy is going too far.

216
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,390
Which buddy are you talking about?

217
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,390
Shao Xingchi.

218
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,840
As the Chief of Station 203,

219
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,980
he actually allows the delivery riders under him

220
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,980
to only take 30 orders a day.

221
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,470
The rest of the orders are all dumped on Stations 202 and 204.

222
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,160
What's the deal?

223
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,460
Are the riders at Station 203 more precious than others?

224
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,350
Do the lives of the riders in

225
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,870
other areas no longer matter?

226
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,710
Mr. Qiu,

227
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,310
you're in charge of

228
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,940
after-sales service.

229
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,600
If Station 203 has been negligent in their work,

230
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,030
you can take action with

231
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,270
the company's policies.

232
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,330
Alright,

233
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,600
I will definitely take action as per

234
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,720
the company's regulations.

235
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,900
But Chief Shao

236
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,790
is your best friend, Mr. Xie.

237
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,620
If I'm going to deal with him,

238
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,220
I should let you know first.

239
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,860
I stand by my words.

240
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,730
Any matters related to the company's business

241
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,530
must be handled according to the rules.

242
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,480
Alright.

243
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,630
With your word,

244
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,050
I'll do as planned.

245
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,600
When the time comes,

246
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,530
if I handled it too harshly,

247
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,500
please...

248
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,080
don't blame me for being inconsiderate.

249
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,810
Next time when you come into my office,

250
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,400
remember to knock.

251
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,590
What are you looking at?

252
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,710
Don't you have work to do?

253
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,440
Come.

254
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,320
I bought some snacks for everyone.

255
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,030
Come, come,

256
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,550
Thank you, boss.

257
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,490
Here.

258
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,990
Take whatever you like.

259
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,630
Thank you, boss.

260
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,270
It's nothing.

261
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,320
Share it around.

262
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,790
-Mr. Xie.
-Mr. Xie.

263
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,120
Share these too.

264
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,520
Don't drop them.

265
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
What's wrong?

266
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,430
You tell me what's wrong.

267
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,150
Didn't we agree before

268
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,150
that I'm in charge of Station 203?

269
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,890
Everything will be done according to my rules.

270
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,260
You won't change your rules

271
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,120
even if they're wrong?

272
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,670
I know our performance isn't ideal right now,

273
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,290
but I have my own plans.

274
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,110
I believe you have a backup plan,

275
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,300
but do the delivery riders believe it?

276
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,510
When everyone leaves,

277
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,550
what good is your backup plan?

278
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,960
If we follow the company's approach,

279
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,040
everything will be in chaos.

280
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,690
That's because you've spoiled them.

281
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,190
Do you know how much effort we've put in

282
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,800
to get the delivery riders used to to the current delivery pace?

283
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,800
And you?

284
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,910
People work to earn a living.

285
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,240
We're not here for a vacation.

286
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,610
If you think I'm not doing a good job,

287
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,900
then replace me as the station chief.

288
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,410
Cut to the chase.

289
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,040
You know how much lower

290
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,010
the income of Station 203's riders is compared to

291
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,109
other stations, right?

292
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,329
When we come out to work,

293
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,420
when we take on a job,

294
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
it's to make money.

295
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,300
You can't be opposing against the mainstream.

296
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,400
Do you know how much pressure

297
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,069
a delivery rider faces in a day?

298
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,260
Running on the streets day and night,

299
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,980
only to be scolded by customers and merchants,

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,560
and also by the pedestrians on the road.

301
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,800
If there's even one order cancellation, bad review, or complaint,

302
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,680
the company imposes a penalty.

303
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,640
What can the delivery riders do?

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,180
Do they deserve to be treated as less than human?

305
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,860
Then what do you expect the company to do?

306
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,670
If we're slower than others,

307
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,070
if merchants and customers are dissatisfied with us,

308
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,900
how can we compete with others?

309
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,120
Competition, competition.

310
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,330
Those two words are enough to give me a headache!

311
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,660
The market is so big.

312
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,080
Must we fight for first place?

313
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,960
Do we really have to fight to death over this?

314
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,390
We grew up by the canal.

315
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,070
There are so many ships in the canal.

316
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,880
Some ships sail fast,

317
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,790
some sail slow.

318
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,640
I've never seen a slow-moving ship get eliminated.

319
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,910
That's because they have different shipping lanes.

320
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,240
Now we're in the same lane.

321
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
You may not have personally experienced

322
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,730
the all-out business war in the past two years,

323
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,920
but I have.

324
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,440
Do you know how many companies

325
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,430
went bankrupt in that competition?

326
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,030
The reason Bee survived is due to

327
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,230
the joint efforts of hundreds of thousands of employees and delivery riders.

328
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,770
Once we fail in the competition,

329
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,510
hundreds of thousands of people will instantly lose their jobs.

330
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,730
I believe at that time,

331
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,030
no one will care about

332
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,100
your concern and sympathy for them.

333
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,790
They will only complain about

334
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,730
the management's incompetence!

335
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,730
I believe everyone is aware of

336
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,980
[To be self-aware, to self-improve, to self-enhance, to self-develop]

337
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,220
the current situation of Station 203.

338
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,380
I'm here today

339
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,670
for nothing else

340
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,280
but to change the rules.

341
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,380
Starting from this month,

342
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,730
Station 203

343
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,920
must align and keep up

344
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
with other areas.

345
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,690
The goals are to

346
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,000
ensure that the delay rate stays below 5%,

347
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,290
and receive no negative reviews or complaints.

348
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,440
If this is achieved,

349
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,690
performance bonuses will be doubled.

350
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,770
If this is not achieved,

351
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,080
Station 203

352
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
will be dissolved immediately

353
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,230
and merged with Stations 202 and 204.

354
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,100
Additionally,

355
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,710
the delivery rider with the lowest number of orders

356
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,560
will be fired immediately.

357
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,550
This place is not bad.

358
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,600
Boss, one bowl of noodles, please.

359
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,670
To go.

360
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,250
Okay.

361
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,000
Bro?

362
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,700
Here to pick up an order?

363
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,440
No, I'm done for the day.

364
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,780
I was thinking of getting a bowl of noodles to tide me over.

365
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,050
Come have a drink.

366
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,590
No thanks.

367
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,010
I have to give a summary report to the higher-ups later.

368
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,860
Come on.

369
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,420
Have a drink.

370
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,870
One drink won't hurt.

371
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,780
Cheers.

372
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,180
Cheers.

373
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,810
Here, eat up.

374
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,610
These have been grilled.

375
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,830
Bro.

376
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
You don't have to feel bad.

377
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,700
Personally, we understand your good intentions.

378
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,900
Everyone sings praises of you as a person.

379
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll get angry at anyone who says otherwise.

380
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,220
Back then in the karaoke room,

381
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,270
when I was being bullied by a room full of customers,

382
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,550
you jumped in to help me with

383
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,720
the drinking when you couldn't stand it,

384
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,790
only to end up getting beaten.

385
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,510
Of course.

386
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm your boss and you're my employee.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,720
How could I just watch you get bullied?

388
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,600
Bro.

389
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,920
All of us are aware of your kindness.

390
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,850
But you're just...

391
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,180
too nice.

392
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,940
You're always thinking about what's best for us,

393
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
but it's overly...

394
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,930
It's a bit unrealistic...

395
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,510
and disconnected from reality.

396
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,670
You think I'm wrong too?

397
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,740
You're not wrong.

398
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,750
Mr. Xie was wrong.

399
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,860
Then why don't you support me?

400
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,030
We're poor.

401
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,720
We're terrified of being poor.

402
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,780
Bro.

403
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,600
In our line of work,

404
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,720
we work from dawn to dusk,

405
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,070
and if we see a few hundred more

406
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,440
in our account when we get home,

407
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,670
that makes us happy.

408
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,680
No matter how hard or tiring the work is,

409
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,680
seeing the money in our wallet increase

410
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,940
gives us peace of mind.

411
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,830
Bro.

412
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,090
Let me put it bluntly.

413
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,000
Take me as an example.

414
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,920
If anyone tries to stop me from making money,

415
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,790
I'll get angry with them,

416
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,440
even if they truly mean well for me.

417
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,680
Aren't you afraid of working yourself to death?

418
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,070
If I really can't take it anymore,

419
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,510
I'll just lie down.

420
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,410
It's still better than dying poor.

421
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,000
A few years ago, before I came to Beijing,

422
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,350
I was full of ambition.

423
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,100
I thought since I was capable, smart and diligent.

424
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,280
I thought I'd make something of myself in just a few years.

425
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,720
But now, after all this time,

426
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,700
I still have nothing.

427
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,690
Every day, I still have to squeeze onto buses

428
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,680
and subways,

429
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,280
and sleep in a basement.

430
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,760
Every time I see the lights

431
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,890
in countless residential areas,

432
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,780
lit up by countless lamps,

433
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,720
I realised not a single one belongs to me.

434
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,370
In Beijing,

435
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,850
people like us

436
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,060
are destined to be a passerby.

437
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,980
If one day

438
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,930
I must leave,

439
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,570
I hope that

440
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,180
people will bury me here.

441
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,780
Come.

442
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,100
Have some tea.

443
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,020
Uncle,

444
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,030
you don't have to be so polite.

445
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,050
Haikuo and I were classmates.

446
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,060
In terms of seniority,

447
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,730
I'm a whole generation after you.

448
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,480
Is Haikuo doing well in Beijing?

449
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,220
Quite well.

450
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,530
He's a programmer in the same company as Wanghe.

451
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,390
Which company?

452
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,050
It's called...

453
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,750
Bee.

454
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
The food delivery one.

455
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,070
That's a big company

456
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,320
worth tens of billions.

457
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,070
It looks like Haikuo is thriving.

458
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,590
No matter how much money there is, it has nothing to do with them.

459
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,880
It's not theirs anyway.

460
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
Can't compare to you,

461
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,480
right?

462
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,880
I'm just a small business owner.

463
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,990
I haven't seen much of the world.

464
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,410
I am just doing some small local business.

465
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,450
But,

466
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,960
I came today

467
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,350
to discuss a great opportunity with you, Uncle.

468
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
You see,

469
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,550
with our Grand Canal

470
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,030
becoming a World Heritage Site,

471
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,150
Huaiyang cuisine is in high demand.

472
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,250
A few days ago,

473
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,930
the city leaders gave me an idea.

474
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,020
They want to establish

475
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,660
a Huaiyang cuisine heritage center in the city.

476
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,950
That's a great idea.

477
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,070
But I said,

478
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,830
having the place without the right people won't work.

479
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,350
We need to invite a master in Huaiyang cuisine.

480
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,930
But throughout Honghuai,

481
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,230
you're the only Huaiyang cuisine master we can count on.

482
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,640
We want to invite you to come out of retirement

483
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,260
and teach at the center.

484
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Only with your presence

485
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,980
will this heritage center possess real value.

486
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,550
We're thinking

487
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,330
of moving this century-old By the Canal

488
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,890
into the city

489
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,170
and bring Huaiyang cuisine to greater heights

490
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,910
by allowing more people to enjoy your culinary skills.

493
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,530
Auntie.

494
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,590
Long time no see.

495
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,080
It's me,

Ah, Liang.

500
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,170
I heard you're a big boss now.

501
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,410
No, no.

502
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,410
What brings you to Flower Street today?

503
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,410
I came to invite Uncle Zhou,

504
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,960
no,

505
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,450

506
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,270
to collaborate on a

507
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,420
Huaiyang cuisine heritage center in the city.

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
Alright, Uncle.

509
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,810
I'll be going now.

510
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,640
Please think it over.

511
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,530
I'll wait for your response.

512
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,880
Okay.

517
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,350
Okay.

Master Zhou,

522
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,870
this is great news.

523
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,200
Your business is growing.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,550
Yes.

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,470
You're awake?

526
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,750
Here, let me.

527
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,380
I'll do it.

528
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,040
I fell asleep.

529
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,030
Dad, let me tell you something.

530
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,200
You can't sleep out here anymore.

531
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,640
It's raining outside.

532
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,180
What if you catch a cold?

533
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,720
Why aren't you in school today?

534
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,220
The school unexpectedly gave us a day off.

535
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,100
Okay.

536
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,790
Have you eaten?

537
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,640
Yes, I have.

538
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,020
I'm a bit tired.

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,610

Before the economic reform,

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,770
chefs were looked down upon.

That's right.

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
-Mr. Zhou! Mr. Zhou!
-Mr. Zhou!

567
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,130
What are you doing?

568
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,850
I haven't seen

569
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,290
Granny Ma all day.

570
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,440
I'm worried something might have happened again.

571
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,440
Mr. Zhou!

572
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,170
Granny Ma went back home to visit her family.

573
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,970
Yes, that's right.

574
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,790
Her daughter-in-law had another baby.

575
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,260
She went back to help with the postpartum care.

576
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:21,970
Right.

577
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, to help with the postpartum care.

578
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,790
Yes.

579
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,630
Isn't her son dead?

580
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,630
How could his wife have a baby?

581
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,670
The daughter-in-law remarried.

582
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,980
She had a son with someone else.

583
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,190
Granny Ma is just so kind-hearted.

584
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,050
She’s taking care of someone who isn’t even her own grandchild.

585
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,910
Yes.

586
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,150
Now that Granny Ma is gone,

587
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,700
what will happen to Siyi?

588
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,300
We'll all look after Siyi.

589
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,420
Don't worry, she won't go hungry.

590
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,610
Yes, that's right.

591
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,470
Yes, we're here for her.

592
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,840
That's good, that's good.

593
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,490
Tiancheng.

594
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,350
When you sail again,

595
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,780
bring a crucian carp for Granny Ma.

596
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,360
That fish

597
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
promotes lactation.

598
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,290
I'll take care of this tomorrow.

599
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,200
Alright.

600
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,360
She didn't even say a word.

601
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,160
She didn't even say a word.

602
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
She didn't even say a word.

603
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,590
Watch your step.

604
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,370
Come on, have a drink.

605
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,120
Sure.

606
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,310
Come.

607
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,480
Come on.

608
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,600
So, what's the matter?

609
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,500
Zhou,

610
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,580
how many years has

611
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,110
your restaurant been around?

612
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Over a hundred years.

613
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,420
It's been famous since the day it opened.

614
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,150
Back then,

615
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,350
salt merchants from Yangzhou,

616
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,490
Suzhou, and Hangzhou

617
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,700
would come by boat specifically to dine here.

618
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,520
That small dock simply

619
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,580
couldn't fit everyone.

620
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
People were packed so tightly they could barely stand.

621
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,230
If it were today,

622
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,380
it would be at least a two-star Michelin restaurant.

623
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,420
Michelin doesn't understand Chinese cuisine.

624
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,490
With my master's culinary skills,

625
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,090
even eight stars wouldn't be enough.

626
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,800
Right. There was another time,

627
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,720
not long ago,

628
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,060
an old gentleman from Taiwan came

629
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,300
to dine at my restaurant.

630
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,840
He specifically showed me an old photo.

631
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,640
He said his father

632
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,230
had dined here

633
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,930
before the liberation.

634
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,060
Later, he went to Taiwan

635
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,640
and had been longing for it his whole life.

636
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,550
As a result, this old gentleman,

637
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,340
upon hearing that the restaurant was still open,

638
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,060
came all the way from Taiwan

639
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,360
to taste my traditional dishes.

640
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,210
Let me tell you.

641
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,530
Your cooking qualifies as intangible cultural heritage.

642
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,650
You

643
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,700
have the responsibility

644
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,090
and the obligation

645
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,540
to let more people

646
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,070
taste the dishes

647
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,590
from By the Canal.

648
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,230
Isn't it?

649
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,960
Yes, yes.

650
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,500
I heard from Yuling that

651
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,130
they're planning to open a shop in the city.

652
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,030
That's good news.

653
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,580
No.

654
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,060
I can't go.

655
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,160
I need to keep an eye on my shop.

656
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,140
I can't get away.

657
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,800
Is it really just because of that shop?

658
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
Zhou,

659
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,960
you can go without worrying.

660
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,490
As for Mr. Zhou,

661
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,160
we'll be here for him, right?

662
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,510
Yes.

663
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,830
Come, come.

664
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,770
I'll just say what's on my mind.

665
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,130
How many years have we been together?

666
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,660
Don't you consider us family yet?

667
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,890
No, it's not like that.

668
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,660
What do you mean?

669
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,730
Yan has already told us everything.

670
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,680
Let me put it this way.

671
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
Previously, Yan and Haihong,

672
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,310
along with Yuling, went to the hospital

673
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,050
to see how others care for patients.

674
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,370
They discovered that nursing

675
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,500
is not that simple.

676
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,900
It requires a lot of professional knowledge.

677
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,560
They brought back a small booklet

678
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,110
and studied it every day.

679
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,120
Look.

680
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,970
It's all densely written.

681
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,720
There are a lot of notes too.

682
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,340
Don't worry.

683
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,260
Leave Mr. Zhou to us.

684
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,390
We won't let him suffer even the slightest discomfort.

685
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,810
You won't have to worry about a thing.

686
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,340
We're all from the same courtyard.

687
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Tell me,

688
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,940
how is it any different from being family?

689
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,050
When an elder in our own family falls ill,

690
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,870
how could we not care?

691
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,090
You can put your mind at ease.

692
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,160
Look.

693
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,590
[Morning] [Noon] [Afternoon] [Evening] [Night]

694
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,020
They've

695
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,170
even laid out

696
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,290
a duty roster.

697
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,770
In our courtyard,

698
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,230
there are four households,

699
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,180
and seven adults.

700
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,670
Including of Chen Rui and his father,

701
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,900
that means we still have

702
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,659
[Morning] [Noon] [Afternoon] [Evening] [Night]

703
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
capacity to take turns caring for him.

704
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,150
This way,

705
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,230
firstly, it's not tiring,

706
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,480
so we keep going at it.

707
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,510
Secondly, it feels natural.

708
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,050
Mr. Zhou wouldn't suspect a thing.

709
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,900
Also,

710
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,600
we've created a WeChat group.

711
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,070
You should join in too.

712
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,139
From now on,

713
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,530
anything related to Mr. Zhou,

714
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,360
we'll communicate in the group chat.

715
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,100
Yes, it's so convenient now.

716
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:34,940
If anything happens,

717
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
just send a message in the group.

718
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,320
We’ll tackle it as a group.

719
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:37,860
That's right.

720
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,179
Let me tell you,

721
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,980
this is the outcome of their research.

722
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,360
Yes, I know.

723
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,190
They've been researching for a long time.

724
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,960
We'll...

725
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,230
j-just go with this plan.

726
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,480
Don't worry, nothing will go wrong.

727
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,840
I...

728
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,480
It's not that

729
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,570
I was deliberately hiding it from all of you.

730
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,650
I really just didn't want to

731
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,260
trouble you all.

732
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,610
But come to think of it,

733
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,510
your wife's got quite a loose tongue.

734
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,420
If it weren't for my wife...

735
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,600
Well,

736
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
let's not talk about it anymore.

737
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,740
Thanks, guys.

738
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,370
Here.

739
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,230
Thank you.

740
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,240
Talk about being polite.

741
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,920
Have some food.

742
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,320
Uncle!

743
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,360
Uncle.

744
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,370
You even came out to greet me.

745
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,150
You're here.

746
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,150
Have you thought it over?

747
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,100
San Liangzi.

748
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,890
I was planning

749
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,060
to call you.

750
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,880
But I thought it would

751
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,320
be better to tell you in person.

752
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,180
Please, go ahead.

753
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,310
I've asked the legal department prepare the contract.

754
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,850
Don't worry, the share distribution is well-arranged.

755
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,590
Wait a minute.

756
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,110
Don't be so anxious.

757
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,990
You need to hear me out first.

758
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,400
Regarding your proposal,

759
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,510
I've been thinking about it,

760
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,130
and I think we should forget about it.

761
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,870
Why?

762
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,230
Look at this shop.

763
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
It's a century-old business.

764
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,490
Let me put it this way.

765
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,010
Since the Qing Dynasty,

766
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,280
many guests have

767
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,790
traveled by boat for days and nights

768
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,290
just to come here for a meal.

769
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,460
Do you know why?

770
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,900
Please tell me.

771
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,720
Look at this tree,

772
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,520
this Grand Canal,

773
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,630
and this sign.

774
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,850
The guests who come here

775
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,120
get to feel the breeze from the canal,

776
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,860
and hear the hawkers on Flower Street.

777
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,440
They may be enjoying the food,

778
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,210
but it's the essence of Flower Street they’re truly experiencing.

779
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,830
So, you see,

780
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,300
the local environment shapes the local cuisine.

781
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,510
If we really leave the canal,

782
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,730
I think

783
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,080
the canal's cuisine

784
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,670
would lose its flavor.

785
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,740
So you mean, I...

786
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,030
What I mean is,

787
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,400
the idea of a heritage center is very good.

788
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,740
If you were to set up the center

789
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,000
here on Flower Street,

790
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,840
I would definitely join

791
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,970
without any hesitation.

792
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,010
But compared to the city, the customer flow on Flower Street

793
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,250
is still a bit lacking, isn't it?

794
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,940
Yes.

795
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,440
I know.

796
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,640
So,

797
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,670
you should go ahead with your plans.

798
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,690
I'll have to decline your kind offer.

799
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,210

800
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,880
do you really have to stay on Flower Street?

801
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,690
I'll stay on Flower Street.

802
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,160
I won't take up any more of your time.

803

00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,770
Look at this plaque.

943
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,440
♫Life is long♫

944
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,550
He ate right here.

945
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,260
♫No need to dwell♫

946
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,880
♫Like moonlight♫

947
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,620
♫The old times♫

948
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,030
Have you made up your mind

949
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,580
during this time?

950
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,560
Do I only have these two options?

951
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Theoretically, yes.

952
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,280
If you opt for surgery,

953
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,710
we can manage its growth

954
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,930
to some extent.

955
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:09,690
But...

956
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,420
there are associated risks with any surgery,

957
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,670
especially craniotomy.

958
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,410
During the operation,

959
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,960
there are many uncontrollable factors.

960
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,130
Besides,

961
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,940
there's a possibility of relapse after the operation.

962
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,670
What about conservative treatment?

963
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,170
This tumor will grow

964
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,420
faster and faster.

965
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,980
It will continue to oppress your nerves.

966
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,080
I've made up my mind.

967
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,340
I'll continue with conservative treatment.

968
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Are you sure?

969
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,410
You're still young.

970
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,880
You can give it a try.

971
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,590
No.

972
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,120
Instead of risking it,

973
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,160
I want to hold onto something

974
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,810
that is more tangible.

975
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,020
Okay, then.

976
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,410
Think about it some more.

977
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,160
If

978
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,190
you change your mind,

979
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,470
you can come to me anytime.

980
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,840
Thank you.
