It's pointless to ask them.

[Once there is a breach of contract, the breaching party needs to pay the other party a penalty of 50,000 Chinese Yuan (RMB).]

If you don't deliberately break the contract,

If it doesn't, Party B reserves the right to refuse.

This clause is enough then.

After crossing the bridge, we need to have a car prepared in advance.

373
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,480
Once at the hospital, she'll need emergency treatment.

374
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,370
With this illness...

375
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,840
it's all about time.

376
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,390
Start.

377
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,050
Hurry.

378
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,920
One, two, go.

379
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,260
Easy now. Watch your step.

380
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,410
Watch the road.

381
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,390
An uphill.

382
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,630
Mr. Zhou!

383
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,120
What happened?

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,870
Make way, make way!

385
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,190
It's nothing, just a drill.

386
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,110
Don't worry.

387
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,200
We'll explain later.

388
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,960
Slowly.

389
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
A drill?

390
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
Are you tired?

391
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,400
How about... I carry you instead for a while?

392
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,510
You... stop talking.

393
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,350
Save your energy.

394
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,020
Actually, I'm fine.

395
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,990
Let me tell you,

396
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,590
before, I could carry a sofa on my head

397
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,290
from the South Gate Market all the way back,

398
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,870
easy peasy.

399
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,390
Really?

400
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:02,990
There are steps ahead.

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Mom!

402
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,550
Careful now.

403
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,570
What happened?

404
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,150
Mom?

405
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,830
Get out of the way.

406
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,300
What's wrong with you?

407
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,070
What's wrong with you?

408
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,110
Hurry up, go, go.

409
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,260
Don't waste our time.

410
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,720
What's wrong with my mom?

411
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,030
What's really wrong with you?

412
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:17,720
Mom!

413
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,420
The three of us were playing cards.

414
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,350
Your Aunt Liang lost.

415
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,210
This is her punishment.

416
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,230
Are you crazy?

417
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,940
Who are you trying to scare this late at night?

418
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,870
Cut the crap.

419
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,790
Just go away now.

420
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,070
Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

421
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,230
It's fine. Hurry up and go home now.

422
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,970
-Here, here.
-Okay.

423
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,960
My goodness.

424
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
Is your waist okay?

425
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,750
It takes at least three minutes to get here.

426
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,660
Then, adding the time to find a car and drive there,

427
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,540
it'll take another ten minutes or so to get to the hospital.

428
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,400
The key is the car. We have to have it ready at all times.

429
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,210
If we only start looking for one when we get here, it'll be too late.

430
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,880
We can have a tricycle ready at all times,

431
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,920
but where can we find a car to keep on standby?

432
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,040
Granny Ma... almost weighs as much as the two of you, right?

433
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,230
That's true, true.

434
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,770
That won't do.

435
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,619
We need to get a stretcher.

436
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,750
Right.

437
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,390
I'll make one.

438
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,210
I'll help you.

439
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,349
Just in case.

440
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,200
We need to have one prepared.

441
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,040
Okay.

442
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,190
It's settled then.

443
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,220
Drill's over!

444
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,180
Let's go home.

445
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,849
Let's go.

446
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,859
Hold her, hold her.

447
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm holding her.

448
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,940
Fenghua, dinner's ready!

449
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,730
You startled me.

450
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,390
What's going on with you?

451
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,200
Mom, sit down first.

452
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,290
What's going on?

453
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,880
What's all this about?

454
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,620
Open it and take a look.

455
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,490
Where did you get it?

456
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,560
I earned it.

457
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,850
How did you earn it?

458
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,300
Guess.

459
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,040
Stop teasing and just tell me.

460
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,140
Wasn't there a photographer at the stall the other day?

461
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
I signed a contract with him

462
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,830
to be an advertising model.

463
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,460
This is the signing bonus.

464
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,280
[Haizi Model Agency Contract]

465
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,850
This is the contract.

466
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,400
Don't worry.

467
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,480
I've gone through it carefully.

468
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,510
Everything's legitimate.

469
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,050
You stay put.

470
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,760
I'll deal with you when I get back.

471
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,520
Mom, where are you going?

472
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,460
Haizi Modeling Agency?

473
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,400
[Haizi Model Agency Contract]

474
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,860
They must be out of their minds.

475
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,240
Is there...

476
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,710
is there something fishy with this contract?

477
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,630
See? I knew

478
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,190
there had to be something fishy with this contract.

479
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,520
They signed Fenghua as their model

480
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,920
and gave her a 10,000 yuan signing bonus?

481
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,020
They must be either crazy or blind.

482
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,030
Auntie.

483
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,870
Don't say anything else.

484
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,790
To each their own.

485
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,620
We're asking you to look over the contract

486
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,160
and see if there are any traps in it.

487
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,520
Take a close look at it.

488
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,060
Auntie, Fenghua is quite pretty.

489
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,690
Come on, take a look.

490
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,390
[Haizi Model Agency Contract]

491
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,350
At face value, there doesn't seem to be any problem with this contract.

492
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,830
The contract states that the work arranged by Party A must be legal.

493
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,990
With this clause,

494
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,770
Fenghua won't be at too much risk.

495
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,630
Is that so?

496
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,880
Then I can rest assured.

497
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,100
However...

498
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,130
there's a...

499
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,160
50,000 RMB penalty clause for breach of contract.

500
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,640
If we ever breach the contract,

501
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,890
then we'll have to pay the penalty.

502
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,630
Here.

503
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,330
50,000 yuan?

504
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,040
50,000 yuan...

505
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,220
Where am I supposed to find 50,000 yuan for her?

506
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,690
Auntie,

507
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,300
as long as she doesn't actively terminate the contract with them,

508
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,490
she won't need to pay any penalties.

509
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,470
If Fenghua can really make money from this,

510
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,710
then she should go ahead and do it.

511
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,590
800 yuan per ad.

512
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,050
With Fenghua's qualifications,

513
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,670
where else could she earn that much money?

514
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,310
What if they're scammers?

515
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,300
We need to look into that.

516
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,120
When Fenghua goes there next time,

517
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,270
I'll go with her.

518
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,520
Let's see how it goes and then decide.

519
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,960
That's great.

520
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm so glad you'll be with her.

521
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,620
You don't need to worry.

522
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,510
I'm going to do my homework now.

523
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,390
Okay, okay.

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,710
See?

525
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,990
Wanghe never gives us anything to worry about.

526
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,020
What's wrong?

527
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,110
Are you scared by this?

528
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,830
Leave me alone. I'm annoyed.

529
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,960
Alright, then.

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,190
Then, I'll spend...

531
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,210
this money myself.

532
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,890
In your dreams.

533
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,660
What?

534
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,790
Can't I spend the money I earned myself?

535
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,070
What do you want to buy?

536
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,700
A phone.

537
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,030
The latest model.

538
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,280
Is that really necessary?

539
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,390
For my dad.

540
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,490
Your dad already has a phone.

541
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,230
He's been using

542
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,470
that old Nokia for years.

543
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,350
It's embarrassing.

544
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,570
Get him a new one

545
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,890
so that he'll have face wherever he goes.

546
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,180
And I'll get you a new watch too.

547
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,670
Your old one keeps breaking down and needing repairs.

548
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,030
And the case is all worn out.

549
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,590
What about yourself?

550
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,710
I want a lipstick,

551
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,550
150 yuan.

552
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,190
Anything else?

553
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,870
That's all.

554
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,270
The watch and phone already cost several thousand yuan.

555
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,390
There's not much money left.

556
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,110
We're not buying anything.

557
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,020
I'll save all the money for you as your dowry.

558
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,510
No way!

559
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,850
I finally have a chance to prove myself for once.

560
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,870
Can you just let me have my moment?

561
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,350
Later, when you're out on the street

562
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,250
and someone asks you,

563
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,290
"You got a new watch?"

564
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,540
"My daughter bought it for me."

565
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,620
How wonderful is that?

566
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,870
Okay.

567
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,310
I'll get a new watch then.

568
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,280
But we don't need to buy a new phone for your dad.

569
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,160
He doesn't have much business to do.

570
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,270
He doesn't need it.

571
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,950
No, we must get him a new one.

572
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,560
Later, when my dad gets a new phone

573
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,600
and shows it off in front of Uncle Xie.

574
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,150
"Look, look."

575
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,470
"My daughter bought this for me."

576
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,270
"Let your son buy you a new cell phone someday, huh?"

577
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,640
Then Wanghe will get another beating.

578
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,480
You bad girl.

579
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,960
Remember.

580
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,100
In the future, for any matter,

581
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,370
always discuss it with your family first.

582
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,100
I'm afraid you'll be taken advantage of.

583
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Did you hear me?

584
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm being serious here.

585
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,100
Your dad is here to support the family.

586
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
We don't need you to do that.

587
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,220
I know, I know.

588
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,030
Boss.

589
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,860
Come on.

590
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,140
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,050
Your liver doesn't hurt anymore?

592
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,450
Not afraid of your wife scolding you anymore?

593
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,900
Let her scold me if she wants.

594
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,660
Well, let's drink first.

595
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,470
Come on, come on.

596
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,210
The heck with it. I'm already like this.

597
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,770
Have you lost your spirit?

598
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,440
It's just the beginning.

599
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,580
All of these setbacks...

600
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,270
are all temporary.

601
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,500
It's okay if we just can't

602
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,200
get the money back.

603
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,980
We can always earn more, right?

604
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,430
These days, I keep feeling that... the...

605
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,200
the Grand Canal...

606
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,660
is finished.

607
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,190
Have you noticed?

608
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,150
These days,

609
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,950
there are fewer and fewer ships on the river,

610
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,630
while the cars on the highway

611
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,390
are increasing day by day.

612
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,950
I'm getting...

613
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,260
really anxious.

614
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,350
I'm in a complete panic.

615
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,460
Let me tell you.

616
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,080
This is all... all temporary.

617
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,600
It will pass.

618
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,670
Right?

619
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,650
Mr. Zhou said

620
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,070
that this Grand Canal

621
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,490
was dug since the Spring and Autumn period.

622
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,660
It took over two thousand years to complete it.

623
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,080
It's witnessed so many dynasties

624
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,070
and supported so many people.

625
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,690
As long as we don't give up on it,

626
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
I firmly believe

627
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,800
that this canal will also not give up on us.

628
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,510
I hope it's like that too.

629
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,810
Right?

630
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,620
You know, I've been following you since we were kids.

631
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,880
Well, whatever we do, you've always called the shots.

632
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,070
You make all the big decisions and major ideas,

633
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,390
and I just follow your lead.

634
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,770
I'll do whatever you say.

635
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,120
But...

636
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,570
but now I'm really starting to feel...

637
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,550
feel like I can't hold on much longer.

638
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,990
Just think about how many days we've fallen behind

639
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,550
on paying the dividends we owe to each family.

640
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,510
We all live in the same compound,

641
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,750
seeing each other every day.

642
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,390
My family's living expenses are about to run out.

643
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,730
Next year, Fenghua will be taking the college entrance exam.

644
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,610
If she doesn't get in, that's fine.

645
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,290
But what if she does?

646
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,880
Where will I get the money for her tuition, Tiancheng?

647
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,550
You also want to sell the ship?

648
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,130
But...

649
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,030
we bought this ship to make money, right?

650
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,580
Not for sentimental reasons, right?

651
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,320
But if we don't do seafaring,

652
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,230
what are we going to do?

653
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
Tiancheng,

654
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,700
look...

655
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,080
your destiny is tied to the water.

656
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,820
Can't we find a place by the river...

657
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,430
and do some fish farming or something?

658
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,410
My brother-in-law knows an expert from Shanghai.

659
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,400
He said

660
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,580
that raising eels or turtles can make money.

661
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,390
At the very least,

662
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,940
we could set up a fish pond

663
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,820
and start a farmstay.

664
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,140
That's still better than this

665
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,730
half-dead state we're in now, right?

666
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,440
Mom.

667
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,270
Your waist hasn't recovered yet. Why are you running?

668
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,750
See? You're in pain again.

669
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,300
You need to wear this back brace even when you sleep at night.

670
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,460
Won't that give me a rash around my waist?

671
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,520
That's still better than a sore back, isn't it?

672
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,240
The doctor said...

673
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,260
that if you don't rest,

674
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,420
your waist will be easily affected by the cold.

675
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,630
Stop worrying about me.

676
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,130
If you have this much spare time,

677
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,900
go hit the books.

678
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,970
Are you feeling better?

679
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,740
Much better.

680
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,590
It's just that I can't do

681
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,320
any heavy work for a while.

682
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,020
I'll need to rest for a while.

683
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Come and eat.

684
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,300
Alright.

685
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,590
Then you should rest.

686
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,050
Take it as a break.

687
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,630
There's not much business on the streets lately anyway.

688
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,750
You drink first.

689
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,780
There are more dishes coming.

690
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,810
How much money do we have left at home?

691
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,060
Not much.

692
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,360
Why do you ask?

693
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,990
Didn't Chen Bo publish a book?

694
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,670
So, I'm planning to self-publish one.

695
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,470
Self-publish?

696
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,220
I was just thinking...

697
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,890
you see...

698
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,740
our son will be going to college next year, right?

699
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,970
Shouldn't we save more money for him?

700
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,710
Forget it.

701
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,630
I'll go chase Boss Xie for our dividend.

702
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,010
No, no, no.

703
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,160
If he hasn't given it, it means he's in a tough spot.

704
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,110
If he is earning money,

705
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,430
hasn't he already given us?

706
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,790
Don't go.

707
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,190
No, but he can't always be in a tight spot.

708
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,520
How long has he owed us now?

709
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,460
If he really had no business, I wouldn't say anything.

710
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,910
But Boss Xie,

711
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,670
he's shipping trip by trip.

712
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,110
If he's not making money,

713
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,310
why is he bothering with all of this?

714
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,100
He might as well sell the ship.

715
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,160
Listen to me.

716
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
I've thought it through.

717
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,430
I'll learn embroidery.

718
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,910
Once I get the hang of it, I can earn money.

719
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,490
How long will that take?

720
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,560
I've asked around.

721
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,060
There's a big demand in the market.

722
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,100
As long as the quality is good,

723
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,030
we won't have to worry about selling.

724
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,910
I need cash now!

725
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,390
Besides, it's Xie who owes us!

726
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,630
Since when did the debtors get to call the shots?

727
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,090
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

728
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,640
You...

729
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,110
Come...

730
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,510
Mom.

731
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,290
You've strained your back again?

732
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,240
Go sit down, quick.

733
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,310
Easy, easy.

734
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,560
Pay attention. What's on your mind?

735
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,870
You're spilling it everywhere.

736
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,930
What are you thinking about?

737
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,020
About Fenghua's contract,

738
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,600
the more I think about it, the more it doesn't feel right.

739
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,660
Why does it not feel right?

740
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,800
If Siyi signed a contract to be a model, I'd believe it.

741
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,020
Fenghua...

742
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,580
What about her?

743
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,060
Are you saying Fenghua isn't beautiful?

744
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,910
She's rustic.

745
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,450
As if you're so fashionable.

746
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,690
Then why didn't they sign you?

747
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,340
I don't make a living off my looks.

748
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,760
Then what do you make a living off?

749
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,740
Your ability?

750
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,020
Haihong.

751
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,320
Uncle Shao.

752
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,090
Wanghe,

753
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,380
is your dad home?

754
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,110
He's not.

755
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,290
Do you need to see him for something?

756
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,260
No, no, no.

757
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,130
Mr. Shao.

758
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,080
I'll have our Xie find you when he gets back.

759
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,900
Okay.

760
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,110
I'll be off then.

761
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,310
What's the matter?

762
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,070
He came for his dividends.

763
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,050
We can't really blame him.

764
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,070
This time...

765
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,880
it's really been dragged out for far too long.

766
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,960
If I were your father,

767
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,280
I'd be too embarrassed to come home.

768
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,160
Don't always be at odds with Yan.

769
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,150
Alright, alright.

770
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,950
Right?

771
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,430
Yes, yes.

772
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,200
Boss.

773
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,170
Mr. Shao.

774
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,350
My dad is back.

775
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,200
Well...

776
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,750
Light-headed.

777
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,860
Boss?

778
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,740
Well...

779
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,760
Lao'er?

780
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,470
You go back first.

781
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,270
We... we'll chat for a bit.

782
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,420
Please... please go ahead.

783
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,150
It's...

784
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,110
about the dividends.

785
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,670
I'm a bit tight on cash recently,

786
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,150
and I urgently need it.

787
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought this up with you.

788
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,630
I understand.

789
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,200
I understand. I understand.

790
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,320
Give me one more week.

791
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,770
I'll definitely... resolve this issue.

792
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,950
One week?

793
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,110
You...

794
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,510
you're... in such a hurry... for money?

795
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,110
It's not that.

796
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,490
I heard

797
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,060
that Crippled Sun even sold his own car

798
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,740
and then ran off.

799
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,490
I'm afraid you'll get scammed.

800
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
Then, can you still get back the money

801
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,520
he owes you?

802
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,350
I...

803
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,200
Be careful, be careful.

804
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,960
I... I...

805
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll do my best to get it back.

806
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,270
If not,

807
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,630
I still have a backup plan.

808
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,489
You've finally decided to sell the ship?

809
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,159
I've said this before.

810
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,870
The canal business is finished.

811
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,590
If we don't cut our losses now,

812
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,290
we may really end up losing everything.

813
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,870
Are you all...

814
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,400
just waiting for me to sell the ship?

815
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,020
It's just a suggestion.

816
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,699
Whether you take it or not

817
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,960
is up to you.

818
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,489
But I think,

819
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,310
now that we're in a market economy, after all.

820
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,350
Doing business still needs to follow market principles.

821
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,110
We can't do things recklessly.

822
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,280
What do you think?

823
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,550
Right.

824
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,190
What you say... makes sense.

825
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,770
Makes sense.

826
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,310
Wanghe has reviewed the contract.

827
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,470
He said there's no problem with it.

828
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,590
Does shooting commercials

829
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,760
really pay that much?

830
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,260
Still, not just anyone can make money from it.

831
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,900
It means our daughter has good conditions.

832
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,940
They came to us.

833
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,670
If it were someone else, they wouldn't even come to them.

834
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,860
If she can make money from it, let her do it first.

835
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,070
Let her earn the tuition fees first.

836
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,830
With her brain,

837
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,870
though, I'm not sure she'll even get into college.

838
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,550
However,

839
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,150
I think modeling is just a career

840
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,810
that expires with youth.

841
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,520
While she's still young,

842
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,970
she can earn as much as possible.

843
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,870
Once she has enough saved up,

844
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,120
we can open a restaurant.

845
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,670
What restaurant?

846
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,030
With the current economic situation,

847
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,190
anything you open will end up losing money.

848
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,120
But we can't just sit around and do nothing.

849
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,110
I've already tried to persuade Boss Xie...

850
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,590
to sell the ship.

851
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,670
Sell the ship?

852
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,710
What would you do then?

853
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,530
Let's talk about it then.

854
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,590
Anything would make more money

855
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,880
than seafaring.

856
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,390
The canal business is done for.

857
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,990
We need to get ashore as soon as possible...

858
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,880
at any cost.

859
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,860
Is it really as bad as all that?

860
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,570
The fuel prices are rising more and more sharply now.

861
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,670
And labor costs...

862
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,910
are getting more and more expensive.

863
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,430
If there were even a way out,

864
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,430
I wouldn't have tried to persuade Boss Xie...

865
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,330
to sell the ship.

866
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,700
[Haizi Model Agency Contract]

867
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,830
Uncle Shao also advised you to sell the ship?

868
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,870
Now, everyone hopes

869
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,800
that I'll sell this ship.

870
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,700
This ship used to be a golden goose...

871
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,720
but now it has become

872
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,300
a hot potato.

873
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,620
Grandpa Zhou and Granny Ma don't think so.

874
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,100
They support you.

875
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,770
This is also what I feel most guilty about.

876
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,410
They trust me too much.

877
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,450
Actually, back when we were buying the new ship, Haikuo's father...

878
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,620
warned me.

879
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,260
He said that once the highway opened,

880
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,980
it would definitely impact the business on the canal.

881
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,820
I didn't listen to him.

882
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,590
I should just sell it.

883
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,210
I shouldn't let myself alone

Wait for what?

887
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,750
Give me another year.

888
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,430
I'll make money.

889
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,590
If you want to keep running the ship,

890
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,810
then you run it.

891
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,390
I'll cover the shortfall for you.

892
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,830
Look at how things are now.

893
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,670
Can we afford to wait that long?

894
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,910
Besides,

No matter what big trouble comes...

901
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,480
we'll have to bear it ourselves.

902
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,020
What?

903
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,730
This.

904
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,640
How come I have that?

905
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,520
You really don't have it?

906
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,590
No.
