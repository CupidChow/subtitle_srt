1
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,150
I now declare Decision 32

2
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,430
COM 8B.23

3
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,759
adopted as amended.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,280
Congratulations, China.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,070
When a river comes to life,

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,710
a piece of history

7
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,039
gets a chance to flow against the tide.

8
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,400
The ancient canal that has flowed for thousands of years,

9
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
in a new millennium,

10
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,430
has once again burst forth with unstoppable new vitality.

11
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,350
This era has given it a new appearance.

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,800
The Grand Canal

13
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,800
once again proves to all who gaze upon it with anticipation

14
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,470
its indomitable

15
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
and pioneering spirit.

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,520
Canal connections, canal people.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,150
Canal families, canal children.

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,590
The canal's brand-new pulse

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,710
is inspiring everyone who loves it

20
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,030
and those it loves.

21
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,560
Their fate and the canal's rebirth

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,079
are closely intertwined, complementing each other.

23
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,000
Folks of Flower Street,

24
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,630
citizens of Honghuai City,

25
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,480
good afternoon!

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,630
Good afternoon!

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,190
Now, let's have Mayor Gu speak to us.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
Great!

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,870
Hello, fellow citizens and friends.

30
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,960
Hello!

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,800
To celebrate the Grand Canal becoming a World Heritage Site,

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,310
the government

33
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,000
will organize festivities that last for a week.

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,760
We welcome everyone to participate in them

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,750
to celebrate the rebirth of the Grand Canal!

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,800
Great!

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
In addition,

38
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,910
the renovation of Flower Street

39
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,280
will enter a new phase.

40
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,150
When it's done,

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,030
we'll see a brand new Honghuai!

42
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,079
Great!

43
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,310
Great!

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on.

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,840
Try this. It's quite delicious.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Mayor Gu,

47
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,840
Mr. Zhou just said

48
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,079
becoming a World Heritage Site

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
will greatly boost Flower Street's economy.

50
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,150
Being a World Heritage Site

51
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,280
doesn't just bring benefits to Honghuai

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,590
and Flower Street.

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,400
It also brings responsibility.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
The Grand Canal has been flowing for over 2,000 years.

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,190
It's the mother river for all of us.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Each of us has the responsibility

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,870
to protect and revitalize it.

58
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,870
It wasn't easy.

60
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,000
We waited for so many years.

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
There was no news a couple of days ago,

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,840
and I thought we failed.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,120
How could that be?

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
Good things are worth waiting for.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,150
The construction of the Grand Canal

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,840
began during the Spring and Autumn period

67
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,680
and didn't end until modern times.

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,269
Countless people worked tirelessly

69
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,510
for over 2,000 years.

70
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,800
It took over 2,000 years

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,600
for it to finally take shape.

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,830
In the history of human civilization,

73
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,950
it's the largest-scale hydraulic project,

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,070
bar none.

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,750
Yes.

76
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,190
L-Let's have a toast

77
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,830
to our great mother river.

78
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,870
Come on.

79
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,600
Cheers.

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Cheers.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,830
While everyone is here,

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,230
there's something I'd like to say.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm thinking of taking advantage of this success

84
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,560
to revitalize Honghuai City and Flower Street.

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Now, the most crucial thing is people,

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,440
especially young people.

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,480
As we all know,

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,830
our young generations, after growing up,

89
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,920
have gradually left their homes

90
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,270
to start businesses elsewhere.

91
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,270
Now, the government

92
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,120
has formulated corresponding policies

93
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,270
in the hope of attracting

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,120
young people back to start businesses in small towns.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,510
As far as I know, all your children are away from home.

96
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,390
I hope you parents

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,120
can spread the word about our policies.

98
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
We'd like to have them back

99
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
to restore our glory.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Great!

101
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,870
Mayor Gu,

102
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll be the first to respond to your call.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Later, I'll ask my son to come back.

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Chen Bo's son has been

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,750
staying in Honghuai all along.

106
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,560
We'll call them immediately

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,000
and force them to come back if necessary,

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
telling them not to go anywhere else

109
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,270
and just stay on Flower Street, right?

110
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,070
Yes, yes.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,240
That's not necessary.

112
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,510
As their parents, you just need

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,159
to inform them about the policies.

114
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,360
If they're willing to come back,

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,360
we certainly welcome them.

116
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,680
But if they have any opinions or suggestions

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,870
about our policies,

118
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,830
they can come to me and talk with me directly.

119
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,480
We're willing to make changes.

120
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,590
I hope

121
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,040
those children will come back

122
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
not because their parents force them to,

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,270
but because they're attracted by the bright future

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
of Flower Street.

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Only in this way

126
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,480
will they have the enthusiasm and motivation

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,720
to make Flower Street better.

128
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,510
Great. That's right.

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
Mayor Gu makes a great point.

130
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,280
Anyway, no matter what,

131
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,800
today I've truly felt that

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,830
the Grand Canal

133
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,270
is a miracle.

134
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,840
We should all take pride in it.

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,070
Then let's have another toast to this miracle.

136
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
Come on.

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Cheers.

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
To our pride.

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,480
To our pride.

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
To our pride.

141
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,350
In the past, when Boss Xie and I were seafarers,

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
we sailed all the way north.

143
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
At that time, the places close to the river

144
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
had many tall buildings,

145
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
and business was booming,

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,909
while the places far from the river

147
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
were not as good, right, Boss Xie?

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
Yes, exactly.

149
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,760
That's right.

150
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,040
In our country,

151
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,920
the canal still plays a crucial role

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
in commerce.

153
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,630
The canal connects the north and south,

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
benefiting the entire nation.

155
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,680
Although these years...

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Haihong, what's wrong?

157
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
You're upset?

158
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,430
In terms of cargo capacity…

159
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,240
No.

160
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,120
The canal still plays the most important role.

161
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,430
I just feel that

162
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,040
at such a joyous moment,

163
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,310
if all our children were here with us,

164
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
it would be wonderful.

165
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Then ask them to come back.

166
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,480
Let's eat.

167
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,160
Cheers!

168
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,560
Happy.

169
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm so happy.

170
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
I feel like singing right now

171
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,830
to praise the Grand Canal.

172
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Too bad there's not a suitable song.

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
There is.

174
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,080
Here it goes.

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,600
The great river…

176
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,800
That's about the Yangtze River,

177
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,870
not the canal.

178
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,070
The Yangtze River and the canal are connected.

179
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,720
We all grew up by the water.

180
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Anywhere near the water is our home.

181
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,240
Why that face? Am I wrong?

182
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,070
You're right. I just didn't expect

183
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,950
you to say something so philosophical.

184
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,630
Fenghua!

185
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,800
Since everyone's here today,

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,590
I suggest we go home together for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

187
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,630
I agree!

188
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,630
Well,

189
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,600
I didn't go back last Mid-Autumn Festival.

190
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,000
My mom nagged me for ages about it.

191
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,680
Can we get time off?

192
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,510
Why are you looking at me?

193
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,270
Aren't you your boss's favorite? Like the historical figure He Shen.

194
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,240
Your words should carry weight.

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,270
He Shen?

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,510
I-I didn't say that. Y-You're

197
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,120
more like Li Hongzhang in the company.

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Is that a compliment or an insult?

199
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,240
A compliment!

200
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,750
Minister Li was a renowned statesman of his time.

201
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,750
He contributed greatly to prolonging the Qing dynasty.

202
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,440
Knock it off.

203
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,720
Alright, I'll ask about it.

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
If it works with the schedule, we'll go back together.

205
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,120
Great, Minister Xie!

206
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,790
Here, try this.

207
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,360
I don't want this. I want fish.

208
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay, fish it is.

209
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,910
Please.

210
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,750
Fill my glass.

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,910
Alright. I'll do it myself.

212
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,870
Cheers!

213
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,390
Cheers.

214
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
Xingchi.

215
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,390
Cheers.

216
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,360
Cheers!

217
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,120
Cheers.

218
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,960
I'm leaving.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,440
Take care.

220
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,510
Don't stay out late. Bye-bye.

221
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,390
Let me know when you're home.

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,390
Bye-bye.

223
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,910
I'm heading off too.

224
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,480
I'll walk home. See you tomorrow.

225
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,390
Watch out for cars.

226
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,550
Be careful.

227
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's go. You can stay over at my place tonight.

228
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,030
You want to drink more?

229
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,480
Wanghe,

230
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
what do you think of my abilities?

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
In what aspect?

232
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,150
Management.

233
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,360
I didn't have experience before,

234
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,030
but after running around for a while recently,

235
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,390
I think I'm ready.

236
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,360
Well,

237
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,030
I want to apply for a station

238
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,630
with me as the chief.

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,840
Bro,

240
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,360
you've never managed a station before.

241
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,480
Food delivery is a new industry.

242
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Every station chief starts from scratch.

243
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,480
I'm ready, Wanghe.

244
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,030
Trust me.

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,510
I'll work hard. I won't embarrass you.

246
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
I hate to discourage you…

247
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,720
Then don't.

248
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,550
I've never asked you for anything in my life.

249
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,080
I've thought it through this time.

250
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,360
Instead of wasting my life away,

251
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,270
I want

252
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,200
to give it my all

253
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,790
when I'm still young.

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,550
I'm done living in the basement.

255
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,750
I just hope

256
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,200
my life can get a little better every day.

257
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't want a drastic change.

258
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
Just a little better is enough.

259
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,120
You like her that much?

260
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
So do you.

261
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,080
Cut the crap.

262
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's do our best and see

263
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,750
who saves up enough to marry her first.

264
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,480
Alright.

265
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,670
I accept

266
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,110
your challenge. Good luck to you,

267
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,000
and good luck to me.

268
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,270
Good luck to you.

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,080
Chief?

270
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,910
Xingchi isn't experienced enough,

271
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,910
but I believe he's capable enough.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
If he fails at it,

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,510
you'll be affected.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,360
Those in Haidian are waiting to laugh at you.

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,480
If he fails,

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll take full responsibility.

277
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,840
How?

278
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I have stock options.

279
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,080
If Xingchi fails,

280
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
just calculate the losses

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,480
and deduct them from my options.

282
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,840
Let me tell you, whether a system is strong or not

283
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,510
all comes down to the order rejection rate.

284
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,670
Take Yuntu, for example.

285
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,670
If the number of rejected orders gets too high in one day,

286
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,440
the system will automatically...

287
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,200
Xingchi.

288
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,200
That won't do.

289
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,440
Take it.

290
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,750
Wanghe.

291
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
The boss agreed.

292
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
I owe you big time.

293
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,000
Alright, knock it off.

294
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,840
Just work hard.

295
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,510
But don't put too much pressure on yourself.

296
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,590
There will definitely

297
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,840
be gossip in the company.

298
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,550
Don't take it to heart.

299
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,320
From now on, you need to use your actions

300
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,960
to prove them wrong.

301
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,600
Don't worry.

302
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,670
They'll know they're dead wrong!

303
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Guys,

304
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,960
from today on,

305
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
we sink or swim together.

306
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,200
I don't know

307
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,720
how things are in other stations.

308
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,870
But here, the most important thing

309
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,630
is fairness.

310
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,480
Great!

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,750
Clap.

312
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,120
At our station, I will

313
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,270
do my best to distribute orders fairly.

314
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,270
I won't make you take orders from over three kilometers away.

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,080
When something unexpected happens,

316
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
don't panic, stay calm,

317
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,750
and call the station.

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,750
I'll handle it.

319
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,870
If there's a dispute with a customer,

320
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,600
don't panic either.

321
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,870
Calm down

322
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
and handle it according to the customer manual.

323
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
If you can't handle it,

324
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,120
leave it to me.

325
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
I won't let anyone take the blame.

326
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,320
Great!

327
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,150
Alright.

328
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,120
Don't get excited yet.

329
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,630
What if I'm fooling you all?

330
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,720
Right?

331
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
We're out here hustling

332
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
just to make our next meal a bit better.

333
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,240
Whether you're truly capable or not,

334
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,630
we'll find out after you're put to the test.

335
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,150
That's all I have to say.

336
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,720
Let's get rich!

337
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,630
Roll out!

338
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,870
Yes.

339
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,720
Roll out!

340
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,600
Stay safe.

341
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,720
Everyone, stay safe.

342
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,240
Let's go.

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
Let's go.

344
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,150
Wang Yuan.

345
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,870
You

346
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,360
are always the loudest one.

347
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
Listen.

348
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,510
I only have one request for you.

349
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,790
Don't get into fights.

350
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,870
Don't worry.

351
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,240
I'll just argue and won't get physical.

352
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,750
You can't argue either.

353
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,200
Just listen to whatever the client says.

354
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,870
If you can't resolve it, hand it over to me.

355
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm off then.

356
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,240
Be careful on the road.

357
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,840
Stay safe.

358
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,750
Rest assured.

359
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,670
You're back?

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,150
Mr. Sun?

361
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,120
What brings you here?

362
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm here to talk with you

363
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,240
about something.

364
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,600
What is it?

365
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,550
Fenghua.

366
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Lychees from Guangdong.

367
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,870
The three of us can't finish them all.

368
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,630
You two carry on.

369
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,230
Are you collaborating with Mr. Xie?

370
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,750
He's in food delivery. I'm in parcel delivery.

371
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
We're more like competitors.

372
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
How could we possibly collaborate?

373
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh, right.

374
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,480
I heard that

375
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,630
recently,

376
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,950
a lot of your people have left.

377
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
How are you holding up?

378
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
Fine.

379
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
I've been trying to hire new people.

380
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,910
Food delivery is really popular lately.

381
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,840
It pays well too.

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,840
It's not easy.

383
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,840
If you're overwhelmed,

384
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
you could consider giving that area

385
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,840
to someone else.

386
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,870
What do you mean?

387
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
You want to cut in on my business?

388
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Aren't you overloaded?

389
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm trying

390
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,920
to share your burden.

391
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
After all, we're colleagues.

392
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Is this your idea or headquarters'?

393
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,200
I think

394
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,000
we can come up with a plan together first

395
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
before I report it to headquarters.

396
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,390
No need for that.

397
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
We're doing well here.

398
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We don't need anyone's help.

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
Don't be so stubborn.

400
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,000
How many people did you have before?

401
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,550
How many do you have now?

402
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
If you can't complete

403
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
the assigned tasks,

404
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
everyone here will be doomed.

405
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,600
Don't worry about that.

406
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,070
I am shorthanded,

407
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,550
but I can still get things done.

408
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,550
When I do feel overwhelmed,

409
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
I'll ask headquarters for help.

410
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,630
By then, it'd be too late.

411
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,750
The market nowadays

412
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
is so competitive.

413
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,600
Mr. Sun.

414
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
I've always respected you as a senior

415
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
and listened when you had something to say.

416
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,240
For me,

417
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,120
this is a matter of survival.

418
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,440
If you won't help me,

419
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,550
at least don't stab me in the back.

420
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,840
You're too stubborn.

421
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
Xia.

422
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't be impulsive.

423
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,240
Think it through.

424
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
In this era,

425
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,120
changes happen so fast.

426
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,790
If you miss an opportunity,

427
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,109
it's lost for good.

428
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,349
Think about it carefully.

429
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,750
He came to cut in on your business, right?

430
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,349
He thinks he has seniority

431
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,000
and once snatched orders from me.

432
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,960
Seeing I'm short-staffed now,

433
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,030
he wants to take advantage of it again.

434
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,680
But I won't give him that satisfaction.

435
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,070
So you're just going to tough it out?

436
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,920
You won't ask for help

437
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,590
even if you're overloaded?

438
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,440
I'll find a way to recruit people.

439
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,110
How?

440
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,110
By stealing my men?

441
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you able to do that?

442
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm not able to do that.

443
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,640
So what do you suggest I do?

444
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,310
I've thought of every possible solution.

445
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,350
But any able-bodied man

446
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,720
works in food delivery now.

447
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,880
You can hire temps.

448
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,720
Let them sort the packages

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,310
so the couriers can have more time to deliver.

450
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,120
Wouldn't that cost a lot?

451
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,400
Hourly workers in Haidian don't work full days.

452
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,640
Part-time shifts would be even cheaper.

453
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,960
Is it easy to manage them?

454
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,110
Spend some money

455
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,590
and have Haikuo write you a part-time shift management software.

456
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,830
It's simple and quick.

457
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,720
Okay.

458
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,400
I'll think about it.

459
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,350
Take your time. No rush.

460
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,030
Is it sweet?

461
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,160
Yes.

462
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,440
Finish them before they go bad.

463
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,750
Fenghua.

464
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,270
You're back so late.

465
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,240
Let me heat up some food for you.

466
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,480
It's okay. I'm not hungry. I'll make another delivery.

467
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
Before food delivery was a thing,

468
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
it was so easy to hire people.

469
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
Just put up a sign, and people would come in droves.

470
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,400
Every industry has its own challenges.

471
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,880
Remember those first few years when we had to fight

472
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,000
to keep our territory?

473
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,550
I'll never forget that!

474
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,350
You were a young girl

475
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,550
but led dozens of people to argue with them.

476
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,680
They hit your head with a shovel.

477
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,640
Your scalp was turned inside out.

478
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
Luckily, it didn't leave a scar on your face.

479
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I was scared to death at the time.

480
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,960
Later,

481
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,920
when you got stitches,

482
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,510
you were actually smiling.

483
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,030
As the leader, I couldn't cry.

484
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,030
If I had cried, everyone else would've panicked.

485
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,790
We're lucky to have had you all these years.

486
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,160
You're the backbone for everyone.

487
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,590
Only you can keep us together.

488
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,030
Don't worry. Even if this station

489
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,480
were to disband,

490
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,920
I'd definitely be the last one to leave.

491
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,750
Oh, by the way, Auntie,

492
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,350
do you know any domestic workers?

493
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,720
Plenty.

494
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,720
Are you thinking about hiring hourly workers?

495
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,310
Just tell me your requirements.

496
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,400
I can introduce a lot of people to you.

497
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,790
Also,

498
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,310
would you consider someone not so young?

499
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Sure.

500
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,440
Anyone who's diligent will do. The more, the better.

501
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Okay, I'll go call them now.

502
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,270
I'll go now.

503
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,960
You're even more eager than I am.

504
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,400
Master,

505
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,830
we're leaving.

506
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,440
Everything's done?

507
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,110
Alright, go home.

508
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,590
Okay.

509
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,030
Alright, we're leaving, Master.

510
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,440
Go ahead.

511
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,070
We're leaving.

512
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,790
-Okay. 
-Bye.

513
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,070
Goodbye, Master.

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,640
Go home.

515
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,070
Don't play cards tonight.

516
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Okay.

517
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,510
Everyone,

518
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,310
I'll get straight to the point.

519
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,110
Mr. Zhou

520
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,070
was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease a couple of days ago.

521
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,310
I gathered everyone here today

522
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,070
to inform you all about this

523
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,720
so that you can be prepared.

524
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,070
H-Has it been confirmed?

525
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,840
This disease…

526
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,920
is not easy to treat, is it?

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,200
Well, people with this disease

528
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,200
will gradually forget the people

529
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,480
around them.

530
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,550
In the most severe cases,

531
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,590
they will even forget their families.

532
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,310
So we all need to be mentally prepared.

533
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,480
You mean,

534
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,350
he'll forget

535
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,000
all of us?

536
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,960
That's why we need to take this seriously.

537
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,070
If Mr. Zhou has a memory lapse one day,

538
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,790
we all need to stay calm.

539
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,200
We should play along

540
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,790
and not let him sense anything unusual.

541
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,000
But we don't know when he's normal

542
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
and when he's having a memory lapse.

543
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,550
I'll ask my friend working at the hospital about it.

544
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,640
We should observe a patient

545
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,550
to understand what this disease is really like.

546
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,880
Then we'll know how to handle it.

547
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,040
We need to know more about it, right?

548
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,000
Now that Mr. Zhou is ill,

549
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,640
can he still take care of his daily needs by himself?

550
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,630
For now, he can.

551
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,920
But we don't know about the future.

552
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,790
Yeah.

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,480
Then we need to get someone to watch him all day,

554
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,750
don't we?

555
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,630
We can't let him get lost.

556
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,440
Watch him all day?

557
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Who can do that?

558
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,000
How could this happen?

559
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,070
W-We were just talking the other day

560
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,070
about going to Italy together.

561
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,670
I was just about to apply for a visa.

562
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,270
Forget about Italy.

563
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,200
It's too far. Forget about it.

564
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,070
Chen Rui,

565
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,790
I called you over

566
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,310
to ask you for a favor.

567
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
G-Go ahead.

568
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,350
Just tell me what I can do to help.

569
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,310
My dad doesn't know about his illness,

570
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
and we don't want him to know.

571
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,790
So,

572
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,000
could you help me keep an eye on him?

573
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,070
I'm worried he might get lost.

574
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,750
No problem. We're together every day anyway.

575
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,550
I'll keep an eye on him. Don't worry.

576
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,480
Don't tell Haikuo

577
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,560
about it.

578
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,590
Why not?

579
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,200
He's in Beijing and can't come back.

580
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,480
It would just make him worry.

581
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
That's true.

582
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,270
Haikuo.

583
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,350
Over here.

584
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,350
What took you so long?

585
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,310
I waited for you for ages.

586
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,830
Mr. Zhou,

587
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,680
pleasure to meet you.

588
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,440
Welcome.

589
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,830
Today,

590
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm going to show you three apartments.

591
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,310
Take your time.

592
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,830
You'll surely find a satisfying one.

593
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,310
Let's go.

594
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,880
Let's go.

595
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,550
Mr. Zhou,

596
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,550
please, this way.

597
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,550
This is one of the best-selling new developments

598
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,590
within the Fourth Ring Road.

599
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,720
Take a look.

600
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,640
This apartment is

601
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,030
north-south facing with good ventilation.

602
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,350
It has two bedrooms, two living rooms, and one bathroom.

603
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,310
There's a lot of

604
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,070
space.

605
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,830
Look at this living room.

606
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,160
It's 32 square meters in total.

607
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
Mr. Zhou, take a look.

608
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,550
Haikuo,

609
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,110
come over.

610
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,110
The view is great.

611
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,350
Mr. Zhou?

612
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,550
Are you not satisfied with this apartment?

613
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,240
It's okay.

614
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,830
I have other options for you.

615
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,590
There's a 100-square-meter

616
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,480
duplex.

617
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
Let me show you.

618
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,720
No need.

619
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,550
Thank you.

620
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,720
I'm busy today.

621
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,640
Maybe next time.

622
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,750
Let's go.

623
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,200
Haikuo!

624
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,590
Haikuo!

625
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,880
Zhou Haikuo, what do you mean?

626
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,200
I'm not planning to buy a house.

627
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,480
Why not?

628
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't have money.

629
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,550
Didn't Xie Wanghe say

630
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,000
he would help you get stock options?

631
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,400
I don't even know if the company will survive,

632
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,640
so don't depend on the stock options.

633
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,750
You think starting a business guarantees success?

634
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,720
Then we can ask our parents for some money.

635
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,590
I don't want to use my parents' money.

636
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
Think about Mr. Du and Wenwen.

637
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Their parents paid the down payments for them,

638
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,110
and then they'd pay off the mortgage themselves.

639
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,750
In life,

640
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,790
one should have a home of their own, right?

641
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,000
Are you saying without a house, there's no home?

642
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm not asking for a big house.

643
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,590
At least let me have

644
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,920
a bedroom I can decorate myself.

645
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,240
Even a small apartment would do.

646
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,110
After we become rich…

647
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm very satisfied with the house I live in now.

648
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I don't want to change.

649
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,830
Wait.

650
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,070
Are you going to live in a rental house for the rest of your life?

651
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,270
What's wrong with renting?

652
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,200
Is life so unbearable in a rental house?

653
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,120
Yes!

654
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,200
Zhou Haikuo, if you leave now,

655
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,270
don't ever come back to me!

656
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,880
Enough.

657
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,030
Stop drinking.

658
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,750
Xiaohui isn't wrong.

659
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,830
Having a house gives her peace of mind.

660
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,960
My parents had a house.

661
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,640
Did they have peace of mind?

662
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,920
That's different.

663
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,030
How is it different?

664
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,310
In my opinion,

665
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,440
a marriage certificate,

666
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,510
a car,

667
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,070
a house,

668
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,030
and children—

669
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,510
these things all seem to be the bonds of marriage

670
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,680
that can make the relationship between two people stronger

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,440
and more stable.

672
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,880
But a truly unbreakable marriage

673
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
doesn't need any of these things.

674
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Love alone is enough.

675
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,310
Any relationship that needs external things to maintain

676
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,400
is fragile

677
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,270
and will fail sooner or later.

678
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,960
My parents are a prime example.

679
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,830
In my opinion,

680
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,790
you just don't love Xiaohui enough.

681
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,680
If you really loved Xiaohui,

682
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,310
you'd not just give her a house

683
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,070
but also your life.

684
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,750
Shut up!

685
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,720
Let me put it this way.

686
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,670
If Xiaohui got sick

687
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,990
and needed a kidney, would you give her yours?

688
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,720
Of course.

689
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,480
That's it.

690
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,310
You'd give her a kidney

691
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,880
but not a house?

692
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,070
Are you crazy?

693
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,480
You're the one who's crazy.

694
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,080
I can understand that.

695
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,200
Giving her his kidney

696
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,400
means Haikuo loves her.

697
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,070
It shows he cares for her.

698
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,790
But being forced

699
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,000
to buy her a house

700
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,310
makes you feel like she doesn't trust you.

701
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
It almost feels like

702
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,000
she doesn't love you.

703
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,750
That's it!

704
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,400
I love her.

705
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
I want to give her

706
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
a better life,

707
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,310
and I'll work hard for that.

708
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,030
But she can't force me!

709
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
It makes me feel that

710
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,880
our relationship

711
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,960
is bought with this house

712
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,550
and it's fragile.

713
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,240
Understand?

714
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Fine.

715
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
If you really break up with her,

716
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,680
don't come crying to us.

717
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,510
I'll change the locks.

718
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,790
Go cry to Xiaohui.

719
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,430
Alright.

720
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,110
You two drink.

721
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm leaving.

722
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,750
I'm leaving!

723
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,480
Go ahead.

724
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,750
I'll talk to the river.

725
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
I'm really leaving!

726
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,160
Take care.

727
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,880
Go ahead and jump.

728
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
You're not stopping me?

729
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Jump.

730
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,000
What are you going to do?

731
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,750
Dance!

732
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,320
Come here!

733
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,480
Come here!

734
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,920
Hurry up!

735
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,750
Not bad.

736
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,110
Your response

737
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,590
is faster than I expected.

738
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,920
You're young and full of energy.

739
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,070
Yuntuan will catch up soon.

740
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,640
Then surpass them again.

741
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,920
Competition is all about spirit.

742
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,160
We need more people.

743
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,920
Yuntuan's HR department alone

744
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,000
takes up half a floor.

745
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,070
I know it's been hard for you.

746
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,070
Hang in there.

747
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,880
I've already started reaching out for Series D funding.

748
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,720
Which company?

749
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,920
I can't tell you for now.

750
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
I'll let you know when it's done.

751
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,160
Mr. Meng.

752
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,640
Well…

753
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
What's it?

754
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,750
If we get the funding,

755
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
before Series E,

756
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,350
can you give my two friends

757
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,480
some stock options?

758
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,590
The amount doesn't matter.

759
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,160
The gesture itself matters.

760
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,350
I hope Bee can make them

761
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
feel included.

762
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,400
So without stock options, they don't feel included?

763
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,590
Not exactly...

764
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,350
In the whole company,

765
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,750
how many people actually have stock options?

766
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,590
I can share mine with them.

767
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,440
Just don't tell them.

768
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,750
You're close friends.

769
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,480
After you succeed,

770
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,960
buy them a nice car.

771
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,240
That'll be enough.

772
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,640
I'm not teaching you to be stingy.

773
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,000
It's just that

774
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,640
people are unpredictable.

775
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,590
Great kindness can lead to resentment.

776
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,960
Look at me.

777
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,270
I started my business in college.

778
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,510
And today, none of my old friends

779
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,230
are still around.

780
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,430
It's a hard-learned lesson.

781
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,110
We're different.

782
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,550
We're childhood friends.

783
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,720
We were neighbors.

784
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,830
So what?

785
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,670
Even blood brothers

786
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,790
fight tooth and nail

787
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,000
over a bit of inheritance.

788
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,240
And think about

789
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,070
those successful big companies.

790
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
How many can you name

791
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,000
that are still owned by their founding members?

792
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,440
Naive.

793
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,830
Son.

794
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,640
Mom?

795
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,350
Get in.

796
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,270
What are you doing here?

797
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,830
Let's go have dinner.

798
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,830
The head chef of this restaurant

799
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,160
was your father's apprentice.

800
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
The restaurant's owner poached him with a high salary.

801
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
Try it and see if it tastes the same.

802
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,510
Not bad.

803
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
I'll give you a card later.

804
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,830
Bring Wanghe and the others here to eat.

805
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,790
How's your dad doing lately?

806
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,920
Don't you two call each other?

807
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,400
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

808
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,480
We're both busy.

809
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,680
I occasionally call your grandpa to check on things,

810
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,680
but he only shares good news with me.

811
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,720
Because there's no bad news.

812
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,790
You're the same.

813
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,160
Every time I ask, you say everything's fine.

814
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
You won't tell me anything.

815
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,960
It's true that everything's fine,

816
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,280
or I would definitely tell you.

817
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,270
What about you and Xiaohui?

818
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
Why did you two fight if everything was fine?

819
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,480
She went to you?

820
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,240
Yes.

821
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,480
She kept crying.

822
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,310
It's your fault.

823
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
Why make such a fuss over a house?

824
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,880
As a girl,

825
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
she needs to feel secure.

826
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,110
You hurt her feelings.

827
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,000
Can a house

828
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,960
really make her feel secure?

829
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,200
Of course.

830
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,110
Having a house means having a home.

831
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,960
But you and Dad had a house and a home.

832
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,960
At your age,

833
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,440
you should be past your rebellious phase.

834
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,070
This is your problem.

835
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,360
Don't bring up your dad and me.

836
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,190
We had a house.

837
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,360
Life was not bad.

838
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,710
My dad is down-to-earth.

839
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I believe you didn't feel insecure.

840
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:26,960
No.

841
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,880
I didn't feel insecure.

842
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,190
But you still left.

843
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,590
So, a sense of security

844
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,230
is not important for marriage,

845
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
and it's not a necessity.

846
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,840
You felt secure,

847
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,360
yet you still found the mundane life boring.

848
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,590
So why should I pursue

849
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,710
the so-called sense of security?

850
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,960
Sorry, Son.

851
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,510
What happened between your dad and me

852
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,840
traumatized you.

853
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,760
That's not what I mean.

854
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,000
When you were young,

855
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,110
there were things you wouldn't understand even if I told you.

856
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,670
Now that you've grown up,

857
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,070
I can tell you about them.

858
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,440
I've only loved one man in my entire life.

859
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's your dad.

860
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,670
I still love him.

861
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,440
But

862
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,550
the life he gave me…

863
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,280
made me feel depressed and suffocated.

864
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,960
I'd rather face all kinds of hardships outside

865
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,590
than go back to that unchanging life

866
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,910
where I could see how it would end.

867
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,760
So,

868
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,280
your dad and I parted on good terms.

869
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,800
We both have resentment in our hearts,

870
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,670
but we also wish each other well.

871
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,030
Are you sure Dad wishes you well?

872
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,480
Of course!

873
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,710
He loves me very much too.

874
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
That's why he let me go.

875
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,960
As for you and Xiaohui,

876
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,880
I don't care about what will happen in the future.

877
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,670
If you truly love her,

878
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,190
I hope you think through a few things.

879
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,110
First,

880
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,550
can you give her the life she wants?

881
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,960
Second,

882
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,670
will that kind of life

883
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,230
make you miserable?

884
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,760
Third and most importantly,

885
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,230
after breaking up with her,

886
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,960
will you regret it?

887
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,960
How about you?

888
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,150
Do you regret it?

889
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,760
I know what my answer is.

890
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,550
You need to figure out what your answer is.

891
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,960
Everyone is responsible for their own life.

892
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,800
Neither your dad nor I have the right to make choices for you.

893
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,800
Tonight,

894
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,880
my mom and I

895
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,000
ate this.

896
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,230
Sorry.

897
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,230
All right.

898
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,670
I won't leave.

899
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,920
Don't worry.

900
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,920
Stop crying.

901
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,480
I wonder

902
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,710
if he'll break up with Xiaohui.

903
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,590
It won't come to that.

904
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,550
How do you know?

905
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,320
Xiaohui loves him so much.

906
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,150
He didn't reply to her messages for a few days,

907
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,710
and her eyes were swollen from crying.

908
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,840
She dragged me to meet Haikuo's mom with her.

909
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,320
She was so humble.

910
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,280
If you were her,

911
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
what would you do?

912
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,030
You mean the house?

913
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,840
What kind of house do you want?

914
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,880
I don't want

915
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,190
a house

916
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,280
but an RV.

917
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,280
The kind you can drive around everywhere.

918
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,030
When I've earned enough money,

919
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,360
I'll drive my RV

920
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,030
to travel all over the world.

921
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,510
Wherever I go,

922
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,760
I'll set up a tent,

923
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,760
build a fire,

924
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
grill some skewers,

925
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,670
and open a beer.

926
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,480
Perfect.

927
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,760
Where do you want to go the most?

928
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,030
The place doesn't matter.

929
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,670
What matters is who I travel with.

930
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,840
Yes.

931
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,040
What about you?

932
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,070
If the company goes public

933
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,150
and you achieve financial freedom,

934
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,880
how do you plan to live your life?

935
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,190
Travel with the girl I love.

936
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,840
That's my dream.

937
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,840
What about your own dream?

938
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,000
Dreams can overlap, you know.

939
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,710
If I were to travel,

940
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,840
I'd sail a ship

941
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,230
along the canal to leave the country,

942
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,280
cruising along the coastline.

943
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,190
Greece is by the sea, right?

944
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes.

945
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,400
Then I'll take wedding photos by the Aegean Sea.

946
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,880
They must look great.

947
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,880
Wedding photos?

948
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,760
With whom?

949
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,840
Certainly not with you.

950
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,960
You don't know that.

951
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,840
I said the shrimp is good.

952
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,670
Trust me.

953
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,800
This restaurant is great.

954
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,880
Welcome.

955
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,230
Let's drink tonight.

956
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,590
Go in.

957
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,200
Wait, wait.

958
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,710
Sorry.

959
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,760
I-I made a mistake.

960
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,840
It's not this restaurant.

961
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,760
The shrimps here are very small.

962
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,630
Let me take you somewhere else.

963
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,760
Bye.

964
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,000
Fenghua.

965
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,230
Are you still using that plaster?

966
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,110
Yes.

967
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,760
My lower back hasn't been hurting much lately.

968
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,190
Avoid heavy lifting.

969
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,510
Don't stay up late.

970
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,760
Eat meals on time.

971
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,190
Brush your teeth with warm water.

972
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,920
The foot bath water should be hot. You hear me?

973
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,710
I got it. You nag even more than my mom.

974
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,070
Bye.

975
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,760
Well,

976
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
wait for me a moment.

977
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,000
Here, this is for you.

978
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,760
What is it?

979
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,560
Read it, and you'll know.

980
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,400
"Guide for Reducing Costs and Increasing Efficiency of Delivery Riders in Haidian District."

981
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,070
Xia Fenghua,

982
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,440
I sincerely invite you again

983
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,110
to join Bee.

984
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,150
Not interested.

985
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,630
Why not?

986
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,590
When I took over this station,

987
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,590
it was almost going under.

988
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,190
At that time, we were all at a loss,

989
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,230
not knowing what the future held.

990
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,840
People were leaving every day.

991
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,640
At the toughest time, only four people were left.

992
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,630
We didn't know where the next meal would come from.

993
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,070
I was really scared.

994
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,760
So I secretly set a goal for myself:

995
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,200
within three years,

996
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,110
I would not only keep this station running

997
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,360
but also make sure everyone earned money,

998
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,440
and I'd be the station chief of the year.

999
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,110
That goal hasn't been achieved yet.

1000
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,830
I can't give up now.

1001
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,360
Compared to them,

1002
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,110
I need you more.

1003
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,670
Wanghe,

1004
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,880
I know you care about me

1005
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,280
and don't want me to push myself too hard.

1006
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,440
But it's okay.

1007
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,760
I'm quite happy.

1008
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,760
Being needed

1009
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,360
makes me feel powerful.

1010
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,630
All these years in Beijing,

1011
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,760
I've been like a wild grass,

1012
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,000
struggling to survive.

1013
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,440
Making it to today,

1014
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,320
I feel like

1015
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,110
I'm finally about to bloom.
