Just asking.

190
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,190
Last semester, he was one of the top ten students in our grade.

191
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,500
His performance is unstable.

192
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,780
How so?

193
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
His grades drop when he spends too much time with you.

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,800
If you stay away from him,

195
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,150
he can be admitted to Harvard University.

197
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,470
Would his mother be willing to let him

198
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,710
become a monk at such a young age?

199
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,670
Hello, Auntie.

-Auntie.
-Hello, Auntie.

201
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,909
I wouldn't be willing.

202
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,190
Your parents wouldn't be willing either, right?

Siyi,

209
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,150
do you have time to chat with me?

210
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,320
-Yes, she does.
-Yes, she does.

211

We're leaving first.

212
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:13,910
Goodbye, Auntie.

Thank you.

Please have a seat.

218
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,060
I should thank you.

219
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,090
You just said in the ward that you'd copy notes for Chen Rui.

220
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm truly touched.

221
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,140
It's the least I can do. He's always been good to me.

222

During Chen Rui's hospitalization,

223
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,090
can you come to live in our house?

224

227
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,180
I'll give you a ride to your school.

228
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,150
After school, you'll come to the hospital

229
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,680
to deliver the notes to Chen Rui and explain them to him.

230
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,920
Then I'll drive you home.

231

232

You should seriously think about your future.

Why don't you think about your future?

320
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,090
Given my brain, it's pointless for me to think about it.

you've managed to achieve anything

327

including studying.

If there's enough scholarship,

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,150
you could be the top student of the class.

331
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,660
Are you saying I only care about money?

332
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,340
What I'm saying is

333
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,100
if I were half as smart as you,

334
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,860
I would definitely study hard

335
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,020
to be admitted to a good university.

336
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,450
Then my parents would be overjoyed.

337
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,330
You're not stupid.

338
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,330
It's just that you always

339
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,820

Actually, I totally understand why Siyi was angry.

341
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,820
You're so smart,

342
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,110
but you've constantly wasted your time and talent

343
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,930
and made your parents worried.

344
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,860
It's really not okay.

345
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,850
You're talking about me?

346
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,340
You haven't made your parents worried?

347
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Anyway,

348
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,350
we all hope you can be more reliable

349
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,970
and put your brain to good use.

350
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,020
As for the definition of good use,

351
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
it's for you to decide.

352
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,680
When my dad drinks too much,

353
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
he would complain sometimes,

354
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,040
regretting he didn't study hard when he was young.

355
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,300
That's why he can only do seafaring all these years.

356
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,360
He's never made any great achievement.

357
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,110
I sincerely hope

358
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,230
when you're at my dad's age,

359
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,510
you won't complain,

360
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,710
regret,

361
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,630
or make those who love you worried

362
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,920
when you drink too much.

363
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,020

364
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,060
do you think I can be successful in the future?

Of course you can.

366

My son

367
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,470

You can succeed in anything.

371
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,280
You're better than your father.

372
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,910
Then how about

373
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,870
me starting a business?

I have a few ideas.

376

If any of my ideas works,

377
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,460
I can make a lot of money.

378
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,890
But...

379
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,710
I need your support.

380
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,110
What kind of support?

381
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,750
You're trying to cheat me out of money again?

382
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,770
No, no, no.

383
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,590
I want to drop out of school.

384

I won't drop out!

389
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,470
I won't drop out, okay?

390
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,430
I was just saying.

391
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,470
Don't ever say that again!

Do you understand?

399
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,690
But my dad didn't finish school, right?

400
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,760
That's why he's ended up like this!

Apart from seafaring,

402
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,420
he has no other skills.

403
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,070
His business is getting worse day by day,

404
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,830
but there is nothing he can do!

405
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,790
Look how much he's aged

406

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,500
I booked a ticket to go back the day after tomorrow.

565
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,220
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

566
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
A new drama is about to start filming in Beijing.

567
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,790
The second female lead

568
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,160
has over 300 scenes.

569
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,590
You should go audition for the role.

570
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,240
Forget it.

571
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,180
My son is about to take the college entrance exam.

572
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,670
They can't manage without me at home.

573
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,560
I've only been away for a few days.

574
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,050
My husband is about to go crazy.

575
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,130
Listen,

576
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,280
the male and female leads are both A-list stars.

577
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,580
The script is excellent.

578
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,920
The director is from Beijing Film Academy.

579
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,020
He's very talented.

580
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,490
You should seize this opportunity.

581
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,630
What drama did he direct before?

582
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,580
A lot.

583
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,860
I'll send you the information later.

584
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,790
How about this?

585
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,390
Call your husband and ask him about it first.

586
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,230
If he's okay with it,

587
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,510
I'll call them.

588
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,270
Then you go to Beijing for an audition as soon as possible.

589
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,230
Okay?

590
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,360
I need to take this call.

591
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,350
Hurry up and call your husband to ask him.

592
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,230
Go ahead.

593
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,190
What's wrong with you? You still want to delay it?

594
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,550
If you do that,

595
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,130
I'll tear up the contract.

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Master, you have an incoming call.

597
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,940
From whom?

598
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,890
Madam.

599
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,050
Come on. You do it.

600
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,990
Make it thin.

601
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,800
Don't break it.

602
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,520
Got it.

603
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,190
Okay.

604
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,310
I'm wrapping up filming tomorrow.

605
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,250
So soon?

606
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,970
I just came to help Ai Linlin.

607
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,210
It's not a big role.

608
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,810
How's everything at home?

609
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,250
Everything's fine at home.

610
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,310
So you'll be back tomorrow then?

611
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,910
Right?

612
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,030
I need to go to Beijing.

613
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,500
What are you going to Beijing for?

614
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,690
I'm going for an audition.

615
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,560
The lead actor and actress in this show

616
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,870
are both A-list celebrities.

617
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,450
The script is pretty good too.

618
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,110
Hello?

619
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,650
Go on.

620
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,130
I'm just going to audition for a role.

621
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,710
The second female lead.

622
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,590
If I don't get it,

623
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,860
I'll come back as soon as possible.

624
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,970
What if you do get it?

625
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,720
If I get it, I'll play it, of course!

626
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,770
It has an all-star cast and is set to air on satellite TV channels.

627
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,700
It's bound to be a hit.

628
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,830
Luo Zhimei.

629
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,870
Time to climb the tree.

630
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,110
I have to go.

631
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,280
Okay, okay.

632
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,320
Go ahead, go ahead.

633
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,250
Give it a good try.

634
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,450
Luo Zhimei.

635
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,840
Hurry up.

636
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,870
Time to climb the tree. Hurry up.

637
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,650
Coming.

638
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,070
Hurry up.

639
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,550
What are you doing?

640
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,680
Stop dawdling.

641
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,390
Director,

642
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,380
Luo Zhimei is here.

643
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,850
[Supo Town Cultural Museum]

644
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,790
Have you seen Curator?

645
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,820
He's setting up the exhibition.

646
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,470
Lower it.

647
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,830
Down. Down.

648
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,750
Gently, gently.

649
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,310
Easy.

650
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
Down.

651
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,430
A bit to the left.

652
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,610
Okay. No, too much!

653
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,770
Come back a little.

654
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,110
Good, good.

655
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,270
That's okay now.

656
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,910
Curator.

657
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,310
What is it?

658
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,180
Look,

659
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,130
I wasn't eliminated after the initial selection,

660
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,910
so why is my name

661
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,770
not on the final list?

662
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,950
This was all decided by the organization.

663
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,290
Don't overthink it.

664
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,080
Let me tell you,

665
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,150
our cultural museum

666
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,460
submitted two topics this time.

667
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,430
During the final review,

668
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,680
the judges felt that the value orientation of your topic

669
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,900
had some issues.

670
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,660
So, your topic didn't receive

671
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,110
a majority vote.

672
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,430
Value orientation?

673
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,400
What's wrong with the value orientation?

674
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,230
Just listen to your topic. It's ridiculous.

675
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,750
What's that about Su Xiaomei's shoe size?

676
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,960
Couldn't you research something else?

677
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,070
Why would you research Su Xiaomei's shoes?

678
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,340
Don't you find that distasteful?

679
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,070
Some people are even allowed to study the famous courtesans of Qinhuai,

680
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,630
but I can't study Su Xiaomei?

681
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,820
Let me tell you,

682
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,340
what Chen Bo studied was the history of Chinese folk music.

683
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,870
Su Xiaomei is just a starting point.

684
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,670
I'm actually studying the history of ancient customs.

685
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,980
To know what shoe size Su Xiaomei wore,

686
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,420
we need to study whether she had bound feet.

687
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,750
Regarding the issue of foot binding,

688
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,150
there are currently many theories.

689
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,820
The relatively authoritative one is that

690
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,120
it began in the Northern Song Dynasty, flourished in the Southern Song Dynasty,

691
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,390
and reached its peak during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.

692
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,930
About foot binding,

693
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,190
Su Shi held the correct attitude.

694
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,480
He wrote a poem saying,

695
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,840
"The delicate beauty is hard to describe; it must be seen in the palm."

696
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,220
But Su Xiaomei

697
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,340
had an outgoing and bold personality,

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,220
and a large frame.

699
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,830
Wait...

700
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,780
A large frame?

701
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,160
How did you know about that?

702
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,980
Su Shi once teased her,

703
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,210
"Before she steps out of the courtyard,

704
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,130
her forehead has already reached the main hall."

705
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,940
You see, if a girl like this

706
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,280
didn't want to bind her feet,

707
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,310
even Su Shi couldn't do anything about it.

708
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,110
Su Xiaomei

709
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,150
didn't bind her feet,

710
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,390
so her feet were

711
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,750
larger than those of ordinary women.

712
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,300
Therefore, I conclude that

713
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,030
she wore size 38 shoes,

714
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,220
or at least size 35.

715
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,500
These are all unofficial histories.

716
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
Whether Su Xiaomei even existed in history

717
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,050
is impossible to verify.

718
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,470
Sima Guang

719
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,790
recorded in the epitaph for Su Xun's wife,

720
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,320
"Her young daughter had her demeanor,

721
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,380
could compose essays, and at nineteen years old,

722
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,230
got married and then passed away."

723
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,060
That was about Shiniang, who married into the Cheng family.

724
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,230
It has nothing to do with Su Xiaomei.

725
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,610
Look, Mr. Shao,

726
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,750
as scholars,

727
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,910
we should make bold guesses but seek careful verification.

728
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,790
In my opinion,

729
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,940
you're only left with boldness.

730
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,500
Well, if you don't like me, so be it.

731
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,510
Can you tell me

732
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,830
who got the special grant this time?

733
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,470
Chen Bo.

734
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,220
Just as I expected.

735
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,890
It's exactly as I thought!

736
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,970
Let me tell you,

737
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,400
Chen Bo's research topic

738
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,590
is about the dialect changes in the Honghuai region,

739
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,990
and through these dialect changes,

740
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,090
examining the role of the Grand Canal

741
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,680
in our country's economic and cultural exchanges.

742
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,780
Well, his topic doesn't seem anything new, either.

743
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,370
It sounds so boring.

744
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,920
Well, why don't you come up with an interesting one

745
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,870
so that a publishing house would reach out to you?

746
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,650
A publishing house?

747
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,750
No, no, no.

748
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,520
Curator, wait a minute.

749
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,120
What do you mean by "a publishing house"?

750
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,310
A publishing house

751
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,790
was interested in Chen Bo's research topic.

752
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,510
They said his materials are substantial,

753
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,670
and the visual materials are also abundant.

754
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,750
They planned to publish his book.

755
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,350
Which publishing house is it?

756
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,290
It's from another province.

757
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,820
The contract is almost signed.

758
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,270
They say the first print run

759
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,620
will be 8,000 copies.

760
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,690
8,000?

761
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,770
[No smoking]

762
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,980
Just for him?

763
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,850
Is the publishing house crazy?

764
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,030
If you're so dissatisfied,

765
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,920
why don't you submit your work to a publishing house too?

766
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,350
Look, Mr. Shao,

767
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,300
we're both in the writing business.

768
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,410
Whether you're truly capable or not,

769
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,430
you've got to take the test.

770
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,830
You're back.

771
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,440
How was the meeting?

772
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,630
Not so good.

773
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,040
Congratulations.

774
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,810
Congratulations.

775
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,280
Are you talking to me?

776
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,280
What are you congratulating me for?

777
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,070
Aren't you going to publish a book?

778
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,630
It's just an intention.

779
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,090
It's far from certain.

780
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,600
How did the publishing house

781
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,220
reach out to you?

782
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,320
A schoolfellow of mine

783
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,640
works as an editor at the publishing house.

784
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,790
One day, he asked me,

785
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,190
"What are you up to these days?"

786
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,480
So, I sent him

787
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,330
my manuscript.

788
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,360
Unexpectedly,

789
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,820
they liked it at first sight.

790
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,830
For this kind of subject matter,

791
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,470
they'd do an initial print run of 8,000 copies?

792
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,310
Yeah.

793
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,570
I was worried.

794
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,810
The topic is too niche.

795
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,250
Not many people are interested in it.

796
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,870
Don't worry.

797
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,130
Isn't your wife there to help?

798
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,020
What does this have to do with my wife?

799
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,880
It's a book about canals.

800
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,510
The government can buy some as gifts.

801
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,500
It can sell no matter how many copies are printed.

802
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,910
Eight thousand is even too few.

803
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,700
It's not like they're spending their own money anyway.

804
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,270
Let me tell you,

805
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,110
my wife doesn't interfere with my affairs at all.

806
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,260
She can't be bothered.

807
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,440
She doesn't need to interfere with it.

808
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,630
As long as her subordinates have some sense,

809
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,790
they'll take care of it themselves.

810
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,060
The district chief,

811
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,890
although not a high-ranking official,

812
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,710
can still be useful at crucial moments.

813
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,360
Take

814
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,990
the special grant this time for example. Right?

815
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,130
Shao,

816
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,920
make it clear.

817
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,840
What does the project grant have to do with my wife?

818
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,040
Whether there's a connection or not,

819
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,460
don't you know in your heart?

820
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,750
No, no, no.

821
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,670
I don't know.

822
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,500
This needs to be clarified.

823
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,030
Help!

824
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,820
With my wife...

825
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,870
Help!

826
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,800
-Why are you yelling for help?
-He's hitting me!

827
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,870
Explain clearly!

828
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,950
Can you explain clearly or not?

829
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,910
What's going on here?

830
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
What's happening?

831
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,990
Is that how you talk to people?

832
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,050
Let go!

833
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,860
You tell him

834
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,170
about the project grant,

835
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
did my wife interfere or not?

836
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,590
You know well whether she interfered or not.

837
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,180
Let me tell you,

838
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
stop acting all righteous every day.

839
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,000
Be careful, or I'll report you and that wife of yours

840
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,220
for abusing your power for personal gain

841
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,450
and suppressing your colleagues.

842
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,720
Curator, he's…

843
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,250
Stop right there!

844
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,410
I said stop!

845
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:31,900
Stop!

846
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,540
Come back here!

847
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,080
Did you hear how he was talking?

848
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,050
You're an educated person,

849
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,040
but you were fighting here.

850
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,470
Aren't you ashamed?

851
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,230
He threatened to report me. Did you hear that?

852
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,180
What's he reporting you for?

853
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,110
Sit down.

854
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,340
Calm down, calm down.

855
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:43,880
Come on.

856
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,780
Don't bother with people like that.

857
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,260
Just calm down.

858
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,290
What kind of person is he?

859
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:03,260
[Heaven rewards the diligent]

860
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,120
Drink less.

861
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,520
Drinking too much is bad for your liver.

862
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,450
Drinking harms the liver,

863
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,550
but if I don't drink, my heart hurts.

864
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,520
Isn't it just a project grant?

865
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,720
Is it really worth getting so upset over a few thousand yuan?

866
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,390
It's not about the money at all.

867
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,950
This is about dignity!

868
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,750
You wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you.

869
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,030
We're both writers.

870
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,540
Why does he get the project grant?

871
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,050
Isn't it just because he has a well-connected wife?

872
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,240
District chief.

873
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,270
The head of a district.

874
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,070
She dares to abuse power for personal gain

875
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,350
and seek benefits for her family members.

876
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,650
Doesn't she fear divine retribution?

877
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,940
You shouldn't say such things carelessly.

878
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,700
Mind your words to accumulate virtue.

879
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,790
They don't even accumulate virtue.

880
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,790
Why should I be the one to watch my words?

881
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,070
Do you know how much effort

882
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,720
I've poured into the topic of Su Xiaomei?

883
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,550
Do you know how many trips I made to the library?

884
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,860
To put it bluntly,

885
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,200
even if I don't deserve credit,

886
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,830
I should at least get credit for my hard work, right?

887
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,060
Yes.

888
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,840
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

889
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,660
If it hurts, then stop talking so much.

890
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,460
It's not such a big deal.

891
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,960
It's not a big deal?

892
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,720
Isn't this a big deal?

893
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,370
What would you call a big deal then?

894
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,800
Abusing power for personal gain.

895
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,920
Swindling and plundering.

896
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,150
If I don't speak up,

897
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,660
I'll be bullied to death by them!

898
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,450
Dad,

899
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,950
could you please keep it down?

900
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,690
Adults are talking. Why are you butting in, kid?

901
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,500
Shut up!

902
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,150
Alright.

903
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,470
Why are you yelling at him?

904
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,990
He didn't say anything wrong.

905
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,890
And you're a graduate of a prestigious school.

906
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,120
You're as petty as…

907
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm petty?

908
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm petty?

909
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,180
I can't even criticize him now. Is that it?

910
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,550
Alright, alright.

911
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,700
What do you mean "alright"?

912
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,190
Mom!

913
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,790

914
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,320
Don't touch my mom!

915
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,220
If you get drunk and act crazy again,

916
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,740
I'll report you to your workplace for domestic violence!

917
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,770
Xingchi, Xingchi.

918
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,830
Don't yell at your father.

919
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,920
Mom's fine.

920
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,670
I'm okay.

921
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,230
Can you move?

922
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,550
[Midnight Eats]

923
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,780
Bro.

924
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:55,910
Lao'er.

925
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,790
Come, have a seat.

926
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,090

927
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,600
Get us another glass.

928
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,470
Okay.

929
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,990
You're drinking?

930
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,470
Of course.

931
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,460
Come on.

932
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,230
I... I'll pass.

933
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,090
My liver's been hurting these past couple of days.

934
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,350
What do you mean your liver hurts?

935
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,740
At most, you've got a fatty liver.

936
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,930
It's not like you have cirrhosis.

937
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,530
What's the matter?

938
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,870
Getting all delicate now, are you?

939
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,520
She... you know...

940
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,360
You mean Yan?

941
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,350
Just tell her

942
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,430
that I make you drink.

943
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,410
What's the problem?

944
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,710
Al... alright then.

945
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,270
Well...

946
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,940
Have you gotten the money back?

947
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,160
What should we do?

948
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,620
In a couple of days,

949
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,230
I won't even have money for gas.

950
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,840
Cheers!

951
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,350
Cheers!

952
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
How about some stir-fried river snails?

953
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,730
Ri... river snails.

954
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,030
Bring us some river snails.

955
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,910
Right away.

956
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,930
Extra spicy, okay?

957
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,330
Okay.

958
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,490
Yes, yes, yes.

959
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,110
Fill it up.

960
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,560
You're back.

961
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,720
You've been drinking again.

962
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,530
Well, on my way home...

963
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,420
I ran into Lao'er.

964
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,430
I just took a sip.

965
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm going to bed now.

966
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,200
Son,

967
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,120
do you know someone called Jay Chou?

968
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,750
Yes, I do.

969
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,200
He's quite popular now.

970
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,130
His songs are played everywhere on the streets.

971
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,639
One of his songs is pretty good.

972
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,739
It's called... "Listen…"

973
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,360
"Listen to Mom."

974
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,719
Go out and learn it.

975
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,790
When you've learned it, sing it for

976
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,860
your mom.

977
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,110
Okay, okay, okay.

978
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,190
You should listen too.

979
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,420
Listen to my mom

980
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
You should drink less.

981
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:43,900
What is this?

982
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,260
I'm asking you, what is this?

983
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,820
This little brat.

984
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,800
You little brat.

985
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,480
What are you doing?

986
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,490
You're not even fully grown yet.

987
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,100
What are you doing?

988
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,110
Don't wrongly accuse our son.

989
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
It's yours!

990
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,160
It's from your pocket.

991
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,270
No way, no way.

992
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,220
I... I never use this thing.

993
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,630
You... don't falsely accuse me.

994
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,710
Am I falsely accusing you?

995
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,840
If it's not yours, is it mine?

996
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,460
Our son can testify to it.

997
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,540
It's yours.

998
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,990
Xie Tiancheng.

999
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,620
What have you done?

1000
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,140
Mom.

1001
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,430
What did you do outside?

1002
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,540
What have you done?

1003
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,440
Stop it, Mom.

1004
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,190
Get away.

1005
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,750
Explain it to me clearly.

1006
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,000
If you don't explain it to me clearly,

1007
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,600
let's just separate!

1008
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,300
Tell!

1009
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,930
Whose is it?

1010
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,000
Don't pinch me here. Not here!

1011
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,100
Tell it!

1012
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,350
No…

1013
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,190
Whose is it really?

1014
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,750
Wait…

1015
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,990
If you dare lie to me, you'll see the consequences.

1016
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,750
Speak!

1017
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,740
Take it easy.

1018
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,060
No need.

1019
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,350
Just a slap.

1020
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,060
It's not that bad.

1021
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,760
Hurry up. The ice pack will help.

1022
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,970
What happened to your face?

1023
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,190
He stood up to his father

1024
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,340
and got put down.

1025
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,720
Here, do it yourself.

1026
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,640
Did he hit your mom again?

1027
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,240
My mom's back is injured.

1028
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,300
It's all bruised now.

1029
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,830
I don't know if she can even walk tomorrow.

1030
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,070
Sometimes I really want to...

1031
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,570
Don't do anything rash.

1032
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,710
No matter what, he's still your father.

1033
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,650
You know what?

1034
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,930
In this regard,

1035
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,550
my dad is a model example.

1036
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,370
Listen.

1037
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,070
No matter how badly he's beaten,

1038
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,520
he never fights back.

1039
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,170
When will this kind of life end?

1040
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,140
If today is unbearable,

1041
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,970
just think about tomorrow.

1042
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,290
In a few years,

1043
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,880
when we've all made it,

1044
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,540
earning millions a year,

1045
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,750
by then,

1046
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,420
every family will have bought a new house.

1047
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,850
At that time, when our parents gather every day,

1048
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,970
they'll just play mahjong and chat about their kids.

1049
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Our biggest worry then

1050
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,970
won't be making money,

1051
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,850
but our parents being extremely bored

1052
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
and hence

1053
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,610
pressuring us to get married.

1054
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,290
Just imagine that life.

1055
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,190
I'm telling you,

1056
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,400
Siyi definitely won't be pressured to marry.

1057
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,560
She'll definitely marry early.

1058
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,940
Why?

1059
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,840
She's beautiful and smart,

1060
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,780
and sensible too.

1061
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,970
By then, she'll get into a good university.

1062
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,160
I bet she'll be

1063
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,650
snatched up before she even graduates.

1064
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,640
That's how it was with my parents.

1065
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,900
My mom

1066
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,080
graduated from the Opera Academy,

1067
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,290
specializing in qingyi roles.

1068
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,300
The first time she performed on stage,

1069
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,600
my dad spotted her.

1070
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
At first, she really looked down on my dad.

1071
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,520
But you know what?

1072
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,140
On their first date,

1073
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,380
my dad cooked a meal for my mom.

1074
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,550
He won her over just like that.

1075
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,030
Hello?

1076
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,930
Linlin,

1077
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,720
I watched that TV series.

1078
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,250
It was so well made.

1079
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,220
It was okay, right?

1080
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,410
Not just okay.

1081
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,690
It was excellent!

1082
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,720
It didn't feel like a TV series,

1083
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,940
but more like a movie.

1084
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,820
That play you mentioned before—

1085
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,360
can I still audition for it?

1086
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,510
Of course you can.

1087
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,850
Then please help me get in touch with them quickly.

1088
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,870
As soon as I finish shooting tomorrow,

1089
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,020
I'll head to Beijing right away.

1090
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,340
Wait, has your husband agreed?

1091
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,840
For such a great director,

1092
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,300
I have to give it a shot no matter what.

1093
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,250
Don't you think so?

1094
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,630
Alright, I'll ask about it.

1095
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,760
Okay, okay.

1096
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,350
I'll wait for your news then.

1097
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,260
And about the Liu family…

1098
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,630
Dad, you're back.

1099
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,160
Dad.

1100
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,170
Have you been drinking?

1101
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,420
I just had a little.

1102
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,210
With whom?

1103
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,540
Just by myself.

1104
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,700
Well...

1105
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm going to my room.

1106
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,450
It's not like Zhimei isn't coming back.

1107
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,680
Dad,

1108
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,270
she

1109
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,420
only comes home a few days a year.

1110
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,040
What's the difference between that and not coming back at all?

1111
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,140
She's contributing to the family.

1112
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,720
You call that a contribution?

1113
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,470
Her contribution should be

1114
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,880
taking care of this home for me.

1115
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,870
She should be looking after Haikuo.

1116
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,080
He's already in his final year of high school.

1117
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,890
What are you waiting for?

1118
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,270
Go study now.

1119
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,040
Go take a shower quickly.

1120
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,040
I really didn't lie to you.

1121
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,040
I really went to collect the debt

1122
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,910
from Crippled Sun.

1123
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,530
That thick-skinned brute refused to pay me.

1124
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,370
He tried to pawn things off to settle the debt,

1125
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,110
stuffing anything he grabbed into my pockets.

1126
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,840
I gave back everything to him,

1127
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,530
but I didn't notice it because it was too small.

1128
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,020
Don't be mad anymore, okay?

1129
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,580
Alright?

1130
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,230
That money—

1131
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,830
we won't get it back forever, right?

1132
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,720
Well,

1133
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,720
that's not possible.

1134
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,500
I must get it back from him.

1135
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,570
What can you do?

1136
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,570
If he doesn't pay me back by the end of the month,

1137
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,580
I'll fight him to the death.

1138
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,040
Don't do anything reckless, you hear me?

1139
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,770
Money is not important.

1140
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,820
You can't get into trouble.

1141
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,790
If something happens to you,

1142
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,860
what will our son and I do?

1143
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,850
Do you understand?

1144
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,550
Don't worry.

1145
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,500
Rest assured.

1146
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,870
I won't do anything illegal, I promise.

1147
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,390
Just now,

1148
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,270
did I hurt you?

1149
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,230
What do you think?

1150
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,140
Have you practiced the Nine Yin White Bone Claw?

1151
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,820
You scratched, pinched, and clawed.

1152
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,590
I was just feeling anxious.

1153
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,290
We haven't had any income for months.

1154
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,190
We still owe several families their dividends.

1155
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,410
I'm too embarrassed to face them.

1156
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,360
You know,

1157
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,980
if it were just our own business,

1158
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,880
even if we lose money,

1159
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
I could accept that.

1160
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,180
At worst, we'll just

1161
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,250
spend less.

1162
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,770
We'd get through it somehow.

1163
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,870
But I'm afraid of letting down our neighbors.

1164
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,650
The other families are fine,

1165
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,650
but considering Granny Ma's situation...

1166
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,990
I feel guilty.

1167
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,090
I'm really sorry.

1168
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,480
We should blame that Crippled Sun.

1169
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,940
He drives a Mercedes to the nightclub,

1170
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,700
blowing thousands in one night,

1171
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,540
but he doesn't pay back the money he owes.

1172
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,370
What kind of person is that?

1173
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,590
You're smart enough.

1174
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,920
Why are you here?

1175
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,770
I saw you leaving home earlier, and you seemed upset.

1176
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,160
I was worried something might happen to you,

1177
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,440
so I followed you all the way here.

1178
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,870
What could possibly happen to me?

1179
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,690
Let's go.

1180
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,630
What are you hissing at? Come with me!
