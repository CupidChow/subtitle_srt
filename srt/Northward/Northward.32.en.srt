[Warm Congratulations on Bee (Haidian) 
Achieving Over 50% Market Share!]

4
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,430
Congratulations, everyone!

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,200
Under Mr. Xie's leadership,

6
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,229
we've created another miracle for Bee.

7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,440
Tonight, let's cut to the chase

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,840
and get straight to the bonuses!

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Great!

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,750
Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng!

11
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,050
Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng!

12
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,190
Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng!

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
Let's enjoy the fruits of our victory!

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,160
Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng!

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,530
[Warm Congratulations on Bee (Haidian) 
Achieving Over 50% Market Share!]

16
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,760
Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng! Mr. Meng!

17
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,630
Come on, come on.

18
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,050
This is just the beginning.

19
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,370
Next,

20
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,680
we'll take down Yuntu completely!

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,430
Come on.

22
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,960
From now on, I'll walk with my head held high

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,460
in the food delivery industry!

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,910
Bee is awesome!

25
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,280
We won!

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,190
Haikuo.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,150
I regret it.

28
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,140
Regret what?

29
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,520
I shouldn't have let Xingchi go back.

30
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,150
That year,

31
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,079
when we came to Beijing,

32
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,270
we made a promise on the train.

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,530
We said we'd make it big in Beijing.

34
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,900
If we couldn't make a name for ourselves,

35
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,590
we'd never go back.

36
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,820
That's what we agreed on.

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,970
The four of us together.

38
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,810
But that bastard...

39
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,690
He ran away again!

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,940
He's tired.

41
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,860
Who isn't tired?

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,740
Aren't you tired?

43
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,890
Am I not tired?

44
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,910
Why is he the only one who's vulnerable?

45
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,960
Why is he the only one who can't take hardship?

46
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,370
Alright, alright.

47
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,890
Tell Xingchi

48
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,340
he can take a break for a while,

49
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,520
six months at most.

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,060
After that, he must get his ass back here.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,209
I'll save a position for him before we go public.

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,740
After we go public,

53
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,570
regulations will be stricter.

54
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,250
I won't be able to pull strings anymore.

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,320
You tell him.

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,210
Why don't you tell him yourself?

57
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,460
No, I won't talk to him.

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm a leader.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,480
He's just a small fry.

60
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,520
What right does he have to talk to me directly?

61
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,870
That bastard.

62
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,730
He keeps pissing me off.

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,410
I want to tell him, but I know he wouldn't listen.

64
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,560
Forget it. Forget it.

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,800
Let's drink.

66
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,760
Stop drinking. You've had too much.

67
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,140
Last drink, okay?

68
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,270
Haikuo.

69
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,510
Here's to us.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,710
The big talk we made when we were kids

71
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,870
has become reality!

72
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,250
Cheers!

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
Mr. Qiu!

74
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,110
Cheers!

75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,650
Come on!

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,970
Come on!

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Cheers!

78
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Cheers!

79
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,780
We won!

80
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,130
We won!

81
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,470
Be careful.

82
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,900
Ms. Xia.

83
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,520
I, I, I...

84
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,040
I've been feeling very uneasy and anxious.

85
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,950
Did you not sleep well last night?

86
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,420
Maybe, I don't know.

87
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,830
I... I've been calling him all morning,

88
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,100
but Tianming hasn't answered.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
Let's go inside first and try calling him again.

90
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,610
Come on.

91
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
Please understand.

92
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm almost there. I'm already on my way.

93
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Please wait a bit longer.

94
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,060
I'm sorry. I...

95
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,560
Wanghe!

96
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,800
Wanghe!

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,159
Wake up, wake up!

98
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,950
Wanghe!

99
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,510
Wake up!

100
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,580
Are you crazy?

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,420
Fenghua called. Something really bad happened!

102
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,250
Tianming!

103
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,480
Tianming!

104
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,870
Tianming!

105
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,000
Wait.

106
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,920
Wait!

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,210
Tianming...

108
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,830
Family members, please come in.

109
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,050
Others, please stay back.

110
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,050
Tianming!

111
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,680
He Tianming

112
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,050
has a 70-year-old mother

113
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,190
and two children,

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,420
with one still in the womb.

115
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,600
When I entrusted him to you,

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,890
you promised me you'd take good care of him.

117
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,320
And now? What happened to him?

118
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,200
Fenghua.

119
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
It was an accident.

120
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,130
No one wanted this to happen.

121
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,840
Wasn't He Tianming the station chief?

122
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,310
Why did he go out to deliver orders?

123
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,200
There's been heavy rain these past few days,

124
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,310
and it caused a surge in orders.

125
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,600
He wanted to lend a hand.

126
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,920
When there's a surge in orders,

127
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,940
what penalties does the company have?

128
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,260
Say it!

129
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,220
There are indeed penalties,

130
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,310
but there are also rewards.

131
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm asking you,

132
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,030
what penalties does the company have?

133
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,310
If standards aren't met,

134
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,240
there's a fine.

135
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,530
Fenghua.

136
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,100
I'll find a way

137
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,030
to apply for the maximum compensation for He.

138
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,190
That's a man's life.

139
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,280
How much do you want to compensate him?

140
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,480
I...

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,540
I don't know.

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,780
The company has regulations in place for this.

143
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
Regulations, regulations!

144
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,690
Tell me, how much is your life worth?

145
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,360
I'll pay.

146
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,600
Fenghua.

147
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,670
30,000?

148
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,290
It was 20,000 before.

149
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,830
I discussed it with the legal department,

150
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,580
and we'll make an exception this time.

151
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,130
After all, there are millions of delivery riders.

152
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,020
If we paid a lot for every accident,

153
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,580
how could we continue our business in the future?

154
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,650
He was the station chief.

155
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
But the company didn't require

156
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,660
him to deliver orders.

157
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,520
That was his personal choice.

158
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,710
The company isn't legally responsible.

159
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,170
Mr. Meng.

160
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
That was a man's life.

161
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,140
He had elderly parents and young children to support.

162
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,730
His wife is even still pregnant.

163
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,440
Our company must take a proactive approach to this matter.

164
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,780
What's a proactive approach?

165
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,870
One person dies,

166
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,190
and we pay millions in compensation?

167
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,380
Or are you suggesting

168
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,230
the company should support his wife and children?

169
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
If that's the case,

170
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,200
we might as well quit the food delivery business.

171
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,410
We might as well open

172
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
a kindergarten or nursing home, that'll do.

173
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,690
Mr. Meng.

174
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,530
I formally request

175
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,690
a significant increase in

176
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
He Tianming's compensation amount.

177
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,910
This matter is not under my jurisdiction.

178
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,680
You should go talk to the legal department.

179
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,320
Okay.

180
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,420
30,000 yuan for a man's life,

181
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,530
do you think that's reasonable?

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,270
Mr. Xie.

183
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,090
Please calm down first.

184
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,410
I can't help it!

185
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,240
Listen to me.

186
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,030
No one wants

187
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,290
this kind of accident to happen.

188
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,960
That's why

189
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,150
our company has purchased accident insurance

190
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,340
for every employee.

191
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,760
However, the specific amount of compensation

192
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,000
shall be determined in accordance with the company's regulations.

193
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,080
This is no exception.

194
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,340
The accident insurance

195
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,860
is deducted from each delivery rider's salary,

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,810
three yuan per day,

197
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,450
right?

198
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes.

199
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,960
So what has the company done for the employees?

200
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,150
The company has provided them with

201
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,390
a better platform

202
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,480
so they can work hard

203
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
and earn money to support their families, right?

204
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,440
We're all colleagues.

205
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Cut out the official jargon, okay?

206
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,030
Just tell me how much compensation we can give him!

207
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,450
Mr. Xie.

208
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,780
I've already said,

209
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,050
it has to be determined according to the company's regulations.

210
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,940
Unless you tell me

211
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,470
Mr. Meng has given different instructions.

212
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,990
He asked me to talk to you,

213
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,570
and you're telling me to go back to him?

214
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,960
With your buck-passing skills,

215
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,710
you should be playing in the World Cup!

216
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,330
I'm just an employee here too.

217
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,270
After He's accident,

218
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,320
all the delivery riders are watching.

219
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,700
He was trying to boost the company's performance

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,850
when the accident happened.

221
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,750
If such a dedicated employee

222
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,170
couldn't get a satisfying compensation,

223
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,720
who would be willing to work hard

224
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,090
and strive for the company in the future?

225
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,600
I don't know whether He worked hard or not,

226
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,670
but based on the current evidence,

227
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,390
He's accident this time

228
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,220
was caused by him running a red light.

229
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,930
Come on, Mr. Xie.

230
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,930
Look at this, Mr. Xie.

231
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,360
This is what

232
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,480
the street cameras captured that day.

233
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,070
The traffic light at this intersection

234
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,000
was changing.

235
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,150
He wanted to speed through,

236
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,570
and an SUV was coming from this side.

237
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,560
[Street]

238
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,680
That's why the accident happened.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,270
So He should bear the primary responsibility.

240
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,200
In this light,

241
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,460
the insurance company's compensation amount

242
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,720
will be even more limited.

243
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,910
But as for the specific number,

244
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,620
we'll have to wait for the insurance company's reply.

245
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,970
Only then will we know.

246
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,110
How much do you think

247
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,660
the company will compensate that delivery rider?

248
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,340
They won't compensate much.

249
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,320
It was a traffic accident,

250
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,590
not the company's fault.

251
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,120
If everyone

252
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,960
could get a lot of compensation in situations like this,

253
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,030
how big of a company could afford such compensation?

254
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,890
That's true.

255
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,030
Let's go.

256
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,750
Let's go.

257
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,080
Have some water.

258
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,480
Tianming is gone.

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
For the sake of your two children,

260
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,030
you can't fall apart.

261
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,850
Have you told

262
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,770
his mother about this?

263
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Don't drag on for too long.

264
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,340
Before the cremation,

265
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,390
she should at least see him one last time.

266
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,570
I don't dare to tell her.

267
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,870
She's too old.

268
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,350
She won't be able to handle it.

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,770
I'm all alone.

270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,370
You still have me.

271
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,760
There are still many things

272
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,910
we'll need to deal with together.

273
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,520
What things?

274
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
We need to fight for his rights.

275
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,240
We must seek justice for Tianming's death.

276
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,980
Bee exploits its employees like this.

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,270
They must be held accountable.

278
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,850
You're willing to help me?

279
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,000
Tianming used to work for me.

280
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,350
You and his mother

281
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,770
are also my people.

282
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,760
It's all my fault!

283
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,900
What are you doing?

284
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,270
If I hadn't pushed him,

285
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,100
Tianming wouldn't have ended up like this!

286
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,390
It's all my fault!

287
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,380
It's not your fault.

288
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,100
Don't you feel guilty.

289
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,260
It's not your fault.

290
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,810
[Haikuo]

291
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,670
[Haikuo]

292
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,600
[Haikuo]

293
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,290
Hello?

294
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,240
Why aren't you answering your phone?

295
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,880
Are you okay?

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
I called you more than a dozen times, but you didn't answer.

297
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,790
I'm okay.

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,710
I'm just lying in bed.

299
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,350
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

300
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,810
Why is your voice so nasal?

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,480
Hello?

302
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Hello?

303
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,730
Why are you here...

304
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,270
Get up.

305
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,500
Come on.

306
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,020
You're burning up.

307
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,330
Have you taken any medicine?

308
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,060
I'll go buy some medicine for you.

309
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,020
No need.

310
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,730
I'll be fine after lying down for a while.

311
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Let go of my hand first.

312
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,180
I'll get you a glass of water, okay?

313
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,950
Don't leave.

314
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,160
I was wrong.

315
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,440
What?

316
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,350
Xingchi left.

317
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,110
And He died.

318
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,550
You entrusted him to me,

319
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,840
and he ended up dead.

320
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,170
I know you all blame me.

321
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
Everyone blames me.

322
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,490
But that was my responsibility.

323
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,810
I had to boost the performance.

324
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,480
I had to win.

325
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,900
I must win.

326
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
You chose this responsibility.

327
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,780
You had no choice.

328
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,450
Fenghua.

329
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,860
I was wrong.

330
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,210
I know I was wrong.

331
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,130
Please don't be angry, okay?

332
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,000
I didn't mean for things to turn out this way.

333
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,910
Don't be angry.

334
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,560
[I'm leaving. Remember to take your medicine. Take care of yourself.]

335
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,020
-Mr. Xie.
-Mr. Xie.

336
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,540
Chief.

337
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,420
Here's the list of delivery riders who have resigned in the past few days.

338
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,390
Why are there so many?

339
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,310
What's going on?

340
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,130
Since Chief He's incident,

341
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,560
everyone's morale has been low.

342
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,810
[Office]

343
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,090
Mr. Xie.

344
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,720
Hello, Mr. Xie.

345
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,790
I'm Liu, the temporary chief

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,450
who just got transferred here.

347
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,980
I'd like to see

348
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,070
the data of Station 203 before He's incident.

349
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,040
Mr. Xie.

350
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,090
After He Tianming took over Station 203,

351
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,590
the data improved rapidly.

352
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Especially in the three days before his incident,

353
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,080
the order volume increased by 15% compared to usual.

354
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,520
I heard he required full attendance from all staff at the station,

355
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,410
and there were indeed no

356
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,560
leave requests.

357
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,450
Their station

358
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,990
was also the one among all stations in Beijing

359
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,190
with the lowest order cancellation rate.

360
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,580
Chief He did this

361
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,240
because he followed the instructions from the higher-ups.

362
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,690
Everyone was working overtime,

363
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,730
pushing themselves really hard.

364
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,840
The performance was great,

365
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,250
and at the celebration, you were all drinking champagne

366
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,010
and whatnot...

367
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,890
Now, such an accident happened,

368
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,030
but the company hasn't done anything in response.

369
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,660
How nice.

370
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,830
Watch your words.

371
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,700
You're not wrong.

372
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,270
Go on.

373
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,160
What is there to say?

374
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,650
There's nothing to say.

375
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,260
He already died.

376
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,650
Mr. Xie.

377
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I've been working at Station 203 for a long time.

378
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,750
Let me report to you on our work.

379
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,570
Since Chief He's accident,

380
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,750
over 20 delivery riders have resigned...

381
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,630
Xiaofei!

382
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,570
Where did they go?

383
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,900
Anywhere is better than here.

384
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,370
Our chief had an accident,

385
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,510
yet the company didn't even show any concern.

386
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,460
Not to mention us delivery riders at the bottom.

387
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,420
The company used to make big promises,

388
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,760
and everyone was happy to buy them.

389
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,810
Now everyone's disillusioned.

390
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,240
Even if you laid out a grand feast,

391
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,310
no one would dare to eat it now.

392
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,190
Tianming!

393
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Where's Tianming?

394
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,450
Xiaofei?

395
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,430
Auntie.

396
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Where's Tianming?

397
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,510
Auntie.

398
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,720
I know he's been busy these days.

399
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
The weather's getting cold,

400
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,620
so I brought him some clothes.

401
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Where is he...

402
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,060
What's going on?

403
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,630
Has something happened to Tianming?

404
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,560
Tell me, has something happened to Tianming?

405
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,960
Why haven't I seen him?

406
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,710
Auntie.

407
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,770
Mr. Xie.

408
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,350
Auntie.

409
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,350
Mr. Xie!

410
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,740
Where's my Tianming?

411
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,870
Why haven't I seen him since I came in?

412
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,350
Has something happened to him?

413
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,590
I knew something was off with my daughter-in-law these days.

414
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,720
She's been so evasive.

415
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,200
I felt something wasn't right.

416
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,720
Tell me, where's Tianming?

417
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,710
Where's Tianming?

418
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,200
Has something happened to him?

419
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,400
Tell me, please!

420
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,200
Tell me already!

421
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,480
I'm his mother. Whatever it is,

422
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,630
I can handle it for him.

423
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,310
Please tell me.

424
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,460
Auntie.

425
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,560
There was a heavy rainstorm a couple of days ago.

426
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,160
He had a car accident.

427
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,680
Auntie!

428
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,310
-Auntie.
-Auntie.

429
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,610
Come help quickly!

430
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,610
Get a chair!

431
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,950
Auntie!

432
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,950
Auntie!

433
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,850
My son!

434
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,960
My son!

435
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,790
My son! My dear son!

436
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,610
Where are you?

437
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,330
All your stuff is in the box.

438
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,400
Clothes, miscellaneous items, and such.

439
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,750
Thank you.

440
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm moving next month.

441
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,620
To Xinghe Bay.

442
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,420
If anything comes up, let's keep in touch on WeChat.

443
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,010
If

444
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,370
I had agreed to buy a house back then,

445
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,510
would you still have chosen to leave?

446
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,160
I probably would.

447
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,190
So it wasn't entirely because of the house, right?

448
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,350
Not entirely.

449
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,720
You

450
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,310
are actually quite conflicted within.

451
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,400
Being with you

452
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,030
is actually quite exhausting.

453
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,040
After your parents separated,

454
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,000
on one hand, you crave a peaceful life,

455
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,350
but on the other hand,

456
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,700
you worry

457
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,350
that you'll get tired of such a life

458
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
and want to escape.

459
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,220
So you're very confused.

460
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,120
You don't know what to choose.

461
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,830
It might be true.

462
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,020
You're a programmer,

463
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,370
rational and logical.

464
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,010
That's not good.

465
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,550
I hope

466
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,590
you will ask your heart more often in the future.

467
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,410
What do you really want?

468
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,520
How should you live your life

469
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,880
so that you feel

470
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,110
comfortable and satisfied?

471
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,510
Well,

472
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,270
goodbye then.

473
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Wanghe.

474
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,590
Do you think I'm a conflicted person?

475
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,830
You met with Xiaohui?

476
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,350
Your chat with her made you feel depressed?

477
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,310
She said

478
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
I lived a very conflicted life.

479
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,470
I didn't agree at the time,

480
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,120
but I couldn't be bothered to argue with her.

481
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,330
On the way back,

482
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,510
the more I thought about it, the more insecure I felt.

483
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,630
She wasn't wrong.

484
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,950
I, as a person,

485
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,270
am indeed very conflicted.

486
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,050
I think

487
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,350
you've been brainwashed by her.

488
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,000
No.

489
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,710
I've been like this since I was little.

490
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,680
In my senior year of high school,

491
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,670
I actually wanted to get into Shanghai Jiaotong University.

492
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,070
The computer science major there

493
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,350
has a better scientific research atmosphere.

494
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,700
But you all wanted to come to Beijing.

495
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,750
I thought,

496
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,280
it would also be good

497
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,960
for us to stick together.

498
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,430
So I came here afterwards.

499
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,270
But sometimes I do wonder,

500
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,510
if I had gone to Shanghai Jiaotong University back then,

501
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,240
would things have been different?

502
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,950
No matter what choices I make in this life,

503
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,730
I always feel conflicted.

504
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm always anxious about gains and losses.

505
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Including my relationship with Xiaohui.

506
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,160
Haikuo.

507
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,640
You two broke up

508
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,280
because she cheated.

509
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
It wasn't your fault.

510
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,800
I know.

511
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,320
But I still feel guilty.

512
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,380
I really admire my mom in this aspect.

513
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,170
Once she made a decision,

514
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,520
she'd move forward bravely

515
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,350
and never regret it.

516
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,050
Today, Xiaohui also advised me

517
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,750
to ask myself

518
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,830
what kind of life

519
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I really want to live in the future.

520
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,110
I've been thinking about it until now,

521
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,290
but I have no clue.

522
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,640
If you can't figure it out, don't think about it for now.

523
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,510
Just take it one step at a time.

524
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,690
Wanghe.

525
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,350
There's one thing I've decided.

526
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,680
Bee

527
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
is not suitable for me.

528
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,230
What do you mean?

529
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
You want to resign?

530
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,150
Xingchi left.

531
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,179
Fenghua had a falling out with me

532
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,670
because of He's accident.

533
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,030
And now,

534
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,030
you're leaving too?

535
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,320
From the company's attitude towards He's accident this time,

536
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,400
you can see that

537
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:42,020
Bee is a company with a wolf culture.

538
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,030
Those at the front eat meat,

539
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,440
while those at the back,

540
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,710
die.

541
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,070
I'm not a wolf,

542
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,690
and I don't want to be one.

543
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,510
Tianming was too careless.

544
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,430
What?

545
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,680
The labor contract he signed with Bee

546
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,850
has very harsh conditionality.

547
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,200
The parts involving compensation clauses

548
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,380
are all vague.

549
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,850
It's particularly unfavorable to him.

550
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,860
Isn't this a standard contract?

551
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,420
Everyone signs it like this.

552
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,620
The contracts for our station were all revised by me.

553
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,520
I argued with the head office for a long time

554
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,550
and finally settled on them after much discussion.

555
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,560
Even so,

556
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,640
I wanted to spend money on additional insurance back then,

557
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,980
but nobody supported it.

558
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,340
Everyone thought they wouldn't be so unlucky,

559
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,150
and nothing would happen to them.

560
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,690
With this contract of his,

561
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,280
if it comes to a lawsuit,

562
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,030
we don't have any advantage at all.

563
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,860
What should we do then?
