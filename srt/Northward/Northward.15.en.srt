00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,430
[By the Canal]

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,310
Just say hi.

5
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,580
I'm still cooking.

6
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,310
Just go and meet them.

7
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,550
They came here specially. Hurry up.

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,710
Our two Mr. Li's.

9
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,509
Let me introduce you.

10
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,870
This is my husband, Zhou Yanlin.

11
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,140
Master Zhou.

12
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,460
Hello.

13
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,510
I've heard so much about you.

14
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,150
Master Zhou, it's my honor to meet you.

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,030
Hello.

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,830
Zhou,

17
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,760
these two Mr. Li's came all the way from Beijing

18
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,009
to taste your cooking.

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,110
Give them a proper introduction.

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,630
Alright.

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,350
Here, please have a seat.

22
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,190
Come, come.

23
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,310
Let's get acquainted.

24
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,110
Okay.

25
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,430
Oh, you're also in this industry?

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,150
Yes.

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,300
This is...

28
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,030
Huaiyang-style imperial cuisine,

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,030
prepared using Qing Dynasty methods

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,829
Do you two think the taste is alright?

31
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,030
Master Zhou,

32
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,829
my brother and I

33
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,510
have been in the restaurant business for many years.

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,440
I've spent half my life in it.

35
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,550
But coming here,

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,290
this is the first time in my life

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,910
that I've been truly impressed.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,540
You two are too kind.

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Well, you see,

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,120
it's the Olympics again next year.

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,910
High-end dining in Beijing

42
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,630
will take off.

43
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,180
We've

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,400
secured a location near Workers' Sports Complex.

45
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,190
We're planning

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,230
to open a high-end restaurant.

47
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,670
We've even decided on a name.

48
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,829
It will be called Suzhen Pavilion.

49
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,230
So, Hangzhou cuisine.

50
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,950
Yes, Hangzhou cuisine.

51
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,230
We were actually thinking of selling that previously.

52
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,070
But

53
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,380
after tasting your dishes,

54
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,770
we've decided to focus solely on Huaiyang cuisine.

55
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,350
Master Zhou.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,990
Yes, yes.

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,550
How about

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,510
you take a look at our design plans first?

59
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,720
You two take a look first.

60
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,670
It's so grand!

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,150
Master Zhou.

62
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,520
We

63
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,070
have set up the stage.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,310
We're just waiting for you to take the stage.

65
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,390
As for Beijing,

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,870
I've actually been there

67
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,150
and stayed for a few years,

68
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,910
but I wasn't very happy there,

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,280
so I came back.

70
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,550
That must be because we aren't clear with the terms.

71
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,710
With us,

72
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,590
you can rest assured.

73
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,590
We

74
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,310
will pay you according to the highest standards.

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750
Additionally, there will be shares.

76
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,280
We absolutely won't let your efforts go unrewarded.

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,550
Any apprentices you've trained

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,270
will receive corresponding dividends.

79
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,070
It's not about the terms.

80
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,030
The main concern is that

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,520
I can't leave this restaurant unattended.

82
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,910
Or how about

83
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,590
I send my apprentice over instead?

84
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,710
How's that?

85
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,000
Master Zhou, you must have some concerns.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,030
If you have any concerns, please tell us.

87
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,270
We can find a solution together.

88
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,830
I have no concerns.

89
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,830
I really don't have any concerns.

90
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,990
It's just because...

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm getting older and don't want to trouble myself.

92
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,870
No.

93
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,750
How old are you now?

94
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,150
Aren't you in your prime?

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,430
With your skills,

96
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,870
isn't it a waste to stay here

97
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,710
in this small place?

98
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,630
Small place?

99
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,589
What's wrong with this small place?

100
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,070
I just like to stay in small places like these.

101
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,910
Both of you,

102
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,870
please continue to enjoy your meal.

103
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,070
The dishes haven’t all arrived yet.

104
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,340
Let me have a word with my husband.

105
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,350
Okay.

106
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,030
Zhou.

107
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,870
Why are you so anxious?

108
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,950
Zhou Yanlin, what are you trying to do?

109
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,230
Do you really have to make things so tense?

110
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,830
They have good intentions.

111
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,230
It's such a good opportunity.

112
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,670
Why do you want to give it up?

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,430
If you aren't going to think about yourself,

114
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,950
you should at least think about Haikuo.

115
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,750
Haikuo is a senior now,

116
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,750
yet you want him to transfer schools?

117
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,870
Wouldn't changing to a new environment

118
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,470
affect his studies?

119
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,630
I've realized that we

120
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,790
can't really communicate anymore, can we?

121
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,630
What do you mean?

122
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,950
Don't you think it's pathetic?

123
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,460
I respect your choice.

124
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,190
Please respect my choice as well.

125
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,950
Do I not respect you?

126
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,390
How am I disrespecting you?

127
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,070
What were you trying to do with those guests just now?

128
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,950
What do you mean?

129
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,070
If you want to go to Beijing, I won't stop you.

130
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,710
But I don't want to go to Beijing.

131
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,790
Listen, Xu Peng,

132
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,830
you either give your best

133
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,030
or just quit otherwise!

134
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,230
If you don't want to work, just go home.

135
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,110
Dad.

136
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,909
Come in.

137
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,590
Have a seat.

138
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,360
You two had another fight, didn't you?

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,350
Someone invited him to open a restaurant in Beijing today.

140
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,430
A high-end restaurant near Workers' Sports Complex.

141
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,909
He flat out refused.

142
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,670
You feel that...

143
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,480
he should go?

144
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,800
It's such a waste

145
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,230
for his skills to be

146
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,710
confined to this small town.

147
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,910
A shame?

148
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,110
The business is so bad now.

149
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,150
It's hard to even break even.

150
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,430
First-tier cities offer better opportunities for growth.

151
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,110
Whether for himself

152
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,470
or for our son,

153
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,150
it would mean a better future.

154
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,630
But...

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,070
that's the future you want,

156
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,680
not what Yanlin wants.

157
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,790
But isn’t it nice for a family

158
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,950
to stay together,

159
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,170
live well,

160
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,550
and not worry about food or money?

161
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,870
Isn't that what we have now?

162
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,110
Zhimei,

163
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,909
if going to Beijing

164
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,470
is what makes you happy,

165
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,270
then go.

166
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,710
I support you.

167
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,790
But...

168
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,470
If Yanlin were to go,

169
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,230
he will not be happy.

170
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,470
Don't push him anymore.

171
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,990
Previously,

172
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,430
My job was very unstable.

173
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,470
We had to keep moving.

174
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,030
Yanlin has been wandering with me since he was little.

175
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,910
Life...

176
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,300
was really tough.

177
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,750
I rarely saw him smile.

178
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,230
Until one day,

179
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,990
I suddenly discovered that the child could smile.

180
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,910
I was puzzled.

181
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,230
He wouldn't tell me anything when I asked.

182
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,150
Later, I secretly followed him.

183
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,110
As it turned out,

184
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,430
that boy was hanging out at a restaurant's back kitchen.

185
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,740
He even found himself a master.

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,120
He was an old chef from Huai'an,

187
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,110
a family chef of Shen Jingsi.

188
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,110
He really liked Yanlin.

189
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,909
He taught him everything he knew.

190
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,560
After that,

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,750
he was smiling every day.

192
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,790
He was always smiling.

193
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,630
It was the kind...

194
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
that came from the heart.

195
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,310
Later, he told me

196
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,980
that when he was cooking,

197
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,990
he felt like

198
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,790
an orchestra's conductor.

199
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,670
Just hearing the sound of chopping

200
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,950
made him feel at ease and happy.

201
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,470
But it's cooking.

202
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,470
Isn't it the same wherever he works?

203
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,710
It's not the same!

204
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,350
The luckiest thing

205
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,790
for a chef isn’t making money,

206
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,270
but that there are people who appreciate his cooking.

207
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,510
As for Yanlin,

208
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,150
you know what he had experienced

209
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,549
in Beijing too.

210
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,110
But perhaps...

211
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,470
you haven't been able to

212
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,470
fully understand his pain.

213
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,470
I,

214
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,190
as his father,

215
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,350
sincerely hope he can be happy.

216
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,350
I hope he can regain

217
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,590
the smile he had when he first started learning to cook.

218
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,670
As for this marriage,

219
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,910
don’t rush into a divorce just yet.

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,230
How about you take some time apart

221
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,470
and cool off for a bit?

222
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,390
Or how about this?

223
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,070
Why don't we

224
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,660
wait until...

225
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,530
wait until Haikuo finishes his exams before deciding?

226
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,990
Okay.

227
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,350
Alright.

228
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,870
Then you should rest early.

229
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay.

What time is it now?

234
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,540
Why aren't you in bed yet?

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,770
In a minute.

236
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,710
What do you mean by 'in a minute'?

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm talking to you.

238
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,940
Give it back to me.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,120
What's wrong with you?

240
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,310
Nothing.

241
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,190
If you're upset about something,

242
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,510
don't bottle it up.

243
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,070
Tell me about it.

244
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,660
Will you?

245
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,010
When do you plan on divorcing?

246
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,040
I don't know.

247
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,560
It’s not my decision to make either.

248
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,390
Do you want a divorce then?

249
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,570
Have you made any effort?

250
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,310
What effort?

251
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,990
To try and keep Mom from leaving.

252
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,260
If your mom wants to leave,

253
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,670
there's nothing I can do to stop her.

254
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,230
Do you understand?

255
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,190
Then why don't you want to go to Beijing

256
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,150
when Mom asked you to?

257
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,470
What would I do in Beijing?

258
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,710
Would it make any difference?

259
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,070
Your mom spends the entire year filming.

260
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,950
What difference does it make

261
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,950
if I wait for her here or in Beijing?

262
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,540
Then why are you all getting a divorce?

263
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
She can continue acting

264
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,200
while you continue to be a chef.

265
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,870
Why can't we just go on like this?

266
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,110
Exactly.

267
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,220
Why indeed?

268
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,750
Dad.

269
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,870
When you two discussed divorce,

270
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,110
have you ever considered

271
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,120
how I might feel about it?

272
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,910
Siyi grew up without her parents by her side.

273
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,830
You can clearly see for yourself

274
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,950
what their family situation is like

275
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,110
and the kind of life they have been living.

276
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,830
So it means you're just being selfish.

277
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,350
You're absolutely right, Dad.

278
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,190
Mom wants to pursue her dreams,

279
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,900
and I support that.

280
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,160
You want to live your own life,

281
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,430
and I understand that too.

282
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,510
But I'm asking both of you

283
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,470
to think about me as well.

284
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,150
Zhimei, I want to ask you for a favor.

285
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,030
No matter what happens between us in the future,

286
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,490
or what decisions we make,

287
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,230
let's not hurt our child.

288
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,780
Let's not give him the impression

289
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,130
that marriage is a terrible thing.

290
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,670
Okay.

292
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,180
Son?

293
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,550
Mom's leaving.

294
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,990

Let Haikuo sleep a bit more.

296
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,520

Here, here.

301
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,630
Take it.

302
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,580
Thank you, Granny.

303
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,690

00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,470

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,670
You're here.

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,790
Come get your soy milk.

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,270
Okay.

310
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,210
Your mom left?

311
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,760
You didn’t go and see her off?

312
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,710
It's not like we're saying goodbye forever.

313
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,840
What's the point of seeing her off?

314
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,630
Are you okay?

315
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,390
Your mom doesn't want you either?

316
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,030
Just eat.

Don't be upset.

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,630
We can meet her when we go to Beijing in the future.

322
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,890
We'll watch a game at the Bird's Nest then.

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We'll make your mom pay for it.

324
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,710
I want to go to Beijing too.

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,230

we'll take you with us.

We'll take you to visit the Forbidden City, climb the Great Wall,

330
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,790
and watch the flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square.

331
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,070
How about that?

332
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,990
You said it! It's a promise.

Fine, I'll be your witness.

Take it easy.

342
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,510
Be careful.

00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,020

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,830
Be careful.

347
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,830
Granny, we're leaving.

348
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,670

What are you doing?

353
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,630
Our child has eaten quite a bit.

354
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,069
No need.

355
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,589
Hasn't Fenghua ate plenty of your food too?

356
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,349
Take it.

357
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,230
However,

358
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,780
it looks like Siwei

359
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,569
is not easy to take care of.

360
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,950
It's alright.

361
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,830
He wasn't doing well when he first arrived a few days ago.

362
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,270
He might have gotten used to it in the past few days.

363
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,110
He's doing much better now.

364
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,590
One night, he said he couldn't sleep alone.

365
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,620
He was scared.

366
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,430
He insisted on sleeping with Siyi.

367
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,150
He fell asleep until 5 a.m.,

368
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,350
but when he realised it wasn't his mom when he woke up,

369
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,710
he cried.

370
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,910
It took me quite a while to comfort him.

371
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,810
Isn’t this just giving Siyi another child to look after?

372
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,750
Isn't it?

373
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,630
That's right, Granny.

374
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,740
He's not even your own grandson.

375
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,780
What are you getting out of it?

376
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,630
Granny Ma is just kind-hearted.

377
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,390
Kind people are often taken advantage of,

378
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,670
just like how a gentle horse gets ridden the most.

379
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,550
No.

380
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,670
This is how I see it.

381
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,380
I want to create good karma for myself,

382
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,790
but also...

383
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,190
do Siyi a favor.

384
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,780
In case something happens to me in the future,

385
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,910
Siyi's mother will need to treat Siyi better.

386
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,910
Granny,

387
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,640
let me be frank.

388
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,250
That person...

389
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,390
She only cares about herself.

390
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,870
She cannot be relied on.

391
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,660
Granny Ma,

392
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,690
it's okay.

393
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,880
You have us.

394
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,230
We're all here.

395
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,160
Yes, I have you all.

396
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,750
It's alright.

397
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,310
Yes, I do.

398
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,250
Yes, Granny.

399
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't worry.

400
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,210
Yes, I won't worry.

401
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,770
Come, let's tidy up together.

402
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,310
No, just sit there.

403
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,670
I'm already done cleaning up here.

404
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,310
We don't need your help here.

405
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,700
No need at all.

406
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,300
I'll put it here.

407
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,270
What happened? Did you get into a fight?

408
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,970
My brother-in-law tricked me.

409
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,750
He said

410
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,790
if anyone bullies me,

411
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,260
I should lie down on the ground,

412
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,110
roll my eyes, and twitch.

413
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,750
That way, the other person will give in.

414
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,750
Grandma, look at him.

415
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,830
The teacher said no one even touched him,

416
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,790
but he just laid down on the ground

417
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,670
and threatened his classmates

418
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,030
to buy him potato chips,

419
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,110
or else he'd tell the teacher.

420
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,630
That's why he got beaten up.

421
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,920
Who taught you that?

422
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,180
My brother-in-law.

423
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,670
What's wrong with you?

424
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,660
Wait, who's this brother-in-law? Who is it?

425
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,780
He's talking about Wanghe.

426
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,690
Wanghe?

427
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,950
Why are you calling him brother-in-law?

428
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,920
He's crazy.

429
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,070
I’ve told you not to spew nonsense.

430
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,150
We're just good neighbors.

431
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,880
Wanghe likes you.

432
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,360
He wants to be with you.

433
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,280
Ge Siwei!

434
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,110
Stop talking nonsense!

435
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,510
Alright, alright.

436
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,910
I'm not talking nonsense!

437
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,550
He keeps sneaking glances at you on the way to school every day.

438
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,150
You won't stop, huh?

439
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,840
He even looks at you during breakfast.

440
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,590
Ge Siwei!

441
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,990
You!

442
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,110
You little...

443
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,110
Siyi, go easy on your little brother.

444
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,630
Ge Siwei!

445
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,520
Grandma, don't listen to his nonsense.

446
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,310
I know.

447
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,630
You like Wanghe.

448
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,070
What are you saying?

449
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,830
I also know that Wanghe likes you too.

450
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,670
I know everything.

451
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,990
Alright, alright.

452
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,800
Alright, Siyi.

453
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Be gentle.

454
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,140
He's asleep?

455
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,860
He drives me crazy.

456
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,630
I don't know who he takes after.

457
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,590
He just blurts things out.

458
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,420
Children speak without malice.

459
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,700
You know,

460
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,240
you should talk nicely to your brother from now on.

461
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,230
Every time you're together,

462
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,010
you end up fighting.

463
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,930
You'll become enemies if this continues.

464
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,140
Isn't it infuriating?

465
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,270
He's only a few years old,

466
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,790
but he is already so gossipy.

467
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,590
It might not be gossip, right?

468
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,760
I mean...

469
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,910
Aren't you aware of

470
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,950
how Wanghe thinks about you?

471
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,530
Grandma...

472
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,750
Both of you

473
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,470
are good kids.

474
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,630
If you two really have feelings for each other,

475
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,750
I won't object either.

476
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,060
I don't have any feelings for him.

477
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,200
Don't talk nonsense.

478
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,550
Why not?

479
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,750
Wanghe...

480
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,710
likes Fenghua.

481
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,270
He likes...

482
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,430
He likes Fenghua?

483
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,390
How come I didn't notice that?

484
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,070
I heard them confess to each other.

485
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,150
Fenghua said she likes him.

486
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,350
Fenghua said she likes Wang He?

487
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,780
But Wanghe might not like Fenghua.

488
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,950
I think Wanghe likes you instead.

489
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,990
Anyway, I'm focusing all my attention on the college entrance exam now.

490
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,820
I won't let anyone

491
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,390
or anything distract me.

492
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,670
Grandma, give me two more years.

493
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,470
After I graduate from the teachers' college

494
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,590
and come back to be a teacher,

495
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,830
I'll be able to keep you company every day.

496
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,510
Alright,

497
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,070
I'll be waiting.

498
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,310
Come on.

499
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,070
You're back.

500
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,630
How was your day?

501
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,950
It was okay.

502
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,590
Did you make or lose money?

503
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,950
Made some.

504
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,070
How much did you make?

505
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,390
After a whole day's work,

506
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,500
I made 30 yuan.

507
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,550
That's not even counting the cost of meals.

508
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,530
What happened?

509
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,040
Did Boss Xie cause trouble again?

510
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,310
No.

511
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,790
Come on, tell me.

512
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,350
To be honest, we can't blame him.

513
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,830
When we were seafaring previously,

514
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,430
Mr. Du did help us a lot.

515
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,940
Boss Xie couldn't bring himself to refuse,

516
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,080
so he gave a pretty steep discount.

517
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,910
It's always like this.

518
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,870
All about his pride.

519
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,750
If he cares so much about his pride,

520
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,140
he should use his own money to cover it!

521
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,570
Why should our family be dragged into this?

522
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,430
Keep your voice down.

523
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,670
Why are you fussing over it?

524
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,790
Why should I keep my voice down?

525
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,150
How are we supposed to get by like this?

526
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,070
You tell me yourself.

527
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,270
Other people run supermarkets

528
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,340
and they all make money,

529
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,850
but you two keep losing money.

530
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,990
How can we go on living like this?

531
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,390
You need to do something.

532
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,910
You need to do something.

533
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,320
Element.

534
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,350
Element.

535
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,150
What's wrong with you?

536
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,550
My parents are arguing at home.

537
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,580
When do they not argue?

538
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,350
This time it's because of your dad.

539
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,730
Because of what?

540
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,670
I overheard that...

541
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,030
your dad is being too prideful

542
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,150
and keeps offering discounts.

543
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,590
A few days ago, he wouldn't listen to advice

544
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,510
and stocked up too much.

545
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,150
And now, it can't sell.

546
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,300
Regardless, they lost quite a bit of money.

547
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,590
My mom is almost going crazy at home.

548
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,430
I mean...

549
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,790
should I not have let them start the floating supermarket?

550
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,510
I had good intentions.

551
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,070
But in the end, we didn't make any money

552
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,350
and can't even be friends anymore.

553
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,430
I really don't know what it was all for.

554
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,630
Alright.

555
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,990
It's not your fault.

556
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,670
Don't worry, I'll figure something out.

557
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,610
Let's go home.

558
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,870
Dad.

559
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,510
You're back.

560
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,330
You didn't sail today?

561
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,750
I did.

562
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,950
I've been busy all day.

563
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,890
Is the floating supermarket

564
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,210
doing well?

565
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,260
It's alright.

566
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,090
Did you make money?

567
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,240
Of course.

568
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,470
If it's not for the money,

569
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,270
w-what am I even doing all this for?

570
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,710
Why do I feel like you're a bit unhappy?

571
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,080
It's not that dramatic.

572
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,030
Everything's fine.

573
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,550
Then why are you drinking alone?

574
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,830
It's really tiring.

575
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,050
Selling things is quite different from seafaring.

576
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,710
You have to call out to customers

577
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,100
and talk to all kinds of people.

578
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,710
And those people are all your acquaintances.

579
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,790
It's frustrating.

580
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,540
You feel embarrassed, don't you?

581
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,110
Not exactly.

582
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,690
I just feel a bit indignant.

583
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,160
You see, everyone's starting point is about the same,

584
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,870
right?

585
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,390
But look at others.

586
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,910
They're still working on ships, aren't they?

587
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,270
They're all operating big ships.

588
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,390
Now, I've switched to a small ship

589
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,660
and I even have to serve them.

590
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,300
I've become a regular crew from being an elite.

591
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,360
Have some more.

592
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,320
Drink up.

593
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,770
If you have something to say,

594
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,560
just say it.

595
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Every industry has its rules.

596
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,710
I'll print out some

597
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,310
information about the retail industry.

598
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,210
You can study it.

599
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,650
Study what?

600
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,990
How to make more money, of course.

601
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,260
Don't look down on supermarkets.

602
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,170
If you do well, you can also make it into Fortune 500.

603
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,880
Are you looking down on your dad?

604
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,780
You think I can't even run a supermarket?

605
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,500
No, that's not it.

606
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,140
I just think

607
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,440
since it's now a joint operation between two families,

608
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,310
we should discuss and plan together.

609
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,650
Discuss with whom?

610
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,840
Xia Lao'er?

611
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,830
He, he...

612
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,710
He's so cowardly.

613
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,910
What ideas could he possibly have?

614
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,990
What's there to discuss?

615
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,770
I'll do it my way

616
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,760
and he just needs to follow along diligently, that's all.

617
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,560
Dad,

618
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,140
he was your assistant when you were seafaring.

619
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,600
Now, you're business partners.

620
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,290
You need to adjust your mindset.

621
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,610
You can't act recklessly.

622
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,230
You little rascal.

623
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,580
Have you ever run a supermarket?

624
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,070
No,

625
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,080
why do you want to meddle in everything?

626
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,170
You should use that energy for your revision.

627
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,360
My grades have improved a lot recently.

628
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,400
What about you? Have you made any money?

629
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,870
Aren’t you done yet?

630
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,160
No, why are you getting so worked up?

631
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,270
Feeling guilty?

632
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,440
Y-You say that again.

633
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,670
Alright, alright.

634
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,780
I'll stop.

635
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,200
Just keep on losing money.

636
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,740
Let’s see how long you can keep up with the payments.

637
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,500
Stop drinking.

638
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,670
Hey!

639
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,680
Are you trying to boss me around now?

640
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,640
Xie.

641
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,320
What's going on with you?

642
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,290
You were the one begging us for wholesale,

643
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,450
and now, you're bringing it back for a refund.

644
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,180
It's been over ten days since you bought these goods.

645
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,170
We really shouldn't be refunding you for all of these.

646
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
No.

647
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,460
As you know, I’ve only just started in this line of work.

648
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,860
I don't know what sells well and what doesn't.

649
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,350
I, I, I...

650
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,280
Could you please...

651
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,870
give me a refund?

652
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,140
All my money is tied up in this.

653
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,330
You've been working on the river for so many years.

654
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,750
Don't you know what seafarers need?

655
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,470
Well...

656
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,860
I thought I knew.

657
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,270
You see, when I was working on boats,

658
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,370
we were all drinking

659
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,130
bottled water like these.

660
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,020
And this bread,

661
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,740
these were all essentials on board.

662
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,510
I stocked up on three boxes, and guess what?

663
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
I've only sold five or six packets of this bread.

664
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,740
I...

665
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,140
So I'm asking you...

666
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,400
Back in your day,

667
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,970
making money on the canal was so easy.

668
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,060
Seafaring is such a tough job now.

669
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,990
Who’d be willing to buy bottled water like this on the ship?

670
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,230
Or bread for that matter?

671
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,390
Forget it, Xie.

672
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,200
For old times' sake,

673
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,320
I'll give you a refund.

674
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,520
Okay, great.

675
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,720
Thank you, thank you.

676
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,730
Xie!

677
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,920
We can't take back this bread.

678
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,290
Why can't you take it back?

679
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,150
This bread has an expiration date.

680
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,410
It's only good for about ten days or so.

681
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,030
It might have already expired.

682
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,850
That's impossible.

683
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,640
These are still sealed.

684
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,110
Look!

685
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,470
This one expires tomorrow.

686
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,860
No way.

687
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,190
We really can't take this back.

688
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,060
No, no.

689
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,580
Y-You listen to me first.

690
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,040
I mean, if these items were to be

691
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,800
displayed in your store,

692
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,580
it will probably sell out in a day.

693
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,290
But with me, they'll just go to waste.

694
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,390
That won't do.

695
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,670
Nowadays, customers always check the expiration date.

696
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,570
No, I won't take it back.

697
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,260
How about this?

698
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,450
I'll give you a refund

699
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,670
for all of the drinks.

700
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,480
Give it to me!

701
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,050
Stop drinking!

702
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,830
You're drinking every day!

703
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,950
It's fine to drink occasionally.

704
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,940
Do you still want your liver?

705
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,570
You misbehave as soon as Mom leaves.

706
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,470
How will she go out without worrying about you in the future?

707
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,410
Give it to me!

708
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,140
Give it to me!

709
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,340
I'll beat you to death!

710
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,280
I... I...

711
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:06,590
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

712
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,490
Okay.

713
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,550
Class dismissed.

714
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,700
Stand up!

715
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,710
Goodbye, Sir.

716
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,760
Want some grilled sausages?

717
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,360
My treat.

718
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:08,950
No, thanks.

719
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll have some.

720
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,510
Hurry up, you two.

721
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,640
I'll wait for you up ahead.

722
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,110
Boss!

723
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,860
Two grilled sausages, please.

724
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,910
Alright!

725
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,620
These chicken strips look pretty good.

726
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,880
You want some?

727
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,180
If you're treating, I'll have some.

728
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,420
Fine, I'll treat you.

729
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,190
One more chicken strips too.

730
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Coming right up!

731
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,760
So you're Xie Wanghe.

732
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,940
What's the matter?

733
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,170
Beat him up!

734
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,950
Whack!

735
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
What's going on?

736
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,770
What are you doing?

737
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,900
Run! Run!

738
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,050
Wanghe, are you alright?

739
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,460
What happened?

740
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,080
What's this all about?

741
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,700
Who did you offend?

742
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,770
How would I know?

743
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,670
Is your hand injured?

744
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,820
-Sir.
-Sir.

745
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,590
it's been taken care of.

746
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,980
I don't want that 10,000 yuan anymore.

747
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,040
Consider it as medical expenses for that kid.

748
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,270
Hai is so generous!

749
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:33,960
Generous.

750
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,080
Thank you, Hai.

751
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,220
Hai, if something like this happens again,

752
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,070
just give us a call.

753
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,580
We'll take care of it for you directly.

754
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,540
No rush.

755
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,710
Let me think about how to deal with that girl.

756
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,350
I personally

757
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,660
don't lack money,

758
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,660
but I'm lacking my pride.

759
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:08,159
[Floating Supermarket]

760
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,790
Flower Street Floating Supermarket!

761
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,750
We have cigarettes, alcohol, snacks, daily necessities,

762
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,260
rice, oil, and vegetables,

763
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,070
One-stop shopping,

764
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,070
fast and affordable.

765
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,739
We warmly welcome you!

766
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,179
Mon, don't be like this!

767
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,989
I don't want to live anymore!

768
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,550
Mom, no!

769
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,080
Don't jump, Mom!

770
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,940
What should we do, Boss?

771
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,980
Help!

772
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,469
Save my mom, please!

773
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,880
Dock now! Dock now!

774
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,560
Be careful, Boss!

775
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,340
Save her!

776
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:35,960
Help!

777
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,380
Mom!

778
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,670
Mom!

779
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,620
Mom, hang on!

780
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,219
I'll get you out of there.

781
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,260
Don't move, stay still!

782
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:56,870
Mom!

783
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,460
Mom!

784
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,190
How is she?

785
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,670
Is she okay?

786
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,910
Is... Is she alright?

787
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,540
Mom!

788
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,150
Mom!

789
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:24,910
Is she okay?

790
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,080
Is she alright?

791
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:26,630
Come on, come on.

792
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,690
Sit up.

793
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,270
Are you okay?

794
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,140
You scared me!

795
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,730
You really scared me!

796
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,350
Are you alright, Boss?

797
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,590
Why would you do something like that?

798
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,550
Put this on.

799
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,120
How do you feel?

800
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,870
Are you feeling better?

801
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,700
That was too...

802
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,040
too dangerous.

803
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank goodness it was you.

804
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,550
Here's your medicine.

805
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,230
Thank you.

806
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,600
How are you?

807
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,520
Fractured ribs

808
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,530
and a fractured left arm.

809
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,010
Good thing it's your left hand that's injured.

810
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to even do your homework.

811
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,340
Do these fractures count as internal injuries?

812
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,010
No, it doesn't.

813
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,840
Think about it carefully.

814
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,070
Who did you offend?

815
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,360
Who could I have offended?

816
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,170
Could it be that guy who promised Fenghua commercials?

817
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,570
He asked us for money before, and we didn't give it to him.

818
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,600
We even threatened him.

819
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,650
Regardless of whether it was those guys or not,

820
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,550
we can't let Fenghua know about this.

821
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,490
Why?

822
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,880
With that pig brain of hers,

823
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,240
she won't be able to help with anything.

824
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,710
if she finds out, she'll just cry.

825
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,990
It's annoying.

826
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,560
If it really was them,

827
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,580
we should just report it to the police.

828
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,470
Your injuries are considered severe.

829
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,390
He'll be sentenced once caught.

830
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,320
Evidence?

831
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,140
There are cameras at the school entrance.

832
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,630
There are cameras at the school entrance,

833
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,760
but not there.

834
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,950
If they had already decided to beat me up,

835
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,510
would they leave any evidence?

836
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,040
There are many ways to get revenge.

837
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,440
But I'm not sure

838
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,430
what they might do if they get desperate.

839
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,840
The key is that Fenghua is around.

840
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,990
If they target her, it could be troublesome.

841
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,860
But what should we do then?

842
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,170
Just take a beating for nothing?

843
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,620
Don't worry about that.

844
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,550
I, Xie Wanghe, can tolerate anything,

845
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,890
but I won't be taken advantage of.

846
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,660
Let's align on how we will explain what happened today.

847
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,050
With our families,

848
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,570
just say that I fell while playing basketball.

849
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,500
Whatever you do, don't say I got beaten up.

850
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,030
With my dad's temper,

851
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,350
if he finds out what really happened,

852
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,520
he might go after those guys with a knife.

853
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,490
Who hit you?

854
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,320
Nobody hit me.

855
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,350
I fell while playing basketball.

856
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,570
Nonsense!

857
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,740
You disappeared right after school today.

858
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,290
I checked the basketball courts, and no one was there.

859
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,560
Tell me, who did it?

860
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,910
Can you be more reasonable?

861
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,870
I really just fell while playing basketball.

862
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,060
Was it Hai?

863
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,870
No.

864
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,260
So it's him.

865
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,270
He asked me for money before and I didn't give him any.

866
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,120
So he went after you.

867
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,590
It really wasn't.

868
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,960
Can you stop crying, please?

869
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,900
Can you shut up for a while?

870
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,360
You're giving me a headache.

871
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,350
You got hit on the head?

872
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,710
Let me see if it hurts.

873
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,910
Can you stop being so mushy?

874
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,690
How am I being mushy?

875
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,670
Alright, everything's fine.

876
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,250
Take this.

877
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,120
I'll hold him.

878
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,830
Don't press on my hand.

879
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,790
Don't press on my hand.

880
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,790
D-Don't touch me.

881
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,210
My dad!

882
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,340
Xie Wanghe!

883
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:47,870
Uncle.

884
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,200
What brings you here?

885
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,890
You got yourself into this state just from a fight?

886
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,860
What fight? It wasn't a fight.

887
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,260
I fell while playing basketball.

888
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,540
How did you fall?

889
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,680
Well...

890
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,710
I was pushed from behind while going for a rebound

891
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,470
and fell to the ground.

892
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,230
Is that so?

893
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,390
Yeah, that's right.

894
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,390
Yes, yes, that's correct.

895
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,640
We can testify that's what happened.

896
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,680
Don't worry, Uncle.

897
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,260
We're good boys who never fight.

898
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,970
You sure know how to take a fall.

899
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,270
Landing on your left arm and right cheek at the same time.

900
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,210
What kind of posture is that?

901
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,710
Someone demonstrate it for me?

902
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,940
Left arm...

903
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,460
So, he was going for a layup, then got pushed, and...

904
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,610
So, were you alone this time?

905
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,560
Who beat you up?

906
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,760
How many of them were there, and what do they do?

907
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,710
I told you, it wasn't a fight.

908
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,150
I know what I'm doing.

909
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:50,890
You don't have to worry about it.

910
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,760
You know what you're doing?

911
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,520
But getting beaten up like this?

912
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,510
You're a hollow log that

913
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,520
is only good for firewood.

914
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,160
Let's go home.

915
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,390
My ribs hurt too.

916
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,720
Then get on.

917
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,590
Come on.

918
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,140
Get on.

919
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:07,970
Come.

920
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,910
It’s embarrassing with so many people watching.

921
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,170
Cut the crap. Get on.

922
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,100
Hurry up!

923
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,650
Gently, gently.

924
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,290
Bring my bicycle back for me, will you?

925
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,660
Take it easy, Dad.

926
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:46,800
Alright.

927
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:47,790
Okay, okay.

928
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,390
You lie down first.

929
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,910
What are you waiting for?

930
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,270
Go, go, go.

931
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,510
Go home.

932
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,920
Just go home!

933
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,920
Fenghua.

934
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,330
G-Go home.

935
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,230
I won't.

936
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,070
I have nothing to do at home anyway.

937
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,080
Who on earth beat you up like this?

938
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,960
How pathetic.

939
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,820
Wanghe,

940
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,610
What do you want to eat?

941
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,680
I'll ask my mom to make it.

942
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,630
Please just go home quickly.

943
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,990
Can you stop hovering around me?

944
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,790
No way.

945
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,230
Well...

946
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,970
A snack for you if you are hungry.

947
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,750
Thank you.

948
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,190
Where are you going?

949
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,360
Why should I report everything I do to you?

950
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,140
He's back?

951
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,000
Yes.

952
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,860
-He just got carried back.
-Where is Wanghe?

953
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,830
He got carried back?

954
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,250
Carried?

955
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,070
Boss, how is Wanghe?

956
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,520
That kid’s tough as nails.

957
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,690
He'll be fine in a few days.

958
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,840
It's not that easy to recover.

959
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,450
It takes a hundred days to heal bones and muscles.

960
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,080
I'll make him some pig’s trotter soup for dinner

961
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,820
to strengthen his bones.

962
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,890
Yes.

963
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,440
You're treating him like your son-in-law.

964
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,860
Of course.

965
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,410
Granny.

966
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,850
Please have this.

967
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,550
Here.

968
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,590
You have a business to run.

969
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,070
Just have some.

970
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,830
I had overstocked

971
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,890
and it's not selling.

972
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,090
Maotian said it won't sell,

973
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,850
but you didn't believe him, did you?

974
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,300
A lesson learned the hard way.

975
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,250
No one’s money comes easily.

976
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,800
That... that's right.

977
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,560
You are right.

978
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,310
Just take it.

979
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,730
Share it around.

980
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,920
Ask me for more when you're done.

981
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,260
Okay, I'll visit Wanghe again.

982
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,050
Tell me if you need anything.

983
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,670
Look, take a look yourself.

984
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,510
I didn't know all of this bread would be so hard to sell.

985
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,470
My heart aches for you

986
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,190
and for our family.

987
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,390
If you continue this way,

988
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,510
how are we going to live?

989
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,750
So much nagging.

990
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,620
I know I did wrong, okay?

991
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,920
You nag all day.

992
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,870
Have you considered how hard I've been working?

993
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,680
We’ve put so much money into this.

994
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,610
All of it is hard-earned.

995
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,360
And now, you're just giving it all away.

996
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,820
Can you be more careful?

997
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,970
Haikuo!

998
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,590
Haikuo!

999
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,220
Come.

1000
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,340
Uncle, what's wrong?

1001
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,100
Are you looking for me?

1002
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,690
Why did you all get into a fight?

1003
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,420
We didn't fight.

1004
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,000
He fell while playing basketball.

1005
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,220
How many of them were there?
