1
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,310
Boss!

2
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,430
One bowl of tofu pudding, please.

3
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,710
Fenghua, why are you back?

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,240
Auntie.

5
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,840
Auntie.

6
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,360
We'd like a bowl too.

7
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,000
Wanghe, Xingchi, Haikuo!

8
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,870
How did you all get back?

9
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,430
By car.

10
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,960
It must have been a tiring journey.

11
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,750
Hurry, hurry.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,520
Go home first.

13
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Let your family know you're back.

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,430
Come back to my shop for tofu pudding later.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,470
Are we closing?

16
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,400
At least for now.

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,150
This is great!

18
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,190
Are you back for the Mid-Autumn Festival?

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,520
I missed you.

20
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,150
This is wonderful!

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,430
Eat up quickly.

22
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,470
This...

23
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,680
Look at you.

24
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,240
Coming all this way just to visit.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,430
You're really something.

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,710
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,430
I wanted to come back for a family reunion dinner.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,430
You're busy,

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,470
and we can video chat now.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
It's the same wherever you are.

31
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,680
Exactly.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
How about I go back to Beijing now?

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,120
Don't you dare.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,400
Here.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,710
Have some buns.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,150
Come.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,630
Okay.

38
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,400
It's hot.

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,800
How long are you staying this time?

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,240
I have to leave tomorrow.

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,360
Leaving tomorrow?

42
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,280
What’s the point of making this trip back here?

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,150
Work's been hectic.

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,030
This time, it was Wanghe who helped arrange time off too.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Otherwise, I couldn't have come.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,590
It's good to be busy.

47
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,910
Being busy...

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
means the company values you more.

49
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,150
They're willing to give you more responsibilities.

50
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,280
Grandpa, Wanghe is now my boss.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,520
Xingchi and I work under him.

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,079
Right, this boss of yours...

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
How is he treating you?

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Pretty good.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,590
He’s been a big help to the two of us at work.

56
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,400
We can learn a lot from him.

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,030
What about his personal life?

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,120
Their personal lives aren’t as good as mine.

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,870
They're both single.

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,710
They need to learn from me in this aspect.

61
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,630
These days, your grandson also has

62
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,400
someone to come home to after work.

63
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,800
Dad, did you hear that?

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,630
Your grandson

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,470
is shamelessly bragging and showing off.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
It's better to be like you.

67
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,000
As a single, you're free.

68
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,710
Cut it out.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,120
Alright, I'm done talking.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
I'll go prepare some food for you.

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,910
Ask them if there's anything they want to eat.

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay, thanks, Dad.

73
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,560
Don't be like your dad.

74
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh yes, Grandpa.

75
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,600
My girlfriend bought you some mooncakes.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Really?

77
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,190
They're from Daoxiangcun.

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
That's nice.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,630
I'm off to work.

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,560
Our son just got back.

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,360
Why can't you have a chat with him and go later?

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
It's not like he doesn't have a phone.

83
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,630
Can't we chat on the phone?

84
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,390
It's fine, just go ahead.

85
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm off then.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,950
Come home early after work.

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,000
Where else could I go?

88
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,510
Do you two still argue these days?

89
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,120
What arguments?

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
We're too old for that now.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,270
Just thinking about it is exhausting.

92
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,159
Don't worry, everything's fine.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
Don't just share the good news and leave out the bad.

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
You're the one who only shares good news.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,830
With all that you've experienced in Beijing,

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
you nearly gave me a heart attack.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,750
You know that?

98
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,560
Mom.

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Your son is on the right path now.

100
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,680
Let me tell you.

101
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,680
In just two years,

102
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,120
all the things I bragged about before

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,070
will be fulfilled.

104
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,950
There's never enough money to be made.

105
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,160
As long as you stay on the right path,

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
your mom will be at peace.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,480
I know.

108
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,800
Have an egg.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,830
Granny Ma.

110
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,040
Fenghua has come back from Beijing.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,110
She's here to see you.

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
How quickly time flies.

113
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,390
In the blink of an eye,

114
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,870
it's been 7 years since Granny Ma passed away.

115
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,600
The same goes for Siyi.

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,480
She still hasn't contacted you?

117
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,750
That ungrateful girl.

118
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,630
I wonder if she’s doing well

119
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,830
on her own out there.

120
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,830
You'd think at least during the holidays,

121
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,560
she'd send a greeting.

122
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
All that worry for nothing.

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,830
She must have her reasons.

124
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,480
If she has her reasons, she should say so.

125
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
You were such close friends,

126
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,270
yet she left without a word.

127
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,950
Even the closest relationships

128
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,390
can't withstand such torment.

129
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
I believe that

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,560
one day,

131
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,950
when she's worn out from wandering around,

132
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,600
she'll come back.

133
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,120
Who knows if we'll still be around by then.

134
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,510
By the time she returns,

135
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,120
this courtyard might...

136
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,160
already be emptied.

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,950
Fenghua, Auntie.

138
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,240
My dad's treating everyone to lunch, so please come.

139
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,480
Alright.

140
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,800
I want to eat soft-braised eel,

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
braised shredded tofu...

142
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,000
Granny Ma,

143
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
it's Mid-Autumn Festival.

144
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,310
We're all together now.

145
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,840
Squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

146
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,320
Here it comes!

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
Squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
Grandpa, don't drink too much.

149
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,510
Okay, I don't need you to tell me.

150
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,550
By the way, come back often.

151
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,320
Come back and visit us often.

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,120
Come back often.

153
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,670
Come back often.

154
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,150
But...

155
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,440
He has a lot of business in Beijing.

156
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,550
Welcome, Mayor.

157
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,200
Happy holidays.

158
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,510
Cheers!

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,360
Today...

160
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,080
There's more good news.

161
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,240
The comprehensive upgrading and renovation of our Flower Street

162
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,080
has already begun.

163
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
Upgrade? To what?

164
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,150
It's exactly this courtyard

165
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,480
where we are all living now.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
Houses that have fallen into disrepair will,

167
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,790
in principle, be renovated on-site.

168
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,000
On-site?

169
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,720
Then, then...

170
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,440
Do we need to move out?

171
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,750
Currently, the plan

172
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,870
has been submitted.

173
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,960
Let's try to make plans

174
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,080
and minimise disruption to your daily lives.

175
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,000
That's great!

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
When will it start?

177
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,870
If everything goes as planned,

178
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,600
next month.

179
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,120
That's so soon!

180
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
That is really quick and productive!

181
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,150
Indeed!

182
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,630
This is great news that deserves celebration.

183
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,320
Renovation...

184
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
What will it be like after the renovation?

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,270
I don't know, they're still planning.

186
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,120
But they'll most likely

187
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
try to preserve the original appearance of the old buildings as much as possible.

188
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,910
Does our courtyard count as an old building?

189
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,510
It should be.

190
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,720
My grandpa said

191
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,390
the main hall is over 200 years old.

192
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,550
As for Granny Ma's residence,

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
county records say it once produced a successful imperial examination candidate.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,750
What about my house?

195
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,600
It produced servants.

196
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,320
No, for real though.

197
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
Granny Ma lives in the main hall,

198
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,790
so that's the master's room.

199
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,790
Your house and mine are the peripheral rooms,

200
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
where the maids and servants lived.

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,240
No wonder my grades were poor when I was young.

202
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,910
So it’s an issue of feng shui.

203
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,200
If I had lived in the same room as Siyi back then,

204
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,030
I might have gotten into a 985 university.

205
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,600
I think even if Siyi had been admitted, she might not have gone.

206
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,870
I remember she told me before the college entrance exam

207
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,790
that she thinks experience from traveling is more valuable than reading countless books.

208
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
And over these years,

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,510
she's been proving this saying with her actions.

210
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,320
You knew Siyi would leave?

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,550
I guessed that it was a possibility.

212
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,440
Why didn't you tell us back then?

213
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,960
With Siyi's personality,

214
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,150
what good would it have done to say anything?

215
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,200
Could we have kept her from leaving?

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,840
I used to worry a lot about Siyi too.

217
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,320
I was worried she'd suffer out there alone,

218
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,480
or be mistreated.

219
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
But I don't think so anymore.

220
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,440
Just recently,

221
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,510
together with Grandpa Zhou, Uncle Shao, and my dad,

222
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,240
we went on a business trip.

223
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,600
It was to trace the Shao family's ancestral footsteps.

224
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,840
It wasn't really that far,

225
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,600
but along the way,

226
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,480
I felt so happy

227
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
and excited.

228
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,440
I felt that it was the first time I truly

229
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,150
experienced the joy of traveling.

230
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,240
I believe it's the same for Siyi.

231
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,720
As long as you have hope

232
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,320
and a goal,

233
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,390
when you are on the road,

234
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,200
no matter how tired or difficult it gets for you,

235
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,070
you'll feel that

236
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,240
your heart is beating,

237
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,790
and life has its purpose.

238
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,910
Come on.

239
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,320
A toast

240
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
to Siyi, who's far away.

241
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,790
To Siyi.

242
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
To Siyi.

243
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,630
I'm fine.

244
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,390
Sit down, sit down.

245
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,440
Is that okay?

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,510
Okay.

247
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,000
Alright.

248
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

249
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Fenghua.

250
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,670
Here,

251
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,440
have a tangerine.

252
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,670
The new ones are really sweet.

253
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,910
Thanks, Mom.

254
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,080
Stop watching.

255
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,120
Chat with me for a bit.

256
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,910
Every time we talk on the phone, you're always in such a rush.

257
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,360
You hang up before we're even done talking.

258
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,200
Well, go ahead.

259
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,440
Be honest with me.

260
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,790
Do you have a boyfriend?

261
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,440
What do you mean 'ah'?

262
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm your mother.

263
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,720
Your eyes can't fool me.

264
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,550
What's wrong with my eyes?

265
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440
They are pretty normal.

266
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,550
Come on, tell me.

267
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,120
There's no one, really.

268
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,150
I'm so busy I barely have time to eat,

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,630
let alone find a boyfriend.

270
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,390
So you plan to stay single forever?

271
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,870
Well, I can't force it if there's no one.

272
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm not the type to simply settle.

273
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,030
Well, your dad and I just settled for each other.

274
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,790
Aren't we doing fine now?

275
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,750
Fine.

276
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,910
I'll just find someone randomly then.

277
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Don't be picky when the time comes,

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,670
complaining about this and that.

279
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,630
That won't do.

280
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,200
Character comes first.

281
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,390
I don't care about anything else.

282
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,960
Well, rest assured,

283
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,080
he has pretty good character.

284
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
Looks like you’re busted!

285
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,600
So, do you have a boyfriend?

286
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,630
Do you have a boyfriend?

287
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,630
You tricked me!

288
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,030
Come clean with me. What does he do?

289
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,910
How old is he?

290
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,480
Do you have any photos?

291
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,000
Hurry.

292
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,670
Do you have any photos?

293
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,480
Let me see!

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
Mom! Mom!

295
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,870
I haven't decided if I want to be with him yet.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,150
Don't pressure me.

297
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,670
Why haven't you decided?

298
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,480
It's complicated.

299
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm really looking forward to it,

300
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,390
but I also feel scared.

301
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
Give me some time.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,910
When I've figured it out,

303
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,720
I'll tell you right away.

304
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,320
I promise.

305
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
What else are you waiting for?

306
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,790
Worrying about this and that.

307
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,840
By the time you figure it out,

308
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,750
it'll be too late.

309
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,870
It won't be.

310
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,840
Why not?

311
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,670
What era are we living in?

312
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,790
Who's going to wait for you?

313
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,630
If you have feelings, just go for it.

314
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,840
You have to capture the opportunity.

315
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,030
If you don't, they'll turn around and find someone else.

316
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,550
How does that song lyric go?

317
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,390
"I've been waiting for you until my heart aches,

318
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,550
been waiting for you until I'm gone."

319
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,630
They'll be long gone.

320
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,200
You silly child.

321
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,910
Seriously.

322
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,440
Wait and wait.

323
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,120
Here, Son. This one has roe in it.

324
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,840
Eat more.

325
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
Just come back when you crave for it.

326
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Eat more.

327
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Tell me.

328
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
How much money have you saved?

329
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,870
You mean savings?

330
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,870
Any kind of money.

331
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,030
We just want to know how much money you have.

332
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,240
This way, we'll know how much money we need to give you

333
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,550
when you get married.

334
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,080
Right?

335
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,480
Why should you give me money?

336
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,870
How can I ask you guys for money when it's my wedding?

337
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,510
Say no more.

338
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,630
Just tell us the truth.

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,150
How much money

340
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,480
do you really have?

341
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,320
I don't have much cash.

342
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,870
About 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

343
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,440
I used the rest of my money to buy stocks.

344
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,750
Which stock did you buy?

345
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,000
Moutai.

346
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,550
And I have a car.

347
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,600
It's gifted by my boss.

348
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,320
That's not much.

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,910
Wait.

350
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,600
So...

351
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,960
all these years you've been out there,

352
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,790
what have you been up to?

353
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,440
Look at you.

354
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,320
Pretending

355
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,840
to be a successful person around us?

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
I have options in Bee.

357
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,150
Quite a lot of them, actually.

358
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
Once the company gets listed,

359
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,790
I'll have complete financial independence.

360
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,390
What if it doesn't get listed?

361
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,960
We could do a merger and acquisition.

362
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,030
As long as this company doesn't go bankrupt,

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,870
I won't be poor.

364
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,440
So you mean...

365
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,870
you're really a successful businessman?

366
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,480
How could I fake that, Mom?

367
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,960
Look at our son.

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
He's so smart.

369
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,150
He's not the kind to be taken advantage of.

370
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,030
Son, have you ever thought about

371
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,910
coming back to develop your career here?

372
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,910
Come back?

373
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,150
What for?

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,390
You see, Mayor Gu said

375
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,120
that

376
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,390
once our canal makes it onto the World Heritage List,

377
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,360
the development potential for Flower Street will be huge.

378
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,790
You're a successful entrepreneur now.

379
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,790
A successful businessman.

380
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,870
I don't consider it an accomplishment if you enjoy success alone.

381
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,870
If you are really capable,

382
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,630
come back and lead everyone to make a fortune.

383
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,030
As the advertisement goes,

384
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,030
"It's only beneficial when it delivers for everyone."

385
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,440
Think about it.

386
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Think about it.

387
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,070
It's because you two miss me, right?

388
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,030
You can come to Beijing.

389
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,150
Why should we go to Beijing?

390
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
To live with me.

391
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Live?

392
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
I'm not used to living in Beijing.

393
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,390
I'm used to it.

394
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,080
Come on.

395
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
Come on, Mom.

396
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
T-The wine is finished.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
All you know is drink.

398
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,510
Go buy me another pot.

399
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,840
I want one that has been aged 8 years.

400
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,550
You've been drinking every day.

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,390
I'll go.

402
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,270
I'll go.

403
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,600
Do you know which shop it is?

404
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,320
Of course. How can I forget?

405
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,840
Tell him

406
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,510
it's me who's buying, and keep it on my tab.

407
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,600
What do you think?

408
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
I won't go to Beijing.

409
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,510
I know you can't leave the canal.

410
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,870
Did you notice

411
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,510
there's something different about him this time?

412
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,670
What's different?

413
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
Aren't you afraid of falling down?

414
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,480
It's okay. I can swim.

415
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,110
You didn't go home for dinner?

416
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,160
I did. What about you?

417
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,830
I came out to buy wine for my dad.

418
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,110
Are you feeling down?

419
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,510
No.

420
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Then why are you sitting here?

421
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,310
People might think

422
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
you want to jump into the river.

423
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,680
In Beijing,

424
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,510
I always feel like I'm a passerby.

425
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,920
I always feel restrained.

426
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,680
But when I'm home,

427
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,270
I feel empowered.

428
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,480
I feel like I'm not afraid of anything.

429
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,830
There's nothing I wouldn't say

430
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,480
and nothing that I wouldn't do.

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,510
Tell me about it then.

432
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,960
Xie Wanghe.

433
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,480
Do you have a crush on me?

434
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,680
Since when?

435
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,200
Does it matter?

436
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
Yes, very.

437
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,160
Let me think.

438
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,640
Yesterday?

439
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,160
I can't remember

440
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,960
when it was exactly.

441
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,440
Which year?

442
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,830
Before we went to Beijing

443
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,720
or after?

444
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,750
After.

445
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,160
In my third year of college,

446
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,680
I was working on a travel marketing project with others.

447
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
But they all skipped town.

448
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,350
We lost all our money.

449
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Stop drinking.

450
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,640
Go home.

451
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,400
Fenghua.

452
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,030
Give it to me!

453
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,960
Drink with me.

454
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,070
You, stop drinking!

455
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,000
Just have a drink with me.

456
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,920
Why are you drinking?

457
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,550
Go home now!

458
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,270
Take your glasses.

459
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,240
Stop drinking!

460
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Go home!

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,240
It's none of your business!

462
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,000
Entrepreneurship

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
is never smooth sailing.

464
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,030
If you fail, just learn from the lesson.

465
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,160
Then why is it me who fails every time?

466
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,000
Why?

467
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,830
If I only failed once, you could say it's bad luck.

468
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,200
But I failed twice, and then three times.

469
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,680
I've failed every time.

470
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,270
I'm just a huge joke!

471
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,230
When I was little, who's the one that told me

472
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,480
we should get up

473
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
from wherever we fell?

474
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,350
Even if you can't pick yourself up,

475
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,550
I'm here with you.

476
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
As long as you still want to win,

477
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,270
and you still have that will,

478
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,880
you won't fail

479
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,470
in the future.

480
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
Just because of that?

481
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,160
Your motivational words

482
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,440
didn't do much for me.

483
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,110
Those two slaps were what

484
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
knocked some sense into me.

485
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
Are you a masochist?

486
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,920
You just knew?

487
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,310
I should be even harsher to you in the future.

488
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,400
This way,

489
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,920
you'll like me more.

490
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
So, do you like me?

491
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,000
This atmosphere.

492
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,070
Did you have this all planned...

493
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you.

494
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,350
For what?

495
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,960
For not avoiding.

496
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,110
I'm on a bridge.

497
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,200
Where can I hide?

498
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,160
Jump into the river?

499
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,960
No.

500
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,720
It wasn't fair for me.

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
What do you want then?

502
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,790
We're even now.

503
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,830
So...

504
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,510
are we boyfriend and girlfriend now?

505
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,720
We've kissed.

506
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,790
How could we not be?

507
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,550
Let's not tell anyone yet.

508
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,400
Let's keep it a secret for now.

509
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,270
Why?

510
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,240
It was too sudden.

511
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,400
I've got a lot on my mind.

512
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,640
Okay.

513
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
Go back and think about it.

514
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,440
Just don't regret it when you wake up tomorrow.

515
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,030
It's possible.

516
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,160
Good night.

517
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,030
Good night.

518
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,590
Why are you still up?

519
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,510
Mom.

520
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,200
Has Dad

521
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,750
liked anyone else before?

522
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,160
How dare he?

523
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
I mean before.

524
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
Before you knew each other.

525
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,000
What does that have to do with me?

526
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,070
As long as he promised

527
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,110
he'd only love me from now on.

528
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,920
So,

529
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,720
you think it's okay even if

530
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,880
he has someone else in his heart?

531
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,240
I don't care who he has in his heart.

532
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,590
As long as he's by my side,

533
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,400
and I have his money in my pocket.

534
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,590
As for the rest, I can't care less.

535
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,880
I’ll just think of him as having an idol.

536
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,070
You're so open-minded.

537
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,160
Actually,

538
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,550
as the old saying goes,

539
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,640
"Soft fire makes sweet malt."

540
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,270
In life,

541
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,070
there are things that you will never understand.

542
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,110
And you'll hesitate

543
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,830
about what choice you should make.

544
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
So, you may as well not think about anything

545
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,200
or do anything.

546
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,720
Just let it be?

547
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,640
If you don't do anything, nothing will go wrong.

548
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
Don't worry.

549
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,480
Give it time.

550
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,270
Time will take care of everything for you.

551
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,920
Good girl, go to sleep.

552
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You'll have a day on the road tomorrow.

553
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,830
Here.

554
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,480
Mom, stop.

555
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,920
Stop putting more stuff in. There's not enough room.

556
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,270
Take it.

557
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,510
I still have to take two people in the backseats.

558
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,680
I'll put the water here.

559
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,030
And there's fruit too.

560
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,920
Take this back.

561
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,640
No one wants mooncakes.

562
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,480
You must take it.

563
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:26,830
This is...

564
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,400
I can buy everything in Beijing.

565
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
I know you can buy everything there,

566
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
but nothing is better than what you get from home.

567
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,070
Don't work so hard, you know?

568
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,880
Be careful, be careful.

569
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,240
I'll just load them up.

570
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,880
Wanghe.

571
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,920
Keep an eye on her.

572
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,310
Okay.

573
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,750
Make sure she eats on time and doesn't stay up late.

574
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,160
I'll keep a close eye on her every day.

575
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,790
Okay.

576
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
Every day?

577
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't have time every day.

578
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,880
Well, at least call me once a week.

579
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,480
All right, I will.

580
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,160
I heard you.

581
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,830
It’d be best if you could bring

582
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,920
someone home for Mom next time.

583
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,030
Haikuo!

584
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,030
Xingchi!

585
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,350
Hurry up, hurry up.

586
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,200
Coming.

587
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll try.

588
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,160
Go.

589
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,310
Give me that bag.

590
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,480
Dad.

591
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,960
What are you doing?

592
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,720
Why are you here?

593
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,830
Who are you decocting the medicine for?

594
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,480
Who is sick?

595
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,790
When are you leaving tomorrow?

596
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
In the morning.

597
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,110
Hey. I'm asking you.

598
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,960
Who is sick?

599
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,590
Your grandpa.

600
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,200
Grandpa?

601
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,030
Yes.

602
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,880
What's wrong with him?

603
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,720
He has Alzheimer's disease.

604
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,310
I didn't tell you

605
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,790
because I didn't want you to be worried.

606
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
It's not as serious as you think.

607
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,550
It's common for people to get

608
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,400
this disease with age.

609
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,680
Does Grandpa know?

610
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
Of course not.

611
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,110
I won't leave tomorrow.

612
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,550
Just leave tomorrow as planned.

613
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,070
Get back to work.

614
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,240
I'm here.

615
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,200
By the way,

616
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,510
don't tell anyone else.

617
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,960
What's wrong?

618
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,790
How much did you drink last night?

619
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,750
Why are you so quiet?

620
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm tired.

621
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,310
Put on some music.

622
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,480
Okay.

623
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,960
Next,

624
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,750
your sweetheart from Flower Street

625
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,920
will sing you the song,

626
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,200
"Just Like You".

627
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,400
Ready, go.

628
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,680
♫I'm just like you♫

629
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,510
♫Strong like you♫

630
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,480
♫Trying my best to pursue my dream like you♫

631
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,240
Friends in the back, come on.

632
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,720
♫Even if I get hurt, even if there are ups and downs♫

633
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,880
♫Only after the storm will there be a charming fragrance♫

634
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,200
I think you should

635
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,790
redesign the homepage.

636
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,270
Retake photos of the dishes.

637
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,680
For food delivery,

638
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,110
presentation is just as important as taste.

639
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,920
Fine, I'll do as you say.

640
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,590
Alright, I'll be on my way.

641
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,270
Okay.

642
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,830
Have a seat.

643
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,480
No need, no need.

644
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,160
Be careful.

645
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,640
Go get busy.

646
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,830
Sure, sure.

647
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,960
Come, have some water.

648
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,480
Hurry.

649
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,030
Here, take this.

650
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,200
This is for you.

651
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Be careful next time, okay?

652
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,350
Grandpa.

653
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,110
Let me carry that for you.

654
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,510
Okay.

655
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,750
Let me take a photo for you,

656
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
alright?

657
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,790
I used to make more than 8,000 yuan a month.

658
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,720
But this month, I only made a bit over 6,000 yuan.

659
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,880
I made more than 7,000 yuan last month,

660
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,310
but only 3,000 yuan this month.

661
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,830
Hello, Chief.

662
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,200
Hello, Chief.

663
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,550
Let’s have a meeting.

664
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
What is Xingchi trying to do?

665
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
Why is he only letting us take on 30 orders?

666
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,310
He said it's for our own good

667
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,070
as he didn't want us to be tired.

668
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,200
Isn't that crazy?

669
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,590
Are we here to do nothing?

670
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,510
Put it here.

671
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,160
Careful.

672
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Hold on a second.

673
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,270
I need some water.

674
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,920
Let me help you.

675
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,640
Be careful.

676
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,750
And this.

677
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,160
This year is a year full of challenges.

678
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,440
Facing fierce market competition,

679
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,160
the group's courier business has reached a new high.

680
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,070
Annual business volume has reached approximately 3 billion yuan,

681
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,960
with sorting efficiency improving by 17%.

682
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,510
We have further increased our market share,

683
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,000
and in turn, strengthening our leading position in this industry.

684
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,640
Could it not have been?

685
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
Everyone's exhausted.

686
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,920
If you ask me,

687
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
they shouldn't have invited

688
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,270
those celebrities for this celebratory gala.

689
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,030
They should invite us couriers.

690
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,720
Right, right.

691
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,400
We should get Fenghua to go.

692
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,640
You should totally go.

693
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,720
Look at how pretty you are.

694
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
What can I do?

695
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Fenghua looks great.

696
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,160
Fenghua, you should represent us couriers up there.

697
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,920
Stop kidding.

698
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
Let's keep working hard.

699
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,750
That day will come.

700
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,880
This year,

701
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,440
we've fought a good battle.

702
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,150
Next year,

703
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
we'll let the whole of Haidian know

704
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,360
which station is the most reliable.

705
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
Do you have confidence?

706
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,400
No.

707
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,480
No?

708
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,480
-Yes. 
 -Yes!

709
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,670
Fenghua.

710
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,710
They're just teasing you.

711
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,440
Then let's eat well and keep working.

712
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,360
Okay!

713
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,110
Let's eat, let's eat.

714
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,400
Fenghua, I'll go get you a bowl of soup.

715
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,960
Thank you, Auntie.

716
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,670
What are you doing?

717
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,230
Want some supper?

718
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,670
Let's spend New Year’s Eve together next week?

719
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,030
Permission granted. You may leave now.

720
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,480
You little brat, you really think you're Concubine Hua now?

721
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,630
Cheers to the last day of this year.

722
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Isn't Xiaohui coming?

723
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,360
She's working overtime.

724
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,230
She has a lot of work to do.

725
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,920
She's so busy, she doesn't even have time to come home.

726
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,550
Did you two fight again?

727
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,880
No.

728
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,590
She’s holding onto my payroll card.

729
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,920
She can spend my money however she wants.

730
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,880
Look at my attitude.

731
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,800
What can she buy with your salary?

732
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,630
It's all about the attitude.

733
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,760
You're single. What do you know?

734
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,960
That's right.

735
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,230
Attitude is the key.

736
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,630
What girls care about the most is undivided love.

737
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,440
Even if I'm the most ordinary girl in the world,

738
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,400
you can only like me.

739
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,440
Yes.

740
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,760
This is how it works in Korean dramas.

741
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,280
You still have time to watch Korean dramas?

742
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,880
We are so busy that we don't even have time to eat.

743
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,840
Hey.

744
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,070
Can't I have some spare time?

745
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,800
203's performance...

746
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,760
I know it's unsatisfactory.

747
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,110
Don't worry.

748
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,230
I've got an idea.

749
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,590
Things will change drastically after the New Year.

750
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,840
I'm worried that you'll be eliminated

751
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,440
before that change happens.

752
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
Are you here to pick a fight today?

753
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,280
Bro.

754
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Your performance is not good.

755
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,590
Can't I say something about it?

756
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,670
If your performance was better,

757
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,000
would I even talk about it?

758
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,070
Do you have to...

759
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,550
Enough, shut up.

760
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,590
It's about to be New Year.

761
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,880
Come, have a toast.

762
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,480
Come on.

763
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,280
In 2014,

764
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,280
a lot has happened to all of us.

765
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,320
Let's forget

766
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,030
all the bad things,

767
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:58,920
and keep up with

768
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,070
all the good things.

769
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,480
I hope all of us can

770
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,190
get a step closer to our dreams.

771
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,710
Come on, cheers, cheers!

772
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,190
Friends.

773
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,920
2014 is coming to an end.

774
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,440
Let's welcome 2015 together!

775
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,150
The countdown starts now.

776
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,550
Ten.

777
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,550
Nine.

778
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,320
Eight.

779
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,280
Seven.

780
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,400
Six.

781
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,400
Five.

782
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,190
Four.

783
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,000
Three.

784
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,920
Two.

785
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,510
One.

786
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,480
Happy New Year!

787
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,710
It's so beautiful!

788
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,030
Cheers.

789
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,800
Cheers.

790
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
Happy New Year.

791
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
Cheers!

792
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Cheers to our friendship!

793
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Happy New Year!

794
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,230
Come on!

795
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,070
This place is really nice.

796
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,510
What's wrong?

797
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,960
Is she drunk after only one drink?

798
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,190
Maybe she drank it too fast?

799
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,760
Did she have a drink prior?

800
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
203's delivery riders all obey Chief Shao's management.

801
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,590
We also think highly of him.

802
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,960
But...

803
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,670
looking at our commission for the past few months,

804
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,320
we have some complaints

805
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
about the current plans.

806
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,760
You think the commission is too low, right?

807
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,550
Indeed.

808
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,030
Chief Shao insists that

809
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,440
every delivery rider of 203

810
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,480
take no more than

811
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
30 orders a day.

812
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,280
But

813
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,590
in other areas,

814
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,030
the riders take at least over 40 orders a day.

815
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,190
Last month's champion station, 201,

816
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,510
the riders there took 48 orders a day.

817
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,030
We delivery riders also compare within each other.

818
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,070
As time goes by,

819
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,800
it's inevitable that we feel frustrated.

820
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,230
I see.

821
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,400
Keep following Xingchi's orders at work

822
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,480
for the time being.

823
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,360
You can go now.

824
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,510
Mr. Xie.

825
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,440
Go ahead.

826
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,320
Fenghua seems to be

827
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,280
in poor physical condition lately.

828
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,710
What's wrong with her?

829
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,710
She looks very pale recently.

830
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,070
My mom and my wife both saw her vomiting in secret.

831
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,150
At first,

832
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,360
we thought she was pregnant.

833
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,710
Don't talk nonsense.

834
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,030
When I changed her pillow cover,

835
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,510
I found that she lost a lot of hair.

836
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,590
And there was blood on her toothbrush.

837
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,400
These are all symptoms of a weakened immune system.

838
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,480
Got it. Go.

839
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,880
You already had symptoms.

840
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,630
Why did it take you more than half a year to come?

841
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,440
Besides dizziness,

842
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,400
I just have a headache from time to time.

843
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,920
There are no other symptoms.

844
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,230
Have you been vomiting?

845
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,110
Yes.

846
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,920
Occasionally.

847
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,550
Do you feel

848
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,360
your eyesight has declined?

849
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,590
A bit, I think.

850
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,190
But everyone's on their phones nowadays.

851
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,440
It's normal to see things a little blurry, isn't it?

852
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,230
I suggest

853
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,920
you do

854
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,840
a thorough brain examination.

855
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,510
Really?

856
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,280
Is it that serious?

857
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
I can't...

858
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,280
give you a definitive diagnosis.

859
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,480
You're still young.

860
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,280
Go get examined,

861
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,360
and we'll talk after the result comes out.

862
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,360
All right?

863
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,550
Chen Xiaoyu, Room 3.

864
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,480
I can go by myself this time.

865
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,760
Okay.

866
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,590
I'll wait for you outside.

867
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,590
Guo Jianshe, Room 6.

868
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,550
Coming.

869
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,320
Xia Fenghua, Examination Room 2.

870
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,440
What's up with you?

871
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,590
I'm sorry.
