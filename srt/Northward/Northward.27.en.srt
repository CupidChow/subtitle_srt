24

25

We've confirmed that

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,840
this ship was just an ordinary cargo ship.

27

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800

197

Eat up.

198
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,510
After eating, get back to work.

199
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,060
Alright.

200

201
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,910
Hurry up and eat.

Eat something.

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
I'm fine. You eat first.

208

209
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,140

They can deliver them after finishing eating.

212
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,010
It'll get cold if you don't eat now.

213
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,390
It's okay.

214
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Don't worry about me.

215
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,780
You…

216
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,690
♫The words you said linger in my mind♫

217
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,890

♫One last time♫

248
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,460
The extremely hot weather

249
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,440
ushers in the peak season for food delivery.

250
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,290
We expect that within a month,

251
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,720
our order volume will reach a new high.

252
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,420
Headquarters requires us

253
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,540
to take advantage of this opportunity

254
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
to become more competitive.

255
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,420
We should see this month

256
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,030
as the final battle

257
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,270
against other platforms.

258
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,230
Within this month, we need to

259
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,700
narrow the gap with other platforms

260
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040
and expand

261
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
Bee's market share.

262
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,030
We're having this meeting

263
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,480
to discuss

264
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,750
whether we should temporarily raise the commission

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,270
to boost the delivery riders' motivation.

266
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,580
An extra yuan per order.

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,200
I disagree.

268
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,270
Why?

269
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,870
The so-called temporary solution

270
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,200
can't be temporary.

271
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,040
If we raise it when it's over 38 degrees Celsius,

272
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,270
at what temperature will we lower it?

273
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,660
The reality is that

274
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,770
the commission is easy to raise

275
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,920
but hard to lower.

276
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,670
Once we raise it,

277
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,320
it'll become the new standard.

278
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,790
The money for the delivery riders

279
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,510
can't come from the customers

280
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,110
or the merchants.

281
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,210
It can only be deducted from our profits.

282
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
The current situation is that

283
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,540
our profits are as low as they can be.

284
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,070
If we give delivery riders

285
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,070
an extra yuan for each order,

286
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,770
the company will be losing money.

287
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,170
We can tell the delivery riders

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,120
that this extra yuan

289
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,550
is a high-temperature allowance.

290
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,390
High-temperature allowance?

291
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,100
What about a low-temperature allowance?

292
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,260
What about allowances for stormy weather?

293
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,440
Mr. Wanghe,

294
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,330
you'll only stay here for a year.

295
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,160
If you set such a high standard for us,

296
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,960
after you leave,

297
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,620
how are we supposed to move on?

298
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,560
Right?

299
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,630
If you insist on going your own way

300
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,880
and raising the commission,

301
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,750
I hope you can get the head office

302
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,610
to make rules about it.

303
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,070
Each district will

304
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,860
strictly follow the rules.

305
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,470
That's no problem.

306
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,570
Am I right, everyone?

307
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,500
Mr. Meng, what do you think?

308
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,220
Rules are rigid,

309
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,450
but people are flexible.

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
In fact,

311
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,910
in the company's commission standards,

312
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,690
there are already provisions

313
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,510
about temporarily raising the commission during extreme weather.

314
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,660
We're just specifying them.

315
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Let's do this.

316
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,610
Wanghe,

317
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,940
you'll be in charge of raising the commission.

318
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,090
But

319
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,070
after it cools down,

320
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,720
you need to lower

321
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,860
the commission back.

322
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,000
No problem, Mr. Meng.

323
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,980
Next,

324
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,510
our top priority

325
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,720
is to make preparations

326
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
to prevent heatstroke.

327
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,230
Each station

328
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,830
needs to prepare

329
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,910
heatstroke medicine and mung bean soup.

330
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,150
In this regard,

331
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Shao Xingchi's

332
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,770
Station 203 in Haidian District

333
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,960
has done a great job.

334
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,010
The delivery riders there are very satisfied.

335
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,600
Additionally,

336
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,570
the system needs to be optimized again.

337
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,570
Haikuo.

338
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,480
How long is the gap

339
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,660
between the time we give to delivery riders

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,800
and the time customers expect?

341
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,390
Usually three minutes.

342
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,320
The time shown to customers is 40 minutes,

343
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,700
while the time shown to delivery riders

344
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
is 37 minutes.

345
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,490
Mr. Meng,

346
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,350
I suggest we shorten the time

347
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,660
given to delivery riders by another minute.

348
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,880
Everyone,

349
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,380
great rewards will bring forth brave men.

350
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,260
If they can't do it, they don't have to take the order.

351
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,580
Wanghe,

352
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,870
simply shortening the system time

353
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,960
can only bring extensive growth.

354
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,390
Then what's your idea?

355
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,840
It's okay. Just speak your mind.

356
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
Mr. Meng.

357
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,810
The delivery riders of Bee

358
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,030
currently use third-party mapping services.

359
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,000
The odds of them providing the optimal routes

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
haven't reached 90% yet.

361
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,840
To some extent,

362
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,270
this has affected the delivery efficiency.

363
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,120
So I suggest

364
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,000
we launch our self-developed map ahead of schedule.

365
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
I've tested it.

366
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,850
It's already very stable.

367
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,970
It only needs final-stage debugging.

368
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Isn't that too risky?

369
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,340
Haikuo,

370
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,330
if you dare to take responsibility for your advice,

371
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,550
I'll dare to heed it.

372
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,670
Do you dare?

373
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,210
Of course.

374
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,070
If anything goes wrong with the self-developed map,

375
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll pack up and leave immediately.

376
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,600
Any other suggestions?

377
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,700
If not,

378
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,180
we'll proceed with this plan.

379
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,250
Meeting adjourned.

381
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,800
stay for a moment.

382
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,980
I want to talk with you.

383
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,600
Sit down.

384
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,420
You're more excellent than I thought.

385
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,470
You flatter me, Mr. Meng.

386
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,160
Are you interested in coming to the headquarters?

387
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,540
Headquarters?

388
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,190
To do what?

389
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,460
To be the Chief Technology Officer.

390
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,320
The previous CTO

391
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,060
was poached by Eat Well.

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,920
Well,

393
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,520
compared with having a headhunter poach someone,

394
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,530
I prefer

395
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,470
to promote someone in the company.

396
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,610
Mr. Meng,

397
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,110
Wanghe still needs help.

398
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,440
I need help too.

399
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,430
Haikuo,

400
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,900
you're a genius programmer.

401
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,460
Running around for business with him

402
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,820
is a waste of your talent.

403
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,980
How about this?

404
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,900
Think it over.

405
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,280
Come to me when you've made up your mind.

406
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,860
It's too sudden.

407
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,550
Please let me think about it.

408
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,900
Whether you come or not,

409
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,130
you must keep it a secret.

410
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,970
It involves backend data.

411
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,870
Safety first.

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,870

[Bee Delivery]

415
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,820
Mr. Meng just asked me…

416
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,030
to keep up the good work.

417
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,020
That's all.

418
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,990
He didn't mention anything about a raise?

419
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,980
No.

420
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,450
It's okay.

421
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,470
Keep working.

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,520
Once our self-developed map is running smoothly,

423
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,780
I'll apply for it for you.

424
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
Where's Xingchi?

425
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,060

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,820
Are you okay?

432
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,050
Sit down for a while.

433
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,060
I'm fine.

434
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,900
I didn't have breakfast this morning.

435
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,130
I think my blood sugar's low.

Oh, you silly girl.

437
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,320
How could you skip breakfast?

438
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,500
Have some water.

439
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm fine.

440
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,770
Why are you so worried?

Don't worry.

445
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,640
Finish the work you have on hand.

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,480
I must see it tomorrow.

447
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,680
Even if it means working overtime.

Mr. Xie,

449
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,650
working late?

450
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,480
I'll leave soon.

451
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,359
I'll head off then.

452
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,329
How's the progress on your end?

453
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,100
It's alright.

454
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,230
What do you mean by alright?

455
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,370
Where did you find those people?

456
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,520
They're all so lazy.

457
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,330
Working overtime is killing them.

458
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,640
Just pull your weight.

459
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,290
Why think so much?

460
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,510

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,890
Alright then.

You hold on.

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,160
I'm leaving.

464
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,470
Aren't you having dinner with us?

465
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,240
Another time.

Zhou Haikuo, you've changed.

469
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,040
You should date someone too.

470
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,920
I know you like being single,

471
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,360
but you can't stay single forever.

472
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,520
Get lost.

473
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,660
Do I look good?

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,190
Yes.

475
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,570
Do you like it?

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,670
If you do, let's buy it.

477
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,450
It's over 3,000 yuan. Too expensive.

478
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,410
It's fine.

479
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,240
This month, I have overtime pay

480
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,580
and a high-temperature allowance. I can afford it.

481
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,840
And then live off scraps?

482
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,640
I can always earn more in the future.

483
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,090
I'm competent anyway.

484
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,150
You haven't established yourself at Bee yet.

485
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,130
I have.

486
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,010
Mr. Meng had a private talk with me.

487
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,630
What did he say?

488
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,130
He wants me

489
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,680
to work at headquarters as the CTO.

490
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,260
Really?

491
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,340
What exactly did he say?

492
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,310
I didn't agree.

493
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,510
Why?

494
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,880
Wanghe brought me into the company.

495
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,120
I need to discuss this with him first.

496
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,750
Wanghe doesn't know how to code.

497
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,510
What's there to discuss with him?

498
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
You don't understand.

499
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,480
No.

500
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,070
I don't understand.

501
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,590
I don't understand anything.

502
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,550
Then from now on,

503
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,060
you don't need to tell me about these things anymore.

504
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,210
Wait.

505
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,480
What did I say?

506
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,510
Wait.

507
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,860
Why are you upset?

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,030
You're on your period?

509
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,690
How about I get you some hot water?

510
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,770
What do you want to eat?

511
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,510
My treat.

512
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,550
How about a barbecue?

513
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,500
I know

514
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,000
you and Wanghe are good friends,

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
and he's helped you a lot.

516
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,070
But you're an adult.

517
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,330
You can only depend on yourself in the future.

518
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,750
I don't want my husband

519
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,270
to be someone who can't even decide

520
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,050
the direction of his own career!

Stir-fried shredded eel.

524
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,430
Here's rice.

525
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,410
Two servings of rice.

526
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,570
Did you plant a bug on me?

527
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,930
I mentioned this morning that I wanted to eat hometown food,

528
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and you brought it to me.

529
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,270
Don't flatter yourself.

530
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,410
I want to eat it too.

531
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,110
Here.

532
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,760
Eat up.

533
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,890
How's it?

534
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,160
Not quite there,

535
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,110
but not bad.

536
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,720
Haikuo's grandpa used to say that

537
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,560
when you crave hometown food,

538
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,790
you're not missing the food

539
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,680
but feeling homesick.

540
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,530
What?

541
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,740
You feel homesick?

542
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Don't you miss home?

543
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:46,790
Occasionally,

544
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,680
when I feel wronged.

545
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,250
I barely think about it other times.

546
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,070
What about you?

547
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,510
How did Xiang Yu die?

548
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,350
Surrounded by enemies on all sides.

549
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,740
If a soldier keeps thinking about going home,

550
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,100
he'll lose the courage to fight.

551
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,790
I'm still fighting.

552
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,000
You're a girl.

553
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,640
You can be vulnerable sometimes,

554
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,880
but I can't.

555
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,400
Everyone under me is watching.

556
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,640
I can't let them see

557
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,590
my vulnerable side,

558
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
not even once.

559
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,350
I want to eat eel noodles.

560
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,240
I'll make some for you.

561
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,830
Please don't.

562
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,570
Given your cooking skills,

563
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,100
I'd have a fishy taste in my mouth afterward.

564
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,720
And I'd have to praise you against my better judgment.

565
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,680
What's Xingchi been up to lately?

566
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,240
His cooking skills aren't good either.

567
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,000
He learned to make eel noodles from Uncle Zhou.

568
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,150

Fine.

580
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,000

You're the manager.

to tough it out first

618
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,790

he helped me a lot,

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,750
so I wasn't so tired.

623
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,480
It's just me now.

624
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,680
I'm struggling to keep it together.

625
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,070
I'll ask He to come back.

626
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,310
No need.

627
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,640
Without him,

628
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,200

631
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
Anyway, she thinks I'm Wanghe's underling.

632
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,590
So she basically thinks I'm a dog.

633
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,490
Why have you come alone?

634
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,590
I just have.

635
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,700
You had dinner by yourself?

636
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,010
None of your business.

637
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's drink.

638
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,750
What's wrong with you this time?

639
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,810
You fought with Xiaohui again?

640
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,830
I suspect

641
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,860
Xiaohui has started menopause early.

642
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,150
What's the reason this time?

643
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,300
She's jealous of you.

644
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,530
Jealous of me?

645
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,180
What did I do?

646
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,050
Meng wants Haikuo to be the CTO at headquarters.

647
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,350
Haikuo said he needs

648
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,240
to ask for your opinion first.

649
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Xiaohui is upset about it.

650
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
When did that happen?

651
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,120
The day

652
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,240
when Meng talked with me alone.

653
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,750
I asked you what he said,

654
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,380
and you said nothing.

655
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,950
He asked me to keep it a secret

656
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,350
for data security.

657
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,580
I didn't really understand it.

658
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,310
He told you to keep it secret, so you did?

659
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,380
That's not the point, okay?

660
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,030
Shouldn't you be asking

661
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,640
why Xiaohui is upset?

662
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,270
Why is Xiaohui upset?

663
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,710
She thinks…

664
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't even want to say it.

665
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,880
Anyway,

666
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,420
recently, every few days,

667
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,770
she picks a fight with me.

668
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,600
It's wearing me out.

669
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,480
Leave her if you can't stand her.

670
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,400
Just break up with her.

671
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,590
You handled things like that,

672
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,790
and you're still single now.

673
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,260
Aren't you single?

674
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,160
I won't be soon.

675
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,810
Wonderful.

676
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,110
Congratulations.

677
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,070
Why are you drinking so fast?

678
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,640
I'm happy.

679
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,920
Waiter!

680
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,030
A 12-pack of beer, please.

681
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,480
Enough. No more drinking.

682
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,470
We still have to work tomorrow.

683
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,480
Worry about yourself.

684
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,720
I know what I'm doing.

685
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,700
It won't affect anything.

686
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,600
Wanghe,

687
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,550
I've thought it through.

688
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,500
Don't worry about Xiaohui.

689
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,860
I won't go to headquarters.

690
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,440
Haikuo.

691
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,120
To be honest,

692
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,820
I really need you right now.

693
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,460
I hope you can stay and help me.

694
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,160
But Xiaohui isn't wrong.

695
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,880
You should decide

696
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,210
your career direction by yourself.

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,170
Whether you succeed or fail,

698
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,210
you need to learn

699
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,070
to take responsibility for your own decisions.

700
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,770
You also need to be responsible for Xiaohui.

701
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,300
Why are you looking at me?

702
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,980
Don't you already have the answer in your heart?

703
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,160
Just follow your heart.

704
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,410
What I say goes!

705
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,260
I say I'm not leaving, and that's that!

706
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,560
Come on.

707
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260

708
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,950

716
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,070
Look at him.

717
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,640
Wait for me.

718
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,240
Mr. Zhou.

719
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,020
It's confirmed.

720
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,000
One of my ancestors

721
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,030
indeed worked as a porter.

722
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,750
Really?

723
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,840
But the name is no longer traceable.

724
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,910
Why?

725
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,620
My family genealogy records

726
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,270
were burned during the war.

727
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,950
Only some fragments were left.

728
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,680
Look.

729
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,680
The writing is all blurred.

730
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,960
-Yeah.
-How do I know

731
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
this person worked as a porter?

732
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,280
It's because at the end of the Qing dynasty,

733
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,030
this person made a fortune

734
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,380
by selling tea.

735
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,960
He went back and built an ancestral hall for his clan.

736
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,670
That's why it was recorded.

737
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,020
This is history,

738
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,110
the folk history of people living by the canal.

739
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,510
I think

740
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,210
we shouldn't just look into our families.

741
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,450
Our neighbors on Flower Street,

742
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,580
we should ask them all.

743
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,910
Maybe every family has their own

744
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
stories.

745
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,010
-Yeah.
-Right?

746
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,640
So this is oral history?

747
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,600
Oral history is still history.

748
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,710
When Sima Qian wrote "Records of the Grand Historian,"

749
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,030
from emperors and generals

750
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,200
to peddlers and porters,

751
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,070
he went door to door to make inquiries.

752
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,750
Yes.

753
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,930
Jing Ke's assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang

754
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,540
was only recorded in detail

755
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,200
because he ran into Xia Wuju

756
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,460
when he was visiting a neighbor.

757
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,750
Yes, indeed.

758
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,720
We don't have his talent,

759
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,000
but if we put in the effort,

760
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,960
we can also contribute to filling in

761
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,070
the blanks in official history.

762
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,110
Absolutely.

763
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,850
So this will also be considered history in the future?

764
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,610
Of course.

765
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,840
You'll become part of history too.

766
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,320
Gosh.

767
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
My dad,

768
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,790
Uncle Shao,

769
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,970
Grandpa Zhou, and I

770
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,880
naturally formed

771
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,070
a four-person research team.

772
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,550
Fueled by passion,

773
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,370
♫At moonset cry the crows♫

774
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,830
we roamed the streets and alleys,

775
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,350
visiting over 100 families

776
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,160
along the canal,

777
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
encountering many rare antiques,

778
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,790
and recording countless fascinating stories.

779
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,200
To our surprise,

780
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,710
♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

781
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,960
after the canal's successful World Heritage application,

782
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,640
various folk museums,

783
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
big and small, began popping up along the canal.

784
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,400
This gave us a more comprehensive

785
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,270
understanding of its history.

786
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,750
The four of us,

787
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,300
♫Dimly lit fishing boats♫

788
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,680
driven by our obsession with the sunken ship,

789
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,030
somehow became the talk of the neighborhood

790
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,200
around Flower Street.

791
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,000
More and more people

792
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,620
began approaching us,

793
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,370
♫Sadly lie beneath maples♫

794
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
offering their help to solve the mystery.

795
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
And just like that,

796
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,000
I felt

797
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,500
I was finally getting closer to the truth,

798
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,990
and closer to fulfilling my promise

799
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,440
to Siyi.

800
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,000
Why am I so tired?

801
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,590
It's just the beginning.

802
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,000
It's only been a few days.

803
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,830
You can't handle it already?

804
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,070
♫At moonset cry the crows♫

805
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,270
When I wrote books,

806
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,240
at least I knew the direction.

807
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,400
I was in control.

808
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,550
But now,

809
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,340
♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

810
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,480
everything is uncertain.

811
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,070
Hello?

812
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,700
Yes.

813
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,090
♫Dimly lit fishing boats♫

814
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,890
Really?

815
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay, okay.

816
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,750
We'll come right away.

817
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,070
Alright, thank you.

818
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,630
Grandpa.

819
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,050
The town chronicle office says they have new leads.

820
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,730
Is that so?

821
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,640
Then let's pack up and go.

822
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,110
Hurry up.

823
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,070
Let's go.

824
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,640
You may find the information

825
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
you're looking for

826
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
in their genealogy records.

827
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,000
If you can't find it here,

828
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,290
there's even less chance elsewhere.

829
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,950
This way.

830
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,470
They've been waiting for a long time.

831
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,910
Yes.

832
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,030
Great.

833
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,280
Come on.

834
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,490
This old man is a descendant of the Dong family.

835
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,440
Hello, everyone.

836
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:26,880
Hello.

837
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,440
Welcome.

838
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,590
They're looking for some information.

839
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,200
Thank you for coming.

840
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,350
Nice to meet you, sir.

841
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,150
Welcome, welcome.

842
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,520
One of my ancestors had a friend surnamed Shao.

843
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,030
There is a record of him.

844
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,860
I've kept it

845
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,480
but forgotten which book it's in.

846
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,460
Help them look for it.

847
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,990
Then let's look for it together.

848
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,730
Okay.

849
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,130
Let's look together.

850
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,620
Okay, thank you.

851
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,480
Sir, is it this?

852
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,710
This.

853
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,250
[I have a friend called Shao Sheng whose father was a canal porter. After leaving, he has not returned for a long time. The chances of survival are slim.]

854
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,390
You found it.

855
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,120
This is it.

856
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,030
Is it?

857
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Great!

858
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,270
Thank you, sir.

859
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,310
Thank you.

860
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,160
Wonderful.

861
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,590
Record it, record it.

862
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,440
It wasn't easy.

863
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,270
Record.

864
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,030
Let's take a picture together.

865
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,440
Take a picture.

866
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,680
Come on.

867
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,480
"I have a friend called Shao Sheng

868
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,190
whose father was a canal porter.

869
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,460
After leaving, he has not returned for a long time.

870
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,070
The chances of survival are slim.

871
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm so worried that I can't sleep."

872
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,110
Why are you laughing?

873
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,460
This is your ancestor.

874
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,080
Look, it says, "The chances of survival are slim."

875
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,110
Why are you so happy?

876
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,440
Don't be so insensitive.

877
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
It's precisely because he was my ancestor

878
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
that I'm happy.

879
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,030
I know he was fine.

880
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,880
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here, right?

881
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
Yes.

882
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,240
That's right.

883
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,190
Were porters paid well at that time?

884
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,440
Of course not.

885
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,110
Is that so?

886
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,440
Grandpa…

887
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,160
Where's Grandpa?

888
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,270
Mr. Zhou.

889
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,350
Grandpa!

890
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,010
Oh, no.

891
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,640
Let's go.

892
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,400
Is that him?

893
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,100
Let's go.

894
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,270
Did he go out?

895
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,830
Let's go take a look.

896
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,960
In the first stage, he's forgetful, and in the second stage?

897
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,050
Memory problem.

898
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,310
I see.

899
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,960
So he can't remember anything at all?

900
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,270
-Yes. 
-So he'll need someone with him

901
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,310
around the clock?

902
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes.

903
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,820
I gotta go.

904
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,920
Is this what it's like when he…

905
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,640
Look.

906
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,400
Mr. Zhou.

907
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,440
Grandpa.

908
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,680
Grandpa.

909
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,170
Rui.

910
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,960
Where are you going?

911
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,130
Grandpa.

912
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,060

Why are you here?

Who?

922

It's Siyi.

This girl came a few days ago.

931

You know, the kind of person who travels on a budget by bike.

932

♫Hold no poetry, no distant dreams♫

Her name?

944
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,150
