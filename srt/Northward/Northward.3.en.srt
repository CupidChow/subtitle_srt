If (a, n) is bigger and equals to

188
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,790
(a, n) minus one,

189
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,930
what does this mean?

190
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,590
It increases.

191
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,360
Yes, this is...

192
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,110
monotonic function.

193
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
You're in your final year of high school now.

194
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,460
Don't be so listless all the time.

195
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,270
Especially you, Xie Wanghe.

196
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,910
Come, let's continue with the lesson.

197
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,590
How nimble.

198
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,520
You've been trained well through these years.

199
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,790
Thank you.

200
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,940
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

201
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,660
[Striving unceasingly with steadfast integrity]

202
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,750
Everyone.

203
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,420
Class.

204
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,220
Have you ever thought

205
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,750
what will you do if you

206
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,740
cannot make it to a university?

207
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,260
[Striving unceasingly with steadfast integrity]

208
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,040
I don't think going to university is the only way out.

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,300
I can start a business if I don't make it.

210
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Bill Gates, the richest man in the world,

211
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,210
didn't complete his degree either.

212
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,140
Okay.

213
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,970
Let's talk about Bill Gates then.

214
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,880
As you all know,

215
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,150
Bill Gates got into Harvard

216
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,440
before he dropped out.

217
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,110
As compared to not making it,

218
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,590
it's totally different when

219
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,830
he chooses to drop out.

220
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,090
Well said, teacher!

221
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,910
Great!

222
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,160
Let's not talk about Bill Gates then.

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,870
Let's talk about how

224
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,310
many outstanding local entrepreneurs

225
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,140
had no education

226
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,010
or background,

227
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,930
but that didn't stop them from being successful.

228
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,470
That was in the past.

229
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,910
Now,

230
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,700
only knowledge can change your fate.

231
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,790
Mr. Xu!

232
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,220
Forget it, I'll stop here.

233
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,010
It's okay.

234
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,910
Carry on.

235
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,500
If you're wrong,

236
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,580
I won't blame you.

237
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,390
If you have a good point,

238
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,950
I won't leave you any homework.

239
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,830
Really?

240
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,960
Of course.

241
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
You must keep your promise.

242
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,870
Yes, I'll.

243
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,800
I think...

244
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,230
Come down.

245
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,170
I think...

246
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,450
you're right.

247
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,660
Knowledge can change one's fate,

248
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,700
but it definitely isn't

249
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,030
knowledge memorized from the textbook.

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,530
Does it mean that everyone who studied hard

251
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,590
will definitely succeed?

252
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,920
Then why is it that

253
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,830
the successful ones are still the minority?

254
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,230
Guys,

255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,320
this is not about getting the wrong reference.

256
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,870
This is called switching concepts.

257
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,660
No.

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,690
Mr. Xu.

259
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,540
What I want to say is that

260
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,030
compared to

261
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,560
knowledge memorized from textbooks,

262
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,920
what's more important is

263
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,150
our way of thinking,

264
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,860
creativity,

265
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,080
foresight,

266
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,510
and future plans.

267
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,010
We can understand the laws of a trade

268
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,320
through observation and analysis.

269
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
And with this understanding,

270
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,630
we can get the final victory.

271
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,030
Well said!

272
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,530
So, tell me.

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,690
How do you plan to get the final victory?

274
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,990
Let's take an example.

275
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,750
For example, in the teaching profession.

276
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,100
Have you ever thought about

277
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,150
how can you

278
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,230
earn more money

279
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,730
without compromising your job?

280
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,350
Have you thought about it?

281
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,470
Yes, I did.

282
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,080
But,

283
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,350
it's definitely not one-on-one tutoring.

284
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,230
That's too inefficient,

285
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,150
and it's not effective.

286
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,710
If you don't reap profits,

287
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,110
its easy to hold a grudge.

288
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,230
Mr. Xu.

289
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,960
I think if you want to make money,

290
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,110
there is only one way.

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,510
And that is, to open test prep centers.

292
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,960
What center?

293
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,170
Test prep centers.

294
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,710
Mr. Xu, please move aside.

295
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,230
[Test prep centers]

296
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,450
Test prep centers.

297
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,330
Don't you understand?

298
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,660
It means to do test papers together.

299
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,600
Actually,

300
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,470
if you want to improve your grades,

301
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,220
it's very simple.

302
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,830
You just have to do test papers non-stop.

303
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,320
But when you do it yourself at home,

304
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
if you encounter any problems,

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,420
you will never get it

306
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,490
no matter how hard you try.

307
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,910
But if someone could guide you,

308
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,700
it's different.

309
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,260
If you can get help whenever you encounter a problem,

310
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,050
your grades will definitely improve.

311
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,880
Of course,

312
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,910
you can't charge for tutoring

313
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,200
as it's against the school rules.

314
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,760
But you can collect fees for things such as

315
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,480
food, nutrition, printing and so on.

316
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,540
Teachers can earn money legitimately

317
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,030
while students can improve their grades.

318
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,260
Let me ask you.

319
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,710
Assuming there is such a place

320
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,230
that runs every weekend for two days,

321
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,370
where Mr. Xu teaches,

322
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,050
and it's inclusive of meals

323
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,020
with no attendance taken.

324
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,180
We'll let Mr. Xu

325
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,730
make this hard-earned 50 yuan.

326
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,060
Would you be interested?

327
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,680
50 yuan is too expensive.

328
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,020
How about 48 yuan?

329
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,170
48 yuan is also expensive.

330
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,080
How about 44 yuan?

331
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,900
That number is unlucky.

332
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,070
If it's 44 yuan, I'll sign up.

333
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,130
I'll attend too!

334
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,680
We must support Mr. Xu.

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,560
Me too!

336
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,670
Me too!

337
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,050
Me too!

338
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,130
Mr. Xu.

339
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,830
Inclusive of me,

340
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,230
there are 40 people in this class.

341
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,990
Enough.

342
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,390
That's not a lot of money either.

343
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,950
My time is very precious too.

344
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,950
Mr. Xu, don't fret.

345
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,470
Let me calculate for you.

346
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,990
There are 52 weekends a year.

347
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,120
52 times 44, times 40.

348
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,050
How much is that?

349
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,140
91,520 yuan.

350
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,940
91,520 yuan.

351
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,700
This is just the fees from one class.

352
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,590
If you think it's not enough,

353
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,950
we can recruit more.

354
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,140
You can calculate how much you will get with a 2 percent expansion

355
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,800
via geometric progression.

356
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,670
You can calculate first.

357
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,530
I'll go back and drink some water.

358
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,750
Class.

359
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,050
Class!

360
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,060
Don't get carried away.

361
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,870
Let's calculate

362
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,630
this question by Mr. Xie.

363
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,060
Okay.

364
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,850
Assuming

365
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,560
the number of graduating seniors of Honghuai is

366
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,900
5,850 students.

367
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,510
Of which, 80 percent are science students.

368
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,110
Mr. Xu,

369
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,380
please don't calculate anymore.

370
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,870
If this continues,

371
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,070
in the near future,

372
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,900
you'll be billionaire!

373
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,690
A billionaire?

374
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,360
Mr. Xu,

375
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,070
you're doing this alone.

376
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,690
When you resign

377
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,270
and focus on this,

378
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,830
we can hire

379
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,230
all of the retired senior teachers

380
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,110
over here.

381
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,350
By then,

382
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,240
we can move out of Honghuai

383
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,470
and set up test prep centers across the country.

384
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,950
Once you have scaled up sufficiently

385
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,160
you can apply for land

386
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,710
to establish

387
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,360
a national test prep center.

388
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,250
By then,

389
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,430
we can advertise,

390
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,830
get financing and go public.

391
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,350
As long as policies remain unchanged,

392
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,750
before you turn 50,

393
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,210
you'll achieve financial freedom.

394
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,710
Mr. Xu!

395
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,980
You will be the richest man in Honghuai!

396
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,830
Mr. Xu!

397
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,750
The richest man!

398
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,790
Mr. Xu!

399
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,060
The richest man!

400
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,940
Mr. Xu!

401
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,190
The richest man!

402
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,070
Mr. Xu!

403
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,990
The richest man!

404
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,750
Mr. Xu, Mr. Xu!

405
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,990
Don't forget us when you are rich!

406
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Mr. Xu!

407
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,470
Don't forget us!

408
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,350
Mr. Xu!

409
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,510
Don't forget us!

410
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,390
Mr. Xu!

411
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,590
Don't forget us!

412
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,470
You've explained so much to them.

413
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,590
Did they even understand?

414
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,110
The swallows and sparrows will never understand the ambition of a swan.

415
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,260
It's a waste of effort if you tell those who don't understand.

416
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,730
I could have knocked into you.

417
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,040
What do you want now?

418
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,710
Tell Xia Fenghua

419
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,610
she owes me money.

420
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,990
What money?

421
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,540
These are Air Force 1's.

422
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,810
I just bought it from Shanghai.

423
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,520
Look at how she stepped on them. How am I supposed to wear them?

424
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,420
How much is it?

425
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,470
Don't ask.

426
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,810
You won't be able to afford it anyway.

427
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,380
So what do you want?

428
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,790
Not much.

429
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,690
It's just a pair of shoes, it's no big deal.

430
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,050
I can get a new pair every day if I want to.

431
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,310
Would you die if you don't show off?

432
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,030
Of course I should show off when I have the money.

433
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,330
Unlike someone,

434
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,200
who thinks about money but his pockets are empty.

435
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,050
All you do is brag.

436
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Liang.

437
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,430
You're so annoying all the time.

438
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you trying to get beaten up to scam for medical fees?

439
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,920
Do you really think I can't beat you?

440
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,310
Tell Fenghua I'll wear new shoes every day.

441
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,620
If she has the guts, tell her to find me every day.

442
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,970
One word.

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,780
Despicable.

444
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,420
If only I had brains like Wanghe.

445
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,670
I would make a lot of money

446
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,930
and take you to Chris' concert by plane.

447
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,450
The concert is not that expensive.

448
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah.

449
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,550
We just have to save some pocket money.

450
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,570
I want to buy first-row seats.

451
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,230
When Chris is in the middle of a song,

452
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,359
I'll rush up and give her a hug.

453
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,109
I won't budge even if eight guards come for me.

454
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,250
Chris will be so annoyed at you.

455
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,589
That's fine.

456
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,079
As long as she remembers me.

457
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,250
I want to leave the most lasting mark

458
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,440
in Chris' performing career.

459
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,339
One word.

460
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,400
Despicable.

461
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,579
Hurry up.

462
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,609
Coming.

463
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,240
Let's go.

464
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,069
♫The second hand turns, tick-tock♫

465
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,570
♫Tiny time difference, ticking away♫

466
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,720
♫As I sip my morning tea, moonlight spills on your hair♫

467
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,040
welcome to my concert.

469
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,070
♫A parallel painting, tick-tock♫

470
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,750
Dear audience, how are you?

471
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,580
♫When will our time cross?♫

472
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,350
Let me see your waving hands!

473
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,670
♫Let's meet at the next intersection♫

474
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,750
Let me hear you call my name!

475
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,710
What? I can't hear you!

476
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,550
No, I disagree!

477
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,630
We agreed to lend it this time.

478
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,670
It's just six months.

479
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,630
My sister wants to open a cyber cafe.

480
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,300
She'll pay us back when she makes money.

481
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,510
She still owe us money from when she opened the noodle house previously.

482
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,830
And all the previous times, she hasn't paid back yet.

483
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,980
Hasn't she return the money that one time?

484
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,440
Your mom!

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,630
What are you talking about?

486
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,350
The money was given to your mom.

487
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,710
Will we ever get the money back?

488
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,570
How many times has your mom visited in the past two years?

489
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,530
So what? My mom can't come?

490
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,920
It's not that she can't come.

491
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,300
Every time she comes, she brings with her the whole family.

492
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,630
They just eat and take things from us.

493
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,030
I've finally saved some money, but all of that went to your sister.

494
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,240
Do I owe her?

495
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Alright. I owe them, okay?

496
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,270
My sister is taking care of our mother for me

497
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,770
and fulfiling filial duties on my behalf.

498
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,760
So what if she takes a bit of advantage?

499
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,870
She can't?

500
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,610
If you've already decided, what else is there to discuss with me?

501
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,470
The bankbook is in the drawer.

502
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,660
I quit.

503
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,510
I'm leaving.

504
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,640
Where are you going?

505
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,710
-It’s dark.
-Leave me alone.

506
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,230
Just tell me if you want to lend or not.

507
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,510
No, I don't want to.

508
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,430
Why should I?

509
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,550
When our business was doing well,

510
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,740
did I say anything?

511
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,750
I tolerated all the injustice.

512
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,570
But don't you know

513
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,320
the situation at the canal?

514
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,550
Seafaring?

515
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,950
How much you used to earn in a day?

516
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,230
How much do you earn now?

517
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,200
If you aren't keeping tabs,

518
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,550
I am.

519
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,230
How are we going to live?

520
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,700
Have you decided

521
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,920
on your university choices?

522
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,270
Which universities?

523
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,510
Tsinghua or Peking University.

524
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,880
Even the worst-ranked

525
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,270
has to be Renmin University.

526
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,950
Be serious.

527
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,870
Where else?

528
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,270
What do you want me to say?

529
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,710
Can I get into any university with these grades?

530
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,710
Why not?

531
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,820
My son is not stupid.

532
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,430
We still have a year.

533
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,740
Let's work hard.

534
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,990
At the very least,

535
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,060
you can go to a vocational college.

536
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,620
Don't be like your dad and become a seafarer for the rest of your life.

537
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,670
What are you talking about?

538
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,940
You're looking down on seafaring?

539
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,910
-How dare you look down on seafaring!
-Dad.

540
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,430
Did you drink?

541
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,610
Who did you drink with again?

542
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,710
Mr. Sun.

543
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,920
He's a big boss now.

544
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,570
He has three big construction sites

545
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,320
and his own water factory.

546
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,630
He's something.

547
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,870
Which Mr. Sun?

548
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,180
My classmate.

549
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,230
Liang's father.

550
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,470
Just a shabby foreman.

551
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,630
Mr. Sun.

552
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,570
Crippled Sun?

553
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,450
Did he say when he will he pay us?

554
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,290
He said he has

555
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,390
too many projects now.

556
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,640
Once he has the capacity,

557
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
he'll pay us first.

558
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,230
You've helped him haul a dozen boats of cement,

559
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,310
yet he's not paying you even a penny.

560
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,340
That's just bullying.

561
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,430
Mind your own business.

562
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,710
Well then, can I say?

563
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,910
That Crippled Sun

564
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,140
is simply a liar.

565
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,400
He just bought a Mercedes last month,

566
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,150
did you know?

567
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes.

568
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,990
He bought a... a second-hand car.

569
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,470
A second-hand car.

570
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,200
He didn't say he won't pay us.

571
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,990
Don't bother me about this.

572
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,150
Wait.

573
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,350
It's cold. I'll heat it up for you.

574
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,990
Ask him to write a guarantee.

575
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,350
Make it clear when he'd pay us back.

576
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,230
If he doesn't do so by the deadline,

577
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,270
he has to pay a late fee.

578
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,230
Are you crazy?

579
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,620
Our business

580
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,670
were all from him.

581
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,270
If we offend him,

582
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,430
we are left with nothing.

583
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,610
You are the crazy one instead.

584
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,550
You are working for him for free.

585
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,550
What are you getting out of it?

586
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,000
-You’re the crazy one instead!
-Okay, okay.

587
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,430
Stay out of men's business.

588
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,230
How can I not care?

589
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,150
Let me tell you.

590
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,790
In the past when we did seafaring,

591
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,950
yes, we could accept late payments.

592
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,620
We could still hold things up.

593
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,790
But not anymore.

594
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,550
If he doesn't pay us now,

595
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,370
how are we going to get by?

596
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,000
What are you talking about?

597
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,550
H-Have I ever mistreated you two?

598
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,750
Where are you going?

599
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,880
What's your family arguing about?

600
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,530
Money.

601
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,550
What else could it be?

602
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,460
If I get married,

603
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,200
it doesn't matter if he has money or not.

604
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,800
He must not be too filial.

605
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,920
Why?

606
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,670
The money he worked hard for

607
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,190
will all end up with his mother.

608
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,150
What's left for the family?

609
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,910
Find someone rich.

610
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,920
He can then satisfy both sides.

611
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,470
What?

612
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,470
If you become rich in the future...

613
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,560
If I become rich,

614
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,150
I'll buy my dad's boat

615
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,540
and force him to retire.

616
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,950
Then,

617
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,230
I'll buy them a big house in the city,

618
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,310
the kind with a garden.

619
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,460
They can then

620
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,020
watch birds,

621
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,090
do some gardening,

622
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,110
and sunbathe all at home

623
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,990
with no worries.

624
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,670
That's boring.

625
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,870
They will be bored to death.

626
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,980
You...

627
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,140
don't know how lucky you are.

628
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,630
You're oblivious to your parents' hard work.

629
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,010
The canal is hopeless.

630
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,650
You can't make a living with seafaring anymore.

631
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,370
I think those on Flower Street

632
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,790
won't last that much longer either.

633
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,910
If you move the tree, it dies.

634
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,990
If people move, we live.

635
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,430
From now on,

636
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,630
we'll go wherever there's good prospects.

637
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,020
As long as we work hard,

638
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,300
we won't starve to death.

639
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,590
Where do you want to go the most?

640
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,680
I don't know still.

641
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,680
What about you?

642
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,630
Beijing.

643
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,030
Zhongguancun.

644
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,410
I'll go when I grow up.

645
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,710
How old is old enough?

646
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,730
At least after we graduate from high school.

647
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:10,710
Regardless,

648
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,870
I am not going to

649
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,430
sit here and wait for death.

650
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,100
[Rejected]

651
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,760
According to "Stories to Awaken the World",

652
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,670
Du Shiniang and Li Jia

653
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,630
boarded the ship from Chongwen Gate of Beijing.

654
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,630
There's no Yangtze River in Beijing.

655
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,230
It's clearly just a canal.

656
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,630
After they came to Guazhou,

657
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,390
they were met with a blizzard.

658
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,070
They haven't had the chance to transfer to Yangtze River.

659
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,030
How could this treasure box

660
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
then sink in the Yangtze River?

661
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,310
It's because Feng Menglong

662
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,870
used the word "river" to replace the canal.

663
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,030
So,

664
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,230
the treasure box

665
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,710
should have sunken in the canal.

666
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,300
[Heaven rewards the diligent]

667
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,160
There is nothing wrong about this.

668
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:12,750
[Heaven rewards the diligent]

669
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,710
My manuscripts

670
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,460
have been rejected before.

671
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,990
But previously when the manuscript was rejected...

672
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,370
Lift up your leg.

673
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,990
At least they would write

674
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,990
why they rejected the manuscript.

675
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,990
They would make clear of the reason.

676
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,300
But now,

677
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,110
they can't even be bothered to write a single word.

678
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,910
It's returned simply with a stamp,

679
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,030
and they even returned it to my company.

680
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,450
Let me ask you.

681
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,230
You read it too.

682
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,830
Why did they reject my manuscript?

683
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,000
What grounds do they have?

684
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,790
Enough.

685
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,200
Why are you yelling at him?

686
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,630
He's not from the publisher.

687
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,350
I can't stand it!

688
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,610
If you can't,

689
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,390
just treat it like a fart.

690
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,870
What are you talking about?

691
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,900
How can you say that?

692
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,440
Dad.

693
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,200
Calm down.

694
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,450
I-I read the manuscript just now.

695
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,910
I-I think...

696
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,110
it's not that you were rejected

697
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,500
because you are not skilled enough.

698
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,830
Let me ask you.

699
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,870
So, why did they reject my manuscript?

700
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,820
I-I think it's the theme.

701
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,500
Theme?

702
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,570
What do you mean?

703
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,870
That Du Shiniang

704
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,410
are all outdated stories of the past.

705
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,090
Nowadays, readers are not interested in that.

706
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,780
It's not easy to read or sell.

707
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,190
So what are they interested in?

708
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,320
This year,

709
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,830
the best-selling novel is called "Ghost Blows Out the Light".

710
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,070
It's centered around tomb raiding.

711
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,710
With your skills, I am sure

712
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,750
you can write better stories with your eyes closed.

713
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,310
What are you talking about?

714
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,310
What are you doing?

715
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,950
How could you hit him?

716
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,430
Are you okay?

717
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,060
How could he say that?

718
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,140
He asked me to write about tomb raiders.

719
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,390
Why don't he ask me to write about murder and arson?

720
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,430
That works too.

721
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,150
A story on a psychopathic killer who does serial killings would also sell.

722
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,710
Get out!

723
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,900
How inappropriate!

724
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,730
I'm a scholar!

725
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,910
How can I write about crap like that?

726
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,940
I have my integrity

727
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,690
and morals, you know?

728
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,710
Calm down.

729
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,030
How does he take after me?

730
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,190
All right.

731
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,480
When those literary artists write, they go...

732
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,100
No, Grandpa, why don't you actually write something?

733
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,760
I want to see.

734
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,310
I...

735
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,230
I don't write well either.

736
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,190
I told you to practice hard.

737
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,670
Practice hard until you are like a calligrapher.

738
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,740
You have to know how to leave even spaces.

739
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,310
You mean to leave room for error, right?

740
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,950
Yes.

741
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,870
You just want me to stay at home

742
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,390
and be a housewife, don't you?

743
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,470
That's not what I mean.

744
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,670
That's what you meant.

745
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,210
All these years,

746
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,530
I've been

747
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,630
supporting this household

748
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,120
and contributing to our family.

749
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,710
I don't ask for your understanding

750
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,260
nor for you to be grateful.

751
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,750
But now,

752
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,390
I just want to get back what I've lost

753
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,970
bit by bit.

754
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,450
What did you lose?

755
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,110
My old name

756
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,920
was Luo Zhimei.

757
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,160
But now?

758
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,150
Who knows my name now?

759
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,040
Everyone calls me Haikuo's mother.

760
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,600
As the days go by,

761
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,470
I've lost my name.

762
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,150
Zhimei.

763
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,070
They call you Haikuo's mom because

764
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,230
that's how they've been addressing each other.

765
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,150
Of course your name is Luo Zhimei.

766
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,150
You are always Luo Zhimei in my heart.

767
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,090
Besides,

768
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,590
can you get your name back

769
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,870
by just acting in a small role?

770
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,190
At least in the ending credits,

771
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,230
the words "Luo Zhimei" will appear on the screen.

772
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,630
There are only ads at the end of the film.

773
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,390
There are no ending credits.

774
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,750
Stop being unreasonable.

775
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,570
I'm telling you, Zhou Yanlin.

776
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,870
This time,

777
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,550
I'm definitely leaving.

778
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,020
Don't try to stop me.

779
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,740
It's not like I won't let you go.

780
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,470
Right now, it's inappropriate whether or not

781
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,470
I say something or say nothing.

782
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,780
I'll just get scolded anyway.

783
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,880
What can I do?

784
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,470
Your dad treats you well.

785
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,310
Not at all.

788
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,470
So, what's your family arguing about?

789
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,550

795
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,470
Maybe he's worried.

797
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,530
He's afraid my mom won't come back after becoming a star.

♫A gentle breeze carries dreams away♫

805
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,140

807
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,560
Why?

808
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,030
Both my dad and my grandma wanted to have a boy.

809
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,880
But they had a daughter instead.

810

♫Life is long♫

811
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,350

Why are they still arguing today?

♫Like moonlight♫

816
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,230
When they made good money a few years ago,

817
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,470
we didn't feel like life was tough.

818
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,380
♫Don't forget♫

819
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,470
Now that they're short of money,

820
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,870
they couldn't control their temper anymore.

♫The old times♫

826
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,880
we all have to push forward.

Now that our families are not doing well,

828
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,930
they are going to rely on us.

829
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,610
With money,

830
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,410
my mom won't be mad at my dad

831
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,910
for not getting the payments.

832
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,730
Haikuo's mom wouldn't be in a hurry

833
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,030
to go out and act.

834
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,070
Fenghua's family?

835
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,620
If they really wanted a son,

836
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,280
they could just have one.

837
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,830
So in the end, it's all because of money.

838
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,010
I agree.

839
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,580
Once I graduate,

840
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,980

a good mother to Siyi.

871

But I've tried my best.

872
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,190

Stand up.

875
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,550
If I didn't send her here,

876
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,460
she would have been ruined by Ge.

877
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,780
What did you say?

878
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,550
I just gave birth to my second child that year.

879
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,930
I was still confinement,

880
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,000
when one day, I found him...

881
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,430
He was...

882
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,710
spying on Siyi in the shower.

883
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,590
He is a beast.

884
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,880
Beast?

885
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,890
Siyi was only ten years old then.

886
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,970
That's why I was bent on

887
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,510
sending her

888
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,210

889
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,990
These years,

890
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,300
I've had the same dream.

891
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,220
I dreamt that Siyi's dad

892
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,040
just standing there, watching me,

893
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,460
but wouldn't talk to me.

894
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,300
He was crying.

895
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,540
I know he resented me.

896
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,430
But...

897
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,300
Only if I had any skills

898
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,830
that could support this family,

899
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,970
or if Ge more humane,

900
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,080
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

901
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,080
Right, Mom?

902
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,360
Why don't you divorce him?

903
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,270
Find another one while you're young.

904
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,440
I won't.

905
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,350
My life's tough,

906
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,400
and I bring bad luck.

907
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,350
I jinxed Siyi's father, causing his death.

908
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,980
The second one went bankrupt too.

909
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,630
He left a mountain of debt.

910
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,480
You accept your fate?

911
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,310
What else can I do?

912
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,230
Now,

913
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,830
our second-born has to go to school.

914
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,950
We haven't got money for the tuition fees.

915
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,510
Mom.

916
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,150
Don't you still have some rental income every month?

917
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,650
Can you please help my child and I?

918
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,670
Help me out here.

919
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,090
What about Siyi? What happens to her?

920
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,260
If that's not possible,

921
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,450
I'll head south then.

922
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,710
I'll join a pyramid scheme.

923
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,550
As long as I put my face on the line,

924
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,030
I can make a lot of money too.

925
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,790
Delicious fried dough sticks.

Soy milk, soybean pudding, tea eggs.

There's no one here.

930
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,969
Yes, stop shouting.

931
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,230
Save your energy. It's been half a day.

932
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,830
I haven't seen anyone.

933

She left already.

Last night,

937
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,219
I persuaded her all night.

938
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,440
She said she wanted to venture into the south.

939
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,710
I couldn't stop her.

940
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,909
Now in the south,

941
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,230
there are many opportunities to make money.

942
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,830
There are jobs and they pay well.

943
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,270
I have a few sisters

944
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,020
who went to Shenzhen and did international trade.

945
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,190
They made a fortune.

946
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,860
They went back home and could immediately build three bungalows.

947
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:44,179
I've been thinking about how bad business has been on our street.

948
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,989
How about I go to the south too?

949
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,909
I'll earn some dowry for Fenghua.

950

What are you going to do?

951
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,550
I'll find a job.

952
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,489
I'll definitely earn more than this.

Right?

954

How much can you earn a month?

955
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,350
Regardless, it must be

956
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,150
more than running this food stall.

957
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,560
Do you think that's really true?

Can she really make that much money?

959
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,850
When they discovered the continent of Asia,

960
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,390
they found that besides

961
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,870
a huge market in Asia,

962
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,850

became a very important reason

966

for them to come to Asia.

967
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,230
But,

968
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,140
what is the one obstacle?

969
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,360
The traditional trade route has been blocked.

970
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,220

971
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,290

994
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,510

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,210
Or I'll tell your mom.

1119
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,260
Take the hammer.

1120
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,750
Fenghua.

1121
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,550
Do you think I dare not touch you?

1122
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,340
You? Touch me?

1123
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,870
Stop it.

1124
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,390
Siyi is in urgent need of money.

1125
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,170
Let go.

1126
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,890
Fine. I'm going too.

1127
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,100
What are you going for?

1128
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,430
I'm going to keep watch for you.

1129
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,670
If you don't take me along today,

1130
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,080
none of you are getting out of here.

1131
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,690
Okay, let's go.

1132
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,460
Take that pail.

1133
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,620
Let's go.

1134
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,100
Just kill me instead.

1135
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,790
How are you transporting it later?

1136
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,630
What do you mean?

1137
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,350
Let's go to Flower Street and borrow a cart.

1138
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,270
You're quite thoughtful.

1139
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,330
She's definitely a habitual offender.
