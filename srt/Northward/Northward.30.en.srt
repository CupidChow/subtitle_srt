190
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
I'll join you.

191
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,890
No matter where you go or what you do

192
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,490
in the future,

193
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,790
I'll be with you.

194
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,740
I haven't decided

195
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,030
if I'm moving back.

196
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,270
And I don't need your company.

197
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,450
I love being alone now.

198
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,230
Really.

199
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,240
So...

200
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,640
do you plan to stay single forever?

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,600
In the future...

202
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,240
I'll find someone

203
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,810
who really spoils me.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll go wherever I want.

205
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,480
New York,

206
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,560
Paris,

207
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,930
Maldives.

208
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll do whatever I want

209
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,630
and eat whatever I want.

210
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,270
He'll send me flowers every day.

211
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,420
I can use his credit card as I please.

212
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,910
And our garage

213
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,870
will be overloaded with cars.

214
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,200
I hadn't seen much of the world as a kid.

215
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,270
Even getting free ice cream

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,640
made me happy.

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,390
Now that I'm grown up,

218
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,360
I think it's better to be more practical.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,270
Am I right?

220
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,120
You're right.

221
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,390
Come on,

222
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,750
let's toast to

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,670
our future happiness.

224
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,270
Absolutely.

225
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,500
Still here?

226
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,420
Almost done.

227
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,510
There's still a market analysis that

228
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,670
Finance needs to review.

229
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,480
It's a day before New Year’s Eve.

230
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,960
Not going back to your hometown?

231
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,750
I'll finish it and then drive back

232
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,650
right away.

233
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,850
Don't push yourself.

234
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,670
I'll stay with my mom for the Eve.

235
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,870
Let's drive back together on the 2nd or 3rd of the New Year.

236
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,400
Just spend time with your mom.

237
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,270
I need to go back.

238
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,790
I need to talk to Fenghua.

239
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,550
Can't you talk over the phone?

240
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,080
No,

241
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,870
I must talk to her in person.

242
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,030
Alright then.

243
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,580
Be careful on the road later.

244
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,360
I'll be off then.

245
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,000
Say hello to your mom for me.

246
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,940
Go home soon.

247
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,700
Drive safely.

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,180
Aunt Yan.

249
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,780
Wanghe, you're back for the New Year.

250
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,390
How did you come back?

251
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
By car or plane?

252
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,580
I drove.

253
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,010
Where's Fenghua?

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,260
Looking for her as soon as you're back?

255
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,700
That girl

256
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,440
came back without saying a word

257
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,460
and didn't wait for me.

258
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So disloyal.

259
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,040
I know. That child...

260
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,390
It'd have been nice to come back together!

261
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,150
I'll call her. She's sleeping.

262
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,610
Fenghua.

263
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,590
Fenghua.

264
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,600
Fenghua?

265
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,000
Wanghe is back.

266
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,800
Still sleeping in.

267
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,750
When she wakes up,

268
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,290
I'll tell her to find you.

269
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,250
Still sleeping at this hour?

270
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,060
She went out drinking with Xingchi yesterday.

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,370
She came back at midnight.

272
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,200
Go rest at home.

273
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,810
You must be tired from driving.

274
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,070
Come here to eat when you're hungry.

275
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll tell her to find you when she wakes up.

276
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,160
Alright.

277
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,440
I applied

278
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,370
for your leave with Meng.

279
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,710
Your year-end bonus was cut by 70%.

280
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,490
It doesn't matter.

281
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,790
I expected nothing anyway.

282
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,460
Save some for me.

283
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,910
You don't deserve it.

284
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,010
Because of you,

285
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,670
the delivery riders at Station 203

286
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,660
aren't getting year-end bonuses.

287
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,810
If you keep sneezing these days,

288
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,630
it's because they're cursing you behind your back.

289
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,430
Let them.

290
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,470
A few curses won't hurt.

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
How's Fenghua?

292
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,620
Didn't you two drink last night?

293
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,750
What's wrong?

294
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,600
I can't even

295
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,270
drink alone with her anymore?

296
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,070
She hasn't been feeling well.

297
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,589
What did you two talk about?

298
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,160
Can you tell me

299
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,550
what you two talked about?

300
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,530
Wash the dishes after you're done.

301
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Fenghua.

302
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,920
Just got up?

303
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,830
Morning.

304
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,260
Did you...

305
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,480
drive back?

306
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,910
I drove all night.

307
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,020
Just got here this morning.

308
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,490
Are you tired?

309
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,140
I'm fine.

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,300
If you want to make it through the night,

311
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,900
you should take a nap.

312
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,350
Let's go somewhere tonight

313
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,450
to set off fireworks.

314
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,450
We'll see.

315
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,070
It's so cold. I don't feel like going out.

316
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,370
Get some sleep first.

317
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,130
I'm going to help out at my mom's shop.

318
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,330
Fenghua.

319
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,810
Are you...

320
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,950
feeling better?

321
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,830
Don't worry.

322
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm already better.

323
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,070
This fatty is quite funny.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,180
Come, come.

325
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,200
Fenghua.

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,350
Stop watching TV.

327
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,960
Hurry.

328
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,350
Let's have New Year's Eve dinner.

329
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,350
Careful, don't burn yourself.

330
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,640
Hurry.

331
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
Pour the wine.

332
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,730
Fenghua.

333
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,110
Aren't you hot wearing so much?

334
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,160
Don't you remember? You and your dad

335
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,590
saved up to buy this for me.

336
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,160
It's so precious, so I never wear it.

337
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
But I've to wear it for the New Year.

338
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,500
It's so festive for the New Year.

339
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,510
Red and prosperous.

340
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,200
Exactly.

341
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,940
Try the egg dumplings.

342
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,480
Let's...

343
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,510
have a toast first. Cheers!

344
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
Come on, come on.

345
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,240
Cheers!

346
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,430
Happy New Year!

347
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,030
Try this. This too.

348
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,180
Happy New Year!

349
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,890
Wanghe!

350
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,240
Wanghe, you're here!

351
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,290
Quick, quick!

352
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,030
We made too many pork knuckles.

353
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,920
My mom asked me to bring

354
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
a plate over.

355
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920
That's so kind of you.

356
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,720
Thank you.

357
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,160
Please, sit down. Sit here.

358
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,000
Come on, have a drink with your uncle.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,790
Let's have a drink.

360
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,640
Grab a glass.

361
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,070
Pour the wine.

362
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,550
Well, um...

363
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,590
I... I won't drink.

364
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,160
My parents are waiting for me at home.

365
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,530
I'll come later to pay my New Year's respects.

366
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,440
Wait! Wait!

367
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,200
Wait! Wait!

368
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,310
Listen.

369
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,640
Well...

370
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,160
I don't have any good wine.

371
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,920
Take this wine back for your dad to drink.

372
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,180
Take it, take it.

373
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,290
Fenghua.

374
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,830
Then I'll head back first.

375
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,640
Alright.

376
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,270
Okay.

377
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,240
Tell your dad later that

378
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,500
Did you deliver it to me in person?

751
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,770
Just wait for my complaint.

752
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Hello? Sir.

753
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,110
Sir, hello?

754
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,440
I've already been late thrice this month

755
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,150
and fined quite a bit.

756
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,630
Now I've got another complaint.

757
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,190
That's like

758
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,090
another black mark in the system.

759
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,640
I've asked around at the company.

760
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,400
They said

761
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm basically

762
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,480
on the blacklist now.

763
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
When the platform assigns orders,

764
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,070
they won't prioritize me.

765
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,280
What am I supposed to do now?

766
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,630
I'm finished, aren't I?

767
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,230
Then why were you so careless?

768
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:15,980
Come with me.

769
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,880
[3 new messages from Class 082]

770
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,770
[Fang Chentao: I had too much fun at the party yesterday.
I'm still a little dizzy. How's everyone?]

771
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,420
[Xu Haoyan: Hahaha. Me too. I haven't had so much fun in a while!
I sent some photos I took in the group chat!]

772
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,160
Sir,

773
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,840
my supervisor and I are waiting for you downstairs.

774
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,150
Could you come down to talk?

775
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,480
I told you I'm busy.

776
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,110
How will the platform handle it?

777
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,590
Sir! Sir!

778
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,820
I'm the delivery rider who contacted you.

779
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,750
He's our supervisor.

780
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,590
Hello, hello.

781
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,350
What do you want?

782
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,880
I'm sorry.

783
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,280
I apologize on behalf of our delivery rider.

784
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,440
We didn't deliver the meal to you in person.

785
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,800
We're truly sorry.

786
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,740
One hour.

787
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,350
Didn't I wait for an hour?

788
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,460
Look at the scorching sun now.

789
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,670
You made me miss lunch!

790
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,490
What's the point of saying sorry?

791
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,440
We're so sorry...

792
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,270
Let go!

793
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,760
We're so, so sorry...

794
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,120
How about this?

795
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,150
I'll compensate you for this order.

796
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,920
Could you please withdraw the complaint?

797
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,230
Do you think I need the money?

798
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,020
No, no.

799
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,920
Why should I withdraw the complaint?

800
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,480
Didn't you mess up?

801
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,280
Why should I withdraw it?

802
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,920
Yes, it's our fault.

803
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,110
Let me teach you two a lesson.

804
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,360
Complaining

805
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,280
is a consumer's right.

806
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,960
Understand?

807
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,820
How is it my fault?

808
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Shut up.

809
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,800
Do you know how long I'd been waiting for you?

810
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,070
Who are you to yell at me?

811
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,130
You're just a deliveryman!

812
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,980
What you just said...

813
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,840
isn't right.

814
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,360
Are you here to apologize or pick a fight?

815
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,060
Want me to withdraw the complaint?

816
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,550
Fine.

817
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,140
Get on your knees!

818
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,880
Kowtow thrice!

819
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Can't do it?

820
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,280
Kneel down!

821
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,030
Turn left.

822
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,030
Alright, you're done.

823
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,550
Careful.

824
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,190
Thank you.

825
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,750
Rest early then.

826
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,510
Okay.

827
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,730
Good night.

828
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:05,930
Good night.

829
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,490
Bye.

830
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
What does he do?

831
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,920
He's in investing.

832
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,070
Is it profitable?

833
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,160
He's been making losses.

834
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,840
But his family is wealthy.

835
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,100
They own mines.

836
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,480
What else do you want to know?

837
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,260
Actually, you don't have to avoid me.

838
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm very prideful.

839
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,580
If it doesn't work out, I'll pack up and leave.

840
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,830
I won't pester you.

841
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,860
You think

842
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm doing this for money?

843
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Isn't that the case?

844
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,400
If that's what you want to believe,

845
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,000
then I have nothing more to say.

846
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,840
As for me,

847
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,950
it's simple.

848
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,590
I'm not ambitious.

849
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,280
I just want to live a simple

850
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
and comfortable life with you.

851
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
That's why I wanted you to buy a house.

852
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,230
But you refused without a second thought.

853
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,360
I don't want to buy a house

854
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,000
because I don't want to spend my family's money.

855
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,190
I want to rely on my own efforts.

856
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,810
But I can't wait any longer.

857
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,790
I'm almost 30 years old.

858
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,550
After all these years in Beijing,

859
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,230
among my college roommates,

860
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,980
even the least successful one lives in Swan Bay

861
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,190
and drives an X5.

862
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,440
But me?

863
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,030
I have to be alert every time I take a cab.

864
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,110
When there's traffic and the driver takes a detour,

865
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,280
I start to panic.

866
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm a graduate from a top university.

867
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,800
I've won first-class scholarships.

868
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,820
Is this any way for me to live?

869
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,600
Being poor

870
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,010
is still the original sin, huh?

871
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,220
Haikuo.

872
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,430
I know you've been trying hard,

873
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,270
but I'm sorry.

874
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,900
I no longer have the time

875
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,920
or patience to chase after your empty promises.

876
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,070
Do you get what I'm saying?

877
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,260
Yes.

878
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,320
You again?

879
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,630
Officer Xia.

880
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,540
Didn't you get a proper job?

881
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,440
Why are you causing trouble again?

882
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,000
He deserved a beating.

883
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,800
If you were me, you'd have hit him too.

884
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,080
Don't tell me all that.

885
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,310
Tell that to your superior.

886
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,710
My superior?
