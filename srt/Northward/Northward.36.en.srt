[NORTHWARD]

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,950
[Episode 36]

3
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,310
How did it go?

4
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
I was right, wasn't I?

5
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,360
It's too sudden.

6
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,870
They're just shocked.

7
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,430
Once they adjust

8
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,079
and accept the reality,

9
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,190
they won't object.

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
Guess what my mom said?

11
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,520
She said if I got cancer,

12
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,030
I should pack my things

13
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,840
and find a place

14
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
to wait for my death.

15
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,000
That I shouldn't be a burden,

16
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
which will make people miss me more after I die.

17
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,430
It's okay.

18
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,910
Anyway, I know you love me too.

19
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,620
I'm very happy.

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,460
All these years of waiting

21
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,950
are worth it.

22
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,670
It doesn't really matter if we get married or not.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Fenghua,

24
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,100
you love me

25
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,300
because

26
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm stubborn, don't you?

27
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,340
It's the same with this matter.

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,000
I've made up my mind.

29
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,430
What others say can't change it.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,110
Don't be silly.

31
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,560
We're both adults.

32
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Don't be childish.

33
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,680
So you know

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,470
we're adults.

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
We're of legal age for marriage.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,190
We have the right to get married.

37
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,680
No one can stop us.

38
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,960
Yesterday…

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,560
I told Xingchi about our situation.

40
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,520
Guess what he said?

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,710
If you can't make the decision,

42
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,680
don't push yourself too hard.

43
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,079
Leave it to me.

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Although I'm not as rich as you,

45
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,150
I can still afford

46
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,430
the betrothal gifts.

47
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,120
You want to marry her,

48
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,630
but she won't agree.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,430
If you

50
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,400
truly want to marry her,

51
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll support you

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,400
and wish you a happy marriage.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,590
But I beg you

54
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,360
to treat her well.

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,940
If you treat her badly, I…

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,750
I'll just take her away.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,080
I won't care about brotherhood or anything.

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,860
He's put it like that.

59
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,370
What am I supposed to do?

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
If I'm careless,

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
my wife might be stolen.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,720
Who could I turn to for help?

63
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,070
In the past,

64
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,110
when I encountered problems,

65
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,270
you always told me

66
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,600
that time smooths things out.

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Today, I'm saying those words to you.

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,310
As long as we truly love each other

69
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,240
and wish to be together,

70
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,270
any problem can be solved.

71
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,220
It's just a matter of time.

72
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,810
I never expected

73
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,270
that getting sick

74
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,870
would make me so popular.

75
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,260
Don't be afraid.

76
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,230
I'll always be by your side.

77
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,380
[Examination method: cranial CT scan]

78
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,370
[Consider: possible tumor or meningioma tumor]

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,400
Is this disease

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,870
treatable?

81
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,480
I asked.

82
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,720
They said she needs brain surgery.

83
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,150
The success rate

84
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,750
is very low.

85
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,380
How low?

86
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,350
It's one in ten.

87
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,990
How can it be?

88
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,650
How can it be?

89
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,450
It can't be.

90
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,470
It can't be.

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,380
I…

92
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,450
I want to trade my life for our daughter's.

93
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,800
I want to switch places with her.

94
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,670
I want to trade my life for hers.

95
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,820
Why is God so cruel?

96
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,100
Please take my life instead.

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,190
It really hasn't changed much, has it?

98
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,720
Are you sure you can find it?

99
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,770
Let's just look.

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,900
Here it is.

101
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,030
Come here.

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,780
[Wanghe, have you succeeded?]

103
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,070
You wrote it?

104
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,850
The day before we left school,

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,090
the three of us all wrote something.

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
So,

107
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,360
have you succeeded?

108
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,350
By the standards back then,

109
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,050
I guess I could be considered successful.

110
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,950
What about by today's standards?

111
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,710
I'm in my thirties

112
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
but still haven't gotten married.

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,870
How can I be considered successful?

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Where is your desk?

115
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,800
Have you found it?

116
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,670
I didn't write anything.

117
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,290
Impossible.

118
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,950
I really didn't.

119
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,930
Why would I lie to you?

120
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,050
Look for it.

121
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
Stop looking. I didn't write anything.

122
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,990
Why don't you believe me?

123
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,800
I must find it.

124
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,510
I want to see what you wrote.

125
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,350
Here it is.

126
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,970
This was your desk, right?

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
No.

128
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,720
It was!

129
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Come here.

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,870
Take a look.

131
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,500
It was not my desk.

132
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,730
Take a look first.

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,240
It was not mine.

134
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,909
Look at this.

135
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,600
Look.

136
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,840
It's missing a piece. It was your desk.

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,020
Let me see what you wrote.

138
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,120
You really didn't write anything?

139
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,480
I told you I didn't.

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,630
Stop looking.

141
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,600
Here it is!

142
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,490
I wish the boy I love

143
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,840
could love me too.

144
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,500
Who's that boy?

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,110
I didn't write that.

146
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,960
This is your handwriting.

147
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,170
I can recognize it.

148
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm officially informing you now:

149
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,500
the boy you love...

150
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,240
loves you too.

151
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,120
Miss!

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,030
He's harassing me!

153
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,910
I'll get beaten up when I get home anyway.

154
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,000
So I might as well

155
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,310
just do whatever I want now.

156
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,960
How dare you mess with me?

157
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,080
So… so audacious!

158
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,960
Miss!

159
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,820
Tell… Tell this boy to stop!

160
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,270
Dad.

161
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,220
You're back.

162
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,890
I just arrived.

163
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,270
Where's Mom?

164
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,370
Asleep.

165
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,910
You should go to sleep too.

166
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,510
Come here.

167
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,960
You and Fenghua...

168
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
We're together.

169
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Your mom told me

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,720
that

171
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
there's a tumor

172
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,030
in Fenghua's brain.

173
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,720
Right?

174
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
I've asked the doctor.

175
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,150
It can be treated,

176
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,870
but there are risks.

177
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,030
Are you

178
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
truly in love with her?

179
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,840
Or is it because of…

180
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
I just love her.

181
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,510
I'm serious.

182
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,780
I know

183
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,510
you and Mom don't approve.

184
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,560
Did I say that?

185
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,510
I don't disagree.

186
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
Back then,

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,550
when I married your mother,

188
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,180
my parents

189
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,120
didn't agree.

190
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,360
They said your mom was from a poor family

191
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,380
and of humble origins.

192
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,960
I chose my wife myself,

193
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,670
right?

194
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,080
I flipped out at the time.

195
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,870
I-If they wouldn't accept her,

196
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,000
I'd just get your mom on a ship

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,150
and live our own life.

198
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
At worst, we just wouldn't come back again.

199
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,960
I don't have your courage.

200
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,970
It's alright.

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,870
You have me.

202
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,750
You know your mom.

203
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,420
She has a bad temper sometimes,

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,080
but she has a kind heart.

205
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,330
I'll handle her.

206
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,550
Really?

207
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,870
Miss,

208
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,400
can I have your number?

209
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,960
I already have a boyfriend.

210
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,090
Who's your boyfriend?

211
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,110
Is he as handsome as me?

212
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,640
Not really.

213
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,440
My boyfriend is a little strange.

214
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,010
He staggers when he walks.

215
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,510
His face twitches,

216
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,230
and he drools when he talks.

217
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,240
Like this?

218
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,480
Go on.

219
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,420
I'm recording it.

220
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,510
Stop.

221
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,970
It's so embarrassing.

222
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,250
Why didn't you open the beers?

223
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,120
Our wives are not home.

224
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,060
Let us

225
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,120
have a drink,

226
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,510
just the two of us.

227
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,870
In-law,

228
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,200
cheers.

229
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,240
Well,

230
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,320
how long

231
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,440
have we

232
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,380
known each other?

233
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,910
36 years.

234
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,550
That's a long time.

235
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,830
We're still good buddies now.

236
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,800
It gotta be fate, right?

237
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,320
This is what they call destiny.

238
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:52,910
Let's drink.

239
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,910
Boss Xie.

240
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,040
I won't let Fenghua marry Wanghe.

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,710
Don't listen to Yan on this matter.

242
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,120
I made this decision myself.

243
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,870
Really?

244
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,270
You don't know.

245
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,670
Fenghua...

246
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,910
If she's sick, get her treated.

247
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,550
It's not a big deal.

248
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,320
Fenghua's condition is not a minor ailment.

249
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,660
We don't even know how long she can live.

250
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,030
You're her father.

251
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,380
You can't jinx it like that.

252
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,240
Let me tell you.

253
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,270
I've talked to Wanghe.

254
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,270
He's head over heels

255
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,030
in love with your daughter.

256
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,780
H-He won't marry anyone but her.

257
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,810
Besides,

258
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,340
when we married our wives back then,

259
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,270
didn't our parents disapprove too?

260
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,960
What did we do?

261
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,120
We were rebellious,

262
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,630
but our children can't be?

263
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,630
Who do you think you are?

264
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,440
Let's drink.

265
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,860
Boss Xie.

266
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,580
I've followed you since I was young.

267
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,990
I listen to you on everything,

268
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,930
big or small.

269
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,900
But this time...

270
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,550
You'll listen to me too,

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,790
okay?

272
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,520
Okay?

273
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,940
Okay.

274
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,930
I'll listen to you.

275
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,230
I'll listen to you.

276
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,650
I feel so sorry for Wanghe.

277
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,950
Nonsense.

278
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
Don't say that.

279
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,860
It's our children's marriage.

280
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,710
Let them decide for themselves.

281
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,230
It's their fate.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,110
Whether it'll end well or badly…

283
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,930
none of us can decide.

284
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,980
They've spent so much time together

285
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,150
since they were little.

286
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,270
How come I never noticed

287
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,510
any signs between them?

288
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,950
Then,

289
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,000
it's settled.

290
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,290
In-law.

291
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,480
In-law.

292
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,410
Good.

293
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,400
Yan.

294
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,760
Yan.

295
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,710
Yan, do you have a moment?

296
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,230
Yeah.

297
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,320
Let's

298
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,880
have a chat.

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,110
Okay.

300
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,510
Our children…

301
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,310
Don't say it.

302
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,400
No need to say it.

303
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,350
I don't agree

304
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,750
with them getting married either.

305
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,590
Don't worry.

306
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,030
I'm well aware of

307
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,350
Fenghua's illness.

308
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,120
I won't let her

309
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,270
become a burden to Wanghe.

310
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,790
Haihong.

311
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,170
We've been friends for so many years.

312
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,830
I understand.

313
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I know.

314
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,710
If I were you…

315
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,790
I wouldn't agree either.

316
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,030
We're the same.

317
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,500
Haihong.

318
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,930
When you have time,

319
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,900
accompany me to the temple.

320
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,170
Okay.

321
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,800
Let's go early

322
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,920
to burn the first incense.

323
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,870
I'm going there

324
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,970
to smash the temple.

325
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,680
That old monk in the temple

326
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,540
once read fortunes for Fenghua.

327
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,350
He said she'd live a great

328
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,400
and happy life.

329
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,050
He said she'd have many children and grandchildren.

330
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,900
It all seems impossible now.

331
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,410
Where is…

332
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,680
Fenghua's happy life?

333
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,200
You know Fenghua

334
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,440
has been a good girl since she was little.

335
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
You know that.

336
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,620
Fenghua

337
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,290
has been hesitant to have the surgery

338
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,580
because of her parents.

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,610
Now she's finally agreed.

340
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,440
Before she goes into surgery,

341
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,590
can't we give her something

342
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,010
to look forward to, some hope?

343
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,560
You…

344
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,400
You think I want this?

345
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,200
What I'm doing

346
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,790
will make everyone hate me.

347
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,880
You think I want to be the bad guy?

348
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,870
That's Fenghua.

349
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,270
We watched her grow up.

350
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Of course I know she's a good girl!

351
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,960
Mom,

352
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,440
I know

353
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,830
you want what's best for me.

354
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,510
I'm sure you hope

355
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,270
I can be happy

356
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,310
and content.

357
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,360
You don't want me to suffer.

358
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,960
I won't.

359
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,830
Put yourself in my shoes.

360
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,680
If this happened to you,

361
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,550
would you give up on Dad?

362
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,000
I would.

363
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
When you're young,

364
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,070
you think love is everything.

365
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,000
But marriage

366
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,960
is like sailing a ship.

367
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,660
The ship has just left the harbor,

368
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,790
but it's already leaking.

369
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,310
So tell me,

370
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,720
how long can you keep sailing?

371
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
You'll just watch it sink?

372
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,240
At this moment,

373
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,680
will you abandon the ship

374
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,200
or keep struggling

375
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,750
and then sink with the ship?

376
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,030
You can't understand now

377
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,830
because you haven't realized

378
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,110
how messy life can get.

379
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,240
You guys want to help her,

380
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,160
but it's too big of a favor for anyone to accept.

381
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
After all the struggle,

382
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,790
we might not even be able…

383
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,270
to maintain our long friendship

384
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,480

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,360
Don't spoil her.

758
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,750
She is

759
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,150
getting too big for her boots.

760
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,670
Dad!

761
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,960
Most fathers-in-law dislike their sons-in-law,

762
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,840
but you're taking his side.

763
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,670
You've gone completely over to his side!

764
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,970
A father-in-law will only

765
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,180
like his son-in-law more and more.

766
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,250
Yes.

767
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,440
He's really...

768
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,630
[Flower Street]

769
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,740
I never thought in the end

770
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,360
we'd all have to part ways.

771
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,070
Our two families won't separate.

772
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,970
We're one family now.

773
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,470
We'll stick together.

774
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,240
Of course, no matter who leaves,

775
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,950
we'll stay together.

776
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,370
[Flower Street]

777
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,410
What are you getting sentimental about?

778
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,590
We'll stay together.

779
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,290
Sorry.

780
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,440
Sir.

781
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,810
You're working late?

782
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,100
I made some noodles.

783
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,590
Have you eaten?

784
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,550
Would you like to try some?

785
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,880
Is it proper?

786
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,400
Of course.

787
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,310
Come on in.

788
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
There are plenty of noodles anyway.

789
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,550
They'll be soggy tomorrow.

790
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,470
Come on in.

791
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,230
Try some.

792
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,510
Just leave the bike here.

793
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,840
Come on in.

794
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,540
Careful.

795
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,980
Careful.

796
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,180
Here you go.

797
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,750
Your noodles.

798
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,740
Try them.

799
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,220
Then give me your valuable feedback.

800
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,100
What do you think?

801
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,850
Are they good?

802
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,490
They are

803
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,540
the most delicious…

804
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,440
noodles

805
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,200
I've ever had.

806
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,530
Uncle, be honest with me.

807
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,760
I am being honest.

808
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,320
You put your heart into these noodles.

809
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,870
I can taste that.

810
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,010
If you like them, have some more.

811
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,650
There are more in the kitchen.

812
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,190
Sir.

813
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,560
Sir!

814
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,340
Sir!

815
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,830
Sir, what's wrong with you?

816
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,910
Sir!

817
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,830
Sir!

818
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,940
Sir!
