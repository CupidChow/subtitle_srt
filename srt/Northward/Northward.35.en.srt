00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,900
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,479
Weren't you doing well

4
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,070
at Bee?

5
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,650
Why did you suddenly quit?

6
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,860
As a programmer,

7
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,840
where I work doesn't matter.

8
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,990
It matters.

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,860
For your profession,

10
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,290
Beijing, Hangzhou, or Shenzhen

11
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,260
can offer better prospects.

12
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,930
Prospects?

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,710
Are they important?

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,910
Of course they are.

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,490
Then why did you come back?

16
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,579
We're different.

17
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,450
How?

18
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,730
You're a boy.

19
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,970
To start a family, you must first establish a career.

20
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm a girl.

21
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,290
I can start a family without a career.

22
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,640
Who do you want to start a family with?

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,200
None of your business.

24
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,490
Given how pretty, charming, and kind I am,

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,620
it's easy for me to get married.

26
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,270
Wanghe is the first in line.

27
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,890
He'll go mad if someone cuts in line.

28
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,910
It's about to rain. Let's go home.

29
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,710
Okay.

30
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,280
Shouldn't you have dinner with me to welcome me back?

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
Alright, have your dad cook tonight.

32
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,310
I'll order the dishes.

33
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,250
No problem.

34
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,220
Here.

35
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,890
Thank you, Auntie.

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,710
How are things lately?

37
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Have you found a job?

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,110
No, I...

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,500
I don't know what I want to do.

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,690
You can't just sit around idle all day.

41
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,820
You need to work, don't you?

42
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Yes.

43
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
Am I right?

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,529
Mom, stop nagging.

45
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,950
Xingchi isn't a child.

46
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
He doesn't need you to worry about him.

47
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,070
I don't worry,

48
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,680
but his parents do.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,160
Enough.

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
There are a few dirty dishes in the kitchen.

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,380
Help me wash them.

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you, Mom.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,450
I'll leave you to talk.

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,040
Okay.

55
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,500
Don't listen to my mom.

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,920
When it comes to finding a job,

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,310
you should listen to yourself.

58
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,700
What do you think

59
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,390
I'm suited for?

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,900
Rather than what you're suited for,

61
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,310
it's more about

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,159
what you like.

63
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,970
When we were young,

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,310
we looked for jobs

65
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,480
that had high salaries

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
and low barriers to entry.

67
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,040
We always felt that as long as we worked hard enough,

68
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,040
we could carve out a path for ourselves.

69
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,520
But think about all these past years.

70
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,310
How many jobs have we tried?

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,310
What did we get?

72
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,020
I think at this age,

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,600
we should think about

74
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,170
what we really like to do.

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,740
Otherwise, you'd still be wasting your life.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
You'd regret it when you're older.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,250
Eat up. What are you thinking about?

78
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,460
I'm just…

79
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,800
thinking about how to know what I like.

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
You need to think about that?

81
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,920
Don't you know

82
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,240
what you like and dislike?

83
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,890
It's just like dating.

84
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,430
Isn't who you are into

85
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,430
crystal clear in your heart?

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,400
Also,

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,270
when you truly enjoy doing something,

88
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,920
you'll feel that

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
time passes incredibly fast.

90
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,040
An entire afternoon

91
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,720
will be gone in the blink of an eye.

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,740
Right?

93
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,630
Cheers. Congratulations!

94
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,800
Speed it up a bit!

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,630
Uncle Zhou.

96
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,870
Come on.

97
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,100
Go ahead. What's the matter?

98
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
I want to

99
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,200
become your apprentice.

100
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,350
You...

101
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,770
I've loved cooking since I was a child.

102
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,360
I-I feel

103
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,800
at ease

104
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,090
when I cook.

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,430
At ease?

106
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,120
I love

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,920
the sizzling sounds in the wok.

108
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,220
I also love the smell of cooking oil.

109
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,600
I just feel that

110
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,040
when I'm cooking,

111
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,240
time passes incredibly fast.

112
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,520
And then?

113
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,780
Then you feel

114
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,180
all your worries

115
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,120
disappear,

116
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,290
and you're able to

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,110
control everything on the stove?

118
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,920
Yes, that's exactly the feeling.

119
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,960
That's the feeling.

120
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,740
But Xingchi,

121
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,060
it's a bit late.

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,510
You know what?

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Cooks need to start young.

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,750
I-It doesn't matter.

125
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,210
I-I don't aim to be a top chef.

126
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,830
As long as I can learn something,

127
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,320
I don't mind being a kitchen helper.

128
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,630
Alright.

129
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,230
Then,

130
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,530
you'll start as a kitchen hand.

131
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,970
Thank you, Master.

132
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,120
Hold on.

133
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,380
Have I taken you as my apprentice?

134
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,570
Listen.

135
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Being a kitchen hand means

136
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
you won't get to cook for months.

137
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,510
Are you okay with that?

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,390
Yes.

139
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,920
As long as I can learn something,

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,950
I'm willing to do anything.

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,190
Alright then.

142
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,390
When the time comes,

143
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,390
you'll make a bowl of Yang Chun Noodles as the test.

144
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,710
If you pass it,

145
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
I'll take you as my apprentice.

146
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,720
No problem.

147
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't be so confident.

148
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,830
You think it's easy to make Yang Chun Noodles?

149
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,820
The simpler a dish is, the harder it is to make it great.

150
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,800
Understand?

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,140
Then, Uncle Zhou, what should I

152
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,260
do now?

153
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,630
Now?

154
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,050
Cut your hair.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,600
Otherwise, the deal is off the table.

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,750
I-I'll go cut it right now.

157
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm on it. I'm on it.

158
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
Brat.

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,120
Dad.

160
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,120
Rui, take a look at this.

161
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,610
Careful.

162
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,840
Look.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,080
Zhou Yiyan?

164
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,600
Yes!

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,910
This watch

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,820
is a family heirloom of Mr. Zhou's.

167
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,470
Its movement was broken.

168
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,120
Last year, Mr. Zhou brought this watch here for repair,

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,340
but he forgot about it.

170
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,240
Zhou mentioned it briefly,

171
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,750
and we managed to retrieve it.

172
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
The engraving on it is in Italian.

173
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,100
And I've seen this pattern online before.

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,600
The key is the name Zhou Yiyan.

175
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,410
It was mentioned in Little Polo's diary.

176
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,520
He was the second apprentice of the seafarer Xia.

177
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,990
We found a match for the Zhou family too.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Let's go tell Uncle Zhou then.

179
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,180
Let's go.

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,390
Let's go.

181
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,660
Here. Look.

182
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,130
Here.

183
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,640
[Zhou Yiyan]

184
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,960
Yeah.

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
Well…

186
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,250
Well…

187
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,630
if that's the case,

188
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,440
my ancestor was also on this ship?

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.

190
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,960
Otherwise, why would your dad have paid

191
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,910
so much attention to this matter?

192
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,850
He's never forgotten Little Polo.

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,970
He must have heard about him when he was young,

194
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,670
and he's been stuck in his mind.

195
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,850
Yes, yes.

196
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,580
Yes, yes.

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Yes, yes.

198
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,260
Isn't it amazing how this all turned out?

199
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,430
It's confirmed for the Shao family, right?

200
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,060
So is it for my family.

201
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,670
What about the Xie and Xia families?

202
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,220
We'll keep looking into it.

203
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,530
The Xie family's ancestral home isn't local.

204
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,020
We'll have to make a trip.

205
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,170
The Xia family should be easier to look into.

206
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,180
Then let's discuss it with Uncle Xia

207
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,610
and make time to visit his hometown someday.

208
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,680
No need.

209
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,460
Have Yan make a call.

210
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,620
If they have genealogical records,

211
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,890
ask them to make a copy and send it over.

212
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,800
As long as the name matches,

213
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,910
it's confirmed.

214
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,130
Mr. Shao, you're amazing.

215
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,720
Impressive!

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,780
Also,

217
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,250
do you think we should

218
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,470
tell Mr. Zhou this good news?

219
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,350
We should.

220
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,440
We must tell him.

221
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,520
We must tell him.

222
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,980
[Zhou Yiyan]

223
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,770
During my afternoon nap,

224
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,030
I had a dream.

225
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
I dreamt that

226
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,380
I was on a ship.

227
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,850
It was at night,

228
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,810
and people on the shore were shooting arrows at my ship.

229
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,570
The ship caught fire.

230
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,290
I woke up frightened.

231
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,120
You dreamt of a ship?

232
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,690
Dad.

233
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,160
On that ship you dreamed of,

234
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,840
was there someone named

235
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,150
Little Polo?

236
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,620
Little Polo?

237
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,560
That sounds familiar.

238
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,210
Little Polo?

239
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Little Polo

240
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,440
was an Italian.

241
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,240
He grew up

242
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
loving Marco Polo's stories,

243
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,830
so he was fascinated by

244
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,500
our ancient country.

245
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
After he grew up,

246
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,980
he finally had the chance to come to China.

247
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,030
He rented a ship in Wuxi

248
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,720
and traveled north along our canal.

249
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,030
On board with him were

250
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,200
an interpreter named Xie Pingyao,

251
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
a porter named Shao Changlai,

252
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,120
and the ship owner called Xia.

253
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,370
Xia had two apprentices,

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,810
one of whom was named Zhou Yiyan.

255
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,550
Zhou Yiyan?

256
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
That also sounds familiar.

257
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,080
I must have heard that name before.

258
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,200
Little Polo, along with those people,

259
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,320
traveled along the Grand Canal, observing it.

260
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,720
At the beginning of the 20th century,

261
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
what he saw was

262
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,840
a China facing

263
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,510
enormous changes.

264
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,720
On that ship, Little Polo

265
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,480
used a Parker pen

266
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,480
to write his diary in a leather notebook.

267
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,960
He used a Kodak camera

268
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,650
to capture the customs along the canal.

269
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,600
As for Xie Pingyao,

270
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,850
he was reading books by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao.

271
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,480
He was pondering, with the influence of Western ideas,

272
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,320
what path our ancient country

273
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,030
should take.

274
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,650
Xia's apprentice, Zhou Yiyan,

275
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,870
began to show interest in foreign things.

276
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,180
He was secretly learning Italian,

277
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,390
believing that if he mastered a foreign language,

278
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,390
his descendants might become interpreters too

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,240
and live a worry-free life for generations.

280
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,990
His eagerness to learn touched Little Polo,

281
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,370
so Little Polo

282
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,610
gave Zhou Yiyan a watch.

283
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,890
And this watch

284
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,300
has been kept by his descendants

285
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,210
until today.

286
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,910
Who'd have known?

287
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,570
-It's shocking.
-Yeah.

288
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,840
My family even had a connection to art.

289
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,070
Yes.

290
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,220
Oh, man.

291
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,670
What's the occasion today?

292
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,240
Uncle.

293
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,920
Boss Xie, Boss Xie.

294
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,270
Boss Xie, hurry.

295
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,400
What's this gathering for?

296
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,840
What's going on?

297
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
We've been waiting for you.

298
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,480
Look at these dishes.

299
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's have a drink first.

300
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,120
Aren't they great?

301
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,360
Let's have a drink first.

302
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Let me tell you

303
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
some good news.

304
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Wonderful news!

305
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,720
What's it?

306
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,960
-You drink first.
-Drink first.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,200
We'll talk after you drink.

308
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,420
Drink up.

309
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,320
Great!

310
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,960
Great!

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,270
Here.

312
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,750
Great.

313
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,320
Xia, tell him.

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
What?

315
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,310
I've

316
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,720
found my roots.

317
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,660
My ancestor

318
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,780
has been confirmed.

319
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,230
Who?

320
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
Remember that ship?

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,670
They found a seafarer on the ship

322
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
whose surname was also Xia.

323
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,490
He was my ancestor.

324
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,910
There are many people with the surname Xia.

325
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
How do you know he was your ancestor?

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,630
Look at him.

327
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,110
I asked

328
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,270
Yan

329
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
to call my parents

330
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,120
and have my mom look for our genealogical records and such.

331
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,720
But we don't have such things.

332
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,270
However, an old person in the village said

333
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,840
that one of my ancestors

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,120
indeed worked as a seafarer.

335
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,550
He even worked for a foreigner

336
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,470
and helped him out.

337
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,240
That foreigner

338
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
gave him

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,560
an old Kodak camera.

340
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,150
The thing Mr. Zhou called

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
the "soul-capturing cannon."

342
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,440
Yes.

343
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,820
That's it.

344
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,490
M-My family even has an old photo taken back then.

345
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,910
They were afraid of

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,150
persecution from the government,

347
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,320
so they kept it hidden and never dared to show it.

348
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,550
Where's the photo?

349
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,390
H-Here.

350
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,840
They've sent it to me. Look.

351
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,480
Look.

352
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,960
Take a look.

353
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,260
See?

354
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,720
This young man

355
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,960
is Grandpa Zhou's ancestor.

356
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,730
This porter on the side

357
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,200
was called Shao Changlai.

358
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,870
He was my ancestor.

359
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,000
And the one

360
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,860
dressed with a scholarly air

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,750
and looking like an interpreter…

362
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,110
This one.

363
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,200
He was called Xie Pingyao.

364
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,870
We are not sure

365
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,120
whether this Xie Pingyao

366
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,790
was your ancestor.

367
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,000
So we need to make a trip to your hometown

368
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
to investigate further.

369
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,080
Xie Pingyao?

370
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,210
Our ancestors were all on the same ship?

371
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,600
This is too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

372
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,250
Are you really going?

373
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
The tickets are already booked.

374
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,440
I have to go.

375
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
Besides, Mr. Shao and the others

376
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,490
all have good intentions.

377
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,510
Why did you hang your shirt

378
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,160
in my closet?

379
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,550
It's so flashy.

380
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,480
I think

381
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,960
they've gone crazy.

382
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,550
How can it be that

383
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,700
those on that sunken ship

384
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,960
were all our ancestors?

385
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,750
This is too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

386
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,440
As Mr. Zhou said,

387
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,350
this is fate.

388
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,960
If the guy called Xie Pingyao

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
on Little Polo's ship

390
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,450
was really the Xie family's ancestor…

391
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,010
You know what?

392
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,070
From now on,

393
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,720
everyone in this courtyard

394
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,260
will be our family.

395
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,950
They already are.

396
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,000
It's different.

397
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Firstly, I'm going

398
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,440
back to my hometown to trace my roots.

399
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,310
Secondly, I want to relax a bit.

400
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,020
Are you sure you won't come with me?

401
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,960
Our son is suffering in Beijing.

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm not in the mood to relax with you.

403
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,510
Can't you

404
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,750
have a little faith in our son?

405
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,270
People are criticizing him

406
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,310
all over the internet.

407
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,640
It's so upsetting.

408
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
I sent him messages,

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and he just replied, "I'm fine."

410
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,200
The more he says he's fine,

411
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,880
the more worried I become.

412
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,310
If he was not fine,

413
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,240
he would have come back already.

414
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,350
Look.

415
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,550
Fenghua,

416
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,830
Haikuo,

417
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
and Xingchi

418
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,830
have all come back.

419
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,960
They didn't say it out loud,

420
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,110
but it's obvious that

421
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,440
they couldn't hold on in Beijing anymore.

422
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,960
If that's the case,

423
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
I hope our son fails

424
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,400
and comes back soon.

425
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,110
He won't come back.

426
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,930
How do you know?

427
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,200
Because he's my son.

428
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
At his age,

429
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,200
I had already bought my first ship

430
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,750
and married

431
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,160
you,

432
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,350
an adorable woman

433
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,400
who gave me a strong boy.

434
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Back then,

435
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
I felt like a king.

436
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,270
Nothing seemed like a problem to me.

437
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,270
I never

438
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,880
groveled to anyone

439
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
or begged anyone.

440
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,720
Just

441
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,200
give our son some time,

442
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,240
okay?

443
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,880
And this.

444
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,000
Take it with you.

445
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
Why?

446
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,000
For safety.

447
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,400
Alright.

448
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,290
It's fine.

449
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,720
And this too.

450
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm not going to drive the truck. You…

451
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Better safe than sorry.

452
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,150
Okay, fine.

453
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,110
Alright, alright.

454
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,680
And also...

455
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Take care of them on the road.

456
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,510
They don't travel much.

457
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,680
Keep an eye out for them.

458
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,070
[Jixiang Passanger Transport Co., Ltd.]

459
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
Alright, be patient.

460
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,650
Don't be downhearted.

461
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,200
This kind of investigation

462
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,560
is just like this.

463
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,540
It takes time.

464
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,070
I think we might as well

465
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,310
head back.

466
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,350
We've been totally clueless,

467
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,610
running here and there.

468
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,990
What can we possibly find?

469
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,240
Now that we're already here,

470
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,350
before we find something,

471
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,730
we can't go back.

472
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,640
If we prove that Xie Pingyao

473
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,070
was your ancestor,

474
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,160
it means

475
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,240
everyone in our courtyard is family.

476
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,270
What are the odds?

477
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,790
Looking back several generations in my family,

478
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,310
t-there wasn't a single scholar among us.

479
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,460
And Xie Pingyao was an interpreter.

480
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,830
I think we just happen to share the same surname.

481
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,680
It's impossible.

482
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
So we...

483
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,360
Uncle Shao.

484
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,400
We found something.

485
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,200
What is it?

486
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,640
My dad and I

487
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,790
passed by an ancestral hall just now.

488
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,160
We decided to go in and take a look.

489
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,250
When they heard

490
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,750
that we study history,

491
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,400
they showed us a notebook.

492
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,200
I took a look.

493
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
The notes are in Italian.

494
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Boss Xie.

495
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,610
Shao.

496
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,110
Here's the thing.

497
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,790
This gentleman's ancestor

498
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,240
knew Xie Pingyao,

499
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,710
and they were close friends.

500
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,830
This is that notebook.

501
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

502
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,400
So this is Italian?

503
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,700
Yes.

504
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,070
I can't understand it.

505
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,480
To my friend Shaoming.

506
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,070
Wang Shaoming,

507
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,640
my ancestor.

508
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,890
Your ancestor?

509
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,160
To my friend Shaoming.

510
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,110
Study it often

511
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,240
and recite it diligently.

512
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,000
You'll then

513
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,350
understand Italian.

514
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,010
From Xie Pingyao.

515
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,360
This can't prove anything though.

516
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,140
There's also a letter here.

517
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Take a look.

518
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,430
Let me.

519
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,070
This notebook was given to me by my close friend Pingyao

520
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,070
before he and his son Lingzhi

521
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,270
left for Hangzhou.

522
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,440
Pingyao once taught me Italian,

523
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,790
but unfortunately, my talent is limited,

524
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,440
and I can't…

525
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,060
Hold on. What?

526
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,820
His son Lingzhi?

527
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,030
His son Lingzhi.

528
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,200
Xie Lingzhi?

529
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,300
To Hangzhou.

530
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,990
That's my grandfather's elder brother!

531
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,830
You eat too.

532
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I will.

533
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,960
Have you decided what major you want to study?

534
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,980
The teacher says

535
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,550
you're good at science.

536
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
I'm happy about that,

537
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,510
but I also hope

538
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,240
that you won't neglect other subjects.

539
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,720
How are the other children doing at school?

540
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Xingchi is good.

541
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,680
Wanghe and Fenghua are average.

542
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,160
How about Siyi?

543
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,270
She's at

594
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,210
She doesn't want to upset her parents,

595
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,020
so she just keeps it bottled inside

596
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,540

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,000
Are you crazy?

759
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,680
Let go of me.

760
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,510
Fenghua.

761
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,450
You've chosen conservative treatment

762
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,410
because you don't want your parents to worry, right?

763
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,080
It's not necessary.

764
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,900
Relax.

765
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,590
Get whatever treatment you need.

766
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,000
If you're cured,

767
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,400
everyone will be happy.

768
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,300
If you die on the operating table…

769
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,350
in the future,

770
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,550
your parents will be my parents.

771
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,270
I'll take care of them for life.

772
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,750
I don't understand…

773
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,120
love and romance.

774
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,790
I've never been in a relationship before.

775
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,270
But I'm sure of one thing:

776
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,920
if your name

777
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,480
can't be on my household registration booklet…

778
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,050
I'll never have peace of mind in my life.

779
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,110
You're just possessive.

780
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,540
It's not love.

781
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,000
I want you to be mine.

782
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,760
Got a problem with that?

783
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,800
From now on,

784
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,270
I, Xie Wanghe,

785
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,070
will be the son-in-law of the Xia family.

786
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
I'll spend the rest of my life proving

787
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,740
that you, Xia Fenghua, have impeccable taste

788
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,940
in men.

789
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,410
[Flying Bird Tea House]

790
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,980
Sir.

791
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,020
Are my vegetables packed?

792
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,930
Yeah.

793
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,000
-Okay.
-Thank you.

794
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,670
Careful.

795
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,150
Pick one yourself.

796
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,750
Madam.

797
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,840
Where's my tofu?

798
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,240
It's ready.

799
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,750
Thank you.

800
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,480
You're welcome.

801
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,070
It's still hot.

802
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,750
Alright.

803
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,240
Thank you.

804
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:33,750
No problem.

805
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,480
Thank you.

806
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,170
Uncle.

807
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,830
I heard

808
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,380
you started learning to cook?

809
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes.

810
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,550
Great.

811
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,310
That's great.

812
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,550
Maybe you have a talent for it.

813
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,870
Do your best.

814
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,900
Don't worry, Uncle.

815
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,790
You should

816
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,900
come to my place for a meal sometime.

817
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,760
Alright, I'll get going.

818
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,710
Take care.

819
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm off.

820
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,250
Take care.

821
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,160
A good cook

822
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,630
is like a painter.

823
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,680
When you start, you can plan and compose,

824
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,250
but you can't be restricted by the details.

825
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,130
Concerns like

826
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,870
the brand of your brushes

827
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,210
and ink

828
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,920
are meaningless.

829
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,050
You must first learn to use your heart, then your mind.

830
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,380
Let me give you an example.

831
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,250
When you like someone,

832
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,610
you don't need to think about it.

833
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,110
You just know

834
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,940
whether you like her or not.

835
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,040
Every cell in your body

836
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,320
is reminding you.

837
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,070
That's not scientific.

838
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,590
Of course it's not scientific.

839
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,080
Cooking itself is an art.

840
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,100
This is important.

841
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,000
What do you think?

842
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,170
It's okay.

843
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,360
Don't just say okay.

844
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,090
Give me some specific feedback.

845
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,000
Specific?

846
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,580
Well…

847
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,660
The soup

848
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,370
seems to be missing something.

849
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,170
M-Missing what?

850
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,550
I can't put my finger on it.

851
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,510
What do you think?

852
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,160
W-What do you think?

853
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,660
I really think it's fine.

854
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,080
It's much better than the noodles in Beijing.

855
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,550
It's pointless asking you.

856
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,370
You even think instant noodles taste good.

857
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,340
In the future,

858
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,370
do you really plan to be a chef?

859
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,650
Fenghua told me

860
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,930
she hopes I can do

861
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,960
something I truly love.

862
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,190
After thinking it over,

863
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,600
it seems

864
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,630
I'm only happy when I'm cooking.

865
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,590
Alright.

866
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,260
Then go for it.

867
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,650
When you're a good cook,

868
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,920
I'll invest in you,

869
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,300
and we'll open a big restaurant

870
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
to cut in on his dad's business.

871
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,840
I'll hold you to that.

872
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,710
The apprentice is planning

873
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,760
to steal his master's business?

874
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,400
-No.
-Fine.

875
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,440
I'll tell my dad to hold back some skills.

876
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
No, no, no.

877
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,670
That's not what I meant, Young Master.

878
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,400
Look.

879
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
You were talking nonsense.

880
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,710
It has nothing to do with me.

881
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,170
Well, it depends on your attitude.

882
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,710
I'll tell my dad how many skills he should teach you.

883
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,190
How do you think they're different from the noodles your dad makes?

884
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,490
If I could answer that, I'd be teaching you myself.

885
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,230
Let me tell you something serious.

886
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,280
After I came back this time,

887
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
I proposed to Fenghua.

888
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,510
She said yes.

889
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,130
Congratulations.

890
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,630
It's

891
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
good news,

892
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,880
but my parents might not agree.

893
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,440
Why?

894
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,590
Fenghua…

895
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,630
has a brain tumor.

896
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,550
We don't know how long she has left.

897
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,300
Hurry, come and watch!

898
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,170
This TV series is so good.

899
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,780
Look at them,

900
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,250
falling in love so passionately in school.

901
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,400
Look at you.

902
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,070
You guys.

903
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,670
It ends in tragedy.

904
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,430
They won't end up together.

905
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,300
How do you know?

906
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,880
I've read the novel.

907
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,260
It's heartbreaking.

908
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,800
What's the point of watching a sad story?

909
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,800
What a waste of time.

910
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,920
I'll make up a story

911
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,840
with a happy ending for you.

912
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,190
Go on.

913
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,460
For example,

914
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,080
Fang Hui,

915
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
after many twists and turns,

916
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,580
still ended up with Chen Xun.

917
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,740
They are planning to get married.

918
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,330
But before the wedding,

919
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,300
Fang Hui finds out she has cancer.

920
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,810
So the two families…

921
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,800
That's just the classic soap opera plot.

922
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,710
The female lead

923
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
either gets into a car accident

924
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,800
or gets cancer.

925
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,110
How can there be so many

926
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,840
young girls getting cancer in this world?

927
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,030
It's lame.

928
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,190
That kind of TV series is pretentious.

929
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,030
I don't want to watch it.

930
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,360
It makes me uncomfortable.

931
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,120
Let me finish.

932
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
Fang Hui finds out she has cancer

933
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,000
and is afraid Chen Xun's family will object.

934
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,320
What do you think

935
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,590
they should do?

936
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,110
If she has cancer, she shouldn't be a burden to others.

937
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,150
Just pack up her things

938
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,000
and find a place far away to wait for death.

939
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,550
At least she'll leave a good impression,

940
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,320
right?

941
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,760
What if I had cancer?

942
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,320
What?

943
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,280
I have a brain tumor.

944
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,440
Wanghe wants to marry me,

945
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,880
but he's afraid Ms. Liang will object.

946
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,110
What should we do?

947
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,140
-To our success!
-To our success!

948
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,260
-To our success!
-To our success!

949
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,720
Wow,

950
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,180
my ancestor was an interpreter,

951
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,390
an educated man.

952
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,800
How come I

953
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,230
ended up…

954
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,150
I'm a disgrace to my family.

955
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,620
Not at all.

956
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,960
Boss Xie, you're a big shot

957
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,670
on Flower Street, aren't you?

958
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,770
-I'm nothing.
-After all this investigation,

959
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,400
it turns out that Shao's ancestor

960
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,510
was a porter,

961
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,970
but Shao is well-educated.

962
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,190
What a reversal of fortune!

963
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,760
Yes.

964
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,480
Mr. Shao,

965
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,030
you should start

966
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,230
compiling your family tree now

967
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,190
and pass it down

968
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,230
from generation to generation.

969
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,400
-No, no, no.
-Bring honor to your family.

970
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,760
Here is what I think.

971
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,710
Compiling my family tree isn't very meaningful.

972
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,440
I actually think

973
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,790
we should write a play.

974
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,110
We should include Little Polo

975
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,150
and our ancestors in it.

976
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:46,760
Think about it.

977
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,440
This way,

978
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,760
the story will not only be written down

979
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,760
but also have sounds and visuals.

980
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,590
Right?

981
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,150
We can tour along the canal.

982
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,400
This way,

983
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,630
it will never be

984
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,440
forgotten by the world.

985
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,150
I think that's viable.

986
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,840
Interesting idea.

987
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,190
-Cheers to Mr. Shao.
-Great idea.

988
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,000
Something happened.

989
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Wanghe

990
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,000
wants to marry Fenghua.

991
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,190
I-Isn't that a good thing?

992
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,880
But

993
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,880
something's happened to Fenghua.

994
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,320
But I think we can add

995
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
some Italian opera elements.

996
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,150
Opera won't do.

997
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,880
Opera will do.

998
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,670
Just like they do…

999
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,630
Or you could write a…

1000
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,510
On the ships in Venice.

1001
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,980
You can't have acquaintances perform in an opera, right?

1002
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,880
You can go perform in Italy.

1003
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,490
That would feel a bit weird.

1004
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,590
It's all about…

1005
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,210
I don't agree.

1006
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,190
-Your dad…
-Mom.

1007
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,710
won't agree either.

1008
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,870
When you have children, you'll understand.

1009
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,720
Marrying a girl

1010
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,860
who doesn't know how long she has left?

1011
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,330
No mother

1012
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,190
would agree to her son

1013
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,720
doing that.
