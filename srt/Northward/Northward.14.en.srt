[Episode 14]

3
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,710
Don't watch so many soap operas.

4
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,990
You're already not smart.

5
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,180
The more you watch, the dumber you get.

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,350
What are you thinking about? Go to sleep!

7
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,550
Who are you talking about?

8
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,350
Say that again!

9
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,310
Who are you calling dumb?

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,450
-Apologize!
-Sorry. Sorry.

11
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,460
Fenghua.

12
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,910
I thought of

13
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,100
a position in my future company

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,160
that's perfect for you.

15
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,870
What is it?

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,520
Security guard.

17
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,550
It's the perfect job

18
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,430
for you.

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,290
Sure, I'll keep you safe!

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,230
Go get some rest.

21
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,829
Good night.

22
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,670
Good night.

23
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,270
Grandma.

24
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,430
You're back?

25
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,950
Have you had dinner?

26
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,310
Yes.

27
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,120
Siyi.

28
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,770
You must be tired.

29
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,360
I saved some dinner for you.

30
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,630
When will Chen Rui be discharged

31
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,310
from the hospital?

32
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,540
Soon.

33
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,270
Once he's discharged,

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,630
you won't have to work so hard, right?

35
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,710
Alright.

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,810
If you're tired, go to bed.

37
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,690
I'll go put away the food.

38
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,900
Grandma.

39
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,630
Come here.

40
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,870
What's wrong?

41
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,270
I want to ask you something.

42
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,140
How can you tell

43
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,550
if someone likes you?

44
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
I'm not asking for myself.

45
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,000
It's for a classmate.

46
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,560
Well, about that,

47
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,430
you don't need to think too hard about it.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,589
If he likes you,

49
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,890
you'll naturally know.

50
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,630
It's like

51
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,240
cooking rice.

52
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,470
When the rice is ready, you can smell its aroma.

53
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,010
What if

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,430
he likes someone else at the same time?

55
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,830
That won't happen.

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,640
If he likes you,

57
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,700
he'll only have eyes for you.

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,780
Your grandpa and I

59
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,770
fell in love at first sight.

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,950
At that time,

61
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,430
he only had eyes for me.

62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,510
He followed me everywhere I went.

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,200
He was so clingy.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,290
In the future,

65
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,110
you should find someone like that,

66
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,820
someone who only has eyes for you.

67
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,990
My little darling,

68
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,270
you have something on your mind.

69

70
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,300
it's not about me.

71
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,290
Okay. Whatever you say.

everyone can take today's joint exam seriously.

76

Let's take this opportunity

77
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,050
to find out

78
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,650
how wide the gap between No. 1 High School and us is.

79
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,510
Show the excellence of No. 1 High School.

80
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,710
Let everyone know that our school

81
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,540
can never be surpassed.

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,970
You should have some pride.

83
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,270
You can't lose too badly.

84
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,420
Francis Bacon once said,

85
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,580
"Histories make men wise;

86
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,620
the mathematics, subtle."

87
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,510
There's an old Chinese saying

88
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,160
that goes, "Victory and defeat are both common in war."

89
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,940
Don't be too nervous.

90
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,450
Relax.

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,430
We usually only do retail,

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
not wholesale.

98
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,600

-I wouldn't…
-That's why I keep saying

Right? Good buddies.

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,270
Yeah.

The water…

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,790
I think…

105
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,670
Get a few more cases of it.

106
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,040
A few more.

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,590
How many cases of water?

108
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,710
Seven or eight.

109
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,240
Okay.

00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,030
Eight cases, right?

Eight cases of water.

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,670
The bread…

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,590
This one.

115
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,670
It's new.

116

Trust me.

117
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,210
Really?

118
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes. It sells very well.

119
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,950
Lao'er, take six boxes of them.

120
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,030
Six boxes.

121
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,950
Okay. Six boxes.

Okay.

This kind of thing doesn't sell well.

Don't buy so many.

127
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,500
Back when we were seafaring,

128
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,050
bottled water and bread

129
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,420
were necessities.

130
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,710
Do as I say.

131
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,150
Supermarkets on land

132
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,150
are pretty much the same as those on water.

133
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,020
Understand?

134
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,420
My judgment should be pretty accurate.

143
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,909
Yeah. Look.

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,630
Is it expensive?

148
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,310
Hold it.

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,540

You're still in the shipping business?

173
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,110
What else can I do?

174
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,610
It's the only thing I know in my life.

175
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,810
Why are you selling things?

176
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,660
It was Xia Lao'er's idea.

177
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,159
Just for fun.

178
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,049
Is this supermarket profitable?

After being taught a lesson,

385
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,270
he'll behave better in the future.

386
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,260
If I were you,

387
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,790
I'd have kicked him.

388
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,040
He's the one getting beaten. Why are you crying?

389
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,390
Are your hands hurting from hitting him?

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,180
My heart hurts.

391
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,600
I feel sorry for my younger self.

392
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,680
I was also only ten years old then.

393
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,060
My mom kicked me out,

394
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,050
like a bag of trash.

395
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,390
Don't cry.

396
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,810
This hoodie is clean.

397
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
You'd end up getting snot all over me again.

398
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,750
I won't cry.

399
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,150
Actually,

400
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,170
you should thank your mom.

401
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,900
She didn't want you

402
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,970
and sent you here,

403
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,240
or you wouldn't have met me,

404
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,310
Wanghe, Xingchi, and Haikuo.

405
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,670
We're all your family.

406
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,450
If you had stayed with her,

407
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,070
you might have become depressed already.

408
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,540
Yeah.

409
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,750
Without you guys,

410
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,630
I don't know what I would have become.

411
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,900
You'd be miserable,

412
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,300
wallowing in self-pity all day

413
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,480
and washing your face with tears.

414
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,750
You'd get tuberculosis

415
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,839
and cough your lungs out at everyone.

416
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,400
What about you?

417
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,359
What if your mom abandoned you?

418
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,270
She'd never do that.

419
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,430
I mean, if she did.

420
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,720
We're different.

421
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,460
If I were you,

422
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,580
I'd scream and yell and roll on the ground.

423
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,880
I'd follow her around every day,

424
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,720
holding up a banner and making tearful protests.

425
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,550
So no one dares to abandon me.

426
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,770
The price is too high.

427
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,050
You're such a soft touch.

428
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,470
When you get hurt,

429
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,050
you just cry secretly under the covers

430
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,400
and even try to blame yourself.

431
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,780
"Have I not behaved well enough

432
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,670
and disappointed Mom?"

433
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,030
This is not right. You can't think like that.

434
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,740
I know it's not right,

435
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
but I can't change myself.

436
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
Today,

437
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,500
when I heard my brother crying outside the door,

438
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,290
at that moment, I actually felt

439
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
great.

440
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,880
It was like…

441
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,780
I was gloating.

442
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,980
Back then, it was because of

443
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,000
my brother

444
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
that my mom abandoned me.

445
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,560
Now he's in the same situation as I was.

446
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,630
I thought to myself,

447
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
"Now it's your turn."

448
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,910
But when I saw him

449
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,430
sitting on the ground crying,

450
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,460
I felt so sorry for him.

451
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,350
Because we're the same,

452
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,110
both thrown out like trash.

453
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,550
In the future,

454
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,860
he and I will have to rely on each other.

455
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,010
If you're going to rely on anyone, it should be me,

456
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,500
not that little brat.

457
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,720
He doesn't deserve it.

458
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,830
Well, that…

459
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,380

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,700
♫I won't let myself fall♫

573
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,310
And this is No. 1 High School's.

574
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,030
♫I don't want endless nagging and chatter♫

575
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
♫Words that make no sense♫

576
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,460
♫Head up, I race forward with a roar♫

577
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,580
♫Facing all those staring eyes♫

578
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,980
♫Years from now♫

579
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,390
Awesome.

♫Time will prove it all♫

581
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,640
Awesome.

582
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,920
♫Everything gained and lost♫

Alright.

589
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,120
Uncle Zhou,

590
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,990
your cooking is different today.

591
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,990
How?

592
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,750
♫Blood burning hot♫

593
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,420
It's completely different, not the usual taste.

594
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,310
How does it taste today?

595
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,200
It tastes happy.

596
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,890
♫Blood burning hot♫

597
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,120
You brat!

598
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,070
You know what happiness tastes like?

599
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,420
Xie Wanghe.

600
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,460
Sir.

601
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,720
The idea of the test prep center was yours, wasn't it?

602
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,770
Yes.

603
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,950
I know when the school

604
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,540
used your idea,

605
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,550
you were a bit upset.

606
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,510
No, no, no.

607
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,590
Not at all.

608
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,110
I know you did it for our good.

609
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,230
Let me finish.

610
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,110
At that time, No. 7 High School

611
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,630
had been under pressure from other schools for many years.

612
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,590
We felt ashamed.

613
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,390
As teachers of the school,

614
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,400
we were bitter inside.

615
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,270
So I sincerely hope

616
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,440
you can understand our feelings.

617
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,270
Of course.

618
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,700
We totally understand.

619
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:07,950
Yes.

620
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,390
Right?

621
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,550
Yes.

622
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,430
Thank you.

623
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,670
Thank you for your hard work, teachers.

625

Goodbye.

626
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,790
Goodbye.

627
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,670
Wait a moment.

628
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,470
Okay.

Goodbye.

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,430
Goodbye.

632
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,950
Have all the students left?

633
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,580
Yes, all the students have left.

634
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,430
Ge Siwei.

635
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,590
Ge Siwei, come out!

636
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,910
How dare you skip school?

637
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,470
Ge Siwei.

638
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,510
Come out. Where are you hiding?

639
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,930
Siyi, what's wrong?

640
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,010
Where's Siwei?

641
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,190
He hasn't come back.

642
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,270
I bought some meat

643
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,710
to make shredded pork with green peppers for you two.

644
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,830
He didn't go to school at all today.

645
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,350
Go look for him.

646
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,130
Okay.

647
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,070
That boy…

648
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,750
Siwei.

649
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,150
Slow down!

650
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,470
Siyi, perfect timing.

651
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,470
Let's go eat.

652
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,970
I can't. I need to look for my brother.

653
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,910
What happened?

654
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,230
When I went to pick him up today,

655
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,990
his teacher told me he didn't even show up at school.

656
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,870
He's not at home either.

657
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,470
Skipping school on the first day?

658
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,450
Impressive.

659
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,110
Where could he be if he's not at home?

660
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,890
Wherever he wants.

661
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,560
It'd be better if he died and never came back.

662
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,010
At his age, if he ran into child traffickers…

663
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,040
That can't be.

664
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,120
Don't you remember?

665
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,070
My grandma spent a lot of money to get that kid.

666
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,810
Your brother could be sold for even more.

667
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,480
Don't…

668
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,460
Don't scare her.

669
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,650
It's okay.

670
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,230
He's been missing for less than 72 hours.

671
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,170
We can find him.

672
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Report to the police first. Let's go.

673
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,830
Let's go.

674
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Don't worry too much. We'll find him.

675
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,600
There are cameras everywhere now.

676
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,000
It's okay, Siyi.

677
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,630
Even if he was kidnapped by human traffickers,

678
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,630
we could still find him.

679
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,610
What if he was in a car accident?

680
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,910
You might as well say he was attacked by wolves.

681
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,510
I'll sew your mouth shut sooner or later.

682
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,710
Siyi,

683
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,150
are you hungry?

684
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,470
Do you want something to eat?

685
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,130
Here he comes.

686
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,740
Here. Take a look at the photo.

687
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,600
Is this your brother?

688
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,550
Yes, that's him.

689
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,060
According to the surveillance footage,

690
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,850
he left school early in the morning.

691
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,280
He went to the long-distance bus station

692
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,000
and got on a bus with the license plate ending in 8732.

693
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,720
The destination is Suqian.

694
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,370
Suqian?

695
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,700
He went home.

696
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,650
It's my mother's home.

697
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,070
Officer,

698
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,030
how long until we reach Suqian?

699
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,010
It'll probably take about another half hour.

700
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,750
Can we go faster?

701
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,000
There's a speed limit on the national highway.

702
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,320
Even a police car can't exceed the speed limit?

703
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,870
Can't you shut up?

and going back to Mom too,

738
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,180
but I only dared to think about it.

739
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,800

My dad dares to do anything.

743
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,900
Is that why he ended up in jail?

I always wondered

747
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,670
why she abandoned her daughter

after having a son.

749
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,620
But then

750
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,840
she abandoned you too.

751
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,510

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,750
was send me to live with Grandma.

762
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,460
What do you mean?

763
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,470
That yard

764
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,030
is warm.

765
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,240
I didn't feel warm there.

766
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,480
I mean warm inside.

767
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,230
You'll understand after living there for a while.

768
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,350
No matter

769
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,850
how bitter or upset you feel,

770
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,260
there will be people by your side,

771
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,250
loving you

772
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,280

773
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,770

774

775
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,900
they'll do everything to cheer you up,

776
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,610
staying up late at night to keep you company.

777
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,190
Even if you had an iceberg in your heart,

778
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,920
they could make it melt away.

779
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,950
They're your friends,

780
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,550
not mine.

781
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,290
You have friends like them,

782
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,270

783
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,110

784
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,360
But the condition is,

785
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,940
you have to treat me as your sister.

786
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,680
You don't just call me your sister;

787
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,690
you accept me as one.

788
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,100
Can you do that?

789
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,830
If you can,

790
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,870
I'll treat you as my brother too.

791
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,250
A real one.

792
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,960
I am your real brother.

793
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,650
So you know that, huh?

794
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,429
It hurts.

795
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,190
I pinched you too hard?

796
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,560
I promise

797
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,020
I'll never hit you again.

798
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,780

799
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,340

800
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,440
Pinky swear. We'll never, ever break this promise.

801
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,090
Can we go home now?

802
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,690
Let's go.

803
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,810
You went easy on him today.

804
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,200
If he were my brother,

805
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,090
I'd have beaten him so hard that he couldn't get out of bed.

806
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,670
He's also your brother now.

807
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,570
Fine.

808
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,670
If you don't behave, I'll beat you to a pulp.

809
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,580
Be gentle. He's sleeping.

810
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,750
Grandma, you're still up?

811
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,030
Yeah. You found him?

812
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,510
What happened? He fell asleep?

813
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,800
Where did he go?

814
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
He went to find his mom.

815
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,270
That was a long journey.

816
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,820
Here, put him here.

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,710
If you teach him to fake injuries at such a young age,

949
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,790
how can he grow up to be a good man?

950
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,500
This trick works well.

951
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,480
I used it against Liang before.

952
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,270
You have no idea.

953
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,260
The boy called Liang

954
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,970
nearly got beaten into a cripple by his dad that day.

955
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,150
Are we clear?

956
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,040
If someone pushes you,

957
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,660
you roll your eyes first.

958
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,420
How do I do that?

959
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,910
Why don't you show me?

960
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,170
Do it!

961
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,970
Do it, do it, do it!

962
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,590
Do it, do it, do it!

963
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,710
Be quiet.

964
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,130
You're the new kid,

965
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,870
aren't you?

966
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,750
Are you okay?

967
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,230
Are you okay?

968
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,660
Are you alright?

969
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,970
Are you okay?

970
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,500
Here we are.

971
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,830
Good morning.

972
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,970
Good morning, miss. Good morning, sir.

973
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,810
Hey.

974
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,840
Siyi, I'm leaving.

975
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,550
Okay.

976
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,350
Roll your eyes and twitch,

977
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,260
remember?

978
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,350
Stop. He's just a kid.

979
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,430
What if he really tries to scam someone in the future?

980
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,390
Brother-in-law.

981
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,470
Be nice to my sister,

982
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,090
or I'll beat you up.

983
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,110
Who are you calling your brother-in-law?

984
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,970
He's crazy.

985
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,200
I'll have to give him a beating again tonight.

986
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,620
Why do you think

987
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,860
Siwei

988
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,950
called Wanghe his brother-in-law?

989
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,430
What's wrong?

990
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,090
Are you jealous?

991
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,140
Why would I be jealous?

992
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,070
I just think it was funny.

993
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,810
Don't worry.

994
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,290
Xie Wanghe and Ma Siyi

995
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
can't be together.

996
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,870
Why?

997
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:30,980
Wanghe said that

998
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,270
for a man to have a successful career,

999
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,010
he needs a helpful wife first.

1000
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,230
Given Ma Siyi's situation,

1001
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,710
it'd be good enough if she didn't hold him back.

1002
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,510
You can't say that.

1003
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,270
Why would Siyi hold him back?

1004
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,520
We're all friends.

1005
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,650
Don't make it sound like I'm speaking ill of her behind her back.

1006
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,670
You don't have a chance either.

1007
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,640
Why not?

1008
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,020
You're too silly.

1009
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,420
Shao Xingchi!
