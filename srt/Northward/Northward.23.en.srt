She's soft-hearted.

188
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,690
She likes to take on everything.

189
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,790
She spoils all her subordinates.

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Everyone says she's nice.

191
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,470
She bears all the pressure alone.

192
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,780
This can't go on forever.

193
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,760
If she wants to bear it, let her.

194
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,910
When she can't handle it anymore,

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,950
she'll naturally let it go.

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,950
When that time comes, we'll help her

197
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,070
with whatever she needs.

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,110
We'll make sure she doesn't suffer or go poor.

199
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,730
But she's feeling wronged right now.

200
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,070
That's her own doing.

201
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
When I went to Bee,

202
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,820
I wanted her to come with me.

203
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,700
The salary would have been much higher than now.

204
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,510
With me there,

205
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,180
I could have taken care of her if anything happened.

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,490
She absolutely refused to do it.

207
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,150
Why?

208
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,820
Because she couldn't let go of those employees.

209
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,210
And what happened?

210
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,820
Other companies offered 300 yuan more per month,

211
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,390
and those people left without a second thought.

212
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,420
Fenghua got wasted

213
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
and came to my doorstep at night, sobbing,

214
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,670
asking me how much she was worth.

215
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,330
Why was 300 yuan was enough to betray her?

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,610
What could I have said?

217
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
It was her own fault?

We were all worried about you before.

Xie Wanghe begged me.

259
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,890
I had to give him some respect, at least.

260

I begged you too.

But you didn't give me respect.

Wanghe is indeed having a tough time now.

He's under a lot of pressure.

Now, everyone in the company

265
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
is waiting for him to fail.

266
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,900
I went over with Haikuo

267
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,270
to help him.

268
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,360

for the sake of performance.

290
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,640
When he was doing ground promotions with Haikuo before,

291
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,980
he dared to climb over the wall into a school in broad daylight.

292
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,900
He almost fell to his death when the security guards chased him.

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,720
and drink this at the celebration party.

558
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,510
Alright.

559
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,430
Let me formally introduce you all.

560
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,150
Zhou Haikuo.

561
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,370
Shao Xingchi.

562
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,070
Hello.

563
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,620
Mr. Meng.

564
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,340
Hello.

565
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,800
Hello.

566
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,060
The three of us grew up together since we were babies

567
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,820
in the same courtyard.

568
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
Then I must toast to you all.

569
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,200
One hero needs three helpers, right?

570
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,870
Come.

571
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,610
Resigning is not a small matter.

572
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,480
Have you really thought it through?

573
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,820
Although Bee is on a roll,

574
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,000
the food delivery industry is so competitive.

575
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,700
I think it's hard to say if they can even survive.

576
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,690
But I'm happy doing it.

577
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,670
How should I put it?

578
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,870
It feels like

579
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,150
as soon as I open my eyes every day, I really want to work.

580
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,970
I just want to keep charging forward.

581
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,890
And working under Wanghe,

582
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,060
I feel like there's something to look forward to.

583
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,450
Wanghe really has charisma.

584
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,690
You all just do whatever he says.

585
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,950
What, are you jealous?

586
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,610
I just think he's really good at sweet-talking people.

587
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,390
It's like he's on a constant adrenaline rush.

588
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,160
People like him should do sales.

589
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,820
You know what?

590
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,870
if he did sales, he'd definitely get rich.

591
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,560
When we were in high school,

592
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,870
he even had our homeroom teacher and the principal

593
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,670
under his thumb.

594
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,130
He set up a test prep center and caused chaos.

595
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,920
He had endless energy back then.

596
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,980
Childhood friendships are precious,

597
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,390
but after growing up, you still have to rely on yourself.

598
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,610
Then I'll just refuse to grow up.

599
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,570
Friends walk together for life.

600
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,540
Those days won't come again.

601
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,610
One promise for a lifetime.

602
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,590
One lifetime of friendship.

603
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,780
One cup of liquor.

604
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,090
Let's drink.

605
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,500
Cheers!

606
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,710
Come on, come on.

607
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,540
[A lifetime of friends, you'll understand]

608
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,340
[You'll get hurt and feel pain]

609
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,550
[You still have to go, you'll still have me]

610
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,440
Fenghua,

611
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,740
after they arrived,

612
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,710
things have been smooth for us.

613
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,660
We're going to take over

614
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,280
Haidian District soon.

615
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,650
If you want to join now, it's not too late.

616
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,950
Is this why you called me here?

617
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,260
Celebrating our success is priority.

618
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
Poaching you is second.

619
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,130
I know

620
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,540
you can't let go of your employees.

621
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,540
Fenghua, if you're willing to come,

622
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,450
I'll take all your employees.

623
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,490
To do what?

624
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,030
To do food delivery.

625
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,140
What else?

626
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,800
I trust the people you've trained.

627
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,460
I'm telling you,

628
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,380
the income from food delivery

629
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,110
will definitely be much higher than express delivery.

630
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,120
It's a win-win.

631
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,310
What if I refuse?

632
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,760
Why would you refuse?

633
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,310
I'm not interested. Is that okay?

634
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,190
Why aren't you interested?

635
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,880
Alright, alright.

636
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,490
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

637
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,650
If you really don't want to come, I can't force you.

638
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,000
But you should at least tell me your actual situation.

639
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,920
Why?

640
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,100
I came here today for entertainment,

641
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,850
but you insist on talking business.

642
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,050
Okay, let's not talk about it.

643
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,930
Let's sing and drink.

644
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,100
What are you doing?

645
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,090
Are you stealing oil?

646
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,480
Stop!

647
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,230
How dare you steal oil?

648
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,060
Stop!

649
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,500
Stop!

650
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,740
How dare you steal oil?

651
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,180
You dare to steal oil?

652
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
Boss!

653
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,750
You dare to steal oil!

654
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,390
Go, go, go!

655
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,060
Little rascals!

656
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,060
Stealing oil?

657
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,800
Boss, what's wrong?

658
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,800
I was too careless.

659
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,890
Help!

660
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,750
Help!

661
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,770
Help!

662
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,520
Someone, help!

663
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,610
Mom?

664
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,570
Is he okay?

665
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,110
Okay, okay, I got it.

666
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,950
I'll be right there.

667
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,100
What happened?

668
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,940
My dad was stabbed while driving long-distance.

669
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,290
He's in emergency care at Tianjin Hospital now.

670
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
I need to get there quickly.

671
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,340
You've been drinking. How can you drive?

672
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,090
Substitute driver.

673
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,950
What?

674
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,170
Give me the car key.

675
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,050
You can't go.

676
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,700
You and Haikuo need to stay here.

677
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,850
It's a critical moment now.

678
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,150
We need to watch out for Qiu Lin and Mr. Song.

679
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,370
They might cause trouble.

680
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,030
Where are you going?

681
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,140
I have an emergency.

682
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm sorry.

683
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,030
Let's meet again next time.

684
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,300
You two, be safe.

685
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,370
Drive carefully!

686
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,910
My dad, I swear,

687
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,660
he still gets so worked up over nothing at his age.

688
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,770
I can't stand him.

689
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,370
When you see him, watch your language, okay?

690
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,900
Don't start arguing again.

691
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,090
If he's the one causing trouble, can't I say something?

692
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,880
When people get old,

693
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,990
they're like children again.

694
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,300
They get agitated when you scold them.

695
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,810
Why isn't Grandpa Zhou like that?

696
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,040
He's always so gentle and mild-mannered.

697
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,540
Your dad has a good temper too.

698
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,390
I've never seen him talk back.

699
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,130
My dad does talk back.

700
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,580
He just mutters it so others can't hear it.

701
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,440
I think

702
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,680
I should take this opportunity

703
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,340
to get them both to stop working

704
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,320
and retire soon.

705
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,300
Why should they retire?

706
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm capable of supporting them now.

707
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,390
They'll be happy that you're making money,

708
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,430
but their generation really can't stand being idle.

709
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,340
It's even more impossible for them to be comfortable spending their children's money.

710
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,260
Why?

711
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Their joy comes from showing off.

712
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,180
The more successful their children are, the happier they are.

713
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
A couple of years ago,

714
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,690
my mom used to complain to me.

715
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,270
She said,

716
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,910
"When will I be able to enjoy the fruits of your success?"

717
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,320
Later, when I made some money and bought her jewelry,

718
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,670
she yelled my ear off.

719
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,470
She said, "You should've saved this money for your dowry.

720
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,050
Your father and I are still young.

721
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,440
You don't need to worry about us."

722
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,770
How old are they?

723
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,840
Still young, huh?

724
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,510
It's precisely because they've reached this age that they can't admit to being old.

725
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,220
Otherwise, they'd really be old.

726
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,620
Let's go a bit faster.

727
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,139
Mom.

728
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,810
Mom.

729
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,530
Aunt Liang.

730
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,940
You two came together?

731
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,940
Well, I had some drinks,

732
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,820
so I couldn't drive.

733
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,870
How's my dad?

734
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,270
Don't worry, the doctor said he's fine now.

735
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,719
He got a dozen stitches on his stomach.

736
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,989
What happened?

737
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,810
Someone was stealing oil.

738
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,120
Your dad acted like the Good Samaritan

739
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,880
and pushed the thieves too far.

740
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,219
It's okay now.

741
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,690

At your age, you should be looking for a man.

Pressuring for marriage is a traditional New Year activity.

Fenghua refuses.

You're the one who's sick.

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,920

He was reckless.

849
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,340
Can't I say that?

850
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,710
That's just how your dad is.

851
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,020
He loves to meddle and stand up for others.

852
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,150
He doesn't think he's wrong,

853
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,430
but you insist on him admitting his mistake.

854
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,710
Isn't that just asking for a fight?

855
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,960
If he would listen, that'd be fine.

856
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,390
The problem is that he can't change.

857
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,260
Even if he can't change, he has to.

858
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,200
Fine.

859
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,070
Go ahead inside.

You two have a fight.

861
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,640
Beat him into submission, then force him to admit he's wrong.

862
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,950
Is this how you're supposed to give advice?

863
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,970
Eat.

I'm full from anger.

867
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,210
Don't provoke me.

868
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,550
Why didn't you bring me a bottle of water?

869
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,360

Where's Mr. Xie?

00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,910
He had something to attend to.

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,520
He went to Tianjin.

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Why?

877
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,130
We're in the middle of a fierce battle with Yuntu right now

878
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,230
and he took time off?

879
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,980
Does he not have any sense of organizational discipline?

880
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,090
His father was hospitalized.

881
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,390
So what if his father was hospitalized?

882
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,950
Even if his father were dying right now,

883
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,860
he couldn't just leave without saying a word.

884
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,330
Just let us know if there's anything that needs to be done.

885
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,620
We'll handle it.

886
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,310
These past few days,

887
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,700
our market share has indeed increased,

888
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,370
but the number of orders has decreased.

889
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,510
That's impossible.

890
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,460
So what if you had successful street canvassing?

891
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,440
So what

892
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,540
if you signed agreements

893
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,910
with all the merchants?

894
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,560
The merchants aren't placing orders now.

895
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,660
What can you two do about it?

896
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,390
Why aren't they placing orders?

897
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,330
Yuntu has increased their subsidies.

898
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,670
They're subsidizing an average of three yuan per order.

899
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,090
They're crazy.

900
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,000
How long can they keep burning money like this?

901
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,220
That's why I've been telling you all along

902
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,460
to quickly apply to headquarters

903
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,890
for us to increase our subsidies as well.

904
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,480
Mr. Xie won't agree to that.

905
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,190
For him to disagree,

906
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,470
he has to be here, right?

907
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,190
We can't just stand by and watch

908
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,070
as Yuntu takes our territories one by one,

909
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,700
without even the strength to fight back.

910
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,990
Isn't that embarrassing?

911
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,670
What will the entire industry think of us?

912
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,740
Alright.

913
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,440
How about this?

914
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,270
Let's put the subsidy issue

915
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,540
on hold for now.

916
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,160
Let's do what we can.

917
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,220
Continue to optimize the delivery process,

918
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,040
and further reduce the delivery time.

919
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,000
Further reduce it?

920
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,550
We're already at the limit.

921
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,630
Leave it to us.

922
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,020
We'll figure something out.

923
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,880
We'll give our all for the company.

924
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,440
