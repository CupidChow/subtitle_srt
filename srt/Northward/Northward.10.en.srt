[Episode 10]

3
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,590
All right.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,150
Hey,

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,220
you don't look bad with makeup on.

6
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,460
Here you go, for the two of you.

7
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,210
Let's eat something first.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Then, we'll find an internet cafe

9
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
and stay up until dawn.

10
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,740
We'll take the first bus tomorrow morning

11
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,750
to go back to Flower Street.

12
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,340
Here.

13
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,960
How did you know I would be in trouble?

14
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,250
When your mom asked me to look at the contract last time,

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,810
I felt a bit uneasy.

16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,430
So I asked Haikuo

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,340
to investigate this studio.

18
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,890
They have a website. From there,

19
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,350
we found an email address from their contact.

[System Management Log-in]

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,620
With that, we found out

22
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,310
that this email

23
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,430
was also registered to an online photo album.

24
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,670
Zhou Haikuo hacked into this online album.

25
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,930
When we looked at it,

26
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,250
we got so furious.

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,290
This is definitely a gang of perverts.

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,270
Let's call the police.

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,180
The extent of this isn't illegal yet.

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,350
Calling the police won't help.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,530
They can't file a case.

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
If Fenghua takes these kinds of photos,

33
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,960
the school will definitely expel her.

34
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,710
If she doesn't take them, they'll say she breached the contract

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,750
and make her pay a penalty.

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,910
These bastards are really despicable.

37
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,360
Then I rushed to your house,

38
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,350
but your mom said you had already gone downtown.

39
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,360
So I hurried over here in a panic.

40
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,260
Fortunately, I arrived in time,

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,860
Fenghua.

42
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,770
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

43
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,610
How did you know I was in this hotel?

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,079
You even knew the room number.

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,870
Haikuo and Xingchi went to the police station

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,280
saying you were missing.

47
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,540
They gave them your ID number.

48
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,900
The police looked it up.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,079
That old police officer who arrested you last time?

50
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,590
Yes.

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,440
We're lucky to have him this time.

52
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,750
Otherwise, you'd have been done for.

53
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,579
Where are those two?

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,680
Why didn't they come?

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,490
We've already agreed.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,270
They're waiting at the police station entrance.

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,630
If anything happens here,

58
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,430
I'll call them

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,350
and they'll alert the police.

60
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,930
They'll come over with the police.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,750
Come on,

62
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,560
let's celebrate your narrow escape.

63
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,240
I thought my luck would finally turn around this time.

64
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,310
Who knew...

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,510
It's a blessing nothing bad happened.

66
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,740
You should be grateful.

67
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,459
Can you stop getting involved in these things from now on?

68
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,630
Even if pies were falling from the sky,

69
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,720
you wouldn't be the one to catch them.

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,350
Hey, I saved you!

71
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,710
Was that all for nothing?

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,310
I didn't ask you to come save me.

73
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,210
Who told you to meddle in my affairs?

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,220
Fine.

75
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,680
Fenghua,

76
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,700
this is the last time I'm helping you.

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,020
From now on, even if you're in deep trouble,

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,790
I won't care.

79
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,790
I'll just stand by and watch.

80
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,700
I'll make you so angry.

81
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,530
Make you so angry.

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,160

Let's forget about the cab fare.

86
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,270
I still have to pay for the meal. Seriously?

87
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,730
I'll pay for the internet cafe. How's that.

88
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,680
Drinks too.

89
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,790
I want iced tea.

90
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,550

It's "what would you do without me?"

94

All right, stop singing.

95

It's best to do so.

109
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,970
Otherwise, they might cause trouble.

110
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,360
Why would they? After how that guy treated me...

111
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,470
I'll report him to the police and have him arrested.

112
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,090
The problem is it's hard to gather evidence.

113
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,070
Didn't you find the photo album?

114
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,190
Hand it over to the police.

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
Those are just photos of people in underwear.

116
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
It's all over the internet.

117
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,800
It's not like they're nudes.

118
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,070
But he forced me to drink with people.

119
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,060
But it didn't happen, right?

120
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,570
Even if you report it, there's no evidence.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,200
The key is, I'm worried if this gets blown out of proportion,

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,610
it could damage your reputation.

123
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,010

125
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,860
Fenghua,

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,150
money can be earned again,

127
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,860
but I don't want you

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,660
to be in any more trouble in the future.

129
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,600
I can't just let this go.

130
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,610
If you don't return the money, he'll come after you.

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Let him come.

132
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,180
If he dares to come, I'll fight him to the death.

133
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,230
How about this?

134
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,270
If he comes, you tell him

135
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,840
to apologize to me sincerely.

136
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,740
Otherwise, he doesn't get his money.

137

All right.

If he really dares to come,

140
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,070
it won't be your fight.

141
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,220
That's my business.

We're almost home.

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,870
You should head back.

I'm going to start a business.

150
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,860
Go back and tell my parents

151

not to worry.

152
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,770
This time, I'm sure I'll succeed.

153
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,030
How long will you be gone?

154
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,500
It's hard to say.

155
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,260
I'll come back when I succeed.

Do your parents know about this?

158
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm acting first and reporting later.

159
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,260
They wouldn't agree to me going.

Here you go.

167
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,310
Be careful.

168
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,070
Okay, we are departing.

176
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,170
What...

177
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,230
What did he go to Beijing for?

178
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,010
To start a business.

179
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,240

It's used.

373
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,950
About a year old.

374
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,420
But the performance is fine.

375
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,550
Hurry up, hurry up.

376
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,270
Hello, teacher.

377
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,030
What did Xie Wanghe go to Beijing for?

378
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,260
What's he up to?

379
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,150
Are you performing a choir performance?

380
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,380
You won't tell me, huh?

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,850
None of you will say anything, right?

382
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,630
Fine then.

383
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,590
This matter has now become serious.

384
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,540
Expulsion from school is not out of the question.

385
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,710
I'm going to the principal right now.

386
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,150
Don't, don't!

387
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,030
Mr. Xu!

388
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,910
He went to...

389
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,960
rent a server.

390
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,260
What did you say?

391
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,520
Wanghe wants to set up an online–

392
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,250
Teacher,

393
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,910
Wanghe will only be gone for a few days.

394
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,190
He'll be back soon.

395
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,070
Don't worry.

396
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,060
It's a good thing he's not doing anything bad this time.

397
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,450
If this project really succeeds,

398
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,550
not just our school,

399
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,230
the whole Honghuai area could benefit from it.

400
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,010
You're just blowing hot air.

401
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,430
Don't I know him well enough?

402
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,210
He's always got big ideas but no skills to back them up.

403
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,510
He's got plenty of ideas,

404
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,870
but what can he actually do well?

405
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,670
If he becomes the CEO

406
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,770
of that website,

407
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,010
he'd run it into the ground in less than six months.

408
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,090
You,

409
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,610
go to Xie Wanghe's house tonight.

410
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,850
Have his parents write an excuse note.

411
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,980
The reason

412
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,050
absolutely cannot be "starting a business."

413
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,540
Otherwise, I won't be able to cover for him.

414
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,630
All right,

415
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,290
we'll get it done tonight

416
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,150
and submit it first thing in the morning.

417
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,210
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

418
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,150
Thank you, teacher.

419
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,830
Okay, okay, hurry back now.

420
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,470
Quick, quick, quick.

421
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,940
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

422
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,950
Keep your mouth shut.

423
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,690
Let's think about the reason for taking leave.

424
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,780
His grandmother is critically ill.

425
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,430
He's accompanying him.

426
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,450
Didn't his grandmother already pass away?

427
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,950
The school doesn't know that.

428
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,650
This won't work.

429
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,140
It'll be more troublesome if someone reports him later.

430
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,350
Let's think again.

431
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,670
Think of a reason that the school can accept.

432
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,110
I've got one.

433
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,520
Let's say Xie Wanghe has a brain tumor.

434
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,630
He needs to go to Beijing for surgery.

435
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,420
You're the one with a brain tumor! Your whole family has brain tumors!

436
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,510
I was just kidding.

437
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm warning you.

438
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,470
We're talking about serious matters here. Don't be an idiot.

439
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,510
I just don't understand. With Xie Wanghe's brain,

440
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,380
he can't even figure out basic arithmetic.

441
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,030
Who gave him the confidence to start a business?

442
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,150
Even your dad can start a business with his brain.

443
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,720
What did you say?

444
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,980
Say that again!

445
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,120
Ouch, ouch!

446
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,940
Fenghua, let go. Let go, let go.

447
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,780
It hurts.

448
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,320
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

449
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,290
Wanghe went to take care of important business.

450
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,610
If he succeeds,

451
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,370
everyone will benefit.

452
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,620
He'll explain the details when he returns.

453
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,730
But before that,

454
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,920
if anyone dares to snitch behind our backs,

455
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,370
and I find out about it,

456
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,990
they'll face the consequences.

457
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,020
If you have issues with Wanghe,

458
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,070
confront him face to face.

459
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,450
Don't gossip behind his back.

460
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,500
It's not manly.

461
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,660
You're right.

462
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,320
I'm indeed not manly enough.

463
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,170
The manliest one must be your Wanghe.

464
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,070
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

465
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,490
Who poured ink on my shoes?

466
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,940
My new shoes!

467
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,510
Was it you?

468
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,180
Fenghua!

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,180
I was talking about him, not you.

470
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,170
My... My dad bought me new shoes.

471
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,870
Fenghua, let me tell you,

472
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,840
this thing today, between us two...

473
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,470
It's still our Fenghua who's the best.

474
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,360
Fenghua is awesome!

475
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,690
Everyone, be quiet. It's self-study time.

476
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,940
[Striving unceasingly with unwavering resolve]

477
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,350
Even if you aren't studying, there are people who are.

478
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,880
What are you doing?

479
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,350
Get back to studying, come on!

480
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,550
I've thought of a reason.

481
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,280
For an exhibition?

482
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,530
What exhibition?

483
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,690
Canal culture.

484
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,600
I saw it online.

485
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,560
For the World Heritage application,

486
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,150
the province has an exhibition in Beijing

487
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,190
for these few days.

488
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,240
But he can't just skip school to go for it.

489
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,950
It doesn't make sense.

490
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,310
It's fine.

491
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,850
I'll ask Haikuo to write an essay later.

492
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,720
Then I'll have Grandpa Zhou help revise it.

493
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,520
We're all from By the Canal.

494
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,090
This school

495
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,150
is very supportive of historical

496
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,350
and cultural activities.

497
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,510
Is this appropriate?

498
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,950
The teacher didn't want to give him a hard time.

499
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,750
Otherwise, he could have been expelled.

500
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,480
All right then.

501
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,770
So for this matter,

502
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,350
keep a close eye on it, will you?

503
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,940
It's driving me crazy.

504
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,930
Just wait until he comes back.

505
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,040
I'll teach him a lesson when he returns.

506
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,220
Why do you need to punish him?

507
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,250
He skipped school.

508
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,380
Is this what a student should do?

509
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,080
Ms. Liang.

510
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,130
You mustn't think that way.

511
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,470
Wanghe went to Beijing for something important.

512
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,900
We should all support him.

513
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,020
He can only fool you.

514
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,750
You're the only one who believes him.

515
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,990
Silly girl, you need to wise up.

516
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,220
Don't end up being sold by him

517
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,720
yet you have to count the money for him.

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Bastard!

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,600
[Breakfast]

520
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,600
Let me...

521
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,310
-Let me do it.
-Move it...

522
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,120
One, two, three.

523
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,840
You two are here so early.

524
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,750
Good morning.

525
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,240
Take it easy.

526
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,350
How's your back?

527
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,550
Be careful.

528
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,470
It's fine, it's fine.

529
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,270
Come this way.

530
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,350
I'm not that delicate.

531
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,020
But I still don't dare

532
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,280
to lift heavy things.

533
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,950
You

534
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,780
shouldn't all the heavy work yourself.

535
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,140
Let your Xingchi do it.

536
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,990
What's the point of raising such a big son?

537
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,940
Let him do it.

538
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,410
Him?

539
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,380
If he could just take care of himself,

[Breakfast]

541
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,920
I'd wake up from laughing.

542
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,870
Still better than ours.

543
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,650
At least you don't have to worry about his studies.

544
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,100
Ours isn't any better.

545
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,940
It's only because Shao keeps a close eye on him.

546
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,450
Shao said this time,

547
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,740
if he doesn't do well in the exam,

548
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,260
he'll disown him.

549
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,390
I've made threats too,

550
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,400

Did she oversleep?

557
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:37,020
[Clock Fixing]

558
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,800
Ma'am, two youtiao please.

559
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,690
All right!

560
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,310
Do you understand this?

561
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,940
First, calculate this angle.

562
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,600
Then plug it in.

563
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,660
That's it.

564
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,890
How's the studying going?

565
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,070
Mom.

566
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,180
Ms. Gu.

567
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,860
Why so formal?

568
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,800
Call me auntie.

569
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,470
Sit down.

570
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,620
Stop studying and eat.

571
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,590
It's getting cold.

572
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,190
I've hired a tutor for Chen Rui.

573
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,640
He's a first-class teacher in our city.

574
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,060
But he's already retired.

575
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,370
On Saturdays,

576
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,010
he'll come to our house to tutor Chen Rui.

577
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,260
If you're free this weekend,

578
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
come for extra classes too.

579
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,530
No need. My grades are okay.

580
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,940
I don't need a tutor for now.

581
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,620
You've helped Chen Rui so much.

582
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,960
I feel I should help you too.

583
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,140
Besides, your grades are so good.

584
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,170
If you push a little harder,

585
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,000
you'll definitely get into a good university.

586
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,930
In this era,

587
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,350
the best way to change your fate

588
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,380
is through the college entrance exam.

589
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,420
I'm not hungry, thank you.

590
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,110
Just agree.

591
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,860
Otherwise, she'll keep pestering you.

592
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,490
Okay.

593
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll come every weekend from now on.

594
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,500
Thank you.

595
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,490
Don't be so polite.

596
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,040
If you're not eating, at least have an apple.

597
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,730
Thank you.

598
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,870
Granny Ma!

599
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,040
Granny Ma!

600
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,450
Ma–

601
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,500
G-Granny Ma!

602
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,810
Granny Ma!

603
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,080
Granny Ma, what's wrong?

604
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,910
Let me help you up.

605
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,230
Don't touch me yet.

606
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,210
I just felt dizzy for a moment.

607
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,270
Give me a minute to recover.

608
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,280
Then let me help you up first.

609
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,710
Yanzi!

610
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,490
Yuling!

611
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,310
Hurry, hurry!

612
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,500
Granny Ma is sick!

613
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,060
Hurry, hurry!

614
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,620
Granny Ma?

615
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,360
Come quickly!

616
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,630
You're not doing business anymore?

617
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,000
Take the things yourself!

618
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,410
Granny Ma! We're here.

619
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,280
We're taking you to the hospital.

620
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,030
Yanzi!

621
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,600
Get the stretcher ready. Bring it quickly!

622
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,250
Yes, yes, yes. The stretcher, the stretcher.

623
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,030
The stretcher is here.

624
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,660
What if the three of us can't lift her?

625
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,670
I'll go find Mr. Zhou for help.

626
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,630
Okay.

627
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,830
Get everything ready for the hospital!

628
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,630
All right! All right!

629
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,350
The stretcher is here.

630
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,700
I'm going to find Mr. Zhou.

631
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,910
You watch her.

632
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,140
I'll go pack the things.

633
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,790
Mr. Zhou!

634
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,320
Mr. ZHou!

635
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,050
What?

636
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,900
Siyi...

637
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,120
Siyi!

638
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,760
Don't worry, we're here for you.

639
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,680
Look, they're here, they're here.

640
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Come on, come on.

641
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,950
Turn that stretcher around.

642
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,350
Turn it this way. Come on, come on.

643
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,230
One, two, go.

644
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,350
Exert some strength.

645
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,390
Slow down, slow down.

646
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,830
Here.

647
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,030
Put your hands down, put your hands down.

648
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,990
Give me a hand.

649
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,430
Come on, come on.

650
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,140
One.

651
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,270
Careful.

652
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,870
All right.

653
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,600
Three!

654
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,270
Let's go.

655
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,630
Yuling.

656
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,510
Go get the things.

657
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,040
Okay!

658
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,590
Hurry.

659
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,390
Watch out for the steps.

660
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:00,950
Slow down, be careful.

661
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,540
Slow down, slow down.

662
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,190
Be careful.

663
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,270
Slow down, slow down.

664
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,540
Yuling, take over for me for a moment.

665
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,390
Okay.

666
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,610
What's wrong?

667
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,670
You guys go ahead.

668
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,180
Where are you going?

669
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,200
I'll be right there. I'm just grabbing some things.

670
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,910
All right, let's go, let's go.

671
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,670
Go ahead, go ahead.

672
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,270
Siyi.

673
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,010
What are you doing here?

674
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,310
Grandma.

675
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,880
Grandma, what's wrong? Grandma.

676
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,720
Siyi, I'm... I'm fine.

677
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm not dead yet.

678
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,740
It's nothing.

679
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,920
Why is my grandma suddenly hospitalized?

680
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,620
What's the illness?

681
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,120
It's a cerebral thrombosis.

682
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
But the treatment was timely.

683
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,600
The doctor said she should recover with proper care.

684
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,610
Oh, child.

685
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,730
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

686
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,720
That's enough.

687
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,340
You see, normally you seem so...

688
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,720
strong.

689
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,760
Why do you panic when something happens?

690
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,030
Don't panic.

691
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,770
Granny Ma's illness...

692
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,540
Fortunately

693
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,630
the rescue was timely this time.

694
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,230
Moreover,

695
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,400
recovery will also take some time.

696
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,400
So I think

697
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,560
she can't be left alone.

698
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,890
That's not a problem.

699
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,470
Our neighborhood has nothing

700
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,270
but plenty of people.

701
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,050
Exactly.

702
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's discuss and arrange a schedule later.

703
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,040
Our families can take turns.

704
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,950
Don't worry.

705
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,030
You should hurry back to your busy store.

706
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,980
Go quickly.

707
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,110
We're here.

708
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,910
Rest assured, rest assured.

709
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,950
Go, go, go.

710
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,620
Hurry up.

711
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,430
Let Siyi stay at your place tonight.

712
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,270
With Fenghua there,

713
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,740
she'll feel more at ease.

714
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,990
They'll have each other for company.

715
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,950
I just need to remind Fenghua.

716
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,930
She tends to speak without thinking.

717
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,360
I've already paid the hospital fees,

718
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,330
but I'm not sure how much it will cost this time.

719
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,390
Granny Ma.

720
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,570
be able to afford it?

721
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,040
Definitely not.

722
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,210
We will

723
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,010
help cover the costs for now.

724
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,980
We can consider it as prepaid rent.

725
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,390
All right.

726
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:50,670
Granny.

727
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,550
Then it's settled.

728
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,930
What would you like to eat?

729
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,020
I'll make it for you.

730
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,880
No need,

731
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,870
Ms. Liang and Ms. Yan are here.

732
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,320
You don't have to do this.

733
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,950
I'm already 17 years old.

734
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,730
Stop treating me like a child.

735
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,300
In ancient times, I could have been married with children by now.

736
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,590
That's true.

737
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,430
When I gave birth to your father,

738
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,940
I was 18.

739
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,950
When your mother had you,

740
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,570
she was 20.

741
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,900
You know, when you were just born,

742
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,680
you were as small as a kitten.

743
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,100
So tiny,

744
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,260
