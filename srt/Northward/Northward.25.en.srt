1
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,509
You're sitting on my leg.

2
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,759
Still angry?

3
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,920
I wouldn't dare.

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,950
You can go ask around.

5
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,590
In all of Zhongguancun,

6
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,000
which employee dares to get angry with their boss?

7
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,030
You must be hungry.

8
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,710
I'll make you some wagyu fried rice.

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,030
Okay.

10
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,710
He's not deserving.

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
Fine.

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,750
I don't deserve it.

13
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Go ahead and cook.

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I'll eat after you're done.

15
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,160
Mr. Xie can watch from the sidelines.

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,790
We'll use Mr. Xie's wagyu, okay?

17
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,750
Use as much as you want. There's plenty.

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
There's just one piece.

19
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,800
It seems like...

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,190
you're going to vomit?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,750
Mind your own business.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,310
Look at your antics.

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,400
You must have learned this from Xiaohui.

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,750
So coquettish.

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,560
If you put on a finger cuff,

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
you'd be the spitting image of Concubine Hua.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,590
If you can’t say anything right,

28
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,710
why not donate your mouth to someone who does?

29
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,560
Bro.

30
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,720
Brother Kuo.

31
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm sorry, okay?

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,710
Should I kneel down to you?

33
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,310
Fine, go ahead.

34
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,840
Come on.

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,710
Kneel.

36
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,750
What’s wrong with you?

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,960
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,800
I know.

39
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,430
Yuntu...

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,590
has been really tough to deal with.

41
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,710
And I suspect that they have their informants

42
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
within our organization,

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,240
keeping an eye on our every move.

44
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,870
Otherwise, there’s no way they’d strike back this quickly

45
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,079
and this accurately.

46
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,360
What should we do then?

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,750
No matter what comes,

48
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,960
we'll tackle it head-on.

49
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,750
As long as the three of us brothers

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,560
stand in solidarity

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,000
and work hard enough,

52
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,710
we will never lose.

53
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,150
Yes!

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,870
It's ready.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,720
Let's eat.

56
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,270
Smells good!

57
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,750
And delicious!

58
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,110
You know, these cartoons

59
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,040
never seem to get past

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,680
the first half.

61
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,040
When will they make the second half?

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,310
Once our company goes public,

63
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,830
we'll force them to make it.

64
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,870
It must be produced.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Yes!

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,480
It has to be "Saint Seiya",

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
"Naruto" or "One Piece".

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,830
We'll make them!

69
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,360
If they're not willing,

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,360
I'll throw money at them to make it happen.

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,430
What else?

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
"Tiny Tadpoles Cause Havoc in Heaven"

73
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,040
Isn't that going a bit too far?

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,560
Well, I like it.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,920
Make it!

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,920
Make it!

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,430
Throw money at them to make it.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Make it!

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,310
♫Holding on to freedom through the storm♫

80
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Have one.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Just eat one. It won't hurt for now.

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,750
No, I won't.

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,040
Forget it if he doesn't want to.

84
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,310
Let him work in peace for now.

85
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,870
I'll eat it.

86
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,150
You can work him to death,

87
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,870
but if he does it alone,

88
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,040
it won’t make a difference.

89
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,000
Let me tell you.

90
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,750
If you're serious about improving delivery efficiency,

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
the key lies in the frontliners.

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
They're doing the actual work.

93
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,600
I want to give it a try.

94
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,920
You want to do food delivery yourself?

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
When we were kids playing games,

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
didn't we also pick the toughest one

97
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,600
and secretly watched how others played?

98
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,070
Xingchi,

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm very grateful

100
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,310
that you're willing to help me.

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,270
What about me?

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,600
Who are you?

103
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,560
What's your name?

104
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,800
Driver,

105
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,720
just drop us off here.

106
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,830
Let us out!

107
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,159
Hey buddy...

108
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm quitting! Let me out!

109
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Pull up!

110
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,990
Who is this?

111
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
He has completed 500 orders.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,510
Still two orders short of 500.

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
And this person just joined last month.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,830
Call him over.

115
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,160
He Tianming.

116
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,680
That's me.

117
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,680
Why do you look familiar?

118
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,630
Have I seen you somewhere before?

119
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,870
Where have you worked before?

120
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,240
At Fenghua's place.

121
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,600
Fenghua? Xia Fenghua?

122
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,270
Yes.

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,070
I used to deliver parcels for Fenghua.

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,310
I know all the routes.

125
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,430
But others know the routes too.

126
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,430
How did you manage to complete 500 orders?

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,870
Besides knowing the routes,

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
I also had to strategically plan the routes

129
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,070
and maintain good relationships with merchants and customers.

130
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,950
How do you maintain them?

131
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,960
With a friendly attitude

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,950
and swift actions,

133
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,720
once a good relationship has been established,

134
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,000
even new customers can become regulars.

135
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,870
That's great.

136
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,560
Have you done any management work?

137
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,310
I did some operations work for Fenghua for a while.

138
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,510
However,

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,920
parcel and food delivery are inherently different.

140
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,310
I'm still learning the ropes.

141
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,510
Li.

142
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,510
You should have the delivery riders

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,830
chat with He more often.

144
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,160
Have him share his insights with everyone.

145
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,430
It'll be useful.

146
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,310
You can go now.

147
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,190
Alright.

148
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,680
Okay.

149
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,590
Fenghua...

150
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,270
How is she doing lately?

151
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,560
Fenghua has a big heart.

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,750
She always says that managers should lead by example,

153
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,310
so she's exhausted every day.

154
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,870
Previously, she hurt her back while working.

155
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,480
It aches on cloudy and rainy days.

156
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:27,870
Alright.

157
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,510
Keep up the good work.

158
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,430
If you need anything in the future, come to me directly.

159
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,070
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

160
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,630
You can go now.

161
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,630
Back aches?

162
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,190
Just take a look.

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,430
The delivery rider who previously delivered the most orders

164
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,120
had some tips for planning routes.

165
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,310
I asked him to compile them.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
See if you can

167
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,070
use his ideas

168
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,750
to improve the application.

169
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,950
This is interesting.

170
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,430
Here,

171
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
take a look at this.

172
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,950
I had those guys who do street surveys

173
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,920
run a questionnaire.

174
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,720
This counts as first-hand user feedback.

175
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
Who created the questionnaire?

176
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,630
I did.

177
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,070
You have that skill?

178
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,320
Are you looking down on me? Do you want it or not?

179
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,950
Yes, I want it.

180
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,830
Can't you just speak nicely?

181
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,750
Alright, alright.

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,190
Hurry up.

183
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,750
Get to work.

184
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,350
Okay!

185
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,630
Liu,

186
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,750
did you find it?

187
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,790
Found it, it's here.

188
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,360
Be careful next time, okay?

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,910
Alright!

190
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,510
Fenghua, there's one more here.

191
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
Is it for Keyuan Nanli?

192
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,390
Yes.

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Pass me.

194
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,080
It's quite heavy.

195
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
Fenghua, there's a parcel for you.

196
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,270
Mine?

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,830
Who's so thoughtful?

198
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,000
Here.

199
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,910
It's for both of you.

200
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,680
I'll leave the money here for you.

201
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,390
Okay.

202
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,870
Hello?

203
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,510
Fenghua?

204
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,360
Mom?

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Did you buy me some plasters?

206
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,000
No, I didn't.

207
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,790
What plasters?

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,190
Traditional Miao medicinal plasters?

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,790
It's a big box of them for back pain.

210
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,390
No, it wasn't me.

211
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,390
You're fine,

212
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,720
so why would I send you plasters?

213
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,870
Alright then.

214
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,080
Okay.

215
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm hanging up.

216
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,870
Are you busy?

217
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,080
Yuling.

218
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,550
I'm here for a bowl of savory tofu pudding

219
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,390
and that'll be a meal.

220
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,200
Help yourself.

221
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,630
Okay.

222
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,630
Those bowls are all freshly made.

223
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,200
Alright.

224
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,480
I'll bring the bowl back to you later, okay?

225
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,750
Oh yes, Yuling.

226
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Wait a moment.

227
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,600
I just remembered I had something to tell you.

228
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,240
What is it?

229
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,790
Well... I feel that

230
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,750
Mr. Zhou has been having

231
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,840
some health issues recently.

232
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,480
What kind of issues?

233
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,600
I just was chatting with Mr. Zhou.

234
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,030
When we talked about Granny Ma,

235
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,790
he seemed to have forgotten that Granny Ma had passed away.

236
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Really?

237
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Yes, really.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
When did this happen?

239
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,390
It was only the other day

240
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,480
that Yan told me about it.

241
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Has Mr. Zhou experienced something like this before?

242
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,480
Yes, but...

243
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,510
But I've been thinking,

244
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,120
it's normal for people to forget things

245
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
as they get older, right?

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,870
It is normal.

247
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,870
But isn't it a bit strange to forget

248
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,870
something this significant?

249
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
If you ask me, Master Zhou,

250
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,840
why don't you take Grandpa Zhou to the hospital for a check-up?

251
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,510
It's great if nothing is wrong.

252
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
But if there's something wrong,

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
let's not delay any treatment.

254
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,270
What do you think?

255
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,120
You're right.

256
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,550
Be careful when digging for that bottle.

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
If you're not careful when digging,

258
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,240
it might all shatter.

259
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,510
Even if you dig it out, it might be all broken.

260
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,480
Wouldn't it?

261
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,670
-Dad. 
 -Yanlin.

262
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,110
You're back.

263
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
Chen Rui is having lunch at our restaurant today.

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,200
Okay, come on in.

265
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,200
What would you like to eat?

266
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,440
Anything is fine with me.

267
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,720
Let's have something light with

268
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,600
just two or three dishes.

269
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,080
I have to go to the cultural museum this afternoon.

270
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,440
Why don't we just let him

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,080
order for himself?

272
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
Order whatever you want.

273
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,150
Thank you, Uncle.

274
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,000
Help yourself.

275
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,630
You're going to the cultural museum this afternoon?

276
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,150
Yes.

277
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,550
Don't make any plans for tomorrow, okay?

278
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,750
What for?

279
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,550
I'll take you to the hospital for a health screening.

280
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,320
How about that?

281
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,440
Health screening?

282
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
There's nothing wrong with my health.

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,840
I know there's nothing wrong with your health.

284
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,600
But doctors advise

285
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,750
that each of us

286
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,000
should have a check-up once a year.

287
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,480
Look at you.

288
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,760
How long has it been since you had one?

289
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,360
Right?

290
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,750
This is called prevention is better than cure.

291
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,750
Besides, it's not troublesome.

292
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
It'll be done in just one morning.

293
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,240
Alright, fine.

294
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,360
You have to go too.

295
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
You should also get a check-up.

296
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:05,790
Do you know?

297
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,870
Once you hit middle age, your body doesn’t hold up as well anymore.

298
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,480
Isn't it?

299
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,270
Anything’s better than falling ill.

300
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,870
You must come.

301
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,750
Alright?

302
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,480
-Okay then. 
 -Right?

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,630
So it turns out you're accompanying me for the check-up tomorrow.

304
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,390
How much?

305
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,390
Hello, it's 40 yuan.

306
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay.

307
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,360
Here you go.

308
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay, thank you.

309
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,120
Take care.

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,390
Don't push! Don't push!

311
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,200
Line up! Line up!

312
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,030
There are tickets for everyone!

313
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,870
What options are there for this concert?

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
What price do you want?

315
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
We have options between

316
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,870
380 to 2,680 yuan.

317
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,840
Stop pushing.

318
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,080
So expensive?

319
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,480
Hey, are you buying or not?

320
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,960
If you're not buying, step aside.

321
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,910
I'm buying.

322
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,790
I'll buy.

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,550
Two tickets at 1,280 yuan each.

324
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,750
Next.

325
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Wait, I’m still here!

326
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,870
Stop! Hold on!

327
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,080
Listen,

328
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
these orders must be delivered today.

329
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
Otherwise, we'll get complaints again.

330
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Thanks for your hard work. Hurry up.

331
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,670
Alright, Fenghua.

332
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,630
Ms. Xia.

333
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,390
I've been calling you from behind. Couldn't you hear me?

334
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,000
Can't you see I'm busy?

335
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,720
What are you here for?

336
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,630
I need your help with something.

337
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,910
Mr. Xie, you're not here to personally poach employees, are you?

338
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,630
If you poach any more, we'll have to close down.

339
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,750
I wouldn't do that in person.

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
I usually do that behind your back instead.

341
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,360
What?

342
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,790
See for yourself.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,870
I thought someone didn't want to go.

344
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
I didn't see anything!

345
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,310
Nothing at all.

346
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,120
Watch your behaviour.

347
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
Looks like I'll have to scold you more often in the future.

348
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,240
I called you cold-blooded previously,

349
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,200
and you are giving me tickets now because you felt bad.

350
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,120
Next time, I'll be even harsher.

351
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Let's see what you'll give me then.

352
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,440
Chris.

353
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,670
Okay.

354
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,600
I'll treat you to a meal later.

355
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
No need to be polite.

356
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,630
You haven't changed your WeChat ID, right?

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,720
No, it's still the same.

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Alright, take it easy.

359
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:47,870
I'll be off!

360
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
-Bro. 
 -Where's Fenghua?

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,390
She went out.

362
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,360
She went out?

363
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,200
Where did she go?

364
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,000
To watch a concert.

365
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,000
She's going alone?

366
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
She went with Mr. Xie from Bee Group.

367
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,270
He came by with the tickets.

368
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,200
They just left a while ago.

369
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,960
Anything else?

370
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,920
I have some parcels to deliver.

371
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,830
Wanghe.

372
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,270
I've dreamt of this scene

373
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,070
more than once.

374
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,600
Do you really think I'll make it one day?

375
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,790
Of course!

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,510
I've always believed that

377
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,350
you can definitely create miracles.

378
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,030
So,

379
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,270
please have faith in yourself too.

380
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,160
Xie Wanghe,

381
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I cherish you.

382
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,510
If you get in,

383
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,230
I'll set up a breakfast stand at your school gate.

384
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,750
I'll tell everyone I meet that I was your first love

385
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,960
and I was abandoned by you.

386
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,400
My girlfriend wouldn't have a lisp.

387
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,270
The bride is so beautiful!

388
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,960
When I grow up, I want to have my wedding on a ship too.

389
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,390
You're talking as if you could even get married.

390
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,590
If no one wants me,

391
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,110
I'll marry Wanghe.

392
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,030
I'll pass.

393
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,030
You're a glutton.

394
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,640
My family will go bankrupt from feeding you.

395
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,830
What are you doing?

396
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,310
You're injured now,

397
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,750
so I must take care of you.

398
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,120
How is it?

399
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,030
A bit higher.

400
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,830
It's unlikely you will get into a university.

401
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,590
When I head north to start my own business,

402
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,480
you can use that money to invest in my company.

403
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,070
I'll lead you to riches.

404
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,000
In the future,

405
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,510
you'll be President Xia.

406
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,350
Okay.

407
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,880
That's your own words.

408
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,000
No backing out.

409
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,750
I said it.

410
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,880
I won't back out.

411
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,070
Want to grab supper?

412
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,070
I'm fine either way. I'm not really hungry.

413
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,310
Love is enough to fill you up, huh?

414
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,000
Can you take a photo of me too?

415
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,200
One, two, three.

416
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Let's take one together.

417
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,790
Stop looking so tense.

418
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,920
It's not like we're taking a funeral photo.

419
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,680
Smile.

420
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,400
Be more sincere!

421
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,160
Look at how her husband lets her take photos as she pleases.

422
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,960
You though, it's like

423
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,480
I'm asking for your life every time we take one.

424
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,480
Darling, I'm sorry.

425
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,640
Let's go home and keep it down.

426
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
This is so embarrassing.

427
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,680
What do you want to eat?

428
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,960
Eel noodles.

429
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,510
It's late.

430
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,920
Where am I supposed to find eel noodles at this hour?

431
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,920
There's a good crayfish place nearby.

432
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,030
I used to go there often with Xingchi and Haikuo.

433
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,070
Why didn't you invite me?

434
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,830
Back then, I was just starting out as a courier.

435
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,270
I barely had time to even sleep.

436
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,750
Well, you could have at least

437
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,070
brought me some takeout.

438
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,720
It's not too late to treat you now.

439
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,400
Sit down.

440
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,400
Waiter!

441
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,200
Bring us 30 chilled crayfish,

442
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,790
the biggest ones you have,

443
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,070
and two bottles of soda too.

444
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,030
Alright!

445
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,070
Back then,

446
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,270
Haikuo had a fight with his mom.

447
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,350
Xingchi's karaoke studio got shut down.

448
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,030
And me?

449
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,200
My startup had failed.

450
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,160
The three of us would come here every day to drink.

451
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
When we got drunk, we'd hug each other and cry our hearts out.

452
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,000
No wonder you wouldn't invite me.

453
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
Afraid I would see you embarrass yourself?

454
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,510
With that mouth of yours,

455
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,070
if you had seen that scene,

456
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,750
you'd nag about it for the rest of your life.

457
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,550
Am I really that immature in your eyes?

458
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,880
It's not that.

459
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,960
You're carefree and easygoing.

460
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
A lot of things don't bother you.

461
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,200
Here it comes.

462
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,750
Give it to me.

463
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,590
Thank you.

464
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,750
Okay, thanks.

465
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,030
Eat up.

466
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,750
Didn't you always say that

467
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,310
you've always seen me as a brother?

468
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,160
So why is it that when something happens,

469
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
you see me as a woman?

470
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,240
You're nitpicking now?

471
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,200
I just want to know

472
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
when you see me as a brother

473
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,510
and when you see me as a woman?

474
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,790
Well...

475
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,440
For example, right now,

476
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,350
do you see me as a brother or a woman?

477
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,750
You're a child.

478
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,550
Look at the mess you're making from eating crayfish as an adult.

479
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,200
Unbelievable.

480
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,480
Waiter, check please.

481
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,510
Hello.

482
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,640
That'll be 150 yuan in total.

483
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,720
Thank you.

484
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,880
Hope to see you again.

485
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,270
Can you live a little more carefully from now on?

486
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,160
Don't be so scatterbrained,

487
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,720
or always acting like you're a tough guy.

488
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,030
Well, if I live carefully enough,

489
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,910
will you treat me like a woman?

490
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
That depends on you.

491
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,160
Depends on me?

492
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,480
What for?

493
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,070
Why aren't you saying anything?

494
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
I'm thinking about something.

495
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,880
Tell me.

496
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,350
If Siyi hadn't left back then

497
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,750
and had also got into a Beijing university,

498
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,310
what would it be like now?

499
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,400
Life has no 'what ifs.'

500
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,470
Just think about it.

501
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,480
It's meaningless.

502
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,590
Then let me ask you this.

503
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,200
If my dad had sold the ship back then,

504
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,350
raised some more money,

505
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,630
and had bought initial stocks of the big companies,

506
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,590
what would life be like now?

507
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,720
So it's all pointless.

508
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,400
We can think about the future though.

509
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,400
When Bee goes public,

510
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,920
I'll have complete financial independence.

511
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,350
By then,

512
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,400
I can buy an apartment in Beijing,

513
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
a three-bedroom one.

514
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
If you're financially independent,

515
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,750
why not buy a villa?

516
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,270
I can't spend all the money.

517
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,070
I still have to support my wife and kids.

518
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,590
So what kind of woman do you want to marry?

519
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,200
A woman.

520
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,920
Someone I'm familiar with

521
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
and know very well.

522
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,200
At the very least, she must have good character.

523
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,550
Warm-hearted, filial, and generous.

524
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,270
I don't expect her to be understanding all the time,

525
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,000
but she can't be petty either.

526
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,240
It'll be great if she's easily pacified

527
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,110
and is not too career-oriented,

528
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
but she must have a sense of responsibility.

529
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,950
She should be able to take good care of those around her.

530
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,680
It's okay if she generally doesn't dress up,

531
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,000
but then looks great with just a touch of lipstick.

532
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,350
When she occasionally wears high heels,

533
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,110
she'll have the presence of a supermodel.

534
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,160
There's someone like that at Bee's headquarters.

535
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,030
Too bad she's married.

536
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,030
Why don't you ask her to get divorced then?

537
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,510
That's not right.

538
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,720
Wouldn't that affect her blissful life?

539
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,920
I don't know if she's happy or not,

540
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,310
but as for you,

541
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,750
you definitely wouldn't be happy.

542
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,510
Be careful on the road.

544
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,160
Good night.

545
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,880
Good night.

546
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,510
What's wrong?

547
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,440
You were the one who bought those

548
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,590
Miao medicinal plasters, right?

549
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,750
No.

550
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,310
It's a local herbal remedy

551
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
that I had a colleague help find.

552
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,880
You've received it?

553
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,750
Aren't you going to thank me?

554
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,310
Thank you.

555
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm off.

556
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,720
♫I'm just like you♫

557
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,830
♫Strong like you♫

558
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Mom, are you asleep?

559
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,270
What's the matter?

560
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,680
You've a boyfriend now?

561
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,590
Why are you here?

562
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,070
You're drunk again.

563
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,400
Get up.

564
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Slowly, slowly.

565
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,640
How much did you drink?

566
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,400
Don't fall.

567
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,680
You bought these tickets?

568
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,070
Of course.

569
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,920
If I hadn't bought it, could I have snatched it?

570
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,000
I saw both of you

571
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,270
at the crayfish restaurant just now.

572
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Why didn't you come over?

573
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,440
You two seemed to be having a good time.

574
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
I didn't want to disturb you.

575
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,070
Are you crazy?

576
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,880
Did you drink too much fake alcohol?

577
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm wrong.

578
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm sorry. I apologize.

579
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,150
Wanghe,

580
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,550
you two are a really good match.

581
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,070
Fenghua is truly good to you.

582
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,070
Isn't Fenghua good to you too?

583
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,480
She's good to me too,

584
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,350
but not in that way.

585
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,350
She's been sticking to you since she was little.

586
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,680
The way she looks at you is different.

587
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,070
Alright, just go to sleep.

588
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,800
Don't dwell on things that don't matter.

589
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Xie Wanghe!

590
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,640
Fenghua is a good girl.

591
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Don't let her down.

592
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,680
If you've made up your mind, be serious about it.

593
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,310
Don't hurt her.

594
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,350
Anything else?

595
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,790
Go on.

596
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,680
Wanghe.

597
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,910
We're like brothers.

598
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm begging you to please be good to her.

599
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
What does...

600
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,790
happiness mean to you?

601
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
Happiness...

602
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,350
Happiness is...

603
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,350
to live life with the person I love,

604
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,400
where we spend our days together.

605
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,920
I think happiness is

606
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,200
letting the person you love

607
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,200
live the life she wants to live.

608
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,630
That's happiness.

609
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
What do you mean?

610
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,880
When we were young, Granny Ma always said

611
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,630
girls must be raised with care.

612
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,110
She was right.

613
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,670
So I want to

614
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,670
save up enough to meet this condition.

615
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,400
Wait.

616
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,000
You can't be together if you have no money?

617
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,840
You probably can,

618
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,550
but you won't be happy.

619
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,840
Then your parents...

620
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,320
Haikuo's parents,

621
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,670
and my parents...

622
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,630
Since young, Fenghua was raised

623
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,070
as a boy by her family.

624
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,440
She's open-minded and easy to raise.

625
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,640
But I just want to have

626
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,590
the ability and conditions

627
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,230
to pamper her one day.

628
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Before that,

629
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,920
I don't want to make empty promises

630
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,470
or commit to a future.

631
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,230
If you aren't going to take action,

632
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,150
can I take my chances first?

633
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,670
Can I, Xie Wanghe?

634
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,630
I'm asking you.

635
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,710
If you want to pursue her,

636
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,230
no one's stopping you,

637
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
nor can anyone stop you.

638
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,550
I'm going to find her now.

639
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,840
Xingchi.

640
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,150
If you think you have the ability

641
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,670
to make her happy,

642
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,630
not only will I not stop you,

643
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,510
I will also give you my blessings.

644
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,190
I may not be good enough now,

645
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,280
but that doesn't mean I won't be in the future.

646
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,590
Making empty promises, huh?

647
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,830
Is there any point in that?

648
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,590
A property or a car.

649
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,480
That's definitely not happening in the short term.

650
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,110
But you should at least have a proper place to stay, no?

651
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,880
I do have one!

652
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,960
That basement, huh?

653
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,280
Are you going to get Fenghua to squeeze in with you,

654
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,320
or are you going to mooch off her place?

655
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,590
That works too.

656
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,910
She has a canteen.

657
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,470
You'll even save on food expenses.

658
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,000
Congratulations.

659
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,630
Tell me in detail.

660
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Let's talk about Yuntu first.

661
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,230
Their biggest problem now

662
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,280
is the chaotic assignment of orders.

663
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,400
As soon as delivery riders

664
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,160
log into the app,

665
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,630
it starts to assign order frantically.

666
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,670
Such a model seems efficient,

667
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,360
but it actually ignores the riders' feelings.

668
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,110
Riders will feel like they're being frantically exploited,

669
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,230
as if they're being whipped to keep moving.

670
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,710
Having an active or passive choice

671
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,840
makes a big difference for individuals.

672
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,710
Yuntu is slow in adjusting order prices.

673
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,670
And that does not match the pace of delivery.

674
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,870
For example,

675
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,440
for orders in more remote areas,

676
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
riders are reluctant to accept them.

677
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,590
In this case, the price should be continuously increased

678
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,960
until someone accepts the order.

679
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,030
But Yuntu's response is much slower.

680
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,590
This way, even when the customer receives their meal,

681
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
the customer experience is still poor

682
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,800
due to the long delay.

683
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,360
Customers often ask,

684
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,030
'Why hasn't any rider accepted my order?'

685
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,510
If no rider accepts the order for a long time,

686
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,960
customers will cancel the order.

687
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,280
The restaurant doesn't make money

688
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,760
and even has to bear with the losses.

689
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,440
If this continues,

690
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,360
we'll lose many merchants.

691
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,960
Hello?

692
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,400
Hello?

693
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,110
Where are you?

694
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,510
I'm in a meeting. Let's talk later.

695
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,480
Hurry and watch the CCTV News channel now.

696
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,960
The Grand Canal's application for World Heritage status has been successful.

697
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,760
Really?

698
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,590
Recently,

699
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,590
at the 38th World Heritage Committee meeting

700
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,400
held in Doha, Qatar,

701
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,880
The Grand Canal, a cultural heritage project

702
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,230
independently proposed by our country,

703
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,230
has been successfully added to the World Heritage list.

704
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,840
World Cultural Heritage, huh?

705
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,880
It's the world!

706
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,920
Our Grand Canal, along with the Great Wall,

707
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,230
the Forbidden City,

708
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,550
the Summer Palace, Potala Palace,

709
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,670
and Longmen Grottoes,

710
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,510
will all be on the same level now.

711
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,030
Right?

712
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,230
What does this mean?

713
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,550
It means that when tourists come to Flower Street in the future,

714
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,880
they'll have to buy tickets.

715
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,840
It means that we'll have to raise the prices

716
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,880
of our family's tofu pudding.

717
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,030
Now that the application is successful,

718
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,590
it means our Grand Canal

719
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,360
will soon see a revival.

720
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,510
The economy along both sides of the canal

721
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,550
will develop rapidly.

722
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,190
Good times are ahead.

723
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,030
Yanlin!

724
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
Come, come.

725
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,710
Find some time to tidy up our restaurant.

726
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,710
It’s time for some repairs and fixes.

727
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,800
Don't let it look all run-down, you know?

728
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,840
It'll bring shame to Flower Street.

729
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,360
Don't worry, I've already arranged it.

730
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,550
Mr. Zhou.

731
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,150
If Flower Street becomes more popular in the future,

732
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,510
business will surely be better than before, right?

733
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,360
Of course.

734
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,880
Not just on both banks, but on the river too.

735
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,150
Business on the water

736
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,400
will gradually improve as well.

737
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,670
So you're saying that we can

738
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,880
make money by seafaring again, right?

739
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,070
What do you mean, Boss Xie?

740
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,070
You have an itch to scratch, don't you?

741
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,920
An itch?

742
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,960
No, we should still wait and see.

743
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,070
Let's see how it goes.

744
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,230
But to be honest,

745
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,960
Mr. Shao really contributed a lot

746
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,550
to the success of this UNESCO heritage application.

747
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,550
That's right.

748
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,550
I wouldn't say I contributed much.

749
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,440
I just helped a little bit.

750
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,760
Before this,

751
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,710
together with Mr. Zhou, Chen Bo,

752
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,840
and Chen Rui,

753
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,070
we've been studying that sunken ship in the canal.

754
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,670
We could strongly prove that

755
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,670
more than a hundred years ago,

756
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,190
this Grand Canal was

757
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,750
part of the Silk Road.

758
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,480
And we concluded that

759
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,550
our Grand Canal

760
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,070
played a role in history that was

761
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,840
much greater than the Suez Canal.

762
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,000
Don't you think that's impressive?

763
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,150
Impressive.

764
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,550
Don't listen to his nonsense.

765
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,760
Well, I...

766
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,150
We only proved that there was a ship

767
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,510
that had an Italian on board.

768
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,110
Then this ship sailed north,

769
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,840
and later, near our area,

770
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
they encountered some pirates

771
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,920
and finally sank.

772
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,710
As for the conclusions,

773
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,230
most of them are speculation.

774
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,030
We don't have enough historical evidence to prove it.

775
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,630
It doesn't have academic value.

776
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,510
You're not writing a thesis.

777
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,480
Why do you need academic value?

778
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,000
We submitted the materials as part of our application,

779
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,440
didn't we?

780
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,710
And they've given us an acknowledgement.

781
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,590
What does this mean?

782
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,880
It means they've seriously looked at it.

783
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,550
Whether or not it's valuable,

784
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,760
it's not for us to determine, right?

785
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,560
Alright. I won't argue with you anymore.

786
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,670
You're the biggest hero for this successful UNESCO heritage application.

787
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes, that's right.

788
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,110
As for us,

789
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,360
we've only proven that

790
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,960
there was indeed an Italian on this ship.

791
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,670
But who was he?

792
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,630
Where did he come from and where was he going?

793
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,710
What was he doing in China?

794
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,480
We have to keep investigating.

795
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,550
Even if we end up finding nothing,

796
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,400
the process itself

797
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,670
can help us uncover more about

798
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,710
the history of Flower Street.

799
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,510
That would be a great achievement for us too.

800
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,110
That's right.

801
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,480
Isn't it?

802
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,000
Yes, yes.

803
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,510
Right?

804
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,110
It certainly is.

805
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,190
I want to visit the Suez Canal.

806
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,960
You look just like the Suez Canal to me.

807
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,360
The celebration is starting, hurry up!

808
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,000
It's starting, it's starting!

809
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,760
Come on, come on!

810
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,920
Let's go, let's go!

811
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,760
The flags, the flags!

812
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,510
We got them!
