Hello, Mom.

Xingchi!

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,350
What have you been doing? Your phone has been off all day.

6
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,310
My phone ran out of battery.

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,259
I just charged it. What's wrong?

8
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,450
We were worried about you.

You don't have to worry about me.

I'm fine.

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,200
Don't worry, Mom.

13
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,230
What do you mean "don't worry"?

14
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,829

Bamboo carving?

22
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,900
That's an intangible cultural heritage.

Look at him.

How can he be so immature?

Why do you have to get the other kids involved?

is the father's fault.

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,000
So it's all my fault, you mean?

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,470

He might be capable,

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,470
I was just thinking,

134
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,710
since they can offer manpower

135
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,590
and they're not lazy,

136
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,870
why can't we all work together?

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,270
Besides, they're really not staying here for free.

138
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
Not for free?

139
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,300
You call that little money "not staying for free"?

140
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,210
Remember when

141
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,220

You have no right to do that.

For one station,

167
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,140
there's only so much money it can make.

168
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,880
If you give more to others,

169
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,630

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,940
From now on,

190
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,020
we'll run this station ourselves.

192

What about

193
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,590
the business Mr. Sun brought in?

194
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,250
He took all the business with him.

195
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,059
We'll find new business later.

196
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,130
No matter how much business we lose,

197
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,600
we'll make it up in the future.

198
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,130
But

199
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,430
you have to help me with some of the management work.

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,830
We can't afford it now,

201
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
so I won't be able to pay you extra.

202
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,110
No need, Fenghua.

203
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,460
We're already extremely grateful

204
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,130
to you for keeping us on.

205

Don't worry, Fenghua.

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,650
My whole family will work hard from now on.

207
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,030
We won't let you regret it.

208
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,030
Alright, get back to work.

This exhibition of ours

210
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,070
provides a detailed introduction to the history of the canal's evolution

211
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,470

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,710
Please take a closer look.

214
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,390
Well, speaking of the Grand Canal,

215
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,840
we all know that

216
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,260
it's the greatest hydraulic engineering project of ancient times,

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,750
bar none.

218
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,080
In fact, starting from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods,

219
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,240
up until today,

220
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,900
our country has continuously

221
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,550
been constructing and dredging the Grand Canal.

222
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,030
After the founding of New China,

223
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,270
in 1953 and 1957,

224
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,110
the Jiangyin Lock and Yangliuqing Lock were built,

225
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,420
as well as thousand-ton locks like the Suqian Lock.

226
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,270
After 1959,

227
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,200
to support the South-to-North Water Diversion Project,

228
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,630
the section from Xuzhou to the Yangtze River was expanded as a key project,

[Lively Jiangnan]

230
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,830
which is about 400 kilometers of the canal.

231
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,090
This increased the canal's annual one-way capacity

232
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,250
to nearly 20 million tons.

233
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,150
It also expanded

234
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,630
the irrigated and drained areas along the canal.

235
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,900
This measure

236
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,350
ensured the safety of people's lives and property

237
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,870
along the canal,

238
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,050
as well as the development of agricultural production.

239
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,250
Therefore, this project has achieved

240
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,180
social benefits in various aspects.

241
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,150
However, there's one point

242
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,590
I want to emphasize today.

243
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,190
That is, through this exhibition,

244
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,350
you may have felt that

245
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,550
this rich heritage

246
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,890
left by our ancestors

247
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,030
is still benefiting us descendants

249
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,300

Therefore,

252
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,230
we should sincerely exclaim that

253
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,750
this is indeed a great project.

254
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,830
Bravo.

255
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,010
Mr. Zhou.

256
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,170
Come and take a look at this.

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,190
Come on, check this out.

258
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,760
What is this?

259
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,980
An arrow.

260
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,550
Mr. Chen found this

261
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,070
on the ship. On the side of the ship.

262
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,180
I found it just now.

263
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,550
You know what it proves?

264
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,460
That this ship

265
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,790
was attacked.

266
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,770
Attacked by whom?

267
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,850
How would I know?

268
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,220
We'll have to wait for

269
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,200
further identification by archaeological experts.

270
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,860
If you ask me,

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,580
this ship from late Qing dynasty,

272
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
which is less than 100 years old,

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,050
really doesn't have much archaeological value.

274
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,370
It's been seven years since we started investigating,

275
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,770
and nothing was found.

276
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,910
We don't even know

277
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,230
who the owner of this ship was.

278
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,070
We do know.

279
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,390
The owner was an Italian.

280
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,470
We don't even know his name.

281
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,380
It's not even recorded in the county chronicles.

282
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,530
After the excavation was restarted,

283
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,040
we did get some new information.

284
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,410
Yes.

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,110
For example,

286
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,500
besides these, there's also

287
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,560
a compass,

288
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,930
a pocket watch,

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,610
a fountain pen, and that

290
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,430
water-damaged notebook.

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,710
Chen Rui

292
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,950
has made a significant discovery

293
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,470
out of

294
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,750
the restored photocopy of this notebook.

295
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,560
Is that so?

296
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,680
But now, he's not that sure.

297
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,830
The canal expo is happening at the right time.

298
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,540
I told him to go to Beijing to see the exhibition,

299
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,560
find the expert who was in charge of the excavation back then,

300
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,590
and ask about it.

301
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,550
He'll also take the opportunity to tell him that

302
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,190
the excavation work on the ancient ship has restarted.

303
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,070
That's great.

304
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Maybe these seven years of waiting weren't in vain.

305
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,460
Sure. Sure.

306
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,550
That kind of ship

307
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,420
was actually quite common in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area

308
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,790
in the Qing Dynasty.

309
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,150
But since there weren't any precious artifacts on the ship,

310
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,990
we returned to Beijing quite soon.

311
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, I understand.

312
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,410
But what was unearthed back then wasn't just some small items.

313
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,670
There was also a notebook.

314
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,420
I made a copy of that notebook,

315
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,050
and I've studied ancient Italian for a few years.

316
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,270
I have some new discoveries.

317
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,060
What new discoveries do you have?

318
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,250
I found out that the owner of that ship was an Italian.

319
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
And that notebook

320
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,350
was actually a diary.

321
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,720
It recorded his observations and experiences during his travels.

322
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,110
Actually, in that era,

323
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,240
there were indeed quite a few Westerners coming to China.

324
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,380
The related records

325
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,870
are also abundant.

326
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,190
But if the person's status at that time

327
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,510
wasn't prominent enough,

328
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,230
it actually doesn't have much research value.

329
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,080
Yes, yes, I understand.

330
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,470
From a macro-historical perspective, it might be so.

331
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,070
But there's one coincidence.

332
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,950
There are several surnames of attendants in that notebook,

333
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,920
namely Xie, Zhou, Xia, and Shao.

334
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,070
These coincide with the surnames

335
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,080
of several households in our Flower Street courtyard.

336
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,310
You mean

337
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,910
they are very likely to be

338
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,940
descendants of the shipwreck survivors?

339
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,600
I think that's possible.

340
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,190
So I'm here to ask you

341
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,710
for the original copy of that notebook.

342
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,070
I want to know the ship owner's

343
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,590
real name and identity.

344
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,710
Well, I'll have to go back and ask about that.

345
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,110
Since there were

346
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,470
no valuable cultural relics on that ship,

347
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,830
after we salvaged it,

348
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,470
we put everything in the warehouse.

349
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,670
How about this?

350
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,470
I'll have them look for it again, okay?

351
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,750
Okay, great.

make a few side dishes and warm up some yellow rice wine.

375
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,270
Let's have a couple of drinks.

376
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,480
You take your time and enjoy it. I need to catch up on sleep.

377
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,400
Yellow rice wine helps with sleep.

378
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,470
How's it been?

379
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,550
Business has been good

380
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,850
these days, right?

381
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,900
It's alright.

382
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,950
It has its ups and downs.

383
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,440
At least we're not losing money.

384
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,430
How about Lao'er?

385
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,790
As for the floating supermarket,

386
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,510
♫Beyond the city wall♫

387
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,910
business has been good lately.

388
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
There have been more and more

389
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,510
ships on the river.

390
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,830
He's been busy from morning till night.

391
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,380
He can make several hundred a day.

392
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,140
♫From Temple of Cold Hill♫

393
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,270
That's good.

394
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,970
How about you guys?

395
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,260
How's it been?

396
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,900
Same as usual.

397
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,220
I still feel the same way,

398
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,270
tired.

399
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,920
♫The sound of bells in the midnight♫

400
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,310
Being tired is fine, as long as we can make money.

401
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,830
I said to Maotian that

402
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,110
while we can still work

403
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,070
these couple of years,

404
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,220
we should work harder

405
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,440
and save more money for Fenghua.

406
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,360
♫Bells break the ship-borne roamer's dream♫

407
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,990
Thinking about Fenghua,

408
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,670
a young girl,

409
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,870
struggling alone in Beijing,

410
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,320
while us parents

411
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,980
can't help much,

412
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,420
it really breaks my heart.

413
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,660
♫At moonset cry the crows♫

414
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,980
You're overthinking it.

415
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,920
Wanghe told me

416
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,530
that Fenghua is doing really well

417
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,810
in Beijing.

418
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,620
There are

419
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,300
♫Streaking the frosty sky♫

420
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,830
several dozen people at her station.

421
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,230
They all listen to her and respect her.

422
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Even if she manages hundreds of people, so what?

423
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,160
♫Dimly lit fishing boats♫

424
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,270
Working like a dog and still not making much money.

425
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,150
She can't compare to Wanghe.

426
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,410
They both have their own struggles.

427
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,260
Before, when Wanghe

428
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,240
♫Sadly lie beneath maples♫

429
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,510
was doing ground promotion,

430
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,650
he had to travel from city to city,

431
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,550
not even having time to eat.

432
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,070
Although it's better

433
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,990
now that he's working at the headquarters,

434
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,070
which is a bit more relaxing,

435
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,240
he can't make any commissions.

436
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,410
You win some, you lose some.

437
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,310
♫Beyond the city wall♫

438
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,030
That's life.

439
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
You may as well use that time

440
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,890
to think about adult matters.

441
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,590
Adult?

442
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
Which adult?

443
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,810
Dad.

444
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,610
You're watching TV?

445
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,790
I'll go upstairs first.

446
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,720
Wait.

447
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,210
What's up?

448
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,190
Well,

449
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,590
Haihong and Yan came to me,

450
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,610
you know?

451
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,580
They said there's a friend

452
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,070
who wants to meet you.

453
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,340
Friend? What kind of friend? From where?

454
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,930
A high school teacher.

455
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:50,690
High school?

456
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,920
A woman. A woman.

457
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,430
They say she has a nice character...

458
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,350
Hold on. Hold on.

459
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,310
Her appearance...

460
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,740
It's a blind date, isn't it?

461
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,550
Well, that might be their intention.

462
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,510
What do you mean "intention"? It's really... Really not cool.

463
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,150
Alright, forget it.

464
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,190
So... So you're planning to

465
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,349
stay single forever, huh?

466
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,569
Hey, what's wrong with me staying single?

467
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,910
Aren't you single all along as well?

468
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,750
We're different.

469
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,430
Back in those days,

470
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,099
as a single father with a half-grown child,

471
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,319
how could I possibly get married again?

472
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,480
Where?

473
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,870
Dad.

474
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,030
Tell me the truth.

475
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,230
Back then, was it hard to get married again,

476
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,790
or did you not want to?

477
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,890
You see,

478
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,810
you managed to endure the loneliness for me.

479
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,910
Why can't I do the same?

480
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,230
That's not necessary.

481
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,690
Look, the neighbors

482
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,240
have been arranging things for you from all sides.

483
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,230
Even if you're unwilling,

484
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,710
you should at least meet her once.

485
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,240
Otherwise, you'll be disappointing everyone's good intentions.

486
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,830
Don't you agree?

487
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,580
Right. I agree.

488
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,230
You keep watching TV.

489
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,150
I'm going upstairs.

490
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,130
This one, this one.

491
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,990
Look, they're about the same age.

492
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,460
She looks really quiet. How nice.

493
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
And this one.

494
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,310
I think this one should also be our focus.

495
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,830
She's really nice.

496
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,630
Is that so?

497
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,930
Her conditions are good.

498
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,100
You're not trying to find a match for Yanlin again, are you?

499
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,710
Boss Xie, take a look.

500
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,070
What do you think of this woman?

501
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,650
Looking like that, she's not going out to film movies, is she?

502
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,250
She's a high school Chinese teacher, an intellectual.

503
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,990
But... But have you

504
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,990
asked for Haikuo's opinion?

505
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,370
He's also grown up, an adult now.

506
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,890
If I ask him, that's a bit...

507
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,690
Why don't we have our son ask him?

508
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,590
Right, right. Let Wanghe ask him.

509
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,170
They're of the same generation, and they're good friends.

510
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,120
They'll definitely speak their minds to each other,

511
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,830
right?

512
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,720
And then we'll know.

513
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,680
Xiaohui didn't come?

514
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,240
She has a class reunion.

515
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,310
I didn't bother to go back either.

516
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,450
Go ahead, what did you want to talk to me about?

517
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,700
What's wrong? Is it so hard to say?

518
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,990
If you can't say it, then don't.

519
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,100
They want to find a partner for your dad.

520
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,350
They wanted to ask for your opinion.

521
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,470
If you don't agree, then...

522
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,150
I agree.

523
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,500
All these years,

524
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,620
my dad has stayed single and struggled alone.

525
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,870
It's not right.

526
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,260
Don't you want your parents to reconcile?

527
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,690
I've tried.

528
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,510
It did't work.

529
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,490
I've already given up.

530
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,740
Last year,

531
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,500
I asked my mom to come home for New Year's.

532
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,870
She had agreed at first,

533
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,870
but a few days before New Year's,

534
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,480
she said there was a role for her.

535
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,610
It was just a cameo.

536
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,540
Only for a few days.

537
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,260
What? Is this what you wanted to see me for?

538
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,010
What do you want for late-night snacks? My treat.

539
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,050
Why?

540
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,980
You feel sorry for me?

541
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,620
No need.

542
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,380
I'm not as fragile as you think.

543
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,980
Fine, I'm the fragile one, okay?

544
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,240
I've been under a lot of mental stress lately.

545
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,710
I urgently need emotional support.

546
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,510
Alright, alright.

547
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,290
Stop acting.

548
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,680
Your pity party won't work on me.

549
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,950
I'm telling the truth.

550
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,470
I'm about to be parachuted

551
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,500
in Haidian.

552
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,900
Besides the competition from Yuntu

553
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,620
and Eat Well,

554
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,920
I also have to deal with

555
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,950
the complex interpersonal relationships in the company.

556
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,970
If I'm only asked to handle business, there's no problem.

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm confident.

558
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,210
But when it comes to office politics,

559
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,210
I'm still a bit insecure.

560
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,270
When you have time,

561
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
read "Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance".

562
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,980
If you want to achieve great things,

563
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,130
don't hold back.

564
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,230
As long as you're sure you are in the right direction,

565
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,570
just push straight through.

566
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If you get stuck,

567
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,610
it means you're not pushing hard enough.

568
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,240
Put in more effort.

569
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,340
No one can take you down on your own battlefield.

570
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,470
Come on.

571
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,430
You can definitely do it.

572
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
You have so much confidence in me?

573
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,350
Back then,

574
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,360
during the group-buying war,

575
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,380
you were in Xiamen.

576
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,910
You realized the trend was changing,

577
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,010
and you called your boss overnight,

578
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,620
telling him to shift the strategic focus

579
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,150
from group-buying to food delivery.

580
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,620
If it weren't for that call,

581
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,420
whether Bee would still exist now would be unknown.

582
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,910
So your boss should be very clear

583
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,230
who he should support.

584
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,820
Hope so.

585
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,850
Brother-in-law!

586
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
How could they do that?

587
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,940
I was doing well at the Haidian branch,

588
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,240
and suddenly they decided to parachute someone in,

589
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,160
saying it's to assist me. Do they think I'm stupid?

590
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,910
What are they really up to?

591
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,260
You didn't do a good job yourself.

592
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,750
The higher-ups have concerns.

593
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,300
If the higher-ups have concerns, they can bring them up to me.

594
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,010
I never said I wouldn't correct my mistakes.

595
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,210
But now, all of a sudden,

596
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,550
they sent someone to take over our territory.

597
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,350
What's that supposed to mean?

598
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,540
Was all our previous work for nothing?

599
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,270
Do you know anything about Xie Wanghe?

600
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,850
He's just a ground promoter.

601
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,310
Why should I know about him?

602
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,020
During the group-buying war,

603
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,410
Xie Wanghe's achievements were remarkable.

604
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,020
If it weren't for him,

605
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,840
Bee might not even exist today.

606
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,870
When dealing with someone like him,

607
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,690
you absolutely can't confront him head-on.

608
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,310
Otherwise,

609
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,410
you'll only embarrass yourself.

610
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,850
According to what you're saying,

611
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,610
we might as well just hand over Haidian's business

612
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,950
to him and be done with it.

613
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,350
Why even bother discussing it then?

614
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,880
Mr. Qiu, Mr. Xie is here.

615
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,710
Mr. Song.

616
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

617
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,770
It's all right. Here, let me introduce.

618
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
This is Xie Wanghe, Mr. Xie.

619
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,230
This is Qiu Lin,

620
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,590
head of the Haidian branch.

621
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,440
Pleased to meet you.

622
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,270
What kind of tea would you like?

623
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,220
No need for tea.

624
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,210
Room temperature water is fine.

625
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,680
How about bottled water?

626
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,430
Alright.

627
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,920
Qiu Lin.

628
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,490
Go get some bottled water.

629
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,830
Mr. Song, we're all quite busy, so let's get straight to the point.

630
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,620
Let's forget about the water, okay?

631
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,530
Okay, no problem.

632
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,090
I'll get to the point then.

633
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,000
Alright then.

634
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,470
Let's sit down and talk.

635
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,390
Qiu Lin.

636
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,140
Offer your seat to Mr. Xie.

637
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,700
Come on.

638
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,330
Mr. Xie, please.

639
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,690
Mr. Song.

640
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,790
Mr. Qiu.

641
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,760
The headquarters is

642
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,840
very dissatisfied with

643
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,940
the work of the Haidian branch.

644
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,510
Do you have any idea how fierce the competition is

645
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,710
in Haidian?

646
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,430
Let Mr. Xie finish first.

647
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,100
For the food delivery industry,

648
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,140
the Beijing market

649
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,640
is extremely important.

650
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,620
And Haidian is the most crucial area.

651
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,640
However, our current

652
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,700
market share in Haidian is less than 30%.

653
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,470
It has even been declining recently.

654
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,750
With shortage of money

655
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,080
and manpower,

656
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,520
under such circumstances,

657
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,290
the fact that we can maintain a market share

658
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,670
of 30% in Haidian is already quite good.

659
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Everyone in the industry knows

660
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,010
that to compete for this market,

661
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,210
every platform is offering subsidies.

662
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,190
Look at Yuntu

663
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,600
and Eat Well.

664
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,340
They've already offered three rounds of subsidies just this year.

665
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,370
What about us?

666
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,540
Since the day I started working here,

667
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,170
we've only offered subsidies once,

668
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,570
and it wasn't even as substantial as the others.

669
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,600
Under such fierce competition,

670
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,460
I still managed to maintain

671
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,210
the market share in Haidian

672
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,240
steady at 30%.

673
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,170
If the head office is still not satisfied,

674
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll quit. How about that?

675
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,830
Sure.

676
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,040
I'll write a report to the headquarters,

677
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,110
and you'll just need to sign.

678
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,110
It's not like that, Mr. Xie.

679
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,730
Qiu Lin

680
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,280
is just short-tempered

681
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,560
and speaks a bit harshly.

682
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,580
Please don't take offense.

683
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,350
It's fine. We're all on the same team.

684
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,670
Who's on the same team with you?

685
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,310
Who do you think you are?

686
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,830
Qiu Lin.

687
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,190
Are you done yet?

688
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,710
Do you still want to work here? If not, get lost!

689
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Mr. Qiu.

690
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,710
Two years ago,

691
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,770
during the group-buying war,

692
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,270
all platforms were burning money.

693
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,000
Mr. Meng wanted to do the same in the first place,

694
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,540
but we didn't have enough funds.

695
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,920
Financing wasn't going well either.

696
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,110
In the end, we were forced to

697
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,130
leave Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen,

698
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,140
and we had to look for opportunities in second, third, and fourth-tier cities.

699
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,250
Fortunately,

700
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,710
our strategic direction and execution were on point.

701
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,670
In over 70 cities

702
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,330
and more than 1,000 sales points,

703
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,630
we cooperated closely to break through.

704
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,270
In the end, we successfully implemented

705
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,010
the strategy of encircling the cities from the rural areas.

706
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,260
Our survival in that round

707
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,030
wasn't due to funding,

708
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,350
but our determination and courage to fight with our backs against the wall.

709
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,550
Next,

710
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,080
Bee will shift from group-buying to food delivery,

711
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,310
focusing on local life services.

712
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,330
So, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen

713
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,270
are markets we must conquer.

714
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,780
Before I came,

715
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,780
I made a pledge to Mr. Meng that

716
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,710
within a year,

717
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,960
I will increase Bee's market share in Haidian

718
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,360
to 50%.

719
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,670
50%?

720
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,310
That's wishful thinking.

721
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,070
If I don't reach the goal,

722
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,310
I'll resign.

723
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,840
Then you'll definitely have to resign.

724
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
However,

725
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,180
I'll take the responsible parties

726
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,220
with me when I go.

727
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,330
Dear passengers.

728
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,250
For your safety and the safety of others,

729
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,030
please do not bring flammable, explosive, toxic, or dangerous items,

730
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,410
or oversized and overweight items into the station or on the train.

731
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
Please cooperate with the security check.

732
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,430
Sir.

733
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,920
Thank you for your cooperation.

734
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,600
How much does a welder make per month?

735
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,350
That depends on your skill level.

736
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,980
I...

737
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,100
I used to do car repairs,

738
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,290
and I can weld too.

739
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,770
Do you have a certificate?

740
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,970
Certificate...

741
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,570
That's easy.

742
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,370
He can make one himself.

743
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,440
Officer Xia.

744
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,110
I've already changed my line of work.

745
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,120
Are you sure?

746
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,300
I am.

747
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,890
Prison food isn't good.

748
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,770
I've got the munchies.

749
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,380
A bowl of noodles would suffice.

750
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,390
Everything in Beijing is good,

751
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,980
but not the noodles.

752
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,610
Then why do you seem to enjoy them?

753
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,300
Where are you from again?

754
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,200
I'm from Honghuai, Jiangsu Province.

755
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,430
It's a small city by the canal.

756
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,760
How long have you been in Beijing?

757
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,280
I came here in 2008. You know that.

758
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,300
Did you come by yourself?

759
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,520
With those buddies. We came together.

760
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:33,990
Yeah, right.

761
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,970
Where are they now?

762
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,530
Officer Xia.

763
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,900
Are you taking a census?

764
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,700
For someone like you who disrupts social stability,

765
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,600
it's necessary to check thoroughly. No problem with that.

766
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,140
I've done legitimate businesses before.

767
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,660
But they all failed, didn't they? I've already confessed.

768
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,440
Then do you know

769
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,500
why you failed?

770
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,750
I was just unlucky.

771
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,750
It's so hard to make a living without a diploma nowadays.

772
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,150
How much can you really make,

773
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,790
selling fake IDs?

774
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,610
If you hadn't caught me, I'd be making quite a bit.

775
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,520
I could make tens of thousands a month.

776
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,610
Then why don't you sell drugs?

777
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,740
That makes even more money.

778
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,030
Hey, Officer Xia, what do you mean by that?

779
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,030
Even if I had the desire, I don't have the guts.

780
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,670
You shouldn't even have that desire.

781
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,400
Work hard and honestly in Beijing,

782
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,840
and opportunities will come your way.

783
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,720
What opportunities could someone like me have?

784
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,370
Do you know

785
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,660
how much a food delivery rider

786
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,000
makes in a month?

787
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,750
How much?

788
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,220
I didn't know before, but I've asked around.

789
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,670
When business is good, they can make 7,000 to 8,000 yuan a month.

790
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,830
It's even possible to make over ten thousand.

791
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,180
Really?

792
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,050
Of course.

793
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,300
But it's hard work.

794
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,780
Especially when the weather is bad.

795
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,820
Even when there's strong wind, heavy rain, or heavy snow,

796
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,310
they still have to work day and night.

797
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,760
When they get busy, they don't even have time to go to the toilet.

798
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,150
Isn't that what we're out here for? To make money?

799
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,590
Who's afraid of hard work?

800
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,460
Are you interested?

801
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,820
If you're interested, I can hook you up.

802
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,750
There's a food delivery station in our area.

803
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,900
Mentioning my name will help.

804
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,280
Xingchi.

805
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,230
Well, I've looked into your background.

806
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,120
You have records of acts of bravery from both last year and the year before.

807
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,980
You're quite a righteous guy.

808
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,050
Your heart's also in the right place.

809
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,310
Don't ever go down a path of no return.

810
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Alright, eat up.

811
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,950
Don't just sit there.

812
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,550
Here, bubble tea.

813
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,650
What about yours?

814
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,990
Jiang Xiaohui, Zhou Haikuo.

815
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,210
Visiting each other during work hours.

816
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,310
Each of you will be deducted three points.

817
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm... I'm sorry, team leader.

818
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,010
I was just delivering bubble tea to him.

819
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
I'll get back to work right away.

820
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,180
Don't just say sorry.

821
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,660
Is it fun to keep doing this?

822
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
I know you two are close,

823
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,760
but you can't be lovey-dovey all day.

824
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,030
This is a workplace.

825
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,000
If you want to date,

826
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,870
there's a park downstairs.

827
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,390
Why don't you go there?

828
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,080
Is this any of your business?

829
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
What does it have to do with you?

830
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,570
You said it yourself that this is a workplace.

831
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,870
It's not a prison.

832
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,560
We're not convicts.

833
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,390
What's with your attitude?

834
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,630
Openly violating company rules.

835
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,990
Zhou Haikuo, you think you're in the right?

836
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,640
What? What's wrong with my attitude?

837
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,150
You're acting like you've got some special authority.

838
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,440
You like deducting points, huh?

839
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,100
Go ahead, deduct all my points.

840
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,670
Let's go. Let's go.

841
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,140
If you're so tough, fire me!

842
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,390
You...

843
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,510
Hey.

844
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,070
What are you doing?

845
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
You asked me to go to the park, didn't you?

846
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm going to drink bubble tea there.

847
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,220
Let's go, Haikuo.

848
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,790
If you've got the guts, don't come back!

849
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,540
What are you looking at?

850
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,990
Too much free time, huh?

851
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,170
Each of you, three points deducted!

852
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,330
Get back to work now!

853
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,620
-Mr. Xie.
-Bye-bye, Mr. Xie.

854
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,310
Bye-bye.

855
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,110
Mr. Xie.

856
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,380
Mr. Xie.

857
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,110
Li, what's wrong?

858
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,020
There's something I want to tell you.

859
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,950
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

860
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,850
This afternoon,

861
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,440
I overheard Mr. Qiu chatting with some other delivery riders.

862
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,130
I didn't pay attention at first.

863
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,030
But then,

864
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,380
as I kept listening,

865
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,640
he started encouraging them

866
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,860
to jump ship to Yuntu.

867
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,440
What?

868
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,260
At first, I also thought I had misheard.

869
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,240
Later, I asked an employee about it.

870
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,300
It turns out to be true.

871
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,480
He said we can't compete with Yuntu,

872
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,030
and that if they could work well at Yuntu,

873
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,730
they could get company shares.

874
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,890
What should we do, Mr. Xie?

875
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,790
Don't do anything for now.

876
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,620
Let's observe secretly for a while.

877
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,490
Li.

878
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,770
We are the only ones

879
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,850
coming from the headquarters.

880
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,350
I'm counting on you.

881
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,200
Understood,

882
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,930
Mr. Xie.

883
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,230
In this company,

884
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,500
from top to bottom,

885
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,910
they're all Mr. Qiu's men.

886
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,710
You've been parachuted in

887
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,120
with just me as your assistant.

888
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,230
Although Mr. Meng supports you,

889
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,060
to get things done,

890
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,030
the most important thing

891
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,820
is to have your own team.

892
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,050
I understand.

893
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,980
When I'm not around,

894
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,750
keep an eye on them for me.

895
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,310
Leave the rest to me.

896
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay.

897
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,840
Go ahead.

898
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,590
Mr. Xie.

899
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,980
In this company,

900
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,310
from top to bottom,

901
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,970
they're all Mr. Qiu's men.

902
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,480
You've been parachuted in

903
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,810
with just me as your assistant.

904
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,150
Although Mr. Meng supports you,

905
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,890
to get things done,

906
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,880
the most important thing

907
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,590
is to have your own team.

908
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,850
Haikuo.

909
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,410
What do you want to eat?

910
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,400
Up to you.

911
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,360
Let's go.

912
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,830
You shouldn't have talked back to him today.

913
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,409
That guy is really sneaky.

914
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,170
He'll definitely cause trouble for you in the future.

915
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,699
I'm just a programmer.

916
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,100
As long as I do my job well,

917
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm not afraid of those things.

918
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,860
But I just think it's unnecessary.

919
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,380
When you can't bear it anymore,

920
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,730
there's no need to endure further.

921
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,469
People like him

922
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,739
should be given a direct, hard blow.

923
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,719
Otherwise, he'll get more and more out of line.

924
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,730
When he first joined the company,

925
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,000
he couldn't even figure out how to partition a hard drive.

926
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,230
We all helped him.

927
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,139
But what happened?

928
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,949
Later, by means of sweet talk

929
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,790
and his ability to tattle,

930
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,290
he worked all his way up and became a team leader.

931
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,429
On his first day as team leader,

932
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,550
he fired a colleague who had helped him before.

933
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,659
In this kind of company,

934
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,989
work ability isn't the top priority to begin with.

935
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,270
So,

936
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,560
I don't want to work here anymore.

937
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,210
Actually, I've wanted to quit for a long time.

938
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,290
What's gotten into you?

939
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,520
My roommate

940
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,380
has been sending resumes everywhere since she quit.

941
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,130
It's been about half a year now,

942
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,600
and she's only had one interview.

943
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,700
She didn't even get the chance to say anything

944
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,950
before they said "Thank you" to her.

945
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,290
So,

946
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,680
she's still stuck at home.

947
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,260
With my abilities,

948
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,780
finding a job shouldn't be too difficult, right?

949
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,350
But it's very stable here,

950
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,580
and the work pressure is low.

951
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,740
I just feel it's too stable.

952
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,530
It's really boring.

953
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,300
I can't get excited about anything I do.

954
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,450
The work is also simple, and there's no challenge.

955
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,080
My brain is almost rusted.

956
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,670
Why are you here?

957
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,540
Why are you back so late?

958
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,600
I had something to do.

959
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,270
What could you possibly have to do?

960
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,300
Why is it so messy here?

961
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,380
Have something to eat.

962
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,430
I've eaten.

963
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,580
What did you eat?

964
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,390
Fried Sauce Noodles.

965
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,050
Then I'll eat alone.

966
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,190
How often do you wash your socks?

967
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,020
What?

968
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,460
Are you offering to wash them for me?

969
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,570
If you don't want to wash them,

970
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,360
you can pile them up and wash them all together later.

971
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,350
It also saves water.

972
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,810
That's what I did in college.

973
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,370
What's wrong with you?

974
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,760
Don't you know biological weapons are against the international law?

975
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,790
Spit it out.

976
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,550
What do you want from me?

977
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,560
Can't I just come to see you without a reason?

978
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,600
Haikuo may come to see me without a reason,

979
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,350
but you...

980
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Our company

981
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,930
has a branch in Haidian.

982
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,010
I'm being parachuted there.

983
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,650
I'm planning to make a big splash.

984
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,010
That's great.

985
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,680
Congratulations.

986
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,970
I want you to come with me.

987
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,610
I've never worked in food delivery before.

988
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,720
I'm not interested.

989
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,950
If you've never done it,

990
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,670
how do you know you're not interested?

991
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,430
When Fenghua was busy before,

992
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,110
I went to help out for a couple of days.

993
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,360
It was boring.

994
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,300
Food delivery and express delivery are two different industries.

995
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
They're completely different.

996
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,480
What's the difference?

997
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,070
Isn't it just delivering from one point to another?

998
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,110
You're wrong.

999
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,710
China's food delivery industry

1000
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,270
is a market worth trillions.

1001
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,010
In the future, it will employ tens of millions of people.

1002
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,060
Isn't that great?

1003
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,660
Just work hard.

1004
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,090
I wish you prosperity and wealth.

1005
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,810
I'm being parachuted

1006
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,660
in Haidian.

1007
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,090
No one respects me.

1008
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,150
I need my own team.

1009
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,570
You have money. Just hire your own team.

1010
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,800
It's a big company.

1011
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,340
Isn't everyone desperate to get into cutting-edge industries?

1012
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,500
Hey.

1013
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,930
Why are you so unwilling to help me?

1014
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
Do you have any concerns?

1015
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,570
If you have concerns, just say it.

1016
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,660
There's nothing we can't talk about, right?

1017
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,150
It's not like that.

1018
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,870
I'm just worried I'll hold you back.

1019
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,950
I'm telling you,

1020
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,660
you won't.

1021
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,310
It's not like you lack ability.

1022
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,210
You just didn't choose the right industry.

1023
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,660
Think it over carefully.

1024
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,830
Take your time. I'm in no hurry.

1025
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,670
Chen Rui.

1026
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:19,880
Wanghe.

1027
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,150
I saw Siyi.

1028
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,340
For real?

1029
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,460
Where are you?

1030
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,750
Houhai Bar Street.

1031
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,730
Okay.

1032
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,800
We'll be right there.

1033
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,720
It was Chen Rui.

1034
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,860
He said he saw Siyi.

1035
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,490
Let's go.

1036
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,910
Chen Rui.

1037
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,490
Where is she?

1038
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,120
She's gone.

1039
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,630
Where did she go?

1040
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Tell me!

1041
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,540
I don't know.

1042
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,490
The boss said she did perform here before.

1043
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,130
That girl is pretty good.

1044
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,000
She has a great voice,

1045
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,510
and she's beautiful.

1046
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,740
♫Far away, so far away♫

1047
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,150
She just didn't talk much.

1048
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,640
Sometimes customers would ask her to drink with them,

1049
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,840
but she never agreed.

1050
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,120
♫The hometown I can never return to♫

1051
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,170
After every performance,

1052
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,480
she'd take her salary and leave.

1053
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,220
Do you know where she went?

1054
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,830
♫Sitting quietly in the city♫

1055
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:21,870
She didn't tell me.

1056
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,790
She sang here for about two months.

1057
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,040
♫Listening to the river flow♫

1058
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,500
The last time,

1059
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,380
she said she was going on a long trip.

1060
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,180
I offered her a raise, but she wouldn't take it.

1061
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,360
When was that?

1062
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,170
Last month.

1063
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,660
♫Hometown, oh hometown♫

1064

Well,

1066
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,270
I need to get back to work.

1067
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,440

♫Hold no poetry, no distant dreams♫

1077

It's my fault.

1084
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,180

1091
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,920
Siwei wouldn't have jumped.

1092
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,240
I'm sure Siyi doesn't see it that way.

1093
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,730
Then how does she see it?

1094
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,400
Tell me how she sees it.

1095
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,490
After all these years,

why couldn't she just contact us?

1097
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
Why?

1098
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,070

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,740
♫Listening as time drifts by♫

1108
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,670
Alright.

1109
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,390
Sorry about that.

1110
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:55,980
Let's drink.

1111
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,640
Why are you shouting?

1112
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,290
What's wrong with you?

1113
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,820
-Wanghe.
-Wanghe.

1114
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,960
What are you doing?

1115
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,010
Next,

1116
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,030
I'll sing a song for you.

1117
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,580
This song...

1118
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,100

1120
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,710
a friend who left without saying goodbye.

1121
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,990
Her name is Ma Siyi.

1122
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,460
♫My friend♫

1123
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,110
Buddy, you can't sing here. Come down, come down.

1124
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,390
It's okay, it's okay.

1125
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,630
♫Have you ever thought of me?♫

1126
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,650
What's wrong with me singing a song?

1127
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,510
What's wrong with me singing a song?

1128
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,670
