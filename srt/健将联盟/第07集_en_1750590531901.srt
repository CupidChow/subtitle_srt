1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,358
-Hey, open this up.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,072
Mr. Min.

5
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,826
I'm sending them to the City Council,
the mayor, and the Prosecutors' Office.

6
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,370
Divide them up and pack them well.

7
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,705
Got it.

8
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,499
-Hey, pack them up.
-Yes, sir.

9
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,918
Can we go out now?

10
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,004
What was that?

11
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,509
These guys helped bring in the goods.

12
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,386
What should we do?
They could be trouble if we leave them.

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,472
Please don't kill us.

14
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,475
We won't tell anyone what we saw here.

15
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,018
Wouldn't it be better…

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,897
if they couldn't speak at all?

17
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,191
Nice and neat.

18
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,902
-I came to see my family.
-Hey.

19
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,529
-Please let me go.
-You stink.

20
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,615
Don't you have a family?

21
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,283
Unfortunately, I don't.

22
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,080
Even if I had one…

23
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:04,875
Please spare me!

24
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,044
Please spare me!

25
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,894
I would've killed them
like I did just now.

26
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,803
Did I do something wrong again?

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,388
No.

28
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,557
I did something wrong.

29
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,439
I should've just beaten you to death
back then.

30
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,402
It's my fault.

31
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,612
Your face tells me

32
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,406
my counterpunch landed pretty well.

33
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,746
So it really was you.

34
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,290
Even a champion like you

35
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,544
should've been ready to take a hit or two
once you entered the ring.

36
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,298
Thanks.

37
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,508
For what?

38
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,511
For giving me a reason
to beat the hell out of you

39
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,763
without a second thought.

40
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,473
I'm going to…

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,726
kill you right here.

42
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:05,788
Hey.

43
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,247
Hey!

44
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:08,999
Hey!

45
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,127
Where the hell did this punk go?

46
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,670
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

47
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,174
Captain.

48
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,803
I think I know where Dung-ju is.

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,034
What are you doing here
after causing trouble?

50
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,787
Do you know what you did?

51
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,497
You need to control your temper.

52
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,332
-Do you know what--
-What?

53
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,467
What was I supposed to do?

54
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,915
Hey.

55
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,752
Fortunately, she's going to make it.

56
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,005
But we'll have to wait and see
when she'll wake up.

57
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,217
With no CCTVs
in and out of the restaurant,

58
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,094
it won't be easy to find out
what exactly happened.

59
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,679
We found traces of gunfire,

60
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,641
but your gun was clean
with no fingerprints.

61
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,937
We need to find evidence
that Min Ju-yeong did it.

62
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,523
But isn't it strange?

63
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,067
The bullet went through
the scapular artery.

64
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,819
There would've been much blood loss.

65
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,947
On top of that, it took 15 minutes
for the ambulance to arrive

66
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,407
after residents heard the gunshot
and called it in.

67
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,786
Under normal circumstances,
she would've bled out in that time.

68
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,412
According to the paramedics,

69
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,582
she had already received first aid
by the time they arrived.

70
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,753
How's Min Ju-yeong?

71
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,089
He got first aid
at Insung University Hospital

72
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,549
and was admitted as an inpatient.

73
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,175
We'll need to wait for the test results,

74
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,511
but his injuries seemed pretty severe.

75
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,098
Take over the case
from the local precinct.

76
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,517
Keep canvassing the area
and trace Min Ju-yeong's movements.

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,812
And put out an APB for Kim Yeon-ha.

78
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,105
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,357
Multiple facial contusions,

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,652
along with a number of
lacerations and bruises.

81
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,195
Total recovery time, 24 weeks.

82
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,283
This is enough to be charged
with aggravated assault.

83
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,494
What happens now?

84
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,496
The ball is in Min Ju-yeong's court.

85
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,165
What do you mean?

86
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,918
He has a video of Dong-ju assaulting him.

87
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,297
Without appropriate disciplinary actions,

88
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,632
he'll make the video public.

89
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,260
And what does he mean by
"appropriate disciplinary actions"?

90
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,554
He wants Dong-ju relieved of his duties

91
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,182
and the SCIT…

92
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,060
dissolved.

93
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,066
He wants to stop us
from investigating further.

94
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,944
Everything was planned.

95
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:11,241
Everything from stealing the captain's gun
to provoking Dong-ju.

96
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,370
I can cover for a simple gun misplacement,

97
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,497
but not when there has been a casualty.

98
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,792
I don't think you can avoid a demotion.

99
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,671
And just like that,
my lieutenant rank is gone.

100
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,549
What did the commissioner say?

101
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,676
This is a headache for him too.

102
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,969
If that video goes public,

103
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,764
he'll get in trouble
since he created the SCIT.

104
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,059
The nomination is right around the corner.

105
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,687
It seems he wants to
handle this discreetly.

106
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,775
Give it a few days
until the disciplinary hearing.

107
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,863
He has a team dinner tonight, right?

108
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,115
RECRUITMENT & SELECTION NOTICE:
INVESTIGATION DIVISION POSITION

109
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,204
-What are you staring at?
-Hello, sir.

110
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,540
I heard rumors of your team dissolving.

111
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,584
You must feel uneasy.

112
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,087
I mean,
you switched teams to get promoted.

113
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,005
You can't catch a break, can you?

114
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,593
-Are you going home now?
-No, there's a senior officials' dinner.

115
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:15,138
I bet he's going to put on a show tonight.

116
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,098
Who do you mean?

117
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,557
Your captain.

118
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,144
I hear he's bent on begging
and pleading with the commissioner

119
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,438
to save that officer and your team.

120
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,484
Man, I can't believe
how that one officer ruined the team.

121
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,279
Why did he take that kid in anyway?

122
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,489
Man-sik, par terre!

123
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,782
-You got this, sir!
-Par terre.

124
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,534
-Good luck, sir!
-Good luck, sir!

125
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,526
What are you doing here?

126
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,653
What do you think, punk?

127
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm drinking.

128
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,039
You won't be
relieved of your duties for now.

129
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,336
The disciplinary hearing or whatever
will be held in a week.

130
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,421
So make sure to prepare yourself.

131
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,340
They'll take circumstances into account.

132
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,093
The commissioner
is also aware of your situation.

133
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,928
You didn't have to do this!

134
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,389
Don't you raise your voice.

135
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,267
Sit down and stop talking nonsense.

136
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:08,794
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,756
I dragged you and the team into this mess.

138
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,759
I'll just quit.

139
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,263
Don't be ridiculous.

140
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,516
Who said it was your fault?

141
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,562
It's my fault for not having enough power.

142
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,149
I'm supposed to be the captain,
but there's nothing I can do.

143
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,027
So I'm just trying to do whatever I can.

144
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,072
You did nothing wrong.

145
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,825
That bastard.

146
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,201
Had I been in your shoes,

147
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:45,539
I would've beaten the hell out of him
like my life depended on it too.

148
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,501
And what's this talk about quitting?

149
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,627
If you quit,

150
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,630
does that mean
you'll let Min Ju-yeong off the hook?

151
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,715
Jeez, you fool.

152
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,260
You're a boxing champion
and a national team athlete.

153
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,846
But you want to give up
before the match is even over?

154
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,684
I bet Min Ju-yeong
would love to hear all this.

155
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,977
Who said I was giving up?

156
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,147
Exactly, so stop talking nonsense,
all right?

157
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,606
You're a simple kid,

158
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,401
so don't overthink things,
looking all serious.

159
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,361
Hey, I've heard enough crap from you.

160
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,907
Come here and put this on me.
I'm aching all over.

161
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:22,826
Come on.

162
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,338
Jeez, that stings.

163
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,215
It stings!

164
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,262
What's this old handkerchief
you always carry with you?

165
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,763
I can get you a new one.

166
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,848
What?

167
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,810
Hey, this is priceless.

168
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,688
My wife gave this to me

169
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,816
when she was pregnant with Jeong-a.

170
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,904
I won the bronze medal
after she gave me this handkerchief.

171
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,201
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

172
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,626
-He held on!
-He won the bronze medal!

173
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,794
-Jae-gyeong!
-Go Man-sik of South Korea!

174
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:20,425
This is my lucky charm.

175
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,552
I know it doesn't look like it,

176
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,054
but it's mine.

177
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,473
Hey, put more of that on the other side.

178
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,787
I brought your stuff.

179
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,580
See if anything's missing.

180
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,125
Thank you.

181
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,139
Nobody blames you.

182
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,726
So don't make that face.

183
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,022
It makes you look pathetic.

184
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,817
But I ruined everything.

185
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,698
I'm no help at all.

186
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,868
Hey!

188
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,371
Our team hasn't been dissolved yet,
so why are you apologizing?

189
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,790
Seriously.

190
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,600
See you.

191
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,071
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

192
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,365
Things are a mess right now,

193
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,076
but we can't just sit back and do nothing.

194
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,455
But there isn't much
we can do at the moment.

195
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,416
The outcome will be the same
even if we stay put,

196
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,751
so we might as well do something.

197
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,464
But we need a lead to dig into the guy.

198
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,174
Excuse me.

199
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,598
Here's the restored data
from Min Ju-yeong's burner phone

200
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,682
and Kim Yeon-ha's file.

201
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,393
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
that the passport was forged.

202
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,104
In addition to Kim Yeon-ha,

203
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,274
she has several fake identities
of different nationalities.

204
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,740
Excuse me.

205
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,759
Sir, how are you feeling?

206
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,511
Not great.

207
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,183
Would you like me to help you feel better?

208
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,231
Many calls were made to the phone number
registered under Kim Yeon-ha.

209
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,858
They seem pretty close.

210
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,779
Are you here to kill me?

211
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,656
Why would I do that?

212
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,786
From the looks of you,
I think someone else might do the job.

213
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,330
If you die,

214
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,374
things will only get difficult for me.

215
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,127
There are a few other numbers
he often called besides Kim Yeon-ha's.

216
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,962
If you catch the burner phone dealer,

217
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,923
you can identify the people
Min Ju-yeong was in contact with.

218
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,552
Most of the burner phones
are registered to Russians and Chinese.

219
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,931
What's going on? Why is he here?

220
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,267
When did this punk get here?

221
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,603
What are you planning
to trick our naive captain with this time?

222
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,189
Good point.
Why share this all of a sudden?

223
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,524
What are you up to now?

224
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,361
I'm not that bad a person.

225
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,488
I do feel bad about what happened.

226
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,783
Anyway, this is the best I can do to help.

227
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,162
We'll keep an eye on Min Ju-yeong,
so do what you can.

228
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,038
Good luck. Bye.

229
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,921
Senior Officers Shin and Ji,
analyze this data.

230
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,507
Sergeant Kim and I
will find the burner phone dealer.

231
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,467
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,885
What about me?

233
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,554
Hey, what about me?

234
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,973
Wait. What do you want me to do?

235
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,266
Don't do anything.

236
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,851
Just stay put!

237
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,644
-Stay with Ms. Jeong.
-What?

238
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,314
But you told me not to give up.

239
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,734
This is all my fault. Do you really
expect me to stand by like an idiot?

240
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,860
Yeah!

241
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,236
I won't get in trouble again.

242
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,113
I'll only do what you tell me to do.

243
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,156
As if I can trust you.

244
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,824
Let's take him with us.

245
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,536
It's better to keep him with us
than risk him causing trouble.

246
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,248
Unless he's an idiot,
he won't cause any more trouble.

247
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,711
I guess.

248
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,589
Move, punk. Get in the car.

249
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,472
Where will we find
the burner phone dealer?

250
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,556
Don't worry.

251
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,725
I know just the person
who can help us with that.

252
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,029
These are the texts Min Ju-yeong received
right before he was arrested,

253
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,615
but there's no way they were work-related.

254
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,535
"Bonded warehouse 201."

255
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,454
It's a cold storage warehouse
near Chinatown.

256
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,581
It used to be run
by the Golden Bunny Gang,

257
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,333
and the manager was Lee Sang-su.

258
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,043
Lee Sang-su?

259
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,671
Golden Bunny's younger brother,
Silver Bunny?

260
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,839
Yeah.

261
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,758
The warehouse is shut down now,
and Silver Bunny is still on the run.

262
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,470
Kim Yeon-ha's arrival time
was also 4:10 a.m.

263
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,722
She departed from Manila, Philippines.

264
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,019
"Filipino air cargo ETA,
next day at 4:10 a.m."

265
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,439
There's a Russian ship
that arrived at Insung Port at 5 a.m.

266
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,732
It's called the Victory.

267
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,276
It's owned by a shipping company

268
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,069
that smuggled used cars
and drug precursors.

269
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,698
"Russian sea cargo ETA,
next day at 5 a.m."

270
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,034
I wonder what came in.

271
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,873
Let's investigate the bonded warehouses
in the Russian cargo sector.

272
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:25,832
Okay.

273
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,005
Hey, be gentle.
I got new hair transplanted there.

274
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,301
That hurts a bit.

275
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,887
Okay, that's good.

276
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,974
Hey, be careful.

277
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,309
What are you doing?

278
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,479
Damn it.

279
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,732
What do you want now?

280
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,696
Jeez, you scared me.

281
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,702
If the burner phone is registered
under a Russian or Chinese name,

282
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,370
there's only one go-to guy in Insung.

283
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,872
Get off the bus!

284
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,001
Burner phone dealers
usually do business with tour guides.

285
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:10,919
All right, everyone.

286
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,588
They collect everyone's passports,
saying that it's necessary

287
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,466
-for hotel or tourist site reservations.
-Okay, good job.

288
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,343
After they do that,

289
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,512
they take photos of the passports
to get information.

290
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,433
CLEANING SUPPLY CLOSET

291
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,435
What are you doing here?

292
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,228
I told you to stay with the group.

293
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,439
Here, hold onto this.
I can't get a good shot.

294
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,983
No, back up a little.

295
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,401
Who are you?

296
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,862
Who do you think? I'm a cop.

297
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,405
A cop?

298
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:54,796
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,341
Hey, look at this.

300
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,301
You know who these people are, right?

301
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,678
They were in your tour group.

302
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,930
You used their passports
to make burner phones!

303
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,890
I don't know.

304
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,268
All I did was take and send photos
for 10,000 won each.

305
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,229
So tell us what you know.

306
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,522
I just told you everything.

307
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,148
I even gave you my phone.

308
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,650
Who's Daepodong Number One?

309
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,527
The burner phone market's boss.

310
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,655
I don't know his real name.
He just goes by Daepodong.

311
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,743
Where's that bastard?

312
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:26,744
How should I know?

313
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,621
I heard he was wanted by the police,

314
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,832
but I only met him once
when I first started working.

315
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm telling the truth. Hey, that hurts!

316
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,627
No.

317
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,629
That's not him.

318
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,506
No. It's not him.

319
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,758
-Are you really looking?
-I am.

320
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,636
No. Not him.

321
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,554
Okay.

322
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,598
Let's keep at it until we find him.

323
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,725
It's not him.

324
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,101
Not him.

325
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,854
No…

326
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,272
You're not answering.

327
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,275
Are you sleepy?

328
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,445
Next guy, please!

329
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,447
That isn't him.

330
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,699
Open your eyes!

331
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:05,992
Okay!

332
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,704
Sir, wake up.

333
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,289
Morning's here.

334
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,707
It's not him.

335
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,958
We have to find our guy.

336
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,754
Toasted egg sandwiches
are the best in the morning.

337
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,631
-Everyone!
-What?

338
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,509
I thought we could use a hearty breakfast.

339
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,427
Please enjoy.

340
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,766
-Here.
-Thank you.

341
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,726
Here, Dung-ju.

342
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,894
Thank you, sir.

343
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,145
Thank you.

344
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,496
Isn't Dung-ju pushing himself too hard?

345
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,497
It's not him.

346
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,916
-He pulled two all-nighters.
-He can do two more.

347
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,960
-Detective?
-Yes?

348
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,462
I'm too hungry to focus.

349
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,798
Can I have some food before we continue?

350
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,801
-Do you want it?
-Yes.

351
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,845
Thank you.

352
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,529
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,830
Hey, it's this person!

354
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,832
This is him! Daepodong!

355
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,000
Daepodong!

356
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,294
-Are you sure?
-I am. It's Daepodong.

357
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,379
Not Nam Po-dong, the actor?

358
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,548
Not Nam Po-dong! It's Daepodong!

359
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,008
I found you, Daepodong

360
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,553
Don't come after me!

361
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,686
-Calm down and open the door.
-I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

362
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,603
Holy crap!

363
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,814
Don't you know Daepodong Number One?

364
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,440
I can't believe he's only 32 years old.

365
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,526
This guy is Daepodong Number One?

366
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,153
I've never seen him before!

367
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,114
So you've never met the warehouse owner,
and they've been out of business?

368
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,241
No, I have no idea.

369
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,077
-Go, Commissioner!
-Go, Commissioner!

370
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,329
-Go, Commissioner!
-You're so strong, sir!

371
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,460
Have you heard anything
about the Russian mafia around here?

372
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,587
Who are you guys?

373
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,968
Just a second.

374
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,597
I swear I'm not in that business anymore.
I live an honest life!

375
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,848
Okay, fine.

376
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,184
Do you know this person?

377
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,769
No, I don't.

378
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,813
I'd remember him if I had seen that face.

379
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,821
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

380
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,750
If you die,

381
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,627
things will only get difficult for me.

382
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,589
Or do you want to tell me

383
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,133
where I can find that bitch?

384
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,843
What do you say?

385
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,016
If I tell you…

386
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,396
it'll make things difficult for me.

387
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,983
Make the goods, and I'll tell you then.

388
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,453
You really are a bad boy.

389
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,622
Here's your vitamin.

390
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,378
About the lady from the noodle place…

391
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,631
I wonder how she survived.

392
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,509
By all accounts, she should've died.

393
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,846
Can I get you something?

394
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,148
Damn it.

395
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,962
RECENT CALLS

396
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,299
DONG-JU

397
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,281
Don't do that.

398
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,492
People might think
I'm a gang boss or something.

399
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,369
Yes, sir.

400
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,204
Will you be heading home?

401
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,541
No, I want to buy some fruit.

402
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:06,876
WANTED: JANG CHUNG-GI (DAEPODONG)

403
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,470
Find anything?

404
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,598
Man, I'm exhausted.

405
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,643
Oh, dear.

406
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,354
Everyone looks exhausted.

407
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,439
Here, try it.

408
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,324
On your shoulders like this.

409
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,368
-Hey, that feels good.
-Good.

410
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,286
They're starting to loosen up.

411
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,455
Your shoulders will feel better.

412
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,708
LEE JONG-HUN

413
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,169
Hey, what is it?

414
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,259
Hey!

415
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,263
What the hell are you doing here?

416
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,390
Stop it.

417
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,850
What a rude way to greet a visitor.

418
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,105
She's badly injured.

419
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,650
I guess she can't have these.

420
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,278
The two of you should enjoy them instead.

421
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,238
Are you kidding me?

422
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,409
I brought them as a gesture of goodwill.

423
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,371
You shot a person,
and you speak of goodwill?

424
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,331
You need another beating?

425
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,541
There you go again.

426
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,211
Accusing me without evidence or witnesses.

427
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:33,963
Don't you agree?

428
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:36,799
Or maybe…

429
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,760
that lady saw me.

430
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,012
I see you're injured.

431
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,933
It happens
when you hold a handgun incorrectly.

432
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,520
Especially for someone inexperienced,
just like yourself.

433
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,106
You got me.

434
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,859
But does this count as evidence?

435
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,736
If she wakes, tell her this.

436
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,656
Although it's unlikely
that she saw her shooter,

437
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,825
even if she did,

438
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,453
she should stay quiet.

439
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,664
If not, who knows what might happen?

440
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,251
Do whatever you want.

441
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,045
I'm going to have you locked up,
no matter what.

442
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,132
You scumbag asshole.

443
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,469
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

444
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,679
Don't even dream about it.

445
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,516
The law, rules, fair play…

446
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,770
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

447
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,983
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

448
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,238
Don't you get it?

449
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,240
You bastard.

450
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,867
I said stop it.

451
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,244
You should stop as well and go.

452
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,082
When you have time, please teach me…

453
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,044
how to shoot a gun.

454
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,215
I'd like to make sure
to hit my mark next time.

455
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,057
Goddammit!

456
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,065
Excuse me.

457
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,733
You forgot to take this.

458
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,703
What a shame.

459
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,372
It looks like nobody saw that.

460
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,875
Here. Get your vitamins in.

461
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,210
It'll help with your recovery.

462
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,680
What is it?

463
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,722
I just like you.

464
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,101
-What do you mean?
-How can I not like someone so cool?

465
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,936
It's your fault.

466
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:57,856
Stop staring.

467
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,237
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju?

468
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,324
Can I have a word with you?

469
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,959
If you keep this up,
the bones won't heal properly,

470
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,460
and it'll leave your hand stuck like this.

471
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,671
Would you be able to use it properly then?

472
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,756
Why would you say that, Doctor?

473
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,341
I'm telling the truth.

474
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,968
You're not one to listen, are you?

475
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,850
Since you're here, let's do an MRI scan.

476
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,935
A head MRI.

477
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,741
What did the doctor say?

478
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,492
What?

479
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,663
Oh, nothing.

480
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,751
He said my hand
could end up looking like this,

481
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,669
so I should be careful.

482
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,129
What?

483
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,756
Seriously?

484
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:06,800
That was it?

485
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,136
I know, right?

486
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,471
He's a funny guy.

487
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,689
There he is. It's Daepodong.

488
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,901
You should go to Cheongpo-dong.

489
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,945
From what I've heard,
he shows up there often.

490
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,574
-Daepodong?
-Yes?

491
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:34,536
Oh, no!

492
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,206
Where are you going?

493
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,507
What are you doing? What's wrong?

494
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,550
It's nothing. Let's go.

495
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,355
Captain, I found them.

496
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,692
Even the records of people
who called Min Ju-yeong's burner phone.

497
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,612
You know Min Ju-yeong,
the customs officer, right?

498
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:09,530
I can't say.

499
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,990
I don't really know any civil servants.

500
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,660
And what kind of a civil servant in Korea

501
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,829
uses a burner phone?

502
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,330
There's a bastard who does.

503
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,332
Let's get your wheels turning.

504
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,962
Okay, then.

505
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:28,006
Who did you sell those burner phones to?

506
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,384
If I tell you, I'll die.

507
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,468
Oh, I see.

508
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:34,722
And who'd come after you?

509
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,601
Okay, I'll tell you!

510
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,228
Just calm down.

511
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,814
Every week,

512
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,151
some Korean Chinese guys
come and buy them in bulk.

513
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,610
-Korean Chinese?
-Yes.

514
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,362
Have you heard of Baek?

515
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,031
Call him up. I want to see him.

516
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,075
You want me to call?

517
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,118
Yeah.

518
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,496
They're really scary people.

519
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,999
You're just going to see his face, right?

520
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,250
Worry about yourself.

521
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,803
What the heck? Let me go!

522
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,737
Our Father, who art in heaven,

523
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,655
Hallowed be thy name.

524
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,783
Thy kingdom come,

525
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,701
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.

526
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,912
I'm sorry, sir!

527
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,750
I didn't mean to snitch,

528
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,503
but I had to because of the cops.

529
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:52,674
If I'd known it was connected to you,
I wouldn't have said anything.

530
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,053
I'll stay out of sight and live quietly.

531
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,723
And lead us not into temptation,

532
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,683
but deliver us from evil.

533
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,693
Through the blood of the cross,
grant us forgiveness.

534
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,619
It's been abandoned for a while.

535
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,162
Will we find any traces of them?

536
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,915
If we don't find anything here,

537
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,376
we'll search the port warehouse
in Gyosa-dong.

538
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,961
-Let's go.
-Okay.

539
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,135
You're driving?

540
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,846
Yes. Why?

541
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,853
Hold on a second.

542
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,604
Is it that car?

543
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,246
This is Senior Officer Shin Jae-hong
of the SCIT.

544
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,291
Please run the plate number 25J 8405.

545
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,710
Thank you.

546
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,379
It's unregistered.

547
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,138
Step on it.

548
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,810
I think they're on to us. Who are they?

549
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,770
We'll know when we catch them.
Hold on tight.

550
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,838
He has a gun!

551
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,049
Duck!

552
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,636
He shot at us!

553
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,353
Are you okay?

554
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,188
Those bastards.

555
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,615
Look at this.

556
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,162
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

557
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,249
He's coming this way.

558
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,846
He united Korean Chinese gangs
from the three Northeastern Provinces

559
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,306
to form the Northeastern Syndicate

560
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,935
and took over Chinatown,
which used to be Golden Bunny's territory.

561
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,520
Introducing…

562
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,355
Baek Seok-chun, also known as Baek.

563
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,238
My brother will kill you.

564
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,074
Open wide. It'll be over soon.

565
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:09,162
The rental warehouse was run by the mafia
operating in the Russian Far East

566
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,872
including Sakhalin and Khabarovsk.

567
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,126
It looks like they came to Korea
on a ship recently.

568
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,462
We have no intel
on the boss's description or identity.

569
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,175
My mother's homeland.

570
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,264
The one who controls the drug supply
across Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia

571
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,598
is Drug Monster, also known as Drugmon.

572
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,811
She came to Korea
under the false identity of Kim Yeon-ha,

573
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,980
and she's wanted by Interpol
and the police agency.

574
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,776
Then there's Oh Jong-gu,
the CEO of J9 Security.

575
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,242
And the person at the center of it all

576
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,995
is the Grade 7 customs officer,

577
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,372
Min Ju-yeong.

578
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:58,211
They're all expanding their profits
through smuggling.

579
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,840
Gangs, drugs, smuggling, and mafias.

580
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,675
It's a cartel of evil.

581
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,470
This is what we've figured out so far.

582
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,888
If we look into the suborganizations,

583
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,974
we'll likely find
most of the criminal groups in Insung.

584
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,851
This is intense.

585
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:14,936
Can we handle this case?

586
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,231
We'll need at least
a few months to investigate.

587
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,108
Will our team still be around by then?

588
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,777
He probably has the commissioner
in his pocket too.

589
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,570
We can't exactly investigate openly.

590
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,990
Cops shouldn't be worried about authority
when catching bad guys.

591
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,951
Bad guys need to get arrested.

592
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,411
-Hello, Commissioner!
-Hello, sir!

593
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,413
-Were you on night duty?
-Jae-hong!

594
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,005
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir.

595
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,967
What were you doing?

596
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,805
We were reflecting on
our poor behavior, sir.

597
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,723
That's what we've been doing, right?

598
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,064
I was working out, sir.

599
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,035
You sure do look like a troublemaker.

600
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,871
You never do as you're told, do you?

601
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,710
-Landscape mode.
-Portrait is the trend, sir.

602
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:24,089
He's been looking for a way to recover
his dropping social media views.

603
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,343
By the way, it appears that the SCIT

604
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,055
will be dissolved within a week.

605
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,480
He'll be helping out
instead of Golden Bunny from now on.

606
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,565
Introduce yourselves.

607
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,235
Yes, sir.

608
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,321
I'm Oh Jong-gu.

609
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,783
I run a small security firm
and a logistics company.

610
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,369
And I was…

611
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,414
a heavyweight boxing champion.

612
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:01,835
Take a seat.

613
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:03,753
Yes, sir.

614
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,011
By the way,

615
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,722
did you find the bastards
who stole my Candy precursors?

616
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,807
There were more than just a couple.

617
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:19,769
The mayor's son got hooked on Candy
and crossed the line.

618
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,730
The remaining precursors
will be collected soon.

619
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,315
Hey, Mr. Min.

620
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,276
Why is everything a mess?

621
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,862
The bunny bastard is in jail,

622
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,323
and the bribed mayor's son
is making a shitshow.

623
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,493
And the cops are swarming in like flies
because of that shitshow.

624
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,163
At this rate,
this place may be left unfinished as is.

625
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:39,623
That won't happen.

626
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,168
This is our starting point.

627
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,838
It can't fall apart already.

628
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:48,798
Can you swear to God on that?

629
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,635
I want my trust in partners
to be bulletproof.

630
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,639
My mother told me
not to trust others so easily.

631
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,517
I swear.

632
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,061
Is this good enough?

633
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:05,982
You…

634
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,319
shouldn't trust me.

635
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,866
Don't trust me. Trust money.

636
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,664
Trust the unimaginable amount of money
that will fall into your laps.

637
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,086
"Though thy beginning was small…

638
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,424
yet thy latter end
should greatly increase."

639
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,893
-Captain, can I--
-Go home.

640
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,192
So do we…

641
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,195
just sit back and do nothing?

642
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,406
I wish we could do something.

643
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,745
What's going to happen now?

644
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,956
Say something!

645
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,584
Do you even need to ask?

646
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,754
This is it for us.

647
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,489
The team will get dissolved.

648
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,742
We'll all face disciplinary action.

649
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,203
Then we'll return
to our respective positions.

650
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,458
We will now begin the disciplinary hearing

651
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,793
regarding the dismissal
of Officer Yoon Dong-ju.

652
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,087
Anything to say before we begin?

653
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,469
Dung-ju's disciplinary hearing
probably started.

654
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,222
I hope he's doing okay in there.

655
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:02,974
He'll be lucky if he only gets suspended.

656
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,567
Officer Yoon Dong-ju?

657
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,446
That's how it'll end.

658
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,575
The bad guys will go on living
without a care,

659
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,120
while the dead are left with injustice.

660
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,540
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

661
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,001
Don't even dream about it.

662
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,963
The law, rules, fair play…

663
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:37,008
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

664
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:40,220
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

665
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,268
On behalf of all the athletes,

666
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,687
I hereby pledge

667
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,233
to compete with honor
and a true spirit of sportsmanship,

668
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,945
respecting and abiding by the rules.

669
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:01,950
Athletes' representative, Yoon Dong-ju.

670
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,996
Officer Yoon Dong-ju, please sit--

671
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,623
Officer Yoon!

672
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,881
What?

673
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,969
Then where the heck is he right now?

674
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,197
How can I--

675
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,744
We need to talk.

676
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,086
His last visit to the hospital
was three days ago.

677
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,548
If he's not in the on-call room
or at the hospital, then where is he?

678
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,508
We haven't been able to reach him
for two days now.

679
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:03,678
Are you sure Dong-ju
last met with Oh Jong-gu?

680
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,181
Yes, I checked with the female bookkeeper.

681
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,391
We can't reach Oh Jong-gu either.

682
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,604
She says he's on a business trip,
but she doesn't know where he is.

683
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,355
Do you think…

684
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,942
Dung-ju got himself into big trouble?

685
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,737
I don't know, damn it!

686
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:24,491
What about Min Ju-yeong?

687
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,285
He took a sick leave and went on vacation
after getting discharged,

688
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,953
but we can't locate him.

689
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,748
Where the hell is Dung-ju holed up?

690
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,666
I'll go and check out

691
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,711
a gym in Dongho-dong
where Dung-ju used to go.

692
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,881
In any case, once we locate
Oh Jong-gu and Min Ju-yeong…

693
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,133
-What the heck?
-What is it?

694
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,259
It's moving.

695
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,307
You scared me, you little bastard!

696
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,518
What are you doing there? Come out!

697
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,231
For crying out loud, you idiot!

698
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,196
What happened to your face? Let me see.

699
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,490
Let me see.

700
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,747
You got into trouble again, didn't you?

701
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:17,168
I spent the weekend
going around looking for you!

702
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,421
I didn't get into trouble.

703
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,924
I just thought I should do something.

704
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,636
So you went to Oh Jong-gu
to settle things once and for all?

705
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,680
To get a confession from him?

706
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,516
I can't believe you, Dung-ju.

707
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,520
You little brat!

708
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,315
You couldn't help yourself
and had to get into a fight, didn't you?

709
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:42,819
Why can't you see
that this accomplishes nothing?

710
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,530
Man, this is frustrating!

711
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:00,837
Why are you following me?

712
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,755
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

713
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,431
Here.

714
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,647
I don't have anywhere to go.

715
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,109
Can I stay with you?

716
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:26,988
Are you always like this?

717
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,073
What?

718
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,743
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

719
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,663
You think it's okay to ignore the problem
and laugh things off, right?

720
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:38,958
Just go.

721
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:42,795
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

722
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,285
RICE PORRIDGE

723
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,041
This pitiful act doesn't suit you.

724
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,463
Where on earth are you staying, you punk?

725
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,675
Dung-ju looked pretty bad.

726
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,636
Do you think the other person
got hurt badly too?

727
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:53,950
What do you mean?

728
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,662
The commissioner decided
to put the SCIT's dissolution on hold.

729
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,288
Your team won't face
disciplinary action either.

730
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,670
Wait a minute.

731
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,715
He was so set on dissolving the SCIT.
What changed his mind?

732
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,384
-Didn't Yoon Dong-ju tell you?
-Tell me what?

733
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,844
It seems that

734
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,222
he met with Min Ju-yeong
and settled things.

735
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,975
Settle what?

736
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,645
This is interesting.

737
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,567
So you're willing to take
as many hits as you've given

738
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,778
as long as I leave the SCIT alone?

739
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,321
That's right.

740
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,532
Just get rid of me.

741
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,785
A man shouldn't be so petty
and drag other people into things.

742
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,581
Our problem should be resolved between us.

743
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,294
You're here to apologize,
yet you seem so brazen.

744
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:52,884
All right.

745
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,137
We're friends. A friend can do that much.

746
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,433
But we're in different weight classes,

747
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,810
so we should balance the scales.

748
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:06,814
If you're still standing
after getting beaten up…

749
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:09,942
I'll think about what to do.

750
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,574
Who does he think he is, Jesus?

751
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:17,992
Why take on all the burden?

752
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,329
Are you always like this?

753
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,415
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

754
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,167
Just go.

755
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,377
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

756
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,216
He hasn't come
to the on-call room in days.

757
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,801
Where in the world is he?

758
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,891
Where's the gym Dong-ju used to go to?

759
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:45,061
It's called Victory Gym in Dongho-dong.

760
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,521
-Thank you.
-But…

761
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,232
It's Victory Gym in Dongho-dong!

762
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,692
VICTORY GYM

763
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,866
Excuse me, is Yoon Dong-ju here?

764
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:59,951
I don't know.

765
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,995
STEAMED BUN

766
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,149
DUNG-JU

767
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,744
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME,
BUT ANSWER YOUR PHONE

768
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:25,870
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE DEAD

769
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,166
TEXT FROM STEAMED BUN
MISSED CALL FROM STEAMED BUN

770
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,890
VICTORY GYM

771
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,317
Have you experienced
any discomfort lately?

772
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,736
Anything like hand tremors
or blurry vision?

773
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,531
Maybe sudden moments of dizziness?

774
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,325
Why do you ask?

775
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,328
The repeated impacts sustained
during your athletic career

776
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,122
may have caused brain damage.

777
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,332
They call it becoming punch-drunk.

778
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,376
You might be okay right now,

779
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,169
but the symptoms can get worse.

780
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,588
I recommend an in-depth examination.

781
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,221
Just getting home?

782
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,019
-I don't see him around at all.
-Excuse me?

783
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:16,397
The guy who followed you around
like a mutt.

784
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,565
Did you two fight?

785
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,654
What's wrong with him?

786
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,239
They say he has a cold.

787
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,700
He got a shot this afternoon,
but he's still listless.

788
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:32,288
My goodness, why is this mutt
making me worry so much?

789
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,748
He won't eat either.

790
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,960
-Can I?
-Yeah.

791
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,628
Go ahead.

792
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,506
Dung-ju, have some sausage.

793
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,676
Goodness, he's eating it.

794
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,386
He's eating.

795
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,597
Are you eating it
because the sweet lady gave it to you?

796
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,015
Goodness.

797
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:53,225
Do you feel better now?

798
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,237
STEAMED BUN

799
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:14,872
DUNG-JU

800
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,832
WHERE ARE YOU? DID YOU EAT? ARE YOU SICK?

801
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:19,752
I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING TO YOU

802
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,090
CONTACT ME OR YOU'LL REALLY REGRET IT

803
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,262
Still can't get in touch with Dong-ju?

804
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:32,765
No.

805
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,976
The little punk
is driving me absolutely crazy.

806
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,078
DUNG-JU

807
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,711
What kind of champion gets beaten up?

808
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:46,964
How humiliating.

809
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,386
I couldn't think of a way
to beat Min Ju-yeong,

810
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,848
no matter how hard I racked my brains.

811
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:35,387
I don't have anything or any influence.

812
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,016
But then I thought it over and realized…

813
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,770
I know how to take hits.

814
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,023
I'm really good at taking hits.

815
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,407
So I thought that was the only way…

816
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,495
I could protect us.

817
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,751
That's why I did it. I'm sorry.

818
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:07,253
I'll leave now.

819
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,548
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

820
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,306
Good job.

821
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:23,978
So is that it?

822
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,729
Is that what you want to do?

823
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,066
Do you want to give up now?

824
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,152
So?

825
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,737
Should we stop?

826
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,158
No.

827
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,294
No.

828
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,381
I won't give up.

829
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,341
Why would I?

830
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,352
Lying on the floor

831
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,604
isn't humiliating.

832
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,733
That's just how life is.

833
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,736
You push through it,

834
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,405
enduring it with gritted teeth.

835
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:20,784
If you can hold on and stay down
without getting turned over,

836
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,330
you can get back up and fight again.

837
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:40,721
It doesn't matter
how many times you fall…

838
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,350
as long as you get back up.

839
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,022
The fight isn't over.

840
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,071
There are still more rounds to go.

841
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,771
-They say everything has its purpose.
-What are you doing? Stop being gross.

842
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:15,774
Why are you leaving
that little mutt of a cop alone?

843
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,694
-Where are the rest of the precursors?
-He only heard that there was a delay

844
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,404
due to customs clearance procedures.

845
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,864
This one's a bit too much.

846
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,699
It is, isn't it?

847
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,034
-If there are red fire ants…
-This is our chance.

848
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,036
You can stay at my place.

849
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,582
Breath. Tremors. Wind.

850
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,293
You take everything into account.

851
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,628
Let's begin.

852
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:37,921
There are days…

853
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,137
that feel like a stray bullet.
