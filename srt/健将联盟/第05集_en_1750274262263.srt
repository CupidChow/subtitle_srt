1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,100
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,270
Pass the ball!

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,660
Left foot.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,670
Time seemed to slow to a stop.

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,250
Everything was vivid and sharp.

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,600
I could see every puff of breath
and every bead of sweat on the glove.

8
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,230
However…

9
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,440
I couldn't avoid that punch.

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,110
The sudden blow came
when I was unprepared.

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,200
By the time I saw it,

12
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,450
it was already too late.

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,250
Hey, Yun Dong-ju. Are you okay?

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,870
Yun Dong-ju.

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,420
Some things can't be avoided.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,540
Are you okay?

17
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,680
My body goes limp,

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,970
and I can't lift a single finger.

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,970
Everything seems hazy and far away

20
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,400
as if I were drunk.

21
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
Yun Dong-ju.

22
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,980
Yun Dong-ju!

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,900
Of course.

24
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,450
I'm fine.

25
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,410
That's when love

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,420
finds you.

27
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,260
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,190
Why is that bastard just looking around?

29
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,150
You punk.

30
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,980
Stop grumbling.

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,980
Why won't you do as I say
and return to the hospital?

32
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,480
Instead, you're here grumbling.

33
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,410
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

34
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,750
At around 2:10 a.m. on the 13th,

35
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,920
Mr. Lee Jin-su
was on his way home after work

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,420
when he was killed
in a hit-and-run accident.

37
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,180
A week later,
at around 3 a.m. on the 20th,

38
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,180
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il, who stepped forward
as the hit-and-run driver…

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,520
I'M SORRY
I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,020
…committed suicide
in the detention center.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,190
Five days later,
at around 5:30 a.m. on the 25th,

42
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,280
vehicle smuggler Kim Deok-chul
of the Monkey Gang was murdered.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,280
What do these cases have to do with me?

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,530
That bastard.

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,620
As for Kim Deok-chul of the Monkey Gang,

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,330
he smuggled vehicles,
illegal weapons, and drugs

47
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,830
through Russia and the Philippines.

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,250
He even forged documents
to get the goods through customs.

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,630
But it's nearly impossible to do this
without help from an insider.

50
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,130
You're aware of this, right?
Yes.

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,350
The person who handled these duties
was Mr. Lee Jin-su.

52
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,680
And the person who handled them before…

53
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,100
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

54
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,020
…was you, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

56
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,540
We found the car that hit Mr. Lee Jin-su,

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,380
and it's being processed as evidence
by the NFS.

58
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,840
Don't you wonder whose DNA
they will be recovered from it?

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,970
Let's wait and see…

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,390
what evidence they find.

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,660
I guess you weren't hurt badly,

62
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,370
seeing how you haven't been admitted.

63
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,870
I stuck around to see you get locked up.

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,620
I'll get a detailed medical certificate,
so be prepared.

65
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,830
It's over for you.

66
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,000
Judging by how you bulldozed your way
to make the arrest,

67
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,460
you don't take your job seriously.

68
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,590
Who, me?

69
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,010
I'll have you know

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,140
that I risk my life doing what I do.

71
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,810
You got it wrong.

72
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,020
Your life will be on the line
from this moment onward.

73
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,940
Starting now.

74
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,710
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

75
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,590
Why do you keep checking the time?

76
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,930
It's a habit.

77
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,970
I need to monitor
arrival and departure times for work.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,810
You must be expecting a shipment today.

79
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,090
That bastard is going to stall
until it blows over.

80
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,390
He won't say a word.
Right.

81
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,100
At this rate,
we won't have enough to request a warrant.

82
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,480
No, we still have time.

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,100
Aren't the NFS results out?

84
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,600
I'll check again, sir.

85
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,230
We just need to beat him up!

86
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,900
We can't reason with him.
Right.

87
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,070
Why do you keep saying "right"?

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
Excuse me.

89
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,040
Who are those guys?

90
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,630
Why are you taking that bastard?
Calm down, Dong-ju!

91
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,920
What's the reason?
Stop!

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
Will you stay still?
You keep overreacting.

93
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,800
Are you serious? I can't stay still!

94
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,010
Stop it!
It doesn't make any sense!

95
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,720
I'll only let you go if you stop.

96
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,310
Just don't, okay?

97
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,310
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,940
Mr. Min is facing smuggling charges,

99
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,990
so Insung Customs handed the case
over to the prosecution.

100
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,360
As you probably know,
the Customs Act gives us the precedence.

101
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,200
Here's the official note.

102
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,410
I'm too old to read the fine print.

103
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,410
Hey.

104
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,170
What is it?

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,630
What do you want to say?

106
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,340
A busy prosecutor like you wouldn't have
come all the way here for a mere criminal.

107
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,430
At dawn, no less?

108
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,840
Seok-hyeon, I know you don't like me.

109
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,180
But this isn't right.
Hey.

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,140
I have better things to do.
Do you think I want to be here?

111
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,770
Civil servants have no choice
but to follow orders.

112
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,730
I've already had enough as is.
Don't pile on.

113
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,820
Sir, the senior superintendent
would like to see you.

114
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,570
Yes, of course.

115
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
Move.

116
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,830
Just a moment, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

117
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,090
I just have one question.

118
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,680
Where did you get that watch?

119
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,980
It was a gift.

120
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
From whom?

121
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,980
Why do you ask?

122
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,980
As far as I know,

123
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,440
that watch isn't sold in Korea.

124
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,570
Is that so?

125
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,660
I suppose that's possible

126
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
since I got it from a Russian friend.

127
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,030
His name is…

128
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,540
It's been so long
that I don't remember it.

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,380
It just so happens

130
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,710
those alleged to be in collusion with you,
such as Golden Bunny Gang's Lee Sang-gon

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,760
and Mr. Oh Jong-gu of J9 Security,
both wear the same watch.

132
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,800
And the same watch was found
at the scene of Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's death.

133
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,850
Maybe we have similar tastes.

134
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,430
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

135
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,350
You think so?

136
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,980
I don't think it's a coincidence.

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,860
That female cop…

138
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,940
You were on TV often.

139
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,160
The famous national team shooter.

140
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,410
I didn't expect to meet
the Shooting Fairy here.

141
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,790
May I ask what your name is?

142
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,540
Senior Officer Ji Han-na.

143
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,790
You seem quite interested in watches,
Senior Officer Ji.

144
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,710
Do you want to see for yourself…

145
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,090
if it's the same one?

146
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,360
What are you doing? Take him away already.

147
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,070
I'd like an autograph
the next time we meet.

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
What are you doing?

149
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,670
Don't go near him.

150
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,090
Hey!
Let go of me!

151
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,760
I said let go, damn it!

152
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,350
Hey, you punk!
Will you beat up a prosecutor too?

153
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,140
I can't just sit back and watch, can I?

154
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,930
Who the hell cares if he's a prosecutor?

155
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,560
Damn it, stop making a scene.
Hey!

156
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,770
Hey, I swear I'll throw your ass in jail!

157
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,730
Try and run if you can!

158
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,280
I'll chase you to the ends of…

159
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,820
Hey.

160
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,660
What's wrong?

161
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,250
What's going on?

162
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,060
You said the same thing before,
but I didn't get a chance to respond.

163
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,520
Do whatever you can. I look forward to it.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,610
You bastard.

165
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,410
Are you okay?

166
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,580
You should take care of your health first.
I suggest you go see a doctor.

167
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,290
Don't get too worked up.

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Damn you.

169
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,090
That's enough. Hey, give me a hand.

170
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,340
Let's go.
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,820
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,400
I just escorted him out.

173
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,580
This is so beneath me.

175
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,330
I can't believe
I'm escorting a petty criminal.

176
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,450
Hey.

177
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,080
Who the hell are you?

178
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,380
Why is the departmental chief prosecutor
stepping in like this?

179
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,550
Are you related to him?

180
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,590
No.

181
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
A friend from school?

182
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,680
No.

183
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Then who are you?

184
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,680
A civil servant…

185
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,100
just like you.

186
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,040
I said I'm fine.

187
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,250
I hope you learned your lesson
for leaving without permission.

188
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,840
I'm sorry, Doctor.

189
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
All right, then.

190
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,510
Don't worry too much.
He just has a slight concussion.

191
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,680
We'll need to run some more tests,

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,560
but he'll be okay
after a few days of rest.

193
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Who's the next patient?

194
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,720
I'll take you to the examination room.

195
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,690
You idiot.
You never listen and cause trouble.

196
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,020
Now look at you.

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,150
Stay right here and rest up
until you recover.

198
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,400
What about that bastard?

199
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,190
How will you catch him without me?
Easily.

200
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,610
Stop talking and go get examined.

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,320
Let's get you to the examination room.

202
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,330
Let's go.

203
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,210
Shouldn't we contact his family?

204
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,420
He doesn't have any family.
He's all alone.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,010
AN DAE-YONG

206
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Are you calling to irritate me again?

207
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,140
What is it?

208
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,640
Okay, got it.

209
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,980
I need to get back to the agency.

210
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,770
Something happened.

211
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,150
Senior Officer Ji, take care of Dong-ju.

212
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,570
Me?

213
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,700
Yeah.

214
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,200
He doesn't listen to others,
but he listens to you.

215
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,780
Please watch him.
Thanks.

216
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,790
No worries.

217
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,960
What is it? What's going on?

218
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,420
Out with it.

219
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,590
Understood.

220
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Captain.

221
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,640
The NFS just called.

222
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,680
The prosecution took
all the related records,

223
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,520
including the car we seized.

224
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,230
Now that I'm in your shoes,
I understand how you must've felt.

225
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,480
What's the matter with you?
Don't be weird.

226
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,940
The prosecution took everything.

227
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,780
All the cases
remotely connected to that civil servant.

228
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,700
Lee Jin-su's hit-and-run,
Golden Bunny, Monkey, and everything.

229
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,580
Who the hell is that bastard,
Min Ju-yeong?

230
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,130
That's what I'd like to know.

231
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,260
May I ask what your name is?

232
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,550
Senior Officer Ji Han-na.

233
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,820
BANG

234
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,700
Make sure we have enough
for all the athletes.

235
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,290
POWER UP WITH A BANG STEAMED BUN!

236
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,210
If the quantity checks out,
bring some boxes out.

237
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,290
Yes, sir.

238
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,670
She's up.
You've got this!

239
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,220
Let's go, Ji Han-na!
Good luck!

240
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,390
Over here, Ms. Ji.
Please look over here.

241
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,890
What the hell are they doing?

242
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,930
Good luck, Ji Han-na!
You've got this!

243
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,770
I'm going to lose it.

244
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Look over here, please!

245
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,610
Over here, please.

246
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,110
I plan on eating well as usual

247
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,320
and keeping my condition in check
during training.

248
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,030
How are you preparing for São Paulo?

249
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,360
Are you confident
in winning the gold this time too?

250
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,830
Achoo.

251
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,500
It's so cold.

252
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,790
Is anyone there?

253
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,010
Bang Steamed Buns
are the best winter snack.

254
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,930
Make sure to have one!

255
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,760
Gosh, look who's a star now.

256
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,810
We have to train late at night
for her to film those lame commercials.

257
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,970
Bang bang.

258
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
What can we do?

259
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,650
The National Fairy doesn't have time.
That's Ji Han-na for you.

260
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,360
It's all about her.

261
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,860
By the way, have you heard?

262
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,280
Ji Han-na and Kim Jong-hyeon broke up.

263
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,070
Why?
Do you have to ask? Isn't it obvious?

264
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,360
Who would want to
put up with her attitude?

265
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,120
Bang bang!
Stop it. It's so corny.

266
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,040
Why would they throw these away?

267
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,000
Steamed Bun will be sad if she sees this.

268
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,460
You guys are so mean.

269
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,600
The steamed bun is so good.
Thanks, Han-na!

270
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,900
I'm so hungry.

271
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,610
They're just jealous.

272
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,240
Winning one gold medal is hard enough,
but you make it look really easy.

273
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,530
That got under their skin.

274
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,120
How should I say this?

275
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
It's the burden all geniuses must bear,

276
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,290
being surrounded
by the envious and the jealous.

277
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,040
Yeah, that's it.
I know the feeling well too.

278
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,540
By the way, I'm taking all of this.

279
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,380
Judo athlete Min-cheol said

280
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,920
he won the qualifiers
after finding a gold medal sticker,

281
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,880
so I want that good luck too.

282
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,640
You lost again, didn't you?

283
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,810
Stop believing in such nonsense.
No wonder you're not improving.

284
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,930
Hey, I'm the Asia boxing champion.

285
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,310
I've just been unlucky lately.

286
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,690
Your haters are nothing

287
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,400
compared to the huge crowd of people
who support you!

288
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,570
I like you too!

289
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,470
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU, MS. JI
FROM TASTY STEAMED BUN

290
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,010
BANG STEAMED BUN

291
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,920
GOLD MEDALIST HAN-NA
BANG

292
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,130
BOXER YUN LOSES
IN TODAY'S SÃO PAOLO QUALIFIER

293
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,210
NEXT WEEK'S FINAL QUALIFIER
IS HIS LAST CHANCE

294
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,040
Why did he stick this here?

295
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,420
Give it to me.
No. You gave it to me, so it's mine.

296
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,800
Give it back.
No, you can't just take it back.

297
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,800
Give it to me.
It's become a rare item too.

298
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,590
Give it to me!
No, I don't want to!

299
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,500
Get up, please.

300
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,290
Return to your bed, please.

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,630
Darn it, it tore a bit.

302
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,050
Lie down, please.

303
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,030
You're here.
Hey.

304
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,290
This will sting a bit.
Hold on a second!

305
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,460
Just a little sting.
No, please wait.

306
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,870
Yun Dong-ju seems to be okay now.

307
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,550
I'm here to tell you something, Han-na.

308
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,260
Thanks.

309
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,180
So…

310
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,020
About earlier today…

311
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,900
It's okay.

312
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,030
The thing is…

313
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,160
I think Min Ju-yeong's people
have been watching you

314
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,580
and got your information from the agency.

315
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,000
Within the agency?

316
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,370
Yeah.

317
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,500
I have a feeling they think you read
Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

318
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,380
Do you remember what they were about?

319
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,890
They're just keeping an eye on you for now
because they don't know how much you know.

320
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,520
But we don't know how they'll react
when we get closer to the truth.

321
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,690
Since this could get dangerous,

322
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,060
you should consider
taking on a different case.

323
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,570
So…

324
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,200
Jong-hyeon.

325
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,660
Is this why you joined the team?

326
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,910
Don't try to make me hide behind you.

327
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,120
We broke up, remember?

328
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,590
I don't want to do that.

329
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,550
Also…

330
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,390
isn't that for the better?

331
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,100
What do you mean?

332
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,640
I can be the bait.

333
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,730
Hello, sir.
Hello.

334
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,440
I brought the civil servant
from the police agency.

335
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,700
What should I do with him?

336
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,870
Yes, Mayor.

337
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,090
Yes, noted.

338
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,300
Mr. Jang, let this bastard go.

339
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,020
You're free to go.

340
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,950
Would you look at this bastard?

341
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,450
The police agency,
the prosecutors' office…

342
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,870
He acts like he owns these places.

343
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,370
Apparently, the prosecution acknowledges
his charge of aiding in smuggling

344
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,380
but considers it trivial,
so he was suspended from indictment.

345
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,920
Insung Customs only gave him

346
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,630
a reappointment order
and a three-month pay reduction.

347
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,550
Who exactly is this bastard?

348
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,350
Comb through Min Ju-yeong's records
we have gathered so far.

349
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,980
Look into his family, his hometown,

350
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,190
his alma maters,
and anyone related to his job.

351
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,690
Go as far as finding out
the underwear he wears.

352
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,270
There's definitely someone backing him.

353
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,030
SURVEILLANCE DIVISION
CUSTOMS OFFICER MIN JU-YEONG

354
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,330
He's a Grade 7 customs officer
at Insung Customs' Surveillance Division.

355
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,740
I see he attended Hanguk University.

356
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,040
Yes. He got in on a scholarship,

357
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,460
but he dropped out after a semester.
Why?

358
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,290
He took time off before applying
for a customs officer position,

359
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,800
so it was likely due to tuition.

360
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,420
He doesn't keep in touch
with any former classmates,

361
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,090
and while he is well-reputed
at his workplace,

362
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,430
he doesn't have a close colleague
for some reason.

363
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,520
Ms. Kim Yu-na from the same division
is something of his acquaintance,

364
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,020
and that's about it.

365
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,690
He's from Insung.

366
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,530
He lost his family to an accident
when he was a child

367
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,280
and was raised by his uncle.

368
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,030
This means he has no friends
or close relatives.

369
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,950
Any assets?

370
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,990
He has a house
with a 120 million won deposit,

371
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,830
56 million won in the bank,

372
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,660
and a compact car. That's all.

373
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,250
INSUNG CITY GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY
CONSTRUCTION SITE

374
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,680
He has monitored this company
since joining the Korea Customs Service.

375
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,810
Some of the vehicles
smuggled by the Monkey Gang

376
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,390
haven't been located.

377
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,270
When compared to their ledger,
about 30 vehicles are missing.

378
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,520
And all of them are foreign luxury cars.

379
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,010
Daddy, cheer up

380
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,590
We're here for you

381
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,160
I'm getting unwanted attention.

382
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,910
Please tell our Russian guest
to take care of our client.

383
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,640
There's buzzing in the ears.

384
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,720
Some dizziness and nausea too.

385
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,100
Open wide.

386
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,730
Is medication being taken?

387
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,230
Maybe some painkillers?

388
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,690
What kind of painkillers?

389
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,780
I don't know.

390
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,320
What did it say when I looked it up?

391
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,570
I think it was called Ménière's disease.

392
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,950
Who are you talking about?

393
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,380
My colleague, cutie Steamed Bun.

394
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,250
Tell me about your condition, Officer.

395
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,670
I'm totally fine.
It doesn't hurt?

396
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,050
No.
It must be painful.

397
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,720
Come on, this is nothing.

398
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,300
Doctor, I used to be a champion boxer.

399
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,350
Gold medalist Energizer Yun Dong-ju.

400
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,930
Right.

401
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,020
Let's schedule a head examination.

402
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,570
Let's run more tests.
I see some signs of nutritional imbalance.

403
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,610
LUXURY SPORTS CAR
CAUSES 3-VEHICLE COLLISION

404
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,860
You need to eat well
for your bones to heal quickly.

405
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,530
Don't just eat eggs.

406
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,990
We have many tests to run,
so I'll monitor your progress…

407
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,240
Mr. Yun Dong-ju?

408
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,420
A luxury sports car races down a road.

409
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,590
Its speed clocked by the camera
exceeds 200 km per hour.

410
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,500
That red sports car…
Ignoring all signals,

411
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,760
its driver drove recklessly,

412
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,840
causing another car
to crash into a roadside tree.

413
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,050
It's one of the missing cars
from the list.

414
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,850
It's time for your injection, Mr. Yun.

415
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,060
Damn it.

416
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,080
Unbelievable.

417
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,750
You keep breaking the law
like it's nothing, but you're still here.

418
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,290
You sure are something.

419
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,710
Okay, I'll give you that much.

420
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,220
You need to eat a balanced diet
to stay fit and keep playing mischief.

421
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,230
Why are you eating alone?

422
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,770
You have no friends, right?

423
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,440
Two-faced people like you

424
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,530
trigger an alarm in people's hearts.

425
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,450
It warns them to stay away.

426
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,910
How old are you?

427
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,170
I'm 1,000,032 years old. Why do you ask?

428
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,380
You look young for your age.

429
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,500
Then you can become my friend.

430
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,260
Let me tell you something
you might not be aware of.

431
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,650
When a traffic accident occurs,
you face criminal and civil liability.

432
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,690
Most reach a settlement
to resolve things peacefully.

433
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,280
But I'm never going to do that.

434
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,370
I don't know what connections you have,

435
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,990
but if I don't agree to settle,
you'll get prison time.

436
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,750
If I have these
so-called powerful connections,

437
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,170
do you think that'll be possible?

438
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,130
Have you heard of Ali?

439
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Muhammad Ali.

440
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,180
He said,

441
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,310
"Impossible is nothing."

442
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,730
I don't know all the shady things
you've been doing here in Insung.

443
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,280
But now that I'm here,

444
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,780
you can't avoid me in the ring.

445
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,370
Think of it as me giving you some time
because of my injury.

446
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's see each other often.

447
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,920
And don't be a picky eater.

448
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,070
I see some signs of nutritional imbalance.

449
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,570
You need to eat well

450
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,950
for your bones to heal quickly.

451
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,990
Don't just eat eggs.

452
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,170
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

453
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,210
Right. I need to eat well
to catch that bastard.

454
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,260
SENIOR OFFICER SHIN JAE-HONG

455
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,390
It's so odd how he keeps
taking that sneaky jerk's side lately.

456
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
Hey!

457
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,700
Didn't I tell you to stay in the hospital?

458
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,820
What are you doing in the office?

459
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,330
What's the point of lying in bed
when I'm perfectly fine?

460
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,910
I'll just rack up more hospital bills.

461
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,790
What's that? Is it for me?

462
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,420
Don't be ridiculous.
I got it on a shopping channel.

463
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,460
It was buy one, get one free.

464
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,300
Thank you. I appreciate it.

465
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,550
Jeez, look at this smoke.

466
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,600
This is a BBQ restaurant, not a--

467
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,600
One, two.

468
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,190
This is so good.

469
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,480
We don't have any peppers.

470
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,740
This is insanely good.

471
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,130
Good morning.

472
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,300
You came to work. How are you feeling?

473
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,340
As you can see, I'm fine.

474
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,430
Did you…

475
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,800
Good morning.

476
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,770
Yun Dong-ju, did you use my desk--
Oh, right.

477
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,690
What's on the menu this morning?

478
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,810
Clean it up.
We should clean up together.

479
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,370
Take this with you!

480
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,950
Sorry, Jae-hong.

481
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,920
What's up with the smell here?

482
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,470
What a nice scent.

483
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,800
Isn't it better now?

484
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,450
Darn it.

485
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,540
Jeez.

486
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,920
I wonder who I was trying to rescue
that my arm ended up this injured.

487
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,840
I need to eat well for my bones to heal.

488
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,440
Here you go.

489
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,650
Eat up.

490
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,880
I have a feeling they think you read
Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

491
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,590
Do you remember what they were about?

492
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,800
Hey, eat mine too.

493
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,220
Eat a lot, okay?

494
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,820
Now that Dong-ju's back,
let's plan our next steps.

495
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,360
Is Han-na not back yet?

496
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,410
Right. Where's Senior Officer Ji?

497
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,450
She left with you.

498
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,290
Isn't that for the better?

499
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,920
I can be the bait.

500
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,590
I looked everywhere for you.

501
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,770
Sometimes, I can't see the target
during a competition.

502
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,990
It's unclear where it is
or how far away it is.

503
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,450
I can't even take a guess

504
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,490
though it's right in front of me.

505
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,750
Everything looks blurry.

506
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,210
When that happens, I take a deep breath

507
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,420
and hone in on a single spot.

508
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,130
Eventually, it becomes clear.

509
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,380
OH JONG-GU (J9 SECURITY)

510
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,390
It becomes sharp and vivid.

511
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,010
The spot that I'm aiming for, that is.

512
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,600
My target.

513
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,320
It's a gift.

514
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,120
Why didn't you tell me
those bastards were tailing Han-na?

515
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,620
It wouldn't have made a difference
even if I'd told you.

516
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,290
Han-na.

517
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,880
Stop overreacting.

518
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,300
Did you meet with Min Ju-yeong?

519
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,310
Yeah.

520
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,640
Holy cow.

521
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,230
What did you do?

522
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,280
I saw a blue circle
on Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

523
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,200
It was this.

524
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,490
EVIDENCE ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

525
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,540
"Cheong" as in blue, and "Il" as in sun.

526
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,330
Cheongil Shipping.

527
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,460
It was established in 1972,

528
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,170
and it declared bankruptcy in 2009
and was absorbed through a merger.

529
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,260
Min Ju-yeong monitored it
for a long time in his post.

530
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,720
CHEONGIL SHIPPING

531
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,550
They're connected to him.

532
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,550
Good work.

533
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,760
Thank you.

534
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,930
We only found out about this,
thanks to Han-na.

535
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,140
Great job, Han-na.

536
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,600
But it's dangerous going alone,

537
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,100
so take me with you next time, okay?

538
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,690
I thought you'd be feeling down.

539
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,200
Did you discover something interesting?

540
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,240
Run away as best as you can. Good luck.

541
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,500
This fairy is quite adorable, isn't she?

542
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,010
My boss and the Russian guest
will go straight to the port.

543
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,260
I heard.

544
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,550
And our guest from the Philippines?

545
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,350
I went to the airport for the pickup,

546
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,430
but they vanished
with the phone and the car.

547
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,440
BONDED WAREHOUSE 201:
DISPOSED DUE TO LOSS OF VALUE

548
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,110
FILIPINO AIR CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 4:10 A.M.

549
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,610
RUSSIAN SEA CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 5 A.M.

550
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,780
Stay still.

551
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,620
BONDED WAREHOUSE 201:
DISPOSED DUE TO LOSS OF VALUE

552
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,640
FILIPINO AIR CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 4:10 A.M.

553
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,410
My mother's homeland.

554
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:29,000
RUSSIAN SEA CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 5:00 A.M.

555
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,960
I told you
to come straight from the airport.

556
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,010
The situation isn't good here.

557
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,460
Where are you right now?

558
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,300
Collaboration?

559
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,260
Between the RIU and us?
Yes.

560
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,890
With what? The prosecution
took all the investigation records.

561
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,600
There's one thing left.

562
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,980
Here.

563
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,360
This is a synthetic drug called Candy.

564
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,860
It's a high-quality new narcotic
with extremely high purity.

565
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,240
It's only been distributed
in parts of Eastern Europe so far,

566
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,450
but I think it made its way
into Korea recently.

567
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,330
This showed up
in Monkey's stolen goods too.

568
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,790
If we pursue the drug's import route,

569
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,660
we'll eventually catch Min Ju-yeong.

570
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,460
We can't just sit back.

571
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,170
The police agency's reputation
is on the line.

572
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,800
Tell me this though.

573
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,510
Why are you offering to help us?

574
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,680
That's a valid point.
Why is it? To take advantage of us again?

575
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,060
What is there to take advantage of?

576
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,810
Are you saying no? Is that it?

577
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,190
Forget it then. I'll just take this over
to the Narcotics Unit.

578
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,390
Before anything,

579
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,690
let's hear more
about the information you have.

580
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,900
Right. Take a seat and explain it to us.

581
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,280
We need to know more
before we can make a decision.

582
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,200
Sit down.

583
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
Okay, then.

584
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,910
The manufacturer of Candy is Drug Demon,

585
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,210
or Drugmon for short.

586
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,920
Other than the fact that
Drugmon is a man who's 190 cm tall,

587
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,380
nothing has been confirmed
about his nationality, name, or age.

588
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,300
Some junkies say
he's a defected North Korean spy,

589
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,260
a Japanese Yakuza member,
or a Filipino gang member.

590
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,060
There are lots of rumors,

591
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,930
but the only thing they agree on is this.

592
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,480
If you see Drugmon's face…

593
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,190
you're a dead man.

594
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,300
Who the heck are you?

595
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,400
Who said you could make my Candy
without my permission?

596
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,450
Wait, are you…

597
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,620
Are you really Drugmon?

598
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,410
I'm sorry.

599
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,000
I only did as I was told. I swear.

600
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,260
Is that real Candy?

601
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,350
Yeah.

602
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,640
Want to try it?

603
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,280
How crude.

604
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,320
This is so irritating.

605
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,700
Is it good?

606
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,210
It's okay.

607
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Goddammit.

608
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,860
Damn it. This is a limited edition.

609
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,460
I don't know
if the rumors are true or not,

610
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,930
but nobody has ever seen Drugmon's face.

611
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,180
This is Park Jae-jin of the RIU.

612
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,020
I'm in Gihyeon District 7.

613
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,030
When will they get here?

614
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,780
I told you
to come straight from the airport.

615
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,240
The situation isn't good here.

616
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,080
Where are you right now?
Me?

617
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,830
I'm on my way to hunt down some rats.

618
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,830
Some bastards
have been circulating fake Candy.

619
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,210
I can't let some knockoffs run wild.

620
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,130
I'll get rid of them first.

621
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,180
And to celebrate my return,

622
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,720
I'll take care of all the cops
causing you trouble.

623
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,270
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

624
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,230
Hey, this is a joint operation!
I know!

625
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,480
We go together!
I know!

626
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,320
Okay.

627
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,650
They're right on time.

628
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,740
This will do.

629
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,290
TIMER

630
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,020
RIU, this way!
Yes, sir.

631
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,830
Oops.

632
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,120
Hey.

633
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,040
Damn it.

634
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,090
Damn it. This didn't occur to me.

635
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,480
Get up.

636
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,030
You little…

637
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,160
Fuck…

638
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,920
Please save me!

639
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,670
Please save me!

640
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,130
Please save me!

641
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,090
Damn, that hurts.

642
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,380
Are you okay?

643
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,350
Yes.
Are you hurt?

644
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:00,950
It's gasoline.

645
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:03,700
Take cover!

646
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,950
Yun Dong-ju!

647
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,290
Run!

648
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,390
Dong-ju!
Hey!

649
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,770
Where's Dong-ju?

650
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:32,900
Hold on tight!

651
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,030
Hey, Dung-ju!
Hey!

652
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,200
Hey!
Dong-ju!

653
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,700
Just let go of her!
He's right there.

654
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,040
No, don't let go!

655
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,190
Everyone's safe, right?

656
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,520
What about Dong-ju? Did he get there okay?

657
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,030
Yes, sir. He received treatment
and went to the agency.

658
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,150
I don't think we'll find any evidence.

659
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,570
Based on the neck wound on the corpse,
it looks like a scalpel was used.

660
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,330
The same weapon was used
on the other body.

661
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,870
Three other corpses in the Philippines
had the same mark.

662
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,040
The murder suspect

663
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,710
was Drugmon.

664
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,750
Do you think Drugmon is in Korea?

665
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,550
There's no way to tell.

666
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,300
Drugmon?
It could be a copycat killer.

667
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,460
What's in that room?

668
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,380
It seems they manufactured drugs

669
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,680
and held kidnapped women here

670
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,680
before drugging
and trafficking them overseas.

671
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,680
There's only one survivor.

672
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,450
Leo!

673
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,700
You used to leech off me, you bastard.
Why are you starting shit on my turf?

674
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,370
Hello there.

675
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,170
I'll blow a hole in your head!

676
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,350
Leo, please spare me.

677
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,430
I had no choice if I wanted to stay alive.

678
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,140
You understand, right?

679
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,110
You can take over
the whole operation here,

680
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,820
including port operations
and distribution.

681
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,320
You can have everything.

682
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,190
Please spare my life, Leo.

683
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,530
But that's a given.

684
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,570
Those were my father's to begin with.

685
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,580
Traitor.

686
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,790
Yes.

687
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,040
The hands that killed the brothers.

688
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,010
The feet that trampled on the sisters.

689
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,340
The mouth…

690
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,800
I said "mouth."

691
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,890
Open wide.

692
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,100
Go on. Open up.

693
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,520
The mouth that deceived the mother.

694
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,820
And the heart that betrayed the father.

695
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,720
Don't come near me!

696
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,180
I'll shoot! Stay away!

697
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,390
I said stay away!

698
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,560
How old are you?

699
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,850
I'm 17.

700
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,270
Look at me.

701
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:03,530
Look at me.

702
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,410
Choose something that's right for you.

703
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:11,950
Don't make the same mistake I did.

704
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,620
Understand?

705
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,750
Need me to kill him?

706
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,930
Let me know if you find something
that might belong to a man

707
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,930
about 190 cm tall.

708
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:29,840
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

709
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,010
Let's check it.
Okay.

710
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,850
Can you tell me your name?

711
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,190
Do you remember anything

712
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,900
like your parents'
or friends' phone numbers?

713
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,200
I don't know.

714
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,740
I don't remember anything.
Oh, dear.

715
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,870
Do you remember what you saw back there?

716
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,250
Can you tell us about it?

717
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,670
There was…

718
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,590
There was a tall man.

719
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,260
He was about 190 cm tall.

720
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,430
The men were fighting with each other.

721
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,970
I heard loud noises from outside.

722
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,640
Then he grabbed my neck…

723
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,610
I'm so sorry.
It's okay. You're in shock.

724
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,280
Let's give her time to calm down
before we continue.

725
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Okay.

726
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,240
Please save me!

727
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,740
Please save me!

728
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,870
Please save me!

729
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,250
You can change into these.

730
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,920
Please put your clothes in here
so we can keep them as evidence.

731
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,840
I see.

732
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,510
Thank you.

733
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,310
Come out once you're done changing.
Okay.

734
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,350
She's the only person who saw Drugmon.

735
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,560
Her safety and security
are our top priority.

736
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,610
We'll keep her with us
until she regains her memory.

737
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,150
What if we request personal protection
and move her to a safe house?

738
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,740
Any internal information can be leaked.

739
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,870
I think it's best that we keep this
between us and the RIU.

740
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,700
But we can't keep her here forever.

741
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,910
You don't have to worry about me.

742
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,370
I'll find a place to stay.

743
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,050
I'll contact you immediately
if anything happens.

744
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,380
No, this is a dangerous situation,
so we'll provide personal protection.

745
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,430
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
will take care of--

746
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,140
What…

747
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,520
I'll stay with her.

748
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,530
It'll make you feel safer
than being alone.

749
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,120
Please get some rest.

750
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,410
I'll be outside,
so let me know if you need anything.

751
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,470
I'm trapped in here.

752
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:35,820
Aren't you leaving?

753
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,950
How can I leave?

754
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,410
She needs a reliable cop
by her side to feel safe.

755
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,660
Who are you calling reliable?
Didn't you see her earlier?

756
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,370
She clung to me for protection
like a little kid.

757
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,040
She instinctively knew I was reliable.

758
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:52,300
Besides, the captain said
to stay with her around the clock.

759
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,220
From this point on…

760
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,380
we're partners.

761
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,140
Since when do you ever listen to anyone?

762
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,600
The coffee tastes great.

763
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,070
The vibes are great.

764
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,320
And you're great too.

765
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,710
Are you okay?

766
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:35,670
Hold on tight!

767
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,060
All done.

768
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:56,240
This is kimchi jjigae made by
a former national team athlete.

769
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,820
Gosh, this looks good.

770
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,700
Han-na first.

771
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,700
You're making a fuss.
We can just eat boxed meals.

772
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,120
It's better with a bowl of hot stew.

773
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,290
Hurry up and try it.

774
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,510
What do you think?

775
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,510
It's good, right?

776
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,760
It's all right.

777
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,140
This might look simple on the surface,

778
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,010
but it's infused
with a boxer's joy and sorrow.

779
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,970
Try the tofu and kimchi together.

780
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,140
And the meat.

781
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,160
Here we go.

782
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,450
This is yours.

783
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,660
Here you go.

784
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,040
What is it?

785
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,920
Does it taste weird?
No.

786
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,720
It tastes like something
I haven't had for a long time.

787
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,470
You cooked dinner
even though your arm is injured.

788
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:07,680
Thank you.

789
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,560
It's not a big deal.
I can do this with one hand.

790
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,440
You've been through a lot,
so you need a hearty meal to feel better.

791
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,480
Just relax and sleep easy tonight.

792
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,320
I'll be keeping watch,
so everything will be fine.

793
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,950
Okay, thank you.

794
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,970
Thank you.
Not at all. Enjoy.

795
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,220
By the way, how did you injure your arm?

796
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,310
Oh, this?

797
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:52,020
I was catching a bad guy
and rescuing a certain someone.

798
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,060
I'm not sure if she appreciates it though.

799
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,480
So?

800
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,030
Shut it and eat.

801
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,950
I heard you were a boxer
on the national team.

802
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,660
I heard you won a gold medal too.

803
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,120
That's right.

804
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,000
That's amazing.

805
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,580
Do you know who Ali is?

806
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Ali?

807
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,380
The person who said,
"Impossible is nothing"?

808
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,960
That's right! "Impossible is nothing."

809
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
That's the guy.

810
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,050
No way.
How do you know him?

811
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,800
Of course I know who he is.

812
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,680
That's so cool.
Most people think of Ali the singer.

813
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,730
Holy crap.

814
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,940
This is a nice house.

815
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,320
Why do you live in a studio apartment
instead of here?

816
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:43,240
It's too big for one person,

817
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,030
and it's too far from the police agency.

818
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,200
I see.

819
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,870
I did assign Dong-ju to her
as you suggested,

820
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,870
but would they be safe?

821
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,330
Min Ju-yeong will be targeting
Senior Officer Ji and the witness.

822
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:59,960
It's safer for those two to be together,
and officers will be patrolling the area.

823
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,550
And we know a mutt is the best
when it comes to protecting people.

824
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:06,800
So when it comes to Han-na…

825
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,390
we won't have to worry about her safety.

826
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,520
So much for protection.

827
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,370
Car accident victims
might seem fine at first,

828
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,290
but they'll unwind in a few days
and experience muscle pain and body aches.

829
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,960
Please tell his family
to keep an eye out for him.

830
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,050
Okay.

831
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,840
All right, then.

832
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:41,850
How heartwarming.

833
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,050
Damn it.

834
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,600
Thank you.

835
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,560
What's this?

836
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,990
CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE

837
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:37,410
Isn't this a luxury brand?

838
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,330
Is it real?

839
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,830
Yes, it is.

840
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,000
Captain.

841
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,250
The senior superintendent
says to get ready.

842
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,540
Jeez, who cares about an event
we hold every year?

843
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,880
It's impossible to get work done.

844
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,380
Let's go.

845
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,670
Let's go.

846
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,180
Hey.

847
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,230
Come out already. We're late.

848
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:04,560
Okay, just a second.

849
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,690
Oh, no!

850
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:10,150
What do I do?
What are you doing?

851
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,490
Hey!
Oh, no!

852
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Are you okay?
Yeah.

853
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,570
Get up.

854
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,710
Thank you.

855
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,840
Why are you blushing?

856
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,960
What are you on about?

857
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,920
Is your heart pounding?
You want a beating?

858
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,800
Did that give you butterflies?
Do you want to die?

859
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,890
Hurry up and come out!

860
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,940
At least turn on the water for me!

861
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,060
Steamed Bun, I can't see anything!

862
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:49,980
You look good together.

863
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,730
Are you two dating?
Not at all.

864
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,990
Why? You two make a great couple.

865
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:59,580
Officer Yun seems to like you,

866
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,950
and you seem interested in him as well.

867
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,500
Me? Interested in him?

868
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,080
Or do you just not realize it?
I'd have to be out of my mind.

869
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:12,210
It's not like that.
I'm pretty sure it is.

870
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:18,840
But if it's not, then that's good.

871
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,430
Officer Yun is amazing, isn't he?

872
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,310
In this day and age,

873
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:31,110
how often do you see a man
willing to sacrifice himself

874
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,570
for the woman he loves?

875
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,950
We have to stop by the agency.

876
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:44,080
The RIU will keep an eye on you
while we're out.

877
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,750
I don't mind being by myself.

878
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,080
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

879
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,710
Consider it a form of protection
and monitoring.

880
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,130
You're both a witness and a suspect
as you were at the scene.

881
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,260
The weather is beautiful today.

882
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,430
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
42ND ANNIVERSARY

883
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,310
The Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,

884
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,640
now celebrating its 42nd anniversary,

885
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,940
has built strong trust with the citizens…

886
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,980
Jeez, it's hotter sitting in this chair.

887
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,690
It's sweltering.
Couldn't he have booked an auditorium?

888
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,900
Why are we out here in the scorching sun?

889
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,320
He said the sun
makes us look better on camera.

890
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,120
Look good on camera, my ass.

891
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,830
So? Did the commissioner not complain
after the prosecution made such a scene?

892
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,210
I don't know what's going on,

893
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,630
but it seems he's also in a bind.

894
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:32,790
Min Ju-yeong

895
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,710
is no ordinary guy.

896
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,710
Is he the president's son or something?

897
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,970
That guy would survive
making the man the butt of a crude joke.

898
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,720
Jeez, my butt is on fire right now.

899
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,220
We are able to celebrate

900
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,810
the agency's 42nd anniversary
without any obstacles

901
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:52,310
thanks to the tireless efforts
of our police officers

902
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,320
who dedicate themselves day and night

903
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,990
to protect the lives and property
of our dear citizens.

904
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,620
I would like to commend

905
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,950
the dedication of our police officers

906
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:13,040
and extend my heartfelt gratitude to you,

907
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,420
my dear police family.

908
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,670
While I, Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol,

909
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,720
will not be in office for much longer…

910
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,150
And who knows?

911
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:43,160
Maybe you'll fall for my charms
and like me back.

912
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,160
Just so you know,
there's no chance that I'll like you.

913
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,330
I don't like you.

914
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:49,660
Call me if you get scared.

915
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,580
Officer Yun seems to like you,

916
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,920
and you seem interested in him as well.

917
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,050
Or do you just not realize it?

918
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:07,800
Han-na!

919
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,770
I'm sorry for making you wait.

920
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,270
I don't know why the commissioner
has so much to say.

921
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,440
Your legs must be aching.

922
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,270
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought one of everything.

923
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,110
What do you want to drink?

924
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,160
I don't know if I'm drunk on the heat…

925
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,670
or something even stronger.

926
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:46,720
Or maybe…

927
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,060
I'm just losing my mind.

928
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,970
A total of 56 wins and 5 losses
out of 61 matches.

929
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,930
The legendary boxer
who left behind a great legacy

930
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,760
and brought everyone to their knees.

931
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,640
The fearless Muhammad Ali.

932
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:52,830
Then in June 2016,

933
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:56,080
after a long battle
against Parkinson's disease,

934
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,750
the legendary Muhammad Ali…

935
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,340
passed away.

936
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,800
I'll handle it without any problems,
so don't worry.

937
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,090
Counterpunch!

938
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,350
Have you kept in touch
with my mom this whole time?

939
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:54,680
Her statement was true.

940
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,720
This might be the largest bust
in the country's history.

941
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:00,390
The truth is out. Let's go arrest them.
Let's round them all up.

942
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,310
It's not that easy.

943
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,150
How dare you
get us dragged into this mess?

944
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,780
Oh, now I remember.
Me?

945
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,240
What should we do?

946
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,030
I have a friend.

947
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,200
The daughter of the SCIT captain.

948
