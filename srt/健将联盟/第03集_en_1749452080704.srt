1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,100
I'll take you through my day.

4
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,020
Health, beauty,

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,770
and Bellissimo.

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,860
Have a Bellissimo day.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,610
WOMEN'S 50 M RIFLE 3 POSITIONS FINAL
JI HAN-NA COMPETING

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,360
We're coming to you live

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,370
at the Women's 50-meter Rifle
3 Positions Final.

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,040
Korea's Ji Han-na is entering the venue.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,130
She has already taken the gold
in the 10-meter Air Rifle.

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,630
If she wins the gold in this event,

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,550
she'll become a double gold medalist
for the third consecutive competition.

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,130
-What an impressive record.
-Indeed it is.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,470
Anticipation is high as we wait to see
if she will break a world record.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,770
According to economic research analysis,

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,310
each shot fired by Ji Han-na

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,900
-is valued at over one billion won.
-My goodness.

19
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,770
She truly is a million-dollar baby.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,730
-It's absolutely amazing.
-Yes.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
-She'll take the gold for sure.
-Right.

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,200
The world record is just within reach.

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,000
Nicely done.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,750
That was an excellent shot.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,760
Good luck to Korea's Ji Han-na
with her last round.

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,220
Five.

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,090
Four.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,260
Three.

29
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,410
It's you.

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,380
-Who are you?
-I think you know.

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,210
I told you before
that I was a police officer.

32
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,880
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

33
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,680
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,060
Did you forget already?

35
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,140
I remember you

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,020
very clearly.

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,110
You hit-and-run bastard.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,950
It seems there's a misunderstanding.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,830
This is my first time meeting you,
Detective.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,500
Your first time?

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,760
MIN JU-YEONG
INSUNG CUSTOMS

42
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,340
Hey.

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,470
SURVEILLANCE DIVISION
CUSTOMS OFFICER MIN JU-YEONG

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,720
Take a look. Is it still your first time?

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,890
You did this to me. Look at it.

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,810
Look!

47
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,310
What's the matter with you?

48
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,190
Excuse me. What do you think you're doing?

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,400
-Let go of me.
-Seriously!

50
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,160
Hey, you'd better remember
exactly who I am.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,780
-Just leave.
-Remember who I am.

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,910
-Let go of me!
-Be quiet and leave.

53
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,160
Remember me!

54
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,910
Do you hear me, you hit-and-run bastard?

55
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,460
He's quite a character.

56
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you.

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,380
So now what?
What did the commissioner say?

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,840
He made a fuss about your team.

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,010
He can't just dissolve the SCIT.

60
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,180
But he doesn't feel comfortable
parading you around either.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,100
It's just a headache for him.

62
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,470
What about Ji Han-na?

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,480
Her status is on hold.
But if she quits, we can't stop her.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,730
Don't process her resignation yet.

65
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,400
I'll talk to her in person today.

66
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,320
SEOBU STATION SENIOR INSPECTOR KANG

67
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,860
Hey, what's going on?

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,570
Yoon Dong-ju?

69
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,780
Hey.

70
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,540
You did this to me. Look at it. Look!

71
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,120
Excuse me. You can't do this.

72
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,080
-Get him out.
-Let go of me!

73
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,960
Why do you keep
taking your pants off everywhere?

74
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,720
Are you an exhibitionist?

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,930
Come here, you pervert.

76
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,560
That's not the issue right now.

77
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,350
I'm telling you it's the same bastard.

78
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,770
Here's the proof!

79
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,190
That's enough. Pull up your pants.

80
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,610
What proof? Will you send your butt
to the National Forensic Service?

81
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,690
That's a good idea.
Should I take a photo and send it?

82
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,900
A photo won't do. Let me rip it off you.

83
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,110
What do you think, Jae-hong?

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm not sure.

85
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,490
He looks like an ordinary civil servant.

86
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,290
That's what I mean.

87
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,330
What do you mean?

88
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,000
A Grade 7 customs officerâ€¦

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,130
is linked to murder,

90
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,670
a gang boss, and knife-wielding
Korean Chinese thugs.

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,170
Isn't that strange?

92
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,760
You're the strange one here.

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,050
That's all conjecture.
You don't have any proof.

94
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,760
That's why we need to investigate!

95
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,020
Let's take a photo and send it to the NFS.

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,770
Jae-hong, take a photo
before the evidence fades away.

97
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,770
Take a photo and then a recording.

98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
Do you see it?

99
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,150
There were two or three lines.
Or was it one?

100
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,650
-It's not very clear.
-Look closely up top.

101
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,240
-That's gross. Do it somewhere else.
-It's not gross.

102
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,580
Hey.

103
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,420
What brings you here, Sergeant Kim?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,550
How's your injury? I've been worried.

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,220
Can't you see that he's fine?

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,180
The doctor said I was fine,

107
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,680
but I don't feel great.

108
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,810
I'm just glad you didn't get hurt.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,610
Not that I want to
make a big deal out of it,

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,440
but the fact remains
that I saved your life.

111
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,950
And I'm grateful for that.

112
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,320
That's enough. Come here.

113
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,330
Goodness, look at this.

114
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,950
This desk was made for him.

115
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,290
You're just the right addition
to complete the SCIT.

116
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,880
How about you join our team

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,050
as a way of repaying me?

118
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,460
Well, Captain--

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,300
Why don't we have a welcome party
since we're having a team dinner?

120
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,300
-We'll do both at the same time.
-Captain--

121
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,680
Sergeant Kim, what do you like? Beef?

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,020
I'm against it.

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,600
-You eat whatever I buy, you punk.
-No.

124
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,980
Who says he can join our team?

125
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,030
Even if you're the captain,
you can't make decisions like this alone.

126
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,240
Every team member should have a say in it.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,990
I'm against it. You too, right, Jae-hong?

128
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,660
I don't mind.

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,040
What?

130
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,500
Fine.

131
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,710
Han-na and I are against it,
so that's two to one.

132
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,670
How do you know what Han-na thinks?

133
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,550
Of course I know what she thinks.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,390
He says he doesn't want to join.

135
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,060
Stop begging. It makes you look desperate.

136
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,140
What if I want to join?

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,270
What? Seriously?

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,650
You can do whatever you want.

139
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,280
Why does he get to do whatever he wants?

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,530
Because he's Sergeant Kim.

141
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Let's be real. He's not helpful at all.

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,030
He only knows how to play swords like kids

143
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,780
and freezes up
when it comes to the real thing.

144
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,880
Do you want to check for yourselfâ€¦

145
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,630
if I really freeze up or not?

146
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm in.

147
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,180
-Where?
-Here.

148
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,010
-When?
-Now.

149
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,520
You can't beat me with punches like that.

150
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,640
I have 180-degree peripheral vision.

151
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,560
I know where every punch is coming--

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
-We have to see this.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

153
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,400
Let go of me.

154
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,780
TRAINING ROOM

155
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,490
So? Ready to get serious now?

156
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,450
Perfect. I was in a crappy mood anyway.

157
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,410
Let's get serious.

158
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
If you win, you can join
or do whatever you want.

159
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,920
That's up to me.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,920
But if I win, stop speaking informally.

161
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,550
Say that after you win.

162
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,130
You don't get to see
a big match like this every day.

163
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,590
It's Dung-ju versus Jong-hyeon.

164
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,050
Which side will win?

165
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,220
Regardless of your division,

166
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,850
I'll pay for the team dinner tonight,
so place your bets!

167
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,230
I bet on Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

168
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,060
He only got one scratch on his face
when he took down that gang.

169
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,730
My money's on Sergeant Kim, five to one.

170
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,650
Come on. It's like Officer Yoon said.

171
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,650
Boxing is the way to go
in a weaponless fight.

172
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,490
He's the Asia boxing champion
and won a gold medal.

173
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,740
-Right. We saw what happened.
-Exactly.

174
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,580
-You're right, we saw it.
-Yeah, we did.

175
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,080
-I saw it too.
-We all did.

176
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,120
I bet on Sergeant Kim.

177
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,830
What about you, Captain?

178
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,790
Is it Kim Jong-hyeon or Yoon Dong-ju?

179
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Me?

180
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,010
Isn't it obvious?

181
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,930
I choose this side.

182
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,470
Did that hurt?

183
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,600
But I barely moved.

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,110
-I'm fine.
-That's good to hear.

185
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,780
Look at you.

186
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,370
You know how to move.

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,710
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,180
He was a reserve member of the
national taekwondo team in high school.

189
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,720
-Dong-ju, are you okay?
-What theâ€¦

190
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,510
-What the heck?
-What happened?

191
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,600
Darn it, I shouldn't have switched.

192
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,390
-Did he lose?
-Damn it!

193
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,160
That was so unfair.

194
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,580
He should've mentioned
that he did taekwondo.

195
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,670
That sneaky jerk.

196
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,090
You said you'd buy beef, not gopchang.

197
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,960
This is expensive, you punk!

198
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,340
It is?

199
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,350
It's good.

200
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,060
Hey, stop eating gopchang and daechang.

201
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,020
Eat yeomtong, the beef heart, instead.
Look at you. You're all flabby.

202
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,190
No wonder
none of your punches landed right.

203
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
By the way,

204
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,280
does that still happen

205
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,080
because of the accident?

206
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
Just ride it out!

207
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,960
-That's it!
-Keep going!

208
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,350
INSUNG CITY
YOON DONG-JU

209
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,730
A straight right to the face.

210
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,230
It's your signature punch.

211
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,730
You had a chance to end it,
so why did you hold back?

212
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,610
You could've won with one of those.

213
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,450
Even I can do it.

214
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,250
What are you talking about?

215
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,460
Stop talking and eat.

216
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,170
Do you want to know the secret tactic
for beating Sergeant Kim?

217
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,430
Take it back.

218
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,180
Don't make a rash decision.

219
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,100
The higher-ups will give you some time,

220
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,480
so take a moment to think it through.

221
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,940
There's no rush.

222
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,520
No, I've already made up my mind.

223
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,020
I appreciate your concern.

224
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,570
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

225
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,370
Senior Officer Ji.

226
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,790
Did you talk to the captain?

227
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
-Yes.
-I guess you made your decision.

228
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,290
-Yes.
-That's a shame.

229
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,960
What about the team dinner?

230
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,760
I don't think I should go.

231
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,720
What about you?

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm going home.
My second-eldest suddenly has a fever.

233
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,430
I guess it's just the captain
and Dung-ju then.

234
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,310
If you don't have any plans,
how about you go cheer him up?

235
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,780
As you know, he's a very proud type.

236
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,990
He probably took it hard because he lost
in front of the person he likes.

237
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,660
He's a simple guy,

238
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,370
so I thought he might cheer up
if he saw you.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,290
No pressure though.

240
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,630
You don't need to go
if you have some family event

241
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,460
or if your parents need a caretaker.

242
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,340
But consider going if neither is the case.

243
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,630
Imagine how happy Dung-ju will be
if he sees you.

244
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,090
I mean, just imagine it.

245
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,350
He'll be over the moon about it.

246
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,060
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if you didn't have any plans?

247
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,650
GOPCHANG RESTAURANT
THE VALLEY

248
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,200
One, two, then to the right!

249
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,790
Why won't you budge?

250
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,540
Why can't I flip you over?

251
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,000
This is the weak spot! Right here!

252
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,500
What kind of secret tactic is this?

253
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,000
I said this is the weak spot!

254
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,130
I'm flipping you over!

255
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,510
Hi there.

256
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,300
-Han-na!
-Han-na!

257
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,430
Cheer him up, my ass. He's perfectly fine.

258
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,010
Wait, don't go!

259
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,180
Are you Popeye the Sailor?

260
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,440
How do you maintain this physique
living off rabbit food?

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm amazed.

262
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,520
And you don't drink, right?

263
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,110
-Right. Would you like some?
-Oh, jeez, no thanks.

264
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,740
Can you survive on just that?

265
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,860
This is the best way to lose weight.

266
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,620
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

267
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,870
Did you get a search warrant
for the hit-and-run bastard?

268
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,830
Warrant, my ass.

269
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,540
Warrants don't appear out of thin air.

270
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,300
You didn't even request one, did you?

271
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,840
I should've known.

272
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,300
I'll do it myself.

273
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,130
Don't do anything stupid. Just stay put.

274
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,510
I'll look into it.

275
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,220
I can't just stay put.
The police are funded by taxpayers.

276
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,020
-We have to work.
-You brat!

277
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,600
The driver behind the fatal hit-and-run
of a customs officer

278
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,730
has been identified as Mr. Lee Gyeong-il,
a former boxing prospect.

279
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,280
Police suspect that Mr. Lee,
who turned himself in,

280
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,490
may have been on drugs
at the time of the accidentâ€¦

281
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,830
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,750
I wanted to get more details
before telling you.

283
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,420
It's okay.
It's fine as long as he didn't do it.

284
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,090
Don't worry.

285
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,880
Of course.

286
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm sure you'll take care of things.

287
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm not worried.

288
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,720
I may not have raised him well,

289
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,520
but he's not a killer.

290
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sure of it.

291
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,860
If he's innocent, he'll be released.

292
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,370
Are you going to the temple?

293
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,790
Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well
these past few days.

294
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,040
This is your favorite,
stir-fried dried squid.

295
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
I may not have raised him well,

296
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
but he's not a killer.

297
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,110
It wasn't imported
through normal channels,

298
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,570
and the plate number wasn't registered.

299
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,360
It's too hard to track it down.

300
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,330
INSUNG CITY JUNKYARD

301
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
I'm borrowing these.

302
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,840
Hey, where are you going?

303
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,670
Yoon Dong-ju!

304
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,270
Have you seen this car here?

305
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,440
That's not a common model.

306
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,020
Good day, sir.

307
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,440
Have you seen this car?

308
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,900
I said there was no car like this here.

309
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,070
Right, let me just check again.

310
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,870
-We never got a car like that.
-Oh, wait.

311
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,200
Never mind.

312
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,170
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

313
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,130
I don't believe everything Dong-ju says,
but it still has credibility.

314
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,010
Things are taking a strange turn too.

315
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,010
Can you look into it, Sergeant Kim?

316
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,760
I'd like to examine Lee Gyeong-il's case,

317
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,180
but my team isn't in a position
to do so right now.

318
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,640
I already asked the prosecution
for an interview with Mr. Lee.

319
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,140
We may need him as a reference
for an internal investigation.

320
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,440
Of course you did.

321
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,780
By the way, I heard the new prosecutor
who took over is rather difficult.

322
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,400
There's a new prosecutor in charge?

323
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,200
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il, do you acknowledge
everything in your statement?

324
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,740
It's Prosecutor Kim Seok-hyeon
of the Criminal Department.

325
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,330
PROSECUTOR KIM SEOK-HYEON

326
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,000
-Hey.
-Yes?

327
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,710
Stop wasting my time and answer me.

328
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,330
I'm busy as hell.

329
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,670
Is this statement correct?

330
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
-Yes.
-What?

331
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,840
Yes, I did it.

332
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,180
All right, then.

333
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,850
You can take him away now.

334
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Let's go.

335
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,790
Why did the departmental chief assign
such a worthless case to me?

336
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,960
Sir, the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency
requested an interview with Mr. Lee.

337
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,290
What for?

338
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,960
The Office of Audits and Inspections
asked for it but didn't specify why.

339
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,590
Office of Audits and Inspections? Who?

340
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,090
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
of the Inspection Division.

341
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,100
Who?

342
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,680
Who? Kim Seok-hyeon?

343
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,680
Why? Do you know him?

344
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,100
Yes.

345
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,560
Tell him to come here

346
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,980
and report to me directly.

347
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,280
OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS

348
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,780
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

349
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,700
Very well.

350
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,620
I'll be there at 3 p.m.

351
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,210
INSUNG DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

352
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
-Hello.
-Hey, Gwang-seok.

353
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,550
I'm glad you called. Yeah.

354
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,880
Next week?

355
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,630
Next week sounds great. Why?

356
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,220
Sir, Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon is here.

357
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,470
Yeah.

358
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,980
Sure, let's have a get-together
among the younger crowd

359
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,100
without the older folks.

360
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,860
I'll call Yong-hui. All right.

361
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,280
Hey, Yong-hui. Are you busy?

362
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,410
Yeah, next week.

363
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,870
Gwang-seok and Yong-hui
are really excited.

364
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,410
Okay, see you next week.

365
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,710
Yeah, let's talk more next week.

366
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,630
All right. Bye.

367
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,520
What's with the bow?

368
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,020
It's been a while.

369
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,060
You came empty-handed?
But it's my birthday next week.

370
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,520
We're not on such great terms
to exchange birthday gifts.

371
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,530
I was just hoping you matured a bit.

372
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,330
I need to take Mr. Lee Gyeong-il.

373
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,080
I can't disclose the reason
because an investigation is underway.

374
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm afraid you can't.

375
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,550
Then why did you have me come?

376
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,340
I just wanted to see you.

377
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,680
Hey, you knew
I was the prosecutor in charge.

378
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,590
Did you really think
I'd agree to the request?

379
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,020
Man, I guess I forgot because we haven't
seen each other in a while.

380
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,770
You've always been a jerk.

381
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,940
That's no way to talk
to your older brother.

382
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,650
This is why people think
we're half-brothers.

383
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,360
Aren't you too old to be rebelling?

384
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,070
Is it fun playing a cop?

385
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,780
Do you think I do this for fun?

386
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,320
All right, all right.
Don't get so serious.

387
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,620
I was only hoping
you were having fun at the job.

388
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,370
That way, you won't run away again.

389
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,370
What?

390
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,750
Running away has been your specialty
since you were a kid.

391
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,880
You couldn't beat me academically
or in taekwondo.

392
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,670
That's why you took up fencing.

393
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,010
You ended up not winning the gold
and ran away from that too.

394
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,840
So stop wasting your time

395
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,600
and go work under Father.

396
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,560
What's the matter? Too embarrassed?

397
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,430
Want me to talk to him?

398
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Hey, eat before you go.

399
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,410
Mr. Jang.

400
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,540
Please look into what he's up to.

401
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,380
Running away has been your specialty
since you were a kid.

402
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,470
Seok-hyeon, not only did you rank first
in every subject,

403
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,470
but there's a huge margin
between you and the second-place student.

404
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,680
Dad, please buy me the present
you promised.

405
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,680
RANK/TOTAL ENROLLED STUDENTS: 2/483

406
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,350
KIM SEOK-HYEON

407
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,100
KIM JONG-HYEON

408
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,870
Is that what you're going to say
to your mom?

409
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,870
What did you tell my mom?

410
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,500
Are you actually worried?

411
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,090
Explain to her in person
what's going on right now.

412
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,720
All you need to say
is that you didn't kill him.

413
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,720
Then I'll get you out of here,
no matter what.

414
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,900
Gyeong-il.

415
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,670
I'd like to go back now.

416
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,970
Excuse me.

417
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,810
When can I see my lawyer?

418
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,620
GOLDENGATE SELF-SERVICE GAS STATION

419
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,840
Please select the serviceâ€¦

420
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,720
He came for a visitation?

421
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,100
Yes, but they didn't
discuss anything specific.

422
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,020
How's Mr. Lee Gyeong-il doing?

423
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,140
He seems a bit nervous,

424
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,520
but all first-time detainees
are like that.

425
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,410
They're all like that, huh?

426
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,420
Even so,

427
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,510
wouldn't it be better
to eliminate any risks?

428
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,510
Excuse me?

429
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,110
The watch suits you.

430
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,870
Thank you, sir.

431
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,290
CHEONUL JUNKYARD

432
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,180
Holy crap!

433
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,390
You little punk!

434
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,680
Move over before I stomp on you.

435
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,270
-You scared me.
-Hey.

436
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,430
Didn't I tell you
to bring the car back by morning?

437
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,480
Did I or did I not, you punk?

438
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,690
I just wanted to check out
a few more places.

439
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,690
How much have you been driving around?

440
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,110
I filled up the tank two daysâ€¦

441
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,280
You little bastard, I ought to justâ€¦

442
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,820
Jeez, you're such a pill.

443
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,370
Wait, where are we going?

444
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,870
Let go.

445
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,250
I said I needed the car
to get there by 10 a.m.

446
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,710
There's still time left.

447
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,170
They open at nine. Let's go after.

448
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,920
No, wait a minute.

449
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,260
Let's look here. Just once.

450
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,880
Please.

451
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,050
Get off me!

452
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,850
I bet you were up to no good.
You went clubbing, didn't you?

453
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,690
9. CHEONUL JUNKYARD, 10. NAMHAE JUNKYARD,
11. JUNGBU INSUNG JUNKYARDâ€¦

454
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,990
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

455
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,160
Sergeant Kim, what's going on?

456
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,870
What?

457
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:32,430
I'M SORRY
I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE

458
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,200
-You can't go in.
-Excuse me.

459
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Hey!

460
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,740
-Let go.
-What's going on?

461
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,290
You can't go in.

462
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,040
Damn it, this is such a headache.

463
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,730
Yes, sir.

464
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,730
I'll be there shortly. Yes, sir.

465
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,590
â€¦investigations are underway
on the smuggling routesâ€¦

466
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,850
Would you like some help?

467
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,060
It's okay. I don't have many belongings.

468
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
I can tell.

469
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,480
Former pro boxer, Mr. Lee Gyeong-il,
who was arrested on hit-and-run charges,

470
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,690
left a suicide note of apology

471
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,610
and took his own life
in the detention center.

472
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,190
Mr. Lee was an up-and-coming boxer

473
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,570
whose victory in the
2013 junior national team trials

474
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,910
made him a rising starâ€¦

475
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,140
I thought it'd be best
if you delivered this.

476
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,350
THE LATE LEE GYEONG-IL
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

477
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
If you'd rather not, I couldâ€¦

478
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,020
Why is this here?

479
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,900
Why is this here?

480
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,490
It's Lee Gyeong-il's personal effect.

481
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,200
He wasn't allowed to have that on him,
but I guess he did.

482
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,780
This doesn't belong to Gyeong-il.

483
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,450
Take a good look at the watch.

484
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,670
It's the same model as the one
Golden Bunny and that bastard wore.

485
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,380
It belongsâ€¦

486
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,760
to Gyeong-il's killer.

487
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,180
If we send this to the NFS
and check for fingerprints and DNA--

488
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,180
It's over.

489
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,600
What do you mean it's over?

490
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,400
Something will come up if they run a test.

491
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,900
The prosecutor ruled the case as a suicide
and already closed it.

492
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,990
What kind of bullâ€¦

493
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,860
What kind of bullshit is that?

494
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,830
Gyeong-il died only a few hours ago.

495
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,460
Okay. I'll look into it.

496
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,720
Hey! There's no use taking that!

497
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,890
Yoon Dong-ju!

498
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,690
Hey.

499
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,750
You had him killed, didn't you?

500
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,670
What are you here to say this time?

501
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,260
-Mr. Lee Jin-su--
-Lee Gyeong-il.

502
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,890
You don't know him?

503
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Lee Gyeong-il?

504
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,980
Who's that?

505
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,440
Don't act like you don't know.

506
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
You had him killed.

507
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,410
Was that a smile?

508
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
-What theâ€¦
-Damn it.

509
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,790
-Go help him.
-Hold on a second.

510
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,920
We have a situation here.

511
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,090
Get up.

512
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,430
Get up.

513
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,870
Captain, what was that watch about?

514
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,490
That watch

515
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,910
was the same model as Golden Bunny's.

516
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,210
And I'm not sure about this,
but Dong-ju claims

517
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,710
Lee Jin-su's hit-and-run driver
also had the same watch.

518
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,770
POLICE ID: JI HO-CHEOL
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

519
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,910
In his statement, Mr. Min Ju-yeong said
there was no prior agreement

520
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,040
to meet with you, Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

521
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,330
According to Mr. Min Ju-yeongâ€¦

522
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,370
You're here.

523
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,250
What happened?
What about the one who got hit?

524
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,880
The inside of his mouth got busted,
so he had to get stitches.

525
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,590
Is that correct?

526
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,510
Mr. Yoon, if you don't respond,
I'll consider it an admission.

527
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,270
Why do you ask about your father's case?

528
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,810
I just got curious.

529
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,310
I'm not sure
if we still have any records of his case.

530
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,110
By the way,

531
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,610
have you seen this before?

532
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,900
I think it was my father's.

533
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,660
Did he wear something like this?

534
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
They don't import it into the country.

535
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,330
I know someone
who specializes in such things.

536
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,590
He runs a pawnshop.

537
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,710
Let me get you his number.

538
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,100
It's Ji Ho-cheol.

539
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,850
Can I get a copy of the death certificate
submitted with the insurance claim?

540
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,730
I see.

541
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,610
Yes, I understand.

542
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,860
You got a three-month pay reduction
but avoided suspension.

543
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,150
Luckily, he won't file a suit.

544
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,530
In exchange,

545
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,330
start writing.

546
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,830
Write what?

547
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,500
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT

548
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,380
Copy the whole book as an act of remorse.

549
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,340
That's Min Ju-yeong's condition
for not filing a suit.

550
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,670
I'm not doing it.

551
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
Why should I?

552
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,890
Would you rather get sued
and leave the force?

553
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,010
Tell him to go ahead and sue me!

554
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,430
I'm not afraid.

555
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,980
Jeez, that punk.

556
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,230
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!

557
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,320
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

558
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,610
My mother loved gold watches like this.

559
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,910
I should've been a better son to her.

560
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,990
MOM

561
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,490
But what's the use of regret now?

562
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,210
Where did you get this from?

563
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,000
-Why do you ask?
-You see, this isn't an ordinary watch.

564
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,420
This is made by a Swiss craftsman

565
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,180
by the name of
Christian D'artisan Diar Watch,

566
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,090
believe it or not.

567
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,930
He only makes 12 of these a year.

568
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,430
The last time I saw one of these in Korea
was back in 2003.

569
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,770
Did you say 2003?

570
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,600
A few appeared on the market
in Insung back then.

571
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,020
There used to be a famous smuggler.

572
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,110
He went by Oh Dollar.

573
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,320
"Oh Dollar"?

574
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,240
His real name was Oh Bong-chan.

575
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,700
He made a ton of money by dealing dollars.

576
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,330
That's why they called him Oh Dollar.

577
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,450
All smuggled goods in Insung
went through him.

578
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,790
Where can I meet him?

579
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,040
He's dead.

580
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,170
It's been about 15 years.

581
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,630
This feels one gram heavier
than it should.

582
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,960
I wonder if it's real or fake.

583
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,430
What's that?

584
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,930
That?

585
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,850
This guy with an uglier mug than mine
took out a loan with it some time ago.

586
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,730
He was an absolute troll.

587
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,940
Dong-ju.

588
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,820
Yes?

589
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,120
Don't come here anymore.

590
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,460
Don't think I'm being cruel

591
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,880
and take this back with you too.

592
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,810
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

594
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,730
I know it's not your fault.

595
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
But I don't think

596
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,990
I can keep seeing you.

597
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,450
I'm afraid I might resent you.

598
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,750
Soâ€¦

599
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,420
let's not see each other anymore.

600
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,840
If I don't hear from you,

601
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,850
I'll assume you're doing fine.

602
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,600
Let's just leave it at that.

603
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,360
Dong-ju.

604
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,360
Take the burden off your chestâ€¦

605
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,530
and live your life with peace of mind.

606
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,590
GYEONGIL NOODLES

607
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,030
GYEONGIL NOODLES

608
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,160
These cases occurred
over the last two weeks,

609
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,700
and I think they might be related.

610
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,040
I'd like to go in reverse order

611
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,210
and investigate
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's death first.

612
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,670
The prosecutor in charge closed the case
within two hours of his death,

613
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,750
and the correctional officer in charge
is unreachable.

614
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Just observe for now.

615
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,550
The agency's information is leaking.
If we don't stop it--

616
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,680
That's why I said

617
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,850
just observe and stay put.

618
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,350
The correctional officer has been
absent for days without calling in,

619
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
and you haven't checked?

620
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,610
Suicide or murder,
he's still a key witness.

621
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,110
Surely it can't be that difficult
to give me his number.

622
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,990
You want to know who I am?

623
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,910
I'm Go Man-sik with Insung Police Agency's
Special Criminal Investigation Team.

624
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,910
What did you say?

625
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Why you punkâ€¦ He hung up.

626
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,220
You should've taken better care of it.

627
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,700
I'm disappointed
that you were so careless with it.

628
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Open your eyes.

629
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,460
Look at me.

630
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Officer?

631
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,550
-Correctional Officer Han?
-Sir.

632
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,550
I wiped the security camera footage,
and there's no other evidence.

633
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,180
-I swear.
-No.

634
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,800
That's not what I was talking about.

635
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,270
Why do you think I gave this to you?

636
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,520
This isn't just any watch.

637
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,060
It's a token of my trust and faith in you,

638
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,150
which is why

639
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,780
you should never lose it
or take it off, right?

640
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,400
I'm sorry. It won't happen next time.

641
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,040
Sorry, but there's no next time.

642
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,620
You can take this offâ€¦

643
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,460
only once.

644
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,050
Please spare me, sir!

645
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,550
Please save me!

646
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,220
I keep finding myself
in Mr. Baek's debt these days.

647
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,180
Please tell him I'll get in touchâ€¦

648
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,560
The Yanbian guys opened it
to check the documents.

649
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,480
Those bastards are under control,
so there won't be any problems.

650
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,280
But the thing is,

651
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,110
this could've been opened
before they checked the contents.

652
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,080
That female copâ€¦

653
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,370
She was a famous
former national team shooter.

654
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,410
She used to be on TV a lot too.

655
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,710
She's another risk factor.

656
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,470
CHEONGIL SHIPPING'S IMPORT/EXPORT

659
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,830
Mr. Oh.

660
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,580
I put my trust in youâ€¦

661
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,120
and now you need to deliver on it.

662
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,550
Thank you, sir.

663
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
â€¦the financial damages
in the early 2000s amounted to 12 billion.

664
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,560
From 2019 up to last year,

665
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,400
the annual loss exceeded 20 billion won
for five years in a row.

666
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,150
With voice phishing schemes on the riseâ€¦

667

ULTRASOUND NERVE THERAPY DEVICE

668
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,320
â€¦if someone impersonates a family member
for information via text or phone,

669
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,450
it is essential that you take caution
and carefully verify the facts.

670
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,160
This is Cha Sang-hun reporting for JTBN.

671
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,160
Lee Gyeong-il, the former athlete involved
in a drug-related hit-and-run scandal,

672
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,330
has taken his own life.

THE LATE LEE GYEONG-IL LEAVES SUICIDE NOTE

674
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,550
Lee, a former boxing prospect, was injured
in a match against Yoon Dong-ju

675
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,880
during the 2018 national team trialsâ€¦

676
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,110
Stop! Neutral corner!

677
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,190
One, two, three,

678
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,700
-four, fiveâ€¦
-Get up!

679
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,030
â€¦six, seven, eightâ€¦

680
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,660
Are you okay?

683
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,220
-Neutral corner!
-Hey, wake up!

684
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,550
We need help!

685
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,050
Gyeong-il!

686
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,890
Gyeong-il, wake up!

687
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,470
Gyeong-il!

688

689
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,780
Gyeong-ilâ€¦

690
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,370
I'm sorry.

691
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,520
ON-CALL ROOM

692
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,020
Now, just imagine all of this
being replaced by high-rise apartments!

693
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,060
Doesn't that sound amazing?

694
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,610
The location is great,

695
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,490
and the prime property in Insungâ€¦

696
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,150
Oh, here we are.

697
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,110
It's this house right here.

698
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,910
What are you doing?

699
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,450
Oh, you were home.

700
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,500
Hello, ma'am.

701
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,290
I'm a real estate agent.

702
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,750
-Real estate agent?
-Didn't you get a call?

703
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,090
The lady put this house up for sale.

704
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,670
Please take your time
and look around the neighborhood.

705
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,130
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

706
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,260
You're probably well aware

707
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,760
that without a few
solid insurance policies,

708
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,350
you could suffer great financial losses.

709
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,440
Gosh, the mere thought scares me.

710
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,320
I'm already insured.

711
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,150
What policies do you have?

712
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,280
A variety.

713
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,860
Actually, the RIU does dangerous work.

714
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,910
-Goodness.
-Dae-yong, don't you need--

715
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,870
The commissioner is calling for me.

716
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,250
Hey, did you call them?

717
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,790
See? All of you need insurance.

718
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,960
Please take a look at this.

719
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,500
-Okay.
-My number is on it.

720
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,420
Feel free to give me a call.

721
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,420
Hey, Jae-hong.

722
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,760
This guy here has four kids
and probably needs insurance.

723
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,300
Goodness, is that so?

724
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,090
Captain, I need to go
to the Support Division.

725
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,310
Oh, I have to go there too.

726
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,930
No, this is more urgent.

727
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,600
Oh, dear! Are you okay?

728
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,810
Oh, my goodness!

729
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,980
Gosh, you're so silly.

730
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,400
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

731
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,740
Insurance companies
lose money on this product.

732
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,570
Just hear me out.

733
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,200
Police officers have had to deal
with limited coverage

734
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,660
and restrictive premiums
due to the high risk of accidents.

735
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,250
Drink this. It's good for your joints.

736
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,880
What do you think?

737
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,090
It's good.

738
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,880
Feel free to drink all of these.

739
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,220
-Hey, Han-na. Don't you need insurance?
-Oh, my.

740
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,180
Don't worry about her insurance.

741
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,350
Han-na!

742
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,060
What's the matter?

743
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,100
Why did you come here without telling me?

744
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,100
I gave you a call,

745
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,690
but you didn't answer.

746
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,610
Maybe your phone is broken.

747
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,690
You haven't answered a single call.

748
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,940
You don't call me or take my calls.

749
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,820
What's with that tone
after all these months?

750
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,870
You're breaking my heart.

751
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,160
Now that we're on the subject,
how come you never reach out first

752
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,830
to tell me how you're doing?

753
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:46,910
Are you listening?

754
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,960
Hey, are you listening to me?

755
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:53,000
-Did you put Dad's house up for sale?
-What?

756
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah.

757
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,630
That's not your decision to make.

758
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,970
That's why I called you.

759
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,100
My loan is overdue.

760
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,760
Still, how could you consider selling it?

761
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,220
What else can I do?

762
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,890
Where else can I get such a large amount?

763
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,650
You should've listened to me
and signed with the management company.

764
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,190
Why did you become a cop of all things?

765
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,730
-Let's talk later.
-Wait.

766
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,610
Where are you going? We're not done yet.

767
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,360
I don't like fighting with you.

768
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,490
That's why I'm going.
I don't want to fight with you.

769
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,200
Do you hate me that much?

770
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,330
Didn't you know?

771
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,580
Han-naâ€¦

772
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,170
You can do whatever you want,
but leave Dad's house alone.

773
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,000
And don't come back here again.

774
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,090
Butâ€¦

775
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,350
Goodness, Director.

776
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,940
Let's discuss the extension

777
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,780
of the shampoo advertisement contract
another time.

778
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,740
No, Han-na won't accept those terms.

779
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,620
No, there's no way we will.
What do you even mean?

780
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,290
No, we won't extend it
unless our terms are met.

781
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,500
Your terms are terrible.
Can't you do better?

782
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,330
Han-na is better than that.

783
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,920
She brought home a world record.

784
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,220
The world record is just within reach.

785
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,680
She brought home a world record.

786
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,190
She brought home a world recordâ€¦

787
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,200
What just happened with Ji Han-na?

788
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,240
This is a surprising turn of events.

789
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,200
It seems she lost her focus
at a crucial moment.

790
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,170
Good job, dear.

791
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,540
You're the best. Hold on.

792
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,840
No, we just can't agree to those terms!

793
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,840
Listen to me, Director.
Han-na is number one in the world.

794
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,140
She's number one on the face of the Earth.

795
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,930
If it were you, would you renew a contract
under those conditions?

796
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,190
If you miss out on my daughter,
it'll be a huge loss for you.

797
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,190
I actually feel bad for you.
What should we do about this?

798
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,280
Oh, no, your hair!
Do you know how much you cost us?

799
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,540
What am I going to do?

800
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,720
That's why I'm going.
I don't want to fight with you.

801
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,850
Do you hate me that much?

802
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:34,890
Didn't you know?

803
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,270
Are you okay?

804
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,230
Are you okay?

805
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,780
I should be worried for him,
not the other way around.

806
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,950
He's such a fool.

807
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,000
Can you stand up?

808
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,800
Do you still get like that?

809
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:53,390
Sometimes.

810
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,770
Is that why you still take medication?

811
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,430
Only when it gets bad.

812
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,560
I'm used to it.
I've been this way since middle school.

813
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,030
How did you win so many gold medals
when you weren't well?

814
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,950
It took me all I had to secure one.

815
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,990
It's hard to see anything
from 50 meters away,

816
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,160
but you still managed
to hit that tiny target.

817
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,250
You're a genius for sure.

818
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,250
There's no such thing as a genius.

819
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,710
You just grit your teeth and do it.

820
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,550
When the target is in your sights,

821
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,720
you have to remain steady.

822
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,220
In that moment,

823
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,770
all trivial thoughts
and sounds of breathing

824
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,640
must fade away.

825
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,650
If notâ€¦

826
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,150
everything will vanish in an instant,

827
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,570
including my faith and effort.

828
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,160
So that's whyâ€¦

829
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,950
you need to remain steady.

830
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,390
Keep a cool head and a passionate heart.

831
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,730
A boxer should know this.

832
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,480
Don't get worked up needlessly.

833
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,150
Focus on the target.

834
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,940
Go get that bastard.

835
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,100
"Such provocationâ€¦"

836
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,360
Why in the world
am I sitting here writing this?

837
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,440
On a Friday night, at that.

838
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,530
Damn it, Dung-ju.

839
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,530
"Such provocationâ€¦"

840
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,660
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION

841
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,670
The agency's information is leaking.
If we don't stop it--

842
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,420
That's why I said

843
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,130
just observe and stay put.

844
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:38,590
Sorry for the wait.

845
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,850
You requested personnel records, right?

846
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,390
Yes, that's correct.

847
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,430
Can I also review the records
of the contract workers within the agency?

848
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Sure.

849
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,230
Oh, looks like someone
was searching something.

What brings you here?

853
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,870
I'd like to take back
my letter of resignation.

854
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,290
I hope it's not too late.

855
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
Of course not.

Where did he stop?

859
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,090
Senior Officer Ji!

860
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,470
Hi there!

861
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,050
Good morning, Captain.

862
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,550
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

863
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,260
All right.

864
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:50,600
Jae-hong, green really suits you.

865
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,810
Hey.

866
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,850
Is there still room for me?

867
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,810
Of course.

868
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,900
This is great.

869
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,940
Senior Officer Ji is back,
and Sergeant Kim is joining us.

870
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,950
Now it feels like a real SCIT.

871
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,200
Real SCIT, my foot.

872
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,160
This isn't some corner store.

873
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,080
You can't come and go as you please.

874
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,620
I thought I could do whatever I wanted.

875
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,880
If you're going to be a crybaby,
leave the team.

876
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,920
Don't ruin the vibe here.

877
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,380
Who are you calling a crybaby?

878
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,460
You, of course.

879
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,970
Did you cry? Your eyes are red.

880
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,050
I pulled an all-nighter.

881
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,850
I'll take the Lee Jin-su hit-and-run case.

882
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,230
Would you like to?

883
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,980
That's my case. Stay away from it.

884
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,820
All you do is sit and cry.

885
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,280
How can you catch anyone?

886
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:46,610
By the way,

887
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,490
I told you not to speak informally.

888
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:50,910
Don't mess with me.

889
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,870
Sir.

890
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,460
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT

891
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,220
What's the matter with him? Is he crazy?

892
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,890
Hasn't he always been that way?

893
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,970
He actually seems normal now.

894
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,810
-That's true.
-Right. You have a point.

895
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,190
-He is crazy.
-Settle down.

896
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,990
RICE PORRIDGE

897
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,540
GYEONGIL NOODLES

898
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,260
What are you here for this time?

899
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,890
I just need a quick word.

900
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,310
-You can't go in!
-What trouble are you going to cause now?

901
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,350
I need to deliver something.

902
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,400
Just go.

903
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,400
Jeez.

904
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,530
Okay.

905
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,030
I just need to deliver this.

906
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:09,990
Hey, wait a minute!

907
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,950
INSUNG CUSTOMS

908
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,950
What's going on? Who are you?

909
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,460
I'm sorry, sir.

910
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,090
Mr. Min Ju-yeong, we need to talk.

911
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,050
-You have to leave.
-Hold on a second!

912
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:31,470
I found the person I was looking for.

913
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,640
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

914
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,560
I'm sorry, sir.

915
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,180
Take care of this, Mr. Min.

916
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,360
I'll leave after I give him this.

917
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,500
Now that you're in front of me,
I can't seem to control myself.

918
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,590
You know?

919
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,850
Keep a cool head and a passionate heart.

920
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,310
Keep a cool head

921
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,650
and a passionate heart.

922
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,420
This must've been hard work.

923
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,930
I'll drop the suit,
so don't worry about it.

924
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,430
Let's never see each other again.

925
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:04,810
You never look up at the sky, do you?

926
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,690
What?

927
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,860
Ever heard of "Prologue"?

928
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:21,250
"I long to feel no shame
as I look up at the sky."

929
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,660
"A mere breeze stirring the leavesâ€¦

930
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:27,790
pained my heart."

931
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,260
If you're an actual human being,

932
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,050
you'd be ashamed of yourself.

933
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,930
I see you enjoy literature.

934
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,150
Asia boxing champion.

935
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,530
National team boxer and gold medalist.

936
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:03,200
Undefeated in 21 matches with 21 KO wins.

937
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,670
What?

938
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,880
That's who I am.

939
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,510
Try and run away if you can.

940
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,300
Anyone who faces me in the ringâ€¦

941
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,720
always goes down.

942
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:51,560
From now on,
our team will operate in these two pairs.

943
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,610
You can't just pair us up like that.

944
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,280
These are the crime scene photos
from your father's case.

945
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,320
His name is Monkey.

946
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,740
He's the best in the country
when it comes to smuggling cars.

947
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,160
Sometimes, you have to make bad choices
for the sake of justice.

948
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,660
What are you doing?

949
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,040
An ordinary civil servant
can't handle all this.

950
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,710
Mr. Min.

951
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,290
Min Ju-yeong is leaving the country
tonight at seven.

952
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,210
There's been a change of plans.

953
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,050
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il
didn't die because of me.

954
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,930
He died because of you.

955
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,010
He's a rotten bastard through and through.

956
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,930
What the hell are you going to do?

957
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,520
Isn't it obvious?

958
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,070
