1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,015
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,395
Shin Jae-hong of Insung City
is stepping up now for his fifth attempt.

4
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:06,066
The heavy rain today will make it tough
for the athletes out there.

5
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,359
Yes, absolutely.

6
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,280
Shin Jae-hong is calmly getting ready
for his fifth attempt.

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,867
INSUNG

8
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,582
Yes!

9
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,375
Foul!

10
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,926
-Another foul is called.
-Why?

11
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,221
-I didn't go over the line!
-It didn't look like a foul on the screen.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,430
That's a strange call.

13
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:42,269
Shin Jae-hong regains his composure
as he prepares for his sixth attempt.

14
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,576
Foul!

15
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,793
Load this up.

16
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,799
You're here.

17
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,176
Good work today.

18
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,554
Keep faking the import ledger
as you've been doing.

19
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,516
I can't tell you how reassuring it is
to have a reliable guy like you

20
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,393
working in the Korea Customs Service.

21
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,356
Why aren't you
wearing the watch I gave you?

22
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,735
Because it's too valuable.

23
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,446
This is a fake.

24
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,865
That can't be.

25
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,951
Can you look at it again?

26
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,495
I can look at it ten times,
but the answer won't change.

27
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,040
The color of the cubic zirconia is off.

28
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,584
If you don't believe me,
get it appraised somewhere else.

29
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,753
With the real thing,

30
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,381
<i>you know it at first glance.</i>

31
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,467
You're right.

32
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,428
I can tell just by looking.

33
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,687
I only thought of filling this container.

34
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,941
<i>I never knew I would see it empty.</i>

35
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,569
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

36
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,405
Let me apologize.

37
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,825
That's okay.
I should be the one apologizing.

38
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,496
I took away all the money
you led a life of crime for.

39
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,498
<i>You've got some nerve though.</i>

40
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,251
How did you manage to live on
with all that money hidden away?

41
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,342
<i>Just work hard for a few years.</i>

42
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,387
Then you'll be able to fill this up

43
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,681
with your own goods.

44
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,937
<i>I was scared at first.</i>

45
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,231
<i>But you see,</i>

46
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,944
when you become unimaginably rich,
all your fears disappear.

47
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,071
You can do anything by then.

48
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,074
<i>But even that can get boring.</i>

49
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,412
<i>Then you showed up</i>
<i>and spiced things up for me.</i>

50
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,541
<i>Watching you struggle like a little mutt</i>
<i>tugged at my heartstrings,</i>

51
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,751
and I even saw myself in your persistence.

52
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,545
You think we're similar?

53
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,090
Damn, that's offensive.

54
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:01,844
Hey.

55
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,306
You must be in deep shock
to be talking all this nonsense.

56
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,266
<i>No.</i>

57
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:11,895
I feel…

58
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,151
really good.

59
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,238
It feels like I've gone back
to when it all began.

60
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,411
I don't think I can wait a few years.

61
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,624
Because I want the real thing

62
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,377
right this second.

63
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,879
Thanks.

64
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:19,963
You feel good?

65
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,799
That's good.

66
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,927
Make sure you eat well.

67
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,179
You need a full stomach
to stay on your feet.

68
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,514
<i>And eat your cucumbers.</i>

69
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,352
I'll push you

70
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,647
further into a corner.

71
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,942
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

72
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,514
<i>Police have seized cash</i>
<i>hidden in a container yard.</i>

73
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,225
<i>The staggering amount</i>
<i>completely filled the 40-foot container…</i>

74
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,644
<i>Bundles of 50,000-won bills</i>
<i>were stacked to the brim,</i>

75
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,312
<i>weighing 26 tons altogether.</i>

76
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,191
<i>What's even more astonishing</i>
<i>is that this isn't the only container.</i>

77
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,571
<i>The amount seized is unprecedented</i>
<i>in the country's history.</i>

78
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,657
<i>We're seeing a series of thefts</i>
<i>targeting containers.</i>

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>As rumors spread about more hidden cash,</i>

80
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,037
<i>similar theft attempts</i>
<i>are occurring nonstop…</i>

81
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>An investigation is underway</i>
<i>as police suspect the stored cash</i>

82
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,002
<i>is criminal proceeds</i>
<i>from gambling and drug trafficking.</i>

83
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,420
Commissioner.

84
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,172
Get that damn phone…

85
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,301
I told you to forward all calls.

86
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,469
You need to take this, sir.

87
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,638
It's the president's office.

88
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:56,143
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

89
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,439
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

90
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,483
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

91
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,860
<i>Why won't you answer your phone?</i>

92
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,695
The commissioner is looking for you.

93
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,572
Bring your guys to the agency right now.

94
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,282
Sorry, but I requested my leave yesterday.

95
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,202
The same goes for my guys.
Tell him we'll be unavailable for a week.

96
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>Do you know what you did?</i>

97
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,706
The president's office just called!

98
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,752
My gosh, it looks like the commissioner
will become a nationwide star.

99
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,339
Sorry, I have to
book my plane tickets now.

100
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,840
Jeez, what's wrong with my phone?

101
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,301
Hello? Hello… Oh… Bye!

102
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,847
This is totally crazy.
It'll take all day to count the money.

103
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,768
Golden Bunny has agreed to testify
in all cases involving Min Ju-yeong.

104
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,062
He'll be transferred
to the SPO for questioning.

105
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:40,979
That's good.

106
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,023
He'll be safe once he's outside of Insung.

107
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,025
With the commissioner
and the mayor scared stiff,

108
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,152
Min Ju-yeong won't be able to
make a move either.

109
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,446
<i>GOPCHANG </i>RESTAURANT
THE VALLEY

110
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,574
Ma'am, please give us
the freshest <i>gopchang</i> you have.

111
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,701
-We're going to stuff ourselves today.
-Welcome back.

112
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,204
But why are there only four of you?

113
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,705
Where's the big guy?

114
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,791
You always came together.

115
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,046
-So a special set for four?
-Yes.

116
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,799
-A special set for four here!
-Okay.

117
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,759
It'd be nice if Jae-hong could join us.

118
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,011
He must be busy,
seeing that he's not answering.

119
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,429
Have you talked to him?

120
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,974
Well, yeah.

121
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,852
But he seems pretty busy.
He can join us next time.

122
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,356
It's still a shame though.

123
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,233
It's not like
we're never going to see him again.

124
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,151
This is frustrating. Let's drink today.

125
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,195
-Can we get some soju?
-Yes, sir.

126
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,954
STOP AT THE STOP LINE
SCHOOL ZONE

127
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,419
You've got some nerve.

128
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,879
I had no idea you had so much money.

129
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,966
How much more do you have?

130
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,552
I'm not sure. I've never counted it.

131
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,639
I guess I had a lot of it.

132
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,978
We should've pulled out
all of Golden Bunny's teeth.

133
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,817
What about the money that's owed to us?

134
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,403
You told us to trust it, and so we did.

135
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,031
What should we trust now?

136
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,657
Don't worry.

137
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,327
You'll receive the payment as promised.

138
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,911
How can we trust you?

139
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,372
The cops are searching everywhere.

140
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,915
That money is as good as gone.

141
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,459
You're not the same as before.

142
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,545
I don't know what you were like before,

143
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,922
but I'm disappointed.

144
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,674
Hey, where are you going?

145
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,845
I don't want to be more disappointed,
so this is it for me.

146
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,975
I'd like to extend…

147
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,562
our contract.

148
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,191
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,610
You have enough Candy.

150
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,570
We got more orders.

151
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,448
How is that any of my business?

152
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,575
Figure out the rest yourself.

153
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,703
If you leave right now,

154
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,914
I can't guarantee the safety of the woman
you're looking for.

155
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,009
Don't mess with her.

156
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,719
Remember what I said.

157
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,971
That bitch is mine.

158
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:23,975
Hey, that's enough.

159
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,979
If you don't let her go,
our deal ends here.

160
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,857
If you move a finger, I'll end you here.

161
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,234
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,985
Not yet.

163
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,490
But I'm about to.

164
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,743
Just like I did back in the day.

165
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,504
You should've done that from the start.

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,345
Honey.

167
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,638
Honey, I'm home--

168
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
Welcome home, Senior Officer Shin.

169
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,808
Go and have dinner.

170
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,106
They were waiting outside
when I got home from work.

171
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,442
Don't lift a finger today.
I'll take care of everything.

172
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,610
I feel so bad though.

173
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:17,821
Hey.

174
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,657
I got some toys your children might like.

175
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,242
I hope that's okay.

176
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,287
That's more than okay,
but what brings you here?

177
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,956
Dong-ju wanted to come.

178
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,253
-Let's take a break and have some snacks.
-Hurry up and come.

179
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,921
You must be tired.

180
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,385
Thank you.

181
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,730
This is really refreshing.

182
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,523
POLICE INVESTIGATE
CASH FOUND AT PORT CONTAINER YARD

183
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,902
Why don't you quit your part-time job?

184
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,322
It'll be a pain in the ass
if you get caught and disciplined.

185
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,407
You saw me?

186
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,533
Of course I did.

187
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,036
You're as big as a mountain.
It's hard to miss you.

188
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,582
I'm sorry I can't join you.

189
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,877
There's nothing to be sorry about.
We know the situation you're in.

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,462
So don't say that.

191
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,798
Things might get worse for you
if you join us now.

192
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,885
If this goes south,
it won't end with disciplinary action.

193
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,139
Look, these two don't care
about getting promoted.

194
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,433
That one's rich, so he's fine.

195
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,144
As for me, I'm already screwed.

196
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:35,524
You can join us later
when things get better.

197
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,486
I put in for a transfer
to Gangwon Province.

198
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,321
Apparently, they offer housing too.

199
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,826
-Sir.
-Yes?

200
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,538
Where should I go, mister?

201
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,083
Gangwon Province is too far away.

202
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,710
Where should I go…

203
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,888
See you.

204
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,973
Dong-ju.

205
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,517
Thanks.

206
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,394
For what?

207
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,813
For not asking me anything.

208
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,156
2013 NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL
DISQUALIFIED: SHIN JAE-HONG, INSUNG

209
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,446
<i>Thank you for being here for me</i>
<i>without saying anything.</i>

210
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,869
I've always been thoughtful.

211
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,167
I'll call you later.

212
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,295
Thanks. Get home safely.

213
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,472
I'll call you later. You go first.

214
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,598
What?

215
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,933
I have to talk to Jong-hyeon.

216
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,730
What kind of talk?

217
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,941
I'll call you. Go.

218
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,487
Okay.

219
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,491
Don't forget to call.

220
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,621
See you.

221
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:01,836
Jong-hyeon.

222
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,341
I don't think I've told you this yet.

223
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,678
-I--
-Han-na.

224
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,432
I'm a little tired right now.

225
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,309
Can we talk some other time?

226
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,149
I'm coming already. Jeez.

227
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,943
What's with the rushing?

228
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,363
What took you so long?

229
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,990
What is it?

230
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,118
Now that I've lost all my money,

231
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,121
you think there's nothing left
to take from me,

232
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,081
dear youngest-ever
departmental chief prosecutor?

233
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,500
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
is taking charge.

234
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,961
I never once thought that, sir.

235
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:44,879
Right?

236
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,089
Of course.

237
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,925
How could I ever forget your kindness?

238
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,886
You almost hurt my feelings there.

239
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,891
My dear smart
departmental chief prosecutor.

240
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,352
Don't forget…

241
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,697
that money isn't the only thing…

242
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,285
in my arsenal.

243
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,871
Yes, sir.

244
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,169
-We have a special guest tonight.
-No, not at all.

245
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,629
I'm sorry for making the atmosphere
so tense.

246
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,631
-Take a seat.
-Hey.

247
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:34,053
Where are you going?
Go sit down. It's okay.

248
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,570
What else do I need?

249
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,370
Come on, not again.

250
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,425
Damn it.

251
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,151
STEAMED BUN

252
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,756
Please, come on!

253
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,857
Are you preparing
for the handover already?

254
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,401
Take your time.
You still have a few days left.

255
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,529
Let's have a team dinner before you go.

256
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,822
You have to come this time.

257
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,615
I will.

258
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,456
LOAN ASSISTANCE FOR ATHLETES

259
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,089
YOUR LOAN APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED
KOREAN SPORT COMMITTEE

260
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,344
Excuse me, sir?

261
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,763
May I use my remaining paid leave days?

262
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,641
Four laptops, three office chairs,
one conference table,

263
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,185
one water purifier,
one Go board, and one <i>Janggi</i> board.

264
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,230
Complimentary coffee,
beverages, and toilet paper.

265
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,733
With the Internet
and the electricity bill…

266
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,152
All right. Here's what you owe me.

267
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,863
You're being so harsh.

268
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,490
Food expenses?

269
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,036
I don't have any money.

270
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,079
I'm freeloading here
because I don't have any funds!

271
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,789
I know you have money.

272
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,958
You swiped the RIU's operating funds.

273
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,084
I'm a web of information.

274
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,295
Watch what you're saying.

275
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,047
I'm a clean, upstanding cop.

276
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,965
I gave you a discount,
so wire the money to me

277
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,675
before I kick you out of here.

278
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,889
Does he have to be that sharp?

279
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,938
What are you doing?

280
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,275
Hey, what are you doing?

281
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,281
Oh, there you are.

282
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,787
Why didn't you answer last night?

283
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,211
I fell asleep while waiting for your call.

284
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,005
What did you two talk about for so long?

285
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,010
Are you still going to stay there?

286
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,221
What?

287
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,307
I told you to come stay with me,
but you still haven't come.

288
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,064
Change your shirt.
You got something on it.

289
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,113
I must've spilled kimchi on myself.

290
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,242
Yoon Dong-ju.

291
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,119
Yeah?

292
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,372
What is it this time?

293
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,874
Are you sure
the doctor said you were okay?

294
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,875
Of course.

295
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,883
If you don't come this time,
I'll never let you into my house again.

296
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,636
Okay, I'll pack my stuff. Let's go.

297
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,264
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

298
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:56,065
-An unattractive pair…
-Coming in together?

299
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,320
-Look at this.
-You're here.

300
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,656
Han-na, over there. Dong-ju, you sit here.

301
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,617
When did you set this up?

302
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,536
Is Jong-hyeon not here yet?

303
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,997
He's looking into things,
so he won't be here for a while.

304
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,249
In the meantime,
we should focus on obtaining

305
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,418
evidence and testimonies
proving Min Ju-yeong's crimes.

306
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,170
What about the RIU
and Seobu Station case files?

307
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,881
Someone's bringing them.

308
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,885
Goodness. Speak of the devil.

309
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,678
What in the world?

310
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:27,722
Jae-hong!

311
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,266
I had some free time.

312
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,854
I'll help as much as I can
before my transfer.

313
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,066
Sounds good.
We need all the help we can get.

314
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,027
-Let's finish this before our leave ends.
-This place is cramped enough as is.

315
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,071
I'm charging extra for another person.

316
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,323
Sit here or over there.

317
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,117
You're the one eating, but I get the bill?

318
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,120
Hey, Dae-yong.

319
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,247
What?

320
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:54,999
Where?

321
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,335
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

322
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,461
Let them through.

323
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,509
What is it? What happened?

324
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,593
Sir.

325
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,056
This stuff left her in this state
in less than ten minutes.

326
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,349
It's on a whole other level.

327
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,857
We caught drug users
at Myeongjin Shopping Complex today.

328
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,567
It's been spreading throughout Insung.

329
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,779
Min Ju-yeong is probably behind this.

330
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,656
That damn bastard.

331
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,951
But why? Is it because he needs money?
Why sell to kids?

332
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,037
Where did she get the drugs?

333
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,539
A handoff was arranged
through a messaging app.

334
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,290
They're searching inside for more.

335
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,836
How old was she? She looks so young.

336
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,045
Sixteen years old.

337
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,339
The same age as Jeong-a.

338
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,011
Did you find anything?

339
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,569
Excuse me.

340
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,742
Hey. It's you, isn't it?

341
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,371
Hey!

342
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,833
You're selling to kids now?

343
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,293
Isn't that way out of line?

344
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,086
You're right.

345
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,173
It's out of line, isn't it?

346
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,844
-I'm not falling for that again. Get up.
-I need that.

347
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,847
Hey, enough with the act. Get up.

348
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,182
Please give me that.

349
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,434
Please.

350
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,330
Hey, get up.

351
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,126
Where's the needle?

352
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,763
You're good at dealing with patients.

353
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,736
Sorry.

354
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,405
You should say that

355
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,033
to the victims of the crap
you and your people pulled.

356
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,077
So save it.

357
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,167
Cuff her.

358
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,380
We finally got Drugmon.

359
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,675
-Let's move.
-Yes, sir.

360
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,679
Move.

361
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,766
-I'll look into it and get back to you.
-Okay.

362
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,520
SERVING THE PEOPLE

363
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:05,648
Yes, Captain.

364
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,818
I just met with the chief
of the Criminal Department.

365
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,405
Golden Bunny will be transferred
to the SPO in Seoul by tomorrow.

366
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,825
-Drugmon?
-<i>That's right.</i>

367
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,368
I'll tell you more when you get back.

368
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,953
Good work. Get back safely.

369
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,208
We'll finish up here,
so bring her in safely.

370
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,584
-Yes, sir.
-Have a good one.

371
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,048
Isn't that Drugmon?

372
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,050
Dong-ju pulled off a big one.

373
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,928
How did you notice her?

374
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,267
You two go to Myeongjin Shopping Complex.

375
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,394
It seems that
Min Ju-yeong is distributing drugs.

376
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,313
Someone must've seen the guys
who made the handoff.

377
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,772
-Look into it.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,692
Right. Seobu Station called this morning.

379
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,154
A Seongnae-dong smuggler associated
with Min Ju-yeong turned themselves in,

380
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,031
and Senior Inspector Kang
is questioning them.

381
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,992
Min Ju-yeong's cronies
are starting to turn their backs on him.

382
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,785
I'm going to Seobu Station.

383
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,412
We'll call you.

384
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,788
Let's go.

385
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,046
<i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>cannot be reached. You will be…</i>

386
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,881
They won't even answer your calls.

387
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,299
This is pathetic.

388
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,426
Looks like the Seongnae-dong guys
turned against us.

389
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,136
Are you going to sit back and do nothing?

390
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,346
No.

391
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,354
Then they won't take me seriously.

392
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,196
What's our dear Dong-ju up to right now?

393
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,783
Hello, sir.
Have you seen anything like this?

394
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,867
No.

395
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,121
-Sir, have you seen a candy that looks--
-I don't know anything.

396
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,790
It could be stashed here.

397
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,833
Why would it be there?

398
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,377
<i>We're not having any luck today.</i>

399
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,420
Is everything on track for the transfer?

400
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,715
-Yeah. I'm sorry I can't help more.
-It's okay.

401
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,384
-Let's go here.
-Okay.

402
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,220
Hello.

403
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,139
Have you seen
this type of candy or wrapper?

404
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,226
THE LOAN APPROVED THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN DECLINED DUE TO UNFORESEEN ISSUES

405
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,437
Hello, have you seen
this type of candy or wrapper?

406
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,605
I don't think so.

407
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,031
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, it's nothing.

408
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,076
Dong-ju, can I take off
for about 30 minutes?

409
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,412
Sure. I just need to check this area.

410
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,205
Thanks. Sorry about this.

411
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,581
It's okay.

412
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,083
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

413
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,318
Stop the car if you want to live.

414
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,655
I'm not sure what to tell you.

415
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,116
Your application was approved,

416
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,953
but one of the review committee members
said additional requirements were needed.

417
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,247
Who's this review committee member?

418
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,332
He's a board member.

419
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,001
His name is Mr. Oh Jong-gu.

420
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,588
Okay.

421
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,799
MR. OH JONG-GU

422
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:25,931
MIDDLE SCHOOLER FOUND DEAD
AFTER TAKING "CANDY"

423
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,683
-What's this?
-"What's this?"

424
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,561
I should be asking you that.

425
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,314
Why is Candy being distributed
without my permission?

426
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,566
You said you'd only sell to the Japanese.

427
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,152
There was a condition
when selling my drug.

428
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,821
Did you forget it?

429
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:45,409
I said that women and children
were off-limits.

430
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,413
I'll look into it.
Don't get too worked up.

431
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,749
Where the hell are you going?

432
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,336
I'm not done talking.

433
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,008
Why all this fuss over a dead kid?

434
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,803
Hey, let's go watch something.

435
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,598
Watch what?

436
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,476
Today is <i>boknal,</i>
one of the hottest days of summer.

437
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,810
It's a perfect day to slaughter the mutt!

438
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,309
Damn it!

439
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,316
Let him go.

440
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,027
That's enough. Good work.

441
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,459
Hey, Dong-ju.

442
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,047
Stop running around.

443
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,051
Your head is bleeding.

444
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,264
Are you trying to run away again?

445
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,892
You have to go through me to do that.

446
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,520
Think you can beat me in that state?

447
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,231
I can take you down no problem.

448
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,192
-You little punk.
-You bastard.

449
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,781
Damn it.

450
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,454
Why do all of these bastards

451
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,039
think I'm a goddamn sucker?

452
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,301
That's how you throw a right hook.

453
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,635
Pretty jarring, huh?

454
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,851
Hey, watch your blood pressure.

455
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,019
If you keep this up,

456
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,272
you'll damage your optic nerve

457
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,398
and go blind.

458
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,610
What the hell are you talking about?

459
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,696
What?

460
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,907
Did you think I didn't know?

461
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,328
I know you're punch-drunk.

462
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,378
You idiot.

463
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,757
I used to be your coach, remember?

464
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,467
Of course, I caught that.

465
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,762
I knew it way back in 2018.

466
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,848
You wanted to win the gold
and earn the pension that came with it

467
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,809
to pay for Gyeong-il's surgery,

468
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,144
so you took those painkillers
and got in the ring.

469
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,272
I guess taking care of him
wasn't enough for you.

470
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,858
Now you're taking care of his mom too.

471
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,779
Seeing you as her caregiver
brings tears to my eyes.

472
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,241
It would've been a really touching story

473
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,701
had Gyeong-il known this
before he croaked.

474
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,702
Don't you agree?

475
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,663
You son of a bitch.

476
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,795
Didn't I tell you
that's not how you throw a right hook?

477
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,300
You should've paid attention

478
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,680
when I taught you, you bastard.

479
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,024
Goddammit.

480
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,896
JAE-HONG, DONG-JU

481
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,778
Dong-ju!

482
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:38,697
Yoon Dong-ju!

483
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,491
Dong-ju!

484
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,814
Jae-hong, where's Dong-ju?

485
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,863
Senior Officer Shin.

486
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,575
Shin Jae-hong!

487
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:25,869
What the hell happened?

488
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,791
Dung-ju disappeared…

489
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,086
while I was gone.

490
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,343
STEAMED BUN

491
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,543
Your face is a mess.

492
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,421
Did you really think
everything would be over

493
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,297
after the count and the 12th round?

494
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
I told you.

495
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,969
You're in my ring.

496
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,304
We don't need rules or the law

497
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,724
because I'm the referee here.

498
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,854
Come here.

499
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,539
I hear you're quite unwell.

500
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,210
They say you can't recognize people
and you'll lose use of your limbs

501
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,962
if your condition worsens.

502
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,590
You should've gotten treatment
instead of following me.

503
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,843
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

504
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,683
Seeing that I recognize the bastard
I need to beat the shit out of,

505
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,644
I'm still fine.

506
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,397
Such tough talk.

507
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,109
There's no time
for you to go to a hospital,

508
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,488
so I'll have to treat you myself.

509
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,746
Come here. Let's get you fixed up.

510
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,122
-Let go of me.
-Hey.

511
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,290
Keep still.

512
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:38,752
This is good stuff.

513
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,255
The patient is ready, Dr. Min.

514
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,217
-Don't do it.
-Keep still.

515
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,260
It's quality stuff. Don't worry.

516
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,599
This will sting a bit.

517
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,829
So?

518
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,998
Do you feel better
now that you've seen the little mutt?

519
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,918
Yeah, I do.

520
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,880
Did you give him all of that?

521
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,048
It's over the lethal dose.

522
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,556
Is it?

523
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,682
Oh, dear.

524
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,101
I guess I made a mistake.

525
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,941
I did think that something was off.

526
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,365
I was wondering
what to fill this up with again.

527
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,660
Now I see it'd be perfect for you.

528
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,704
Isn't that nice of me?

529
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,457
I'm such a good friend
for giving you a big, sturdy coffin.

530
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,217
You'll be okay after a while.

531
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,181
It's been fun.

532
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,392
Enjoy your trip…

533
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,188
to the afterlife.

534
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,362
Escort him safely to the port.

535
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,042
Don't fight it. It'll make the pain worse.

536
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,587
Hold out for ten minutes.

537
00:41:56,473 --> 00:42:00,352
Man, I didn't know you had it in you.

538
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,853
How did you catch him?

539
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,689
Asshole.

540
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,110
Don't just stand there. Lock it up!

541
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,166
Captain.

542
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,459
What's going on?

543
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,921
I'm sorry, Senior Officer Ji.

544
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,260
BANG

545
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,389
AN DAE-YONG

546
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,015
Hey.

547
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,809
We lost Drugmon.

548
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,229
-I'm sorry.
-You goddamn idiot!

549
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,108
Why the hell can't you do your job?

550
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,568
Whatever, I'm hanging up!

551
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,830
What happened to cameras one and five?

552
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,165
Why are the feeds gone?
How much did they give you?

553
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,583
Look at me!

554
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,377
I said look at me!

555
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,442
Hold out for ten minutes.

556
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:48,626
Ten minutes,

557
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,795
I can handle.

558
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,351
What the hell?

559
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,897
Hey, what the hell is he doing?

560
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,273
That crazy mutt!

561
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:20,635
Hey!

562
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,639
We can't have a little mutt
run away on <i>boknal</i>!

563
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,811
Let him go. He's not getting away anyway.

564
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,559
Excuse me.

565
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,436
Please help. Please!

566
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,787
Sir, please save me.

567
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,547
Call the cops.

568
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,593
<i>A suspect involved in harming</i>
<i>innocent bystanders fled the scene.</i>

569
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:29,180
<i>The suspect on the run is Officer Yoon</i>
<i>of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency</i>

570
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,682
<i>who is under disciplinary review.</i>

571

572
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,728
<i>that is extremely addictive and fatal…</i>

573
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,746
Taxi!

574
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,958
Taxi!

575
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,126
<i>Myungjin Park entrance.</i>

576
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,087
<i>Trails left by the suspect have been found</i>
<i>at the Myungjin Park entrance.</i>

577
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,464
<i>Witness says the suspect was stabbed.</i>

578
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,675
<i>The suspect is likely drug-impaired</i>

579
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,927

00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,229
<i>Suspect was seen</i>
<i>fleeing to Eungcheon-dong.</i>

584
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,731
<i>Request backup from nearby patrol units.</i>

585
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,692
<i>Multiple vehicles collided</i>

586
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,283
POLICE PURSUE FUGITIVE OFFICER YOON

587
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,586
VICTORY GYM

588
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,381
Can we take a look at this intersection?

589
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,637
Where are you, Dung-ju?

590
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,198
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

591
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,076
Yes, Captain.

592
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,786
Sergeant Kim, are you up to speed?

593
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,579
I was just reading the article.
What happened?

594
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,540
We have to find Dong-ju
before the other officers do.

595
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,960
He's heading toward Eungcheon-dong
from Myungjin-dong. I'll check it out.

596
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,629
I'll head over there too.

597
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,468
A quiet exit would've been nice,
but he's making quite the ruckus.

598
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,726
If that's what he wants…

599
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,065
I'll turn up the noise for him.

600
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,208
Have you seen this man?

601
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,169
No.

602
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,510
What happened? Did you find Dong-ju?

603
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:14,053
Not yet.

604
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,723
By the way, Insung is in utter chaos.

605
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,099
I know that already!

606
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,478
I don't think you do. Min Ju-yeong
put a huge bounty on Dong-ju's head.

607
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,064
-Over here, boss.
-Hold on.

608
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,984
-Is his info solid?
-It is, boss.

609
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,861
We have to find him first.

610
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,988
Don't worry about a thing, boss.

611
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,574
We can't live like this forever.
We need to make it big.

612
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,702
All the gangs
and even the local street rats in Insung

613
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,371
are hunting down Dong-ju right now.

614
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,957
-Yes!
-Let's do this!

615
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,041
It's 100 million won!

616
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,711
-Let's kill him! 100 million won!
-By the way, that's a fine-looking dude.

617
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:47,670
YOON DONG-JU / 32 Y/O / 182 CM

618
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:48,921
The bastard's info is up.

619
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,800
Hey, it's up!

620
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,095
Let's go get 100 million won!

621
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,555
I'll round up the guys!

622
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,436
Those damn street rats.

623
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,024
<i>I'm not sure</i>

624
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,068
if I can accept something like this.

625
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,695
Why? Do you think it's fake?

626
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,614
It's not that.

627
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,827
This has a strange power.

628
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:22,955
It's nothing special,
but when I put this on,

629
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,958
it feels like I've become
an important person.

630
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,294
I hold my head a little higher.

631
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,137
If I may ask,

632
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,766
is there something
you want me to do in return?

633
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,560
Don't do anything.

634
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,397
That's all I ask.

635
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,693
Don't do a single thing.

636
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,319
From Buk-dong to Myungjin-dong,

637
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,530
then Eungcheon-dong…

638
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,707
<i>The door is open.</i>

639
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,458
<i>The door is locked.</i>

640
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,543
Yoon Dong-ju.

641
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:52,253
Yoon Dong-ju!

642
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,881
Yoon Dong-ju!

643
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,008
Yoon Dong-ju.

644
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:39,842
Yoon Dong-ju.

645
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,847
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Wake up!

646
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,060
Yoon Dong-ju, get up.

647
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,979
Let's get you up. Come on.

648
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,442
Get up.

649
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:10,790
What are you doing?

650
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,000
Let go, or else he'll die.

651
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:17,922
Dong-ju.

652
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,751
Are you okay?

653
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,178
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay?

654
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,639
Take him to a hospital
and flush his system.

655
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,725
He won't last if he goes into shock again.

656
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,520
Come on. Let's go.

657
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,293
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

658
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,214
You found him? How is he?

659
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,384
Not good.
We need to get him to a hospital quickly.

660
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,012
Not Insung University Hospital.
They'll be all over the place.

661
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,973
-<i>Meet me in Seongjin City.</i>
-Okay. We'll be there in 20 minutes.

662
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,550
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay? Yoon Dong-ju!

663
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,012
Are you busy?

664
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,308
Hand that damned little mutt over!

665
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,062
Let go, you bastard!

666
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,692
Hey, what are you doing?

667
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:44,610
Get back here!

668
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,573
It's here.

669
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,742
Our food is here. Go get it.

670
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,494
Hurry up.

671
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,374
<i>Jjamppong </i>is the best on a rainy day.

672
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,137
What?

673
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,057
Hello.

674
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,997
What's going on? Why aren't you here yet?

675
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,457
Captain, I don't think
we can get out of Insung.

676
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,667
We were just attacked.

677
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,794
And Dong-ju is in bad condition.

678
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:45,880
What should we do then?

679
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:52,261
HANO GLASS

680
00:57:58,851 --> 00:57:59,685
KIM JONG-HYEON

681
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,021
Damn it.

682
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,154
What is it?

683
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,123
So? Did you make a decision?

684
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:23,209
I told you to send it
through Secretary Kim.

685
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:24,627
Did you have to come bother me?

686
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:26,879
What happened to your car?

687
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:36,889
Isn't that…

688
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:43,354
Why did you bring that bastard here?

689
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:44,813
What are you playing at?

690
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,318
Help us.

691
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,153
We need a place to stay and a doctor.

692
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,238
Damn it.

693
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,032
Did that bullet mess up your mind or what?

694
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,910
This is the Prosecutors' Office,
and I'm a prosecutor, you little shit.

695
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,746
Are you asking me
to help a criminal escape?

696
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,634
I signed the document

697
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,594
you gave me in the hospital.

698
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,056
I'll hand over all my shares to you.

699
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,313

701
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,654
Still causing trouble recklessly, huh?

702
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:37,825
How typical of you.

703
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,456
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

704
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,874
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

705
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:49,128
His internal injuries are pretty severe.

706
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,463
Don't you think
he needs a thorough examination?

707
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,676
He may have other issues
I might've missed,

708
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:57,928
so monitor him closely.

709
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,222
Okay.

710
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,357
I stopped the bleeding,

711
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:14,528
but it'll be a tough recovery for him
until the drug is completely flushed out.

712
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,114
You need to get him to a hospital
as soon as you can.

713
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,450
He's in critical condition.

714
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,702
All right.

715
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,458
Thank you. Good night.

716
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,961
Thank you.

717
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:50,814
I know he's your brother,
but he did a number on us.

718
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,816
-Can we trust him?
-We can.

719
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,487
He never makes deals
where he stands to lose.

720
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,284
You have three days.
That's the best I can do.

721
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,537
Is this really worth
giving all that up though?

722
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,046
Dong-ju.

723
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,382
I'm here.

724
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:18,509
Look at me.

725
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,261
Dong-ju.

726
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,348
Please look at me.

727
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,101
Yoon Dong-ju.

728
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:02,302
You'll be okay.

729
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:06,682
Just hang in there.

730
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,684
You'll be okay.

731
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,645
You'll pull through.

732
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,065
It's…

733
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:16,984
It's okay.

734
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,820
It's okay.

735
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,083
I'm sorry.

736
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,043
This is all my fault.

737
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,380
I should've been with him,
but I left because of a stupid loan.

738
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,050
How is this your fault? That's enough.
Don't beat yourself up.

739
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,636
Does he have to be on the run like this?

740
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,181
He's hell-bent on killing Dong-ju.

741
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,144
He won't stop until he does.

742
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,439
This will only end
if we catch Min Ju-yeong.
