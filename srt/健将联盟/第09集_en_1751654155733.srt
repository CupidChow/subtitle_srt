1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,060
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,520
Prêts?

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,060
Allez.

5
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,900
Kim Jong-hyeon goes in for an attack.

6
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,230
Roger successfully parries
and lands a riposte.

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,780
Halt. Attack parried. Riposte awarded.

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,450
Is something wrong with his ankle?

9
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,780
Kim Jong-hyeon is having trouble
lunging forward today.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

11
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,550
The slowed footwork is making
his movements more exaggerated,

12
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,340
leaving him exposed to more attacks.

13
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,680
An attack point.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,100
Roger scores a point.

15
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,770
What are you doing? Get up.

16
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,690
His opponent is left-handed,

17
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,610
so he has to read his moves
and anticipate the incoming attacks.

18
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,330
En garde.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
Prêts?

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,170
Allez.

21
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,220
-What was that?
-Oh, my.

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,890
-What happened?
-What?

23
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,060
What just happened?

24
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
There's been an unexpected turn of events.

25
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,270
It appears that the blade snapped suddenly

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,570
and pierced his mask from beneath.

27
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,780
This doesn't look good at all.

28
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,200
This is truly unfortunate.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,870
Let's hope his eye injury
isn't too serious.

30
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,500
Jong-hyeon, are you okay?

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,690
Are you sure you're okay?

32
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,770
I can continue.

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I can do this.

34
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,160
I can do this.

35
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,540
En garde.

36
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,420
Prêts?

37
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,500
Allez.

38
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,440
Wait. I'm hurt.

39
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,770
Look at this idiot here.

40
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,100
Hey, does this scare you?

41
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,060
Does it?

42
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,980
Does it scare you?

43
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,230
Are you afraid?

44
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,110
What happened to Superman?

45
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,620
You were flying around a while ago,
but now you're shaking.

46
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,160
Come over here. Come on!

47
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,830
Damn it.

48
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,870
You asshole!

49
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,170
Darn, I missed.

50
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Hey, you.

51
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,480
My guy here doesn't even care for needles.
Why are you bullying him?

52
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,150
He's with you? I didn't know.

53
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
It's okay.

54
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,280
Now you know.

55
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,160
And now you have to pay
for messing him up.

56
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,820
You little hamster.

57
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,330
A hamster?

58
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,910
You son of a bitch!

59
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,880
You asshole.

60
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,510
You little shit.

61
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
You asshole.

62
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,490
Get up.

63
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,030
We're just getting started.

64
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,670
Yoon Dong-ju!

65
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,940
Mr. Min!

66
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,480
Hey!

67
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,030
Are you dead?

68
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,410
You're still alive.

69
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,580
How does it feel

70
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,540
lying in the street?

71
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,840
Not like the ring, is it?

72
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,270
You can scheme and plot all you want,

73
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,180
but this is the outcome.

74
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,980
Why do you make things hard for yourself?

75
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,150
That's what sets me apart,

76
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,070
you dirty asshole.

77
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,620
Save the childish games for the ring.

78
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,580
I told you before.

79
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,330
Don't even dream

80
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,630
about fighting for justice.

81
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,250
You see…

82
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,340
we risk our lives for this.

83
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Today…

84
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,310
is going to be a very memorable day.

85
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,230
You can look forward to it.

86
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,310
Here. Jab.

87
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,320
Childish games?

88
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,040
Those of us stepping into the ring…

89
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,830
risk our lives just the same.

90
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,380
Consider yourselves lucky!

91
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,390
Hey, little mutt.
Move unless you want to die.

92
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,650
You okay?

93
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,190
What about you?

94
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,320
-Where's Han-na?
-We have to go find her.

95
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,410
Hey!

96
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,910
That's going to leave a scar
on your pretty face.

97
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,660
What are you doing, you idiots?

98
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,870
Move your cars. Snap to it!

99
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,340
Get the goods and go!

100
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,720
Hurry up.

101
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Let's go.

102
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,060
Han-na!

103
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
-Ji Han-na!
-Han-na!

104
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,110
Han-na.

105
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Han-na!

106
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,250
Han-na.

107
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,330
Han-na?

108
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,500
Ji Han-na!

109
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,130
She's not here.

110
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Han-na!

111
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,220
Han-na!

112
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,640
Sergeant Kim!

113
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
You okay, Dong-ju?
What about the motorcycle?

114
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,310
Are you okay, Captain?

115
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,600
I think I dozed off a bit.

116
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,980
That's not important.
Where's Senior Officer Ji?

117
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,610
I can't reach her on the phone.

118
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,400
There's no way to contact her.
What do we do?

119
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,110
What's the matter with the signal?

120
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,620
This whole area is like that.

121
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,740
The nearby cell tower is acting up.

122
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,250
I hear it's going to take a while
to fix it.

123
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,080
This all happened
after the riot police pulled out.

124
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,500
They trapped our guys here
and attacked as planned.

125
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,800
Isn't there a tracker on the container?

126
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,130
It's right here.

127
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,130
It's busted.

128
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,350
Guys, they set us up.

129
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,430
Jae-hong's in bad shape.

130
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,810
He's heading to the hospital,
but his lower back is wrecked.

131
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,640
After the Jungdong Tunnel,

132
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,440
the road forks off to Seo-dong,
Cheoli-dong, and Cheolsam-dong.

133
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,610
Seeing how they cut off the network
and all the surrounding CCTVs,

134
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,980
they're very meticulous.

135
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,150
You'll need backup to catch them by today.

136
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,570
Think you can manage it?

137
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,410
We have to keep looking.

138
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,580
Han-na will be there.

139
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,250
-Your belongings are in the back seat.
-Thank you.

140
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,960
I'll check in with Jae-hong first

141
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,630
and then head to the agency for backup.

142
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,550
Go to the hospital with the captain
and get checked out.

143
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,060
I said go to the hospital.

144
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,190
Kim Jong-hyeon.

145
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,650
We have to find Han-na.

146
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,940
You're in no shape to do that.

147
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,030
I'll go find her myself.

148
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,240
Then get in the car. There's no time.

149
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,910
Get out of the way.

150
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,040
Just get in. I'll drive.

151
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,300
Get it together
if you want to find Han-na.

152
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,190
The road forks
to Cheoli-dong and Seo-dong here.

153
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,110
Let's make a stop here.

154
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,960
Which way did they go?

155
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,660
This is Han-na's.

156
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,390
I'll look in this direction.

157
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,930
Okay.

158
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,990
Yoon Dong-ju!

159
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,650
I found something.

160
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,290
I think it's that way.

161
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,350
This is Han-na's, right?

162
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,270
Yeah, it is.

163
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,690
Hang on. Stop the car.

164
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,950
The phone's busted.

165
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,790
It's hers, right?

166
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,760
Let's get going.

167
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,930
Hurry up!

168
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,350
What are you waiting for?

169
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,060
Hurry up and get moving!

170
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,180
Check the goods carefully!

171
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,480
Hurry up!

172
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,940
Unload all this before sundown!

173
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,110
Get the doors open. Are the goods secure?

174
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,860
Go over everything.

175
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,200
Hey, the trucks are here.

176
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,960
They divided the goods
and split up to avoid getting tracked.

177
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,010
They had multiple vehicles,
judging by the tire tracks.

178
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,400
Four, one, three, one.

179
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,030
What's this?

180
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,050
INSUNG 96
P4131

181
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,220
I think it's a license plate number.

182
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,850
-We have to find this truck quickly.
-Hold on.

183
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,190
Captain, can you run a plate number

184
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,360
for a truck ending in 4131?

185
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
Thank you.

186
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,660
Let's go back to the agency
and check all the working CCTVs.

187
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Captain, did you run…

188
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait a second. I'm getting a call.

189
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,420
It's the senior superintendent.

190
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,670
Just decline.

191
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,930
What's this about?
We don't have time. Where's our backup?

192
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,470
Backup, my ass.

193
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,640
If we get caught, we can't do anything.

194
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,430
Our hands will be tied.

195
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,230
How dare this bastard not answer my call?

196
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,060
The person you are calling cannot…

197
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,650
-Dong-ju isn't answering either.
-Neither is Sergeant Kim.

198
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,060
Hey, let's go over there to listen in.

199
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,990
I've had it with these idiots.

200
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,290
Do you really not know
where Go Man-sik is?

201
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,080
I saw him at the tunnel, but after that…

202
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,410
After that?

203
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,710
I haven't seen him at all since.

204
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,460
If I do, I'll bring him in immediately.

205
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,420
Look, it's Go Man-sik!

206
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
There he is! Oh, wait.

207
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,300
Jeez, that's not him.

208
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,680
-Cut it out, you punk.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,720
He's gone now.

210
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,690
So 96 P4131 is an unregistered vehicle.

211
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,440
Senior Officer Shin requested
the traffic unit to track its route,

212
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,990
-so something will come up.
-Isn't Jae-hong in the hospital?

213
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,320
Over there.

214
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,910
Jae-hong.

215
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,750
How's your back? Is it really bad?

216
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,620
No, I just sprained it.

217
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,710
What about you two?

218
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,580
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

219
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,920
We need to find Senior Officer Ji.
I can't just lie down and wait.

220
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,840
I need to do what I can.
I'd feel more at ease that way.

221
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,100
He's right. We have to do
whatever it takes to locate her.

222
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,680
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

223
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,390
Hop in.

224
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,640
-I have to get back in?
-Get in.

225
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,190
Who is it?

226
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,980
Do you know what time it is?

227
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,860
Who the hell are you?

228
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,240
For goodness' sake.

229
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,160
Who are these guys with the ugly mugs?

230
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,250
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

231
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,710
What are you doing here at this hour?
I need sleep to survive.

232
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,790
I was dreaming about getting married.

233
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,960
And why do you all look like crap?

234
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,840
Something happened.
So did you look into it?

235
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,050
I'm a private investigator,
not a pawnshop owner.

236
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,970
I'm a pawnshop owner,
not a private investigator.

237
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,010
What?

238
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,680
-Thank you.
-What do you think you're doing?

239
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,730
Look at you,
blatantly taking advantage of me.

240
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,100
Our country produced Nobel laureates.
You should have better manners than this.

241
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,900
Just wait a bit.
They said they'd get back to me.

242
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,530
Here's the truck with the 4131 plate,

243
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,950
spotted at the Seo-dong Intersection.

244
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,120
From here, it took Route 23,

245
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,330
but there's no footage of where it went.

246
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,090
Route 23 is right there.

247
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,850
But there are too many exits.

248
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,430
They're all side roads,
so we can't check them all.

249
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,350
We'll have to check footage
for every truck that took Route 23.

250
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,730
They would've needed many trucks
to move all the goods in the container.

251
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
We should look into
where those trucks came from.

252
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,200
-What about Oh Jong-gu?
-It's not him.

253
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,040
He's right. Oh Jong-gu's drivers
are at the City Hall protest.

254
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,830
I don't even know where to begin.

255
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,090
Hello?

256
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,720
I've got it, okay?

257
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,090
Yeah?

258
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Right.

259
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,060
What?

260
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,440
I see.

261
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,730
Oh, sure.

262
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,810
Okay.

263
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,480
-You got word?
-You were right.

264
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,900
Gwang-se contacted a broker to stow away.

265
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,490
-Where?
-Dageum Port, 4 a.m., the Geumdong.

266
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,830
Let's ask the bald eagle.

267
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,370
Geumdong, where are you? I'm here.

268
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,210
Damn it, where is it?

269
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,380
Hey, Geumdong.

270
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
Is that you, Geumdong?

271
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,010
Hey. Can you help me with this?

272
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,220
Hey, Gwang-se.

273
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,510
You're just asking for trouble
if you whistle at night.

274
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,600
-Hello, sir.
-Are you happy to see me?

275
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,730
Yes.

276
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,350
-Hey, be careful.
-Damn it. How did he know I'd be here?

277
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,940
What am I going to do?

278
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm disappointed.

279
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,410
I thought you were on our side.

280
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,030
You're all here.

281
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,250
That's adorable.

282
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,580
Is that what you got from Min Ju-yeong
after selling us out?

283
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,210
No, I bought this myself.

284
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,960
It's a gift for my daughter in Vietnam.

285
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,260
It even has a mustache.

286
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,970
Not that.

287
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
I mean what's inside.

288
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,440
-Hey.
-Hold him still!

289
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,320
Oh, jeez.

290
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,110
What's this?

291
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,660
Are you trading drugs now, you bastard?

292
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,580
What's the penalty
for trafficking drug precursors?

293
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,950
-Wait, what?
-Ten years.

294
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,330
-That's right. Ten years.
-These aren't drugs.

295
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,080
It's the medicine I got for my cold.

296
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,130
We have no time to waste.
Are you going to talk or not?

297
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,390
Stop drinking. Haven't you had enough?

298
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,930
I have to dilute it somehow.

299
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,220
I took so much of it. What if it kills me?

300
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,440
Too much water can kill you too.
Give it here and start talking.

301
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,690
Just leave him be.

302
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,190
Go ahead and drink more.

303
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,150
I don't drink water when I compete.
Do you know why?

304
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,990
One wrong punch in the gut
after drinking water…

305
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,040
could burst your organs.

306
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,210
A bowel rupture hurts so much
that you'll wish you were dead.

307
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm done drinking.

308
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,760
Gosh, I'm full. I should stop now.

309
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,260
Now start talking.

310
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,930
I'm not in the mood
to joke around anymore.

311
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,840
Tell us everything. Every last detail.

312
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,140
Then promise you'll protect me this time.

313
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,100
I can't keep risking my life
like this anymore.

314
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,040
I only heard that they were dealing
with the Japanese.

315
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,040
The Japanese? Like the yakuza?

316
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,290
Where's the deal going down?

317
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,090
Golden Bunny. I bet he'll know where.

318
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,760
He was in charge of all deals
with the yakuza.

319
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,510
Are you not going to say anything?

320
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Oh Jong-gu took over
all of your operations.

321
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,480
You're dead broke now.

322
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,900
So why are you still loyal
to Min Ju-yeong?

323
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,900
Your trial is still ongoing, right?

324
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,070
I hear you're exercising
your right to remain silent.

325
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,200
If you keep it up,
you'll likely be found guilty

326
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,620
of all charges against you.

327
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,080
You'll end up taking the fall

328
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,330
for Min Ju-yeong's crimes.

329
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,960
Guess you won't see
your younger brother, Silver Bunny.

330
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,170
He'll be dead by the time you get out.

331
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,970
You met with Min Ju-yeong, didn't you?

332
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,540
What did you do to my brother?

333
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,830
He's still alive.

334
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,040
So…

335
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,550
If you want me to talk…

336
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,800
go find my brother.

337
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,770
PROGRESSIVE CORRECTIONS
FOR A BETTER FUTURE

338
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,520
It looks like Min Ju-yeong came by.

339
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,400
He got Golden Bunny
to keep his mouth shut.

340
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,190
It seems his younger brother
is being used as leverage.

341
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,820
How will we find Silver Bunny?

342
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,490
We issued an APB for him over a month ago,
but there hasn't been a single tip.

343
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,910
That means he fled the country.

344
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,790
Do you think Min Ju-yeong
knows his whereabouts?

345
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,960
Let's go look for Han-na for now.

346
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,250
Where do we even start?

347
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,590
It's been almost a day
since we heard from her.

348
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,880
If we don't find her soon…

349
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,640
Stop talking nonsense, Kim Jong-hyeon.

350
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,270
I know Han-na is holding up.

351
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,140
If only we could track her location.

352
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,770
Wherever it is,
Golden Bunny conducted his deals there.

353
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,570
We'll comb through his files
and find the areas he was active in.

354
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,070
That'll take a lot of time.

355
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,860
We don't have any other options.

356
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,570
We have to do everything we can.

357
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,290
I couldn't bring
all the files from the agency.

358
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,500
The RIU will take care of the rest.

359
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,330
How many crimes did he commit?
Why is there so much?

360
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,630
This is all he did over the past 20 years.

361
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,420
I'm sure we'll find something fishy.

362
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,510
METH SMUGGLING
AND VACANT PROPERTY BURGLARY CASE

363
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,930
Sumang-dong, Okmi-gu.

364
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,260
-Sumang-dong, Okmi-gu.
-Daeri-dong.

365
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,560
Which Daeri-dong? Oh, here it is.

366
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,730
-Bumyeong-dong, Jung-gu.
-Bumyeong-dong, Jung-gu.

367
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,520
Help us with our search,

368
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,110
or I'll make you a bald eagle.

369
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,070
Could I start after I eat?

370
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,620
I was so busy running yesterday
that I haven't eaten a thing.

371
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,240
I feel dizzy.

372
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:54,120
I'd be so grateful
for a bowl of ox bone soup.

373
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,000
It'll help wash down
the squeaker in my throat.

374
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Be grateful that I haven't killed you yet.

375
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,130
Thank you, sir.

376
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,450
North Port in Choryeon 1-dong, Jung-gu.

377
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,130
Hey, this is good.

378
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,970
Can I have one too?

379
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,050
-It's good.
-So give me one.

380
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,550
Keep working.

381
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,060
Are you telling me
you're not doing anything?

382
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,230
Haven't you seen the news?

383
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,690
What do you mean?

384
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,810
It's absolute chaos here.

385
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,020
You shouldn't have acted so violently

386
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,440
without reporting your rally
ahead of time.

387
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,320
I didn't throw that soju bottle, did I?

388
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,490
Come on. Calm down, sir.

389
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,070
How can I calm down?

390
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,950
I trust you.

391
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,160
This is a direct act of defiance
against governmental authority…

392
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,330
So how badly was he hurt?

393
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,250
He has a one-centimeter cut
on his forehead.

394
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,880
In any case, it's crazy here right now,
so we can't provide backup.

395
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
You…

396
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,340
Damn it.

397
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,140
He's putting on a ridiculous show
just to keep us from catching a criminal!

398
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,180
How can we not investigate
when one of our own is missing?

399
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,560
I'm so pissed right now.

400
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,020
I'm going straight
to that damn commissioner and…

401
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,730
Get back in here.

402
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,360
Authorities are looking
for a man in his thirties

403
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,690
who fled the scene
after throwing a soju bottle…

404
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,610
We didn't expect help anyway.

405
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,990
We'll find her ourselves.

406
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,410
It's unlike you to be so calm.
I thought you'd be losing your shit.

407
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm holding back.

408
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,380
Finding Han-na is our priority.

409
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,720
I'll lose my shit…

410
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,970
once I find her.

411
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,810
INSUNG POLICE COMMISSIONER
TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH

412
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,350
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

413
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,610
Is that really Dong-ju?

414
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,950
He's finally acting like a real cop.

415
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,330
BANG

416
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,440
You should get some rest. You look tired.

417
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,980
I could say the same thing to you.

418
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,280
Get some rest yourself
before you pass out.

419
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,430
Please check out the sample first.

420
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,100
Something came up,

421
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,100
so the goods
will have to be sent in installments.

422
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,600
But let's seal the deal here tonight.

423
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,910
He says he was due the goods yesterday
and that this wasn't the agreement.

424
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,160
I just said something came up.

425
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,460
I thought what mattered
was the goods' quality.

426
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,260
He says he can't trust the goods
because you broke your word.

427
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,520
I'll give you a present.

428
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,030
I play

429
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,700
an essential role in this organization…

430
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,120
as an interpreter.

431
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
So?

432
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,590
Did I earn back your trust?

433
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,050
Not satisfied?

434
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,970
What about now?

435
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,810
Are you satisfied?

436
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,680
Jeez, Insung sure has gotten big.

437
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,230
These are all the locations
connected to Golden Bunny.

438
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,980
Jeez, that's a lot.

439
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,820
Ruling out places under new ownership
or ones repurposed

440
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,230
will help narrow it down.

441
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,700
Let's scout the places
where the deal is likely to occur.

442
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,280
Okay. We'll let you know
if anything comes up.

443
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,570
And take this guy with you.

444
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,410
He knows every corner of Insung.

445
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,580
-He'll be of help. Go.
-Okay.

446
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,750
That was my first bite.

447
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,210
Please, I was about to have my first bite.

448
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,210
Let me have a bite before we go. Please!

449
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,550
I'm not done yet.

450
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,660
-Are all the goods on board?
-Yes, boss.

451
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,410
-Well done.
-Thank you, sir.

452
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,740
Oh, damn.

453
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,160
This looks expensive.

454
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,450
Don't touch what isn't yours, you rat.

455
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,580
Who are you calling a rat?

456
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,120
You, of course. Who else?

457
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,380
You hamster.

458
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,090
Do you have a death wish?

459
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,260
-Me?
-What's this?

460
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,630
This is top-shelf.

461
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,300
Screw you.

462
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
Sorry.

463
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,770
This is for someone else.

464
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,350
I'll get something better for you.

465
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,560
My black cat.

466
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,820
Someone else? Who?

467
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,190
Just someone.

468
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,530
Come on, tell me. Who?

469
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,910
You're not going to tell me?

470
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,930
"Presumed to be a .30 caliber
Russian-made Tokarev."

471
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,140
"Possible involvement
of Russian mafia gang, 'Black Cat.'"

472
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,520
My black cat.

473
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,180
What are you doing?

474
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,560
Why bother? There's nothing there.

475
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,430
-This isn't it.
-Let's move on.

476
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,390
You're going to Jangpo next, right?

477
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,520
Take a right out of here. It's faster.

478
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,990
Should we try this area?

479
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,450
Which area are you talking about?

480
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,530
GEUMPO SHIPYARD

481
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Here.

482
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,330
Where? Tell me where.

483
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,210
GEUMPO…

484
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,820
My black cat.

485
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Seriously.

486
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,900
Look who it is.
A cute little rat snuck aboard.

487
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,450
Hey, catch that bitch!

488
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,620
Get her!

489
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,210
Are you serious? You can't catch one girl?

490
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,630
Get over here!

491
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,060
Mr. Min, you're the best.

492
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,600
Damn it.

493
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,690
I wasted the wine I got
to celebrate the ship's departure.

494
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,860
-Go through her pockets.
-Hey.

495
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,280
Nothing on her?

496
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,240
Not even a cell phone?

497
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,000
What's going on?

498
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,210
You followed us here all alone?

499
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,550
I can't tell if you're brave or stupid.

500
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,180
Hey, get her up.

501
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,480
Man, you look even prettier like this.

502
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,860
I'm not here for you to admire.
Don't touch me.

503
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,700
There's definitely something about her.

504
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,950
You little bitch.

505
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,620
She's got an attitude
like someone else I know.

506
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,540
Cop or not, you end up as fish food
once you're chopped up.

507
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,080
I'll carve you up nicely.

508
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Come on now.

509
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,220
Shouldn't we avoid bloodshed
on departure day?

510
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,720
It's bad luck.

511
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,600
I guess you're right.

512
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,610
I'm not a hopeless bad guy
who beats up women.

513
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,450
But earlier,

514
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,490
I was flustered and couldn't help it.

515
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,200
I hope you understand.

516
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,620
That must've hurt.

517
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,580
She followed us here.
Why wouldn't you kill her?

518
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,130
We'll send her somewhere nice.

519
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,050
You'll like it too.

520
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,840
It's a pretty great place.

521
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,180
If it's that great of a place,

522
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,350
the fare must cost a lot.

523
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,260
Don't worry.

524
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,140
Since we know each other,
I'll give you the ticket free of charge.

525
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,140
Lots of empty seats, you see.

526
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,530
-Let go of me!
-You bitch!

527
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,290
I didn't want you to be lonely.

528
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,210
They can't talk, so it'll be quiet.

529
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,840
I guess I should thank you.

530
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,890
The ship will sway a bit.

531
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,600
If you feel sick, just tough it out.

532
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,640
It's a small space,
and there's no ventilation.

533
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,730
After about a week,

534
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,190
my guys will let you off
in the middle of the Pacific.

535
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,490
You'll float in the ocean for a while…

536
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,950
and sink to the bottom.

537
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,200
If you're lucky enough
to survive until then, that is.

538
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,580
In any case,

539
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,250
I hope you enjoy your trip.

540
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,670
We're behind schedule.
Let's have the ship depart by 3 a.m.

541
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,630
Just one question.

542
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,180
All right. Ask away.

543
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,730
Back in 2008,

544
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,190
a Russian mafia member
was shot dead in Insung.

545
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,200
The police officer in charge of the case

546
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,030
was also shot dead.

547
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
His name was

548
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,120
Ji Ho-cheol.

549
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,340
What does that have to do with you?

550
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,720
That dead police officer…

551
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,020
was my father.

552
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,690
Why close the case?

553
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,570
I said Oh Dollar didn't kill them.

554
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,490
But we don't know where he is.

555
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,660
So let's look first
and see if there's a different suspect--

556
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,830
But the Russian…

557
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,700
Understood.

558
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,700
Make necessary arrangements

559
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,700
to ship Drugmon's new batch of Candy
to Japan first.

560
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,370
What will we be left with then?

561
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,960
We have to keep our word
until all the Candy is produced.

562
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,670
That was one of Drugmon's conditions.

563
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,170
So we can't sell it in Korea
or to little kids?

564
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,760
Those are bullshit conditions.

565
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,590
Am I supposed to sit here and watch
while she gives it all away?

566
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,470
That won't happen.

567
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,310
What do you mean?

568
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,020
Please make sure the ship departs safely.

569
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,450
Let go of me!

570
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,620
You bitch!

571
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,350
NO SIGNAL

572
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,150
This is… 112 Emergency Center.
How can… help you?

573
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,200
Sergeant Kim.

574
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,780
The 112 Emergency Center got a call,
and I think it was Senior Officer Ji.

575
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,160
Could you check
if it came from the Geumpo Shipyard?

576
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,290
-Okay, hold on.
-If it did, that'd be amazing.

577
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,000
I got the recording.
Sending it to you now.

578
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,590
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

579
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,670
MESSAGE FORWARDED

580
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,090
Hello?

581
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,430
This is… Officer Ji… of In… Police Agency.

582
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,140
My location is…

583
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,680
a shipyard with… view… Insung Bridge.

584
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:20,350
I'm in a container…
on a Russian vessel… the Victory.

585
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,440
112 EMERGENCY CENTER

586
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,980
Please… Go Man-sik… of In… Police Agency.

587
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,070
I only hear "Go Man-sik."

588
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,780
Hello?

589
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,200
-Jeez.
-Hold on.

590
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,660
-A shipyard with a view…
-Of the Insung Bridge.

591
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,780
A shipyard
with a view of the Insung Bridge.

592
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,580
A shipyard
with a view of the Insung Bridge.

593
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,460
That's Geumpo Shipyard.

594
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,910
It's Geumpo Shipyard.

595
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,670
It's Geumpo Shipyard! That has to be it!

596
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,000
Hey, we found it! Holy cow!

597
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,260
-Captain, we're almost there.
-Got it.

598
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,720
It's Geumpo Shipyard.

599
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,680
The Russian vessel mentioned
in the recording is being repaired.

600
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,560
They reported
its departure schedule as 3 a.m. tonight.

601
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,350
Let's go. What about you?

602
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,770
-I need to stay at headquarters.
-We'll be back.

603
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,280
Don't just focus on the details.
Look at the big picture.

604
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,650
Hello?

605
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,580
Let's go.

606
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,270
RESTRICTED AREA
GEUMPO SHIPYARD

607
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,340
It looks like they're going to
load the goods here in secret and leave.

608
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,640
When a foreign ship
is docked in a shipyard for repairs,

609
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,600
surveillance tends to get lax,

610
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,810
but they've got some nerve
to do this so openly.

611
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:25,690
Han-na must be on there.

612
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:29,060
There's less than 20 minutes left
if they're departing at 3 a.m.

613
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,950
How can we get on board
with so many of them around?

614
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,030
Hold on.

615
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,160
Excuse me, but may I leave now?

616
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,160
I'm pretty sure
I won't be of any help to you.

617
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,210
Sure. You can go.

618
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,040
-Really?
-How's your leg?

619
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
It's totally fine. I can go by myself.

620
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,010
It's completely healed. See?

621
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,510
Good. Then run.

622
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,050
-What?
-If you want to live, that is.

623
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:03,970
Who the hell are you?

624
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,680
I'm sorry.

625
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,440
Now.

626
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,740
I'll go this way. You go there.

627
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,750
Han-na?

628
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,210
Han-na, can you hear me?

629
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,790
Ji Han-na.

630
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,590
Han-na.

631
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,430
Han-na!

632
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,050
Ji Han-na.

633
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,350
Han-na.

634
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,480
Han-na.

635
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,390
Han-na, can you hear me?

636
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,770
I'm here, Han-na.

637
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,020
Dong-ju?

638
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,400
Han-na, say something if you hear me.

639
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,110
-What are you doing here?
-Ji Han-na.

640
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,200
-Didn't you hear me? Get lost!
-Be quiet.

641
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,990
Han-na!

642
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,660
-Give me a second! Han-na!
-Dong-ju.

643
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,830
Do you have a death wish?

644
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,200
I can't hear her, you bastards!

645
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,540
Are you going to tell me where she is?

646
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,960
I'm here.

647
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,670
I'm in here!

648
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,760
-I'm here. Yoon Dong-ju!
-Han-na? Ji Han-na.

649
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,430
-Han-na. Ji Han-na.
-I'm in here!

650
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,430
Hey!

651
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,310
Han-na!

652
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,730
-I'm over here.
-Han-na.

653
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,450
-Over here.
-Han-na.

654
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,700
Han-na!

655
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,030
-Where is she?
-Call out if you hear me.

656
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,200
Han-na!

657
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Han-na.

658
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,960
Han-na, are you in there?

659
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,880
I'm in here.

660
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,590
-Han-na! I found her!
-I'm in here.

661
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,160
It's okay.

662
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,790
I'm sorry it took me so long.

663
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,790
Are you okay, Han-na?

664
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Are you all right?

665
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,960
What happened to your million-dollar face?

666
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,850
Put these on.

667
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,190
Hurry. We have to get off.

668
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,340
Save Han-na, Kim Jong-hyeon!

669
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,380
Han-na!

670
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,820
Did you come back
for another taste of this?

671
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,080
We'll settle this once and for all.

672
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,040
Hey, you.
You're settling it with me, you asshole.

673
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,800
Hey, didn't I tell you
to leave my guy alone?

674
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,340
You crazy bastard!

675
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,060
Where do you think you're going?

676
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,230
Open the door, you son of a bitch!

677
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,570
-Are you okay?
-Open the door!

678
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,910
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay?

679
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,050
Damn it.

680
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,970
There are too many of them.
What do we do?

681
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,680
It's the same in the ring.

682
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,020
The fight is over
the moment you get scared.

683
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,490
The only way to conquer fear

684
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,320
is to advance, no matter what.

685
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,950
You can move, right?

686
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,000
Take Han-na and go.

687
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,410
-What about you?
-What are you going to do alone?

688
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,040
What do you think?

689
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,090
Now that I've found you…

690
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,800
I'm going to lose my shit.

691
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,030
Get out of here!

692
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,310
Go! Hurry!

693
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,460
Jong-hyeon.

694
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,140
Kim Jong-hyeon!

695
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:26,600
Kim Jong-hyeon!

696
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,560
Things are about to get messy.

697
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,470
MAYOR OF INSUNG

698
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,270
SPECIAL THANKS TO KO JUN AND KANG GIL-WOO
FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCE

699
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,560
Are you okay?

700
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,520
Thank you for always helping me

701
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,320
when things were tough.

702
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,530
Don't underestimate your condition.

703
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,780
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Here.

704
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,240
I feel so bad. You should've told me.

705
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,580
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

706
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,580
No matter how hard you try on your own,

707
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,540
nothing will change.

708
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,380
You don't know what today is, do you?

709
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:37,420
If you fall, just grit your teeth
and get back up.

710
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:39,720
I'm going to catch them, no matter what.

711
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,050
I promise.
