1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,060
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,200
<i>Take this.</i>

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,910
It belonged to your father.

5
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>The man who killed your father</i>
<i>gave you that gun.</i>

6
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,470
Min Ju-yeong!

7
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,010
You son of a bitch!

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,020
Why did you do it?

9
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,100
Why the hell did you do it?

10
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,440
Tell me.

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,070
Tell me!

12
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,040
<i>You brought it onto yourself.</i>

13
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,340
<i>This is on you.</i>

14
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,510
They obviously got into an altercation
with each other and died.

15
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,510
What else is there to investigate?

16
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,560
Let's wrap things up here and go.

17
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,150
I know who killed your father.

18
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,530
Do you want my help?

19
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,240
Who was it?

20
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
Oh Dollar.

21
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
<i>I'll help you get revenge for your father.</i>

22
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,800
There was a cop who covered
for your father's murderer, Oh Dollar.

23
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,720
<i>If you want revenge,</i>

24
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,940
<i>you need to take him out first.</i>

25
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,840
This doesn't look right for you.

26
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,210
<i>No matter how battered and broken he is…</i>

27
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>a king never dies…</i>

28
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
<i>until he's crushed</i>

29
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,590
<i>his opponent.</i>

30
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
You bastard!

31
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,610
You son of a bitch!

32
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,940
Did you come to save the girl?

33
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
You bastard!

34
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,090
I have to hand it to you.

35
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,800
You lose every time,
but you still come back.

36
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,350
I'm not here for you.

37
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,690
You son of a bitch.

38
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,300
He's over here!

39
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,720
Come here!

40
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,610
You bastard!

41
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,810
You asshole!

42
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,380
Are you calm now, sir?

43
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
Apologize! You're scared, aren't you?

44
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,680
I told you not to come near me!

45
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,310
Rude little punks.

46
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,810
Hey!

47
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,950
I won.

48
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,000
Dung-ju, I won!

49
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,790
I…

50
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,790
I'm so sick of this.

51
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,130
Just stop already!

52
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,640
Final move!

53
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,510
It's so damn loud.

54
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,100
MAYOR

55
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,650
Riot police here. How should we proceed?

56
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,160
The reporters followed us here,
so standing by isn't exactly an option.

57
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,580
Understood, sir.

58
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,330
What are you doing?
Stop them from going in!

59
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,870
Hurry up and block them!

60
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,220
Wake up.

61
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,600
Wake up!

62
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,270
Please wake up!

63
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,820
Will you tell me now?

64
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,280
Your real name.

65
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
Mi-hyang.

66
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Yoon Mi-hyang.

67
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,160
How old-fashioned.

68
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,090
I'll remember it.

69
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,670
Goodbye…

70
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,760
my love.

71
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,850
I thought you were a fencer.

72
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,970
How can you be so afraid of blades?

73
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,740
Hey.

74
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,240
Did you come alone?

75
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,080
I don't see the little mutt.

76
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,210
Did he drop dead already?

77
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,580
He's not one to die that easily.

78
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,670
That's good to hear.

79
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,500
Because I'm going to
slit the little mutt's throat myself.

80
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,300
Don't underestimate him.

81
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,050
I hate to admit this,

82
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,600
but he'll exceed your expectations
in every way possible.

83
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,310
I underestimated him,

84
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,650
and it cost me everything.

85
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,610
I don't like Yoon Dong-ju.

86
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,280
But do you know what I hate more?

87
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,990
What?

88
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,040
I hate losing to anyone.

89
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,750
I fought tooth and nail to win.

90
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,130
What are you mumbling about?

91
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,170
If I don't step up now,
I'll look like a loser.

92
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,800
Have you lost your mind?

93
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,720
So I'm not going to run anymore.

94
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,310
Let's see this through.

95
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,140
You want to go again?

96
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,370
Hey! Let's stop.

97
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,540
Aren't you a cop?

98
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,830
Cops shouldn't hit people, should they?

99
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,210
Am I wrong?

100
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,380
You came to save the girl,
so why are you taking it out on me?

101
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,130
You persistent little bastard!

102
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,330
-Shit.
-Damn it.

103
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,860
Han-na!

104
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,110
Hey.

105
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
You got quite the makeover
since I last saw you.

106
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,410
You're not dead yet.

107
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,540
Of course, I'm not!

108
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,500
I won't die.

109
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,170
Not until I throw your ass in jail.

110
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,770
You…

111
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,890
You bitch!

112
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,890
Die.

113
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,230
Are you insane?

114
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,940
Farewell, you crazy bastard.

115
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,130
Oh, shit.

116
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Han-na.

117
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,990
Are you okay?

118
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,320
Han-na.

119
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,410
Ji Han-na!

120
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,910
Han-na, get it together. Ji Han-na!

121
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,950
Ji Han-na!

122
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,080
Be quiet. My ears hurt.

123
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,710
Are you really okay?

124
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,640
You shouldn't have come
to this dangerous place all alone.

125
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,710
Yoon Dong-ju.

126
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,920
Are you feeling okay?

127
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,590
Are you okay?

128
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,630
You're bleeding.

129
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,430
What about Min Ju-yeong?
Have you seen him?

130
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,240
She's still alive.

131
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,080
We should call an ambulance.

132
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Keep still.

133
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,850
National team athletes
and cops are the same.

134
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,230
We can't go a day without getting hurt.

135
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,320
The riot police and firefighters
searched the whole building,

136
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,820
but they didn't find Min Ju-yeong.

137
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,830
I checked the transport vehicles
and didn't find him there either.

138
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,080
I think he slipped out already.

139
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,330
I'm sure there are
lots of informants here in his pocket.

140
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,960
I bet they're busy covering for him.

141
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,210
That's why we need to find him.

142
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,290
"We"?

143
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,460
You're a fugitive. Don't you dare.

144
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,510
Just keep still!

145
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,180
Hold on.

146
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,260
How can we get this punk out of here?

147
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,560
Informant?

148
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,680
What is it?

149
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,610
Someone told Min Ju-yeong
that I came here.

150
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
His phone.

151
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,700
If we pull up his last call history,
we'll find the informant.

152
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,910
SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY
ON THIS CONSTRUCTION SITE

153
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,880
There was so much trash
inside the building.

154
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,510
Okay, jeez.

155
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,350
Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

156
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,230
-I feel so lightheaded.
-Captain!

157
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,730
Did you find it?

158
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,900
Please get up if you found it.

159
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,450
Here, get up.

160
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,330
Jeez, this is brutal.

161
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,580
Do you think
the data would be recoverable?

162
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,250
Probably, as long as the SIM card is okay.

163
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,040
I'll send it to the forensics chief.

164
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,250
What are they talking about?

165
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Captain.

166
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,110
What's going on?

167
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,530
Commissioner.

168
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,160
What happened to your jaw, sir?

169
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,330
Yoon…

170
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,460
Where's Yoon Do-ju?

171
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
What did you say, sir?

172
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,090
Yoon Dong-ju, you bastard!

173
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,420
Oh, Yoon Dong-ju.

174
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,090
-I'm not sure.
-"I'm not sure"?

175
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Damn it.

176
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,760
You know damn well but won't say it!

177
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,060
You bastards.

178
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,310
-I should've broken his jaw clean.
-All of you.

179
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,690
Say goodbye to your police careers.

180
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,070
Especially you, you little punk!

181
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,450
Don't you dare take a step

182
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,950
and stand at attention!

183
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,000
<i>A new drug was being produced,</i>

184
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,840
<i>-causing widespread shock.</i>
-Damn it, we're screwed.

185
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,970
<i>-The operation was carried out</i>
-What the hell is going on?

186
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,550
<i>-under the command of the commissioner</i>
-Goddammit.

187
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,220
<i>of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.</i>

188
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Hey.

189
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,490
What's going on? Have you seen the news?

190
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,160
Tell me what's going on.
The news is blowing up.

191
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,830
Where's Mr. Min?

192
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,500
And what's wrong with your face?
Did you get beaten up again?

193
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,540
Shut the hell up!

194
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,370
Your trucks came too damn late.

195
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,170
Do you know how much drug
we had to give up?

196
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,010
Damn it.

197
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,430
Boss.

198
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,640
What happened? Did you look into it?

199
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,270
I can't get in touch with anyone,

200
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,900
and nobody has seen Mr. Min.

201
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,530
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

202
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,620
What should we do about those goods?

203
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,460
Even if we slash the price,
it's still worth a fortune.

204
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,290
If we add the goods we've already moved…

205
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,970
We can't reach Mr. Min.

206
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,640
That Black Cat bastard died,
so we have no buyer.

207
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,510
And the bitch
who made the drugs croaked too.

208
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,140
So now there's only one person left…

209
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,730
who knows that the goods are here.

210
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,150
Hey, what about the goods?

211
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,070
Okay, got it.

212
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,410
One more thing.
How many guys can you round up right now?

213
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,740
Gather every last one you can find.

214
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,250
I'll call you back.

215
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,680
You want to go out?

216
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,150
What was that?

217
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,690
You've got to be kidding me.

218
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,820
Don't mess with me, punk.

219
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,580
I'm a heavyweight champion.

220
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,750
Got it?

221
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,770
-I love fingerprint door locks.
<i>-The door is open.</i>

222
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,060
Jeong-a.

223
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,150
Dad!

224
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,650
Were you worried about me
after watching the news?

225
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,820
What are you talking about?

226
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,780
I bought braised chicken!

227
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,530
Braised chicken?

228
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,240
Nice. This is great.

229
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,910
Of course, it's great for you.

230
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,950
All you did today
was stay home and lounge around.

231
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,120
Hey, come in already.

232
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,290
We've been through a lot today,
so we've earned a snack.

233
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,290
Hi, Jeong-a.

234
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,340
You met them before. Say hello.

235
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,380
These are my colleagues.

236
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,800
And this is my daughter, Go Jeong-a.

237
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,800
Excuse me.

238
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,560
Hi.

239
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,930
Take the braised chicken with you!

240
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,100
Cheers.

241
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,100
-Good work today.
-Good work.

242
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,410
Have it with some<i> mukeunji</i>, aged kimchi.
It's amazing.

243
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,030
I had it with Jeong-a before,
and I've been craving it ever since.

244
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,870
Wrap it in some <i>mukeunji.</i>

245
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,250
It's so good.

246
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,130
-It really is good.
-Is it?

247
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,010
I like the rosé one better.
It's more mild and tasty.

248
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,010
Is it good?

249
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,020
Senior Officer Ji, I'm disappointed.

250
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,650
If something like that
had happened to your father,

251
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,310
you should've given us a heads-up.

252
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,860
Instead, you struggled all by yourself.

253
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,530
I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed.

254
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,900
I'm sorry.

255
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,490
It's been difficult for her already.
Leave her alone.

256
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,330
We need to beat up that bastard instead.

257
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,200
-Stop beating up people.
-Eat up.

258
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,250
Stay right here at home
until you're off the wanted list.

259
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,670
Don't you dare try anything.

260
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,500
What's the plan now?

261
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,170
We have to catch him.

262
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,760
Of course.

263
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,090
The special joint task force
is in charge of the case,

264
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,050
so we probably can't step in.

265
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,510
And we likely won't get any support.

266
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,510
Then it'll be us, the RIU,

267
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,480
and Seobu Station's Senior Inspector Kang.

268
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,100
Probably not Senior Inspector Kang.

269
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,070
He received disciplinary action,
so his hands are tied.

270
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,990
Then it's just us and the RIU.

271
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,070
That's not bad.

272
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,740
Stop eating!
I'm saying something important!

273
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,000
There you go again.

274
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,090
I told you not to do that.
Where did you pick up that weird habit?

275
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,050
-Isn't that Lamaze breathing?
-Llama?

276
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,050
It's a breathing method

277
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,470
that helps calm the body and mind.

278
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,300
My wife practiced it a lot
when she was pregnant.

279
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,700
Don't tell me you…

280
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,580
Hey, Jeong-a!

281
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,420
Go Jeong-a, open the door!

282
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,790
Let's talk. Open the door.

283
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,460
Is this why you fought with your mom
and came to Korea?

284
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,420
Open the door, Go Jeong-a!

285
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,920
The captain will be okay, right?

286
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,470
I shouldn't have brought up
Lamaze breathing.

287
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,550
Don't worry about it.

288
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,350
By the way,
shouldn't all of you go to the hospital?

289
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,980
I'm okay.

290
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,820
We're okay too.

291
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,400
Then let's go home.

292
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,940
I really can't wait to go home today.

293
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,400
Sounds good.

294
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,160
I'll drop you off on my way home.

295
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
That sounds great.

296
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,830
What about you two?

297
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,120
Get home safely. We'll get going first.

298
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,460
Hold on.

299
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,420
-Group hug.
-Let's just go.

300
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,880
Oh, okay.

301
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
See you.

302
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,830
Honey, I'm home.

303
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,200
You must've been worried.

304
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,680
Did I ever tell you?

305
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,930
I've been so ashamed of that bronze medal.

306
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,430
It felt like proof
that I hadn't done my best

307
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,100
both at the game and in my life.

308
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,440
That's why I could never
confidently show it to our kids.

309
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,450
Hey.

310
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,070
The kids and I have never once
been ashamed of you.

311
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,910
Do you know how happy the kids were
to see you on the news?

312
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,040
Whatever decision you make,

313
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,580
the kids and I will always support you.

314
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,920
Why are you crying?

315
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,590
Does it not hurt?

316
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,510
Hold on.

317
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,680
This should do.

318
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,140
-Yoon Dong-ju.
-Yeah?

319
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,440
You were unconscious for two days.

320
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,610
You must've been worried.

321
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,860
Let's go to the hospital.
I'll find one for you.

322
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,620
I'm totally fine.

323
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,080
I actually feel rejuvenated
after the good long sleep.

324
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,540
I want you

325
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,920
to take better care of yourself.

326
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,670
Don't hold it in when it really hurts.

327
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,180
Okay, okay.

328
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,390
But for now, you come first.

329
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,900
Don't overdo it. It's not that serious.

330
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,860
No. You'll end up with a scar
if you don't take care of it.

331
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,530
Leave it to me.

332
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,910
I'm an expert when it comes to this.

333
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,660
Actually, you should go
to the hospital tomorrow.

334
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,160
Okay.

335
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Here.

336
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,590
All done.

337
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,760
How are you so good at this?

338
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,390
I don't know

339
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,980
if I told you this.

340
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,690
But I got hit a lot as a kid.

341
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,740
Whenever my dad got drunk,

342
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,740
he would hit me and my mom.

343
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,830
First aid was the only thing
I could do for her afterward.

344
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,250
I'd apply ointment to her wounds…

345
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,840
and blow on them.

346
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,130
That's why I'm used to it.

347
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,730
What is this for?

348
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,020
Nothing special. I'm just proud of you.

349
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,730
Then give me a prize.

350
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,320
Go change your clothes.

351
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,860
What for? It's not staying on long anyway.

352
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,120
What?

353
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,240
My gosh. Hey.

354
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,330
-Han-na! It's me!
-Hey, move.

355
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,670
Are you home?

356
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,630
What was the passcode again?

357
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,840
Why won't this open?
What am I going to do?

358
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,010
-No, not here.
-Then where?

359
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,640
Go to the bathroom.

360
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,430
Calm down and focus, Gyeong-suk.
You can do this.

361
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,970
I'm a mother! Han-na!

362
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,560
My goodness, Han-na!

363
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,770
My precious girl.

364
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,980
Why won't this open?

365
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,190
My goodness. Did you change the passcode?

366
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Are you okay? Let me take a look at you.

367
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,870
Thank the heavens you're okay.

368
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,790
-I'm fine.
-Let me look at you.

369
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,870
What happened to your face?

370
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,210
It's just a scratch.

371
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,830
Why did you come?

372
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,460
The news got my heart racing.
How could I not rush over here?

373
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,380
And why didn't you answer your phone?

374
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,930
You scared me half to death!

375
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,930
Did you get hurt anywhere else?

376
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,640
-No, not at all.
-What happened here?

377
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,470
I'm fine, so calm down.

378
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,730
How can you be fine?

379
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,560
My poor baby.

380
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,810
Goodness.

381
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,860
Why is your face so hot?

382
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,490
What are you talking about?
It feels the same as usual.

383
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,490
Hold on. Oh, my goodness.

384
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,290
What is it? Where does it hurt?

385
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,910
It's just a headache.
Yeah, actually, I'm aching all over.

386
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,880
Where? Where does it hurt?

387
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,080
-Oh, dear.
-My room.

388
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,670
-Help me to my room.
-Okay, hold on tight and lean on me.

389
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,550
What's your father doing in heaven?
Why isn't he protecting you?

390
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,350
My word, this is just unbelievable!

391
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,810
Darn it.

392
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,330
-Are you coming from her place?
-Hello.

393
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,450
Where are you going?

394
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,370
DUNG-JU

395
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,900
FRONT DOOR

396
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,570
CALL

397
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,280
<i>Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.</i>

398
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,910
<i>Sergeant Kim.</i>

399
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,950
<i>I mean, Jong-hyeon.</i>

400
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,950
<i>Jong-hyeon, can you please open the door?</i>

401
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,160
Jong-hyeon.

402
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,960
<i>The door is open.</i>

403
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Were you at a sauna?

404
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,260
Don't smile like that.

405
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,850
Thank you for having me.

406
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,560
<i>The door is locked.</i>

407
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,860
SÃO PAULO 2018
KIM JONG-HYEON WINS SILVER

408
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,320
Are you moving?

409
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Want some help?

410
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,200
Mind your own business,
and stop acting like we're friends.

411
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,780
Just out of curiosity,

412
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,030
when did you start hating me?

413
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,610
From the beginning.

414
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,280
Why?

415
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,830
Your smile bothered me.

416
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,750
<i>Yoon Dong-ju?</i>

417
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,330
Yeah. Do you know him?

418
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,670
The crazy boxer kid
who made the national team.

419
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,050
He's bought the superstition
that 100 laps here will get you the gold.

420
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,930
He's been at it every day
for a full week now.

421
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,260
Everyone collapses at 94 laps.

422
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,430
But I think he'll make it today.

423
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,310
He's already at 99 laps.

424
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,930
VICTORY GYM

425
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,770
Look at him sweating. Go, Yoon Dong-ju!

426
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,780
-You're almost there!
-You got this!

427
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,780
Looking good, Yoon Dong-ju!

428
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,210
SOAR TOWARD VICTORY

429
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,590
-See you.
-Okay.

430
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,800
Jeez, he's amazing.
He sure does know how to run.

431
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,950
I didn't like your smile,
and I still don't.

432
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,910
I don't like you either.

433
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,870
Go to sleep.

434
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,640
Good night.

435
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,720
Still no sign of Min Ju-yeong?

436
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,680
None.

437
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,730
The roadside CCTVs

438
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,770
caught the Russian mafia
and the Korean Chinese guys escaping,

439
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,360
but not Min Ju-yeong.

440
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,610
This is the only road
that leads to Goldengate Central.

441
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,740
Seeing how he's left no trail whatsoever,

442
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,030
someone inside the agency
must've helped him.

443
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,700
We need to find that informant.
What a headache.

444
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,630
Anyway, we seized a truck yesterday.

445
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,420
It belongs to Mr. Oh Jong-gu
of J9 Security.

446
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,590
The rest of the trucks
were caught on CCTVs,

447
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,510
but we can't make out the plates.

448
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,180
I think they were used to move Candy.

449
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,300
Thank you. Please send us these photos.

450
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,680
-We'll take on Oh Jong-gu.
-All right.

451
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,520
By the way, what's wrong with him?

452
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,280
Were you up all night
because of what happened?

453
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,660
You mean Jeong-a?

454
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,540
She says she's not pregnant.

455
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:13,040
What a relief. I was really worried.

456
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,710
It's my wife who's pregnant.

457
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,590
Oh, your wife is… What?

458
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,710
Congratulations!

459
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,340
I didn't know you still had it in you.

460
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,840
What's your secret?

461
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,770
I had a vasectomy.

462
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,190
It's permanent.

463
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,440
But that means your wife had an affair…

464
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,070
The wind's not the only thing stirring.

465
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,540
My marriage!

466
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,540
Let's get going.

467
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,160
Sergeant Kim, I'll go with you.

468
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,330
Why won't this open? Sergeant Kim!

469
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,170
Sergeant Kim, I don't want to be here!

470
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,670
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

471
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,460
You came right on time.

472
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,050
Thank you for lending me your car.

473
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,510
That's it?

474
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,310
No. Thank you for everything you did.

475
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:16,020
Why do I have to help you?

476
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,690
Ask someone else.

477
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,110
There's no one else I can ask.

478
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,150
You're the only one at the agency
who talks to me.

479
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,820
So what?

480
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,900
Why do I have to do this favor for you?

481
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,530
Because you like me.

482
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,160
Me? You must be mistaken.

483
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,330
Even so, I'm still asking you.

484
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,040
You're the only one I can trust.

485
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,630
And I'm sorry I've put you in trouble.

486
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,170
It's okay.

487
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,960
I'll just spend the next three months
lounging around at home.

488
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,720
Leaving like this felt unfair,
so I snuck this out.

489
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,940
It's the list of people who attended
the special joint task launch ceremony.

490
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,520
I thought it might help the investigation.

491
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,980
Why are you being so nice to me?

492
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,910
You said that I liked you, remember?

493
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,740
And you're right. I do like you.

494
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,910
I was also jealous.

495
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,000
Back in the day,
I wanted to go out in the field like you.

496
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,800
So I'm living vicariously through you.

497
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,090
Jeez.

498
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,970
It's like I'm fangirling

499
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,930
over a protagonist in a drama
or something!

500
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,520
J9 SECURITY

501
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,940
Damn it.

502
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,480
He cleared out and took off already.

503
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,870
Is he here?

504
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,950
He hasn't used the office in a while.

505
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,620
The power's shut off too.

506
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,620
These damn bastards.

507
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,380
These aren't the trucks.
The plate numbers are different.

508
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,880
The truck beds look different too.

509
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,510
Captain, I talked to the district office,

510
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,140
and they said there's a junkyard

511
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,310
authorized to handle scrapping
and replacing freight trucks.

512
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,140
I think Oh's fleet was using plates
illegally deregistered from there.

513
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,100
Let's head there then.

514
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,690
You want it, huh? You want it?

515
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,780
Mr. Lee Yong-ju.

516
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
-What the hell?
-Oh, my!

517
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,030
Wait.

518
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,540
He took the train.

519
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,580
She's Oh Jong-gu's bookkeeper.

520
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,630
Who are they? Your dad and older brother?

521
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,300
They're cops.

522
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,720
Damn it.

523
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,470
Oh, jeez.

524
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,650
Where do you think you're going?

525
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,990
Put the knife down.

526
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,420
You sold freight truck plates
to Mr. Oh Jong-gu, right?

527
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,050
We need the plate numbers.

528
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,760
How can I possibly remember that?

529
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
I have many clients.

530
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,640
I've probably put on
hundreds of truck plates by now.

531
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,180
Just arrest me.

532
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,680
I'll pay a fine and be done with it.

533
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,640
Why bother coming here over nothing?

534
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,350
I said arrest me!

535
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,270
Arrest--

536
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Hang on.

537
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,530
You have a daughter.

538
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,070
-Yes.
-You're married?

539
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Yes.

540
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,080
You're a married man

541
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,660
and had an…

542
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,620
-An affair here?
-He's going to lose it.

543
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,460
Excuse me. I have that information.

544
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,420
This is the management log
of the truck fleet Mr. Oh manages himself.

545
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,930
There are 15 illegal vehicles in total.

546
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,890
Seven vehicles were used

547
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,560
to move the Candy.

548
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,480
Where the hell is Oh Jong-gu?

549
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,770
Min Ju-yeong won't give up the Candy.

550
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,310
If we follow it,

551
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,940
we can catch both Oh Jong-gu
and Min Ju-yeong.

552
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,530
Let's look at the CCTV footage
and check out each truck.

553
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,120
Right, let's put in the legwork
and find him.

554
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,540
-I'll take photos of this.
-Okay.

555
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,080
All right.

556
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,000
Let's split into two teams
and get moving.

557
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,920
You be on standby here.

558
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,710
Why?

559
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,300
Do you really have to ask?
You're still wanted.

560
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,090
It'll be a headache if anyone notices you.

561
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,340
I mean, with my looks,

562
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,310
I get noticed even if I sit still.

563
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,640
I'll be discreet.

564
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,270
Discreet, my ass.

565
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,520
You stay here
and keep me posted on the situation.

566
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,270
-I don't want to--
-I'll go with Dong-ju.

567
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,900
-It's more dangerous to leave him alone.
-You think so?

568
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,320
I guess you're right.

569
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,160
Okay, then take him with you.

570
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,410
Might as well have you with him
if he gets into trouble.

571
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,120
Get into trouble? I'm not a kid.

572
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,370
You're worse than a kid!

573
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,200
You damn wanted fugitive.

574
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,040
Quit complaining
and go before I change my mind.

575
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,500
Get going, you punk.

576
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,170
Hang on.

577
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,760
I just noticed that you're not
wearing glasses, Sergeant Kim.

578
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,260
You look more handsome without them.

579
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,100
-You'll be as handsome as me soon.
-He's right. You look good.

580
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,430
As if. He looks the same.
Hurry up already.

581
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,600
You're both handsome!

582
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,520
Why are you coming after me?

583
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,610
I got my license plate from there too.

584
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,400
I've never even met Oh Jong-gu!

585
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,370
Why did you run if you didn't know?

586
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,410
Because you said you were cops!

587
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,080
Let's check your plate.

588
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,750
I got scammed into buying this
a few days ago.

589
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,540
I'm the victim here.

590
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,960
-Jeez.
-Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

591
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,930
What did he say?

592
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,100
He said he got scammed
into buying the plate a few days ago.

593
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,060
If you're tired, stay here and rest.

594
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,600
I'll check out the remaining places.

595
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,440
Who said I was tired?

596
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,150
My stamina is unbreakable,
unlike someone I know.

597
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,900
Just stay here
instead of getting in my way later.

598
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,160
I don't get it.

599
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,530
If you hate me so much,
why did you say you'd take me?

600
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:49,040
Because it's getting to me.

601
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,540
What is?

602
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,210
Me and Han-na being together?

603
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,250
Yeah.

604
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,010
Jeez.

605
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,850
Just when I start liking him,
he makes me hate him.

606
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Yes, Chief?

607
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:30,950
INSUNG JEIL ELECTRONICS

608
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,870
<i>There are too many people at the agency,</i>
<i>so I worked from here.</i>

609
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,630
I know the owner here, so it's safe.

610
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,790
All right.

611
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,090
Hello.

612
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,100
There was a lot of damage,
but I managed to recover half the data.

613
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,260
Thank you.

614
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,150
What was the last incoming number?

615
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,650
Four, seven, two, three?

616
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,740
Four, seven, two, three…

617
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,490
What is it? Do you know it?

618
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,910
LEE JONG-HUN

619
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,120
<i>-The person you are calling…</i>
-Lee Jong-hun?

620
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,710
<i>-…cannot be reached.</i>
-Who is that again?

621
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:20,050
<i>You will be directed to voicemail…</i>

622
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,590
The RIU's rookie.

623
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,800
Hold on. Now it makes sense.

624
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,010
The day Dong-ju was kidnapped,

625
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,180
we only informed the RIU
of the operation area.

626
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,980
It was odd how Oh Jong-gu showed up there.

627
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,730
Do you think letting Drugmon take his gun

628
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,270
was also a calculated move?

629
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,190
There's no way to tell when this started.

630
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,030
So he's the informant.

631
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,860
Come to think of it,
the day Drugmon escaped,

632
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,660
the person in charge

633
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,200
happened to be the RIU's rookie.

634
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:55,710
She disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.

635
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,300
<i>-Hey, Dae-yong.</i>
-Yes?

636
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,510
<i>-Are you with the rookie?</i>
-Our rookie?

637
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,970
He's on probation for letting Drugmon
take his gun during transport.

638
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,680
Why do you ask?

639
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,480
All right. We found our informant.

640
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
Now we just need to catch Min Ju-yeong.

641
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,480
Man, what a sight.
They sent a ton of manpower.

642
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,990
Over 500 men have been dispatched
under the commissioner's special orders.

643
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,660
I hear the commissioner
is basically living at the agency.

644
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,200
What's gotten into him?
He can't seem to make up his mind.

645
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,000
He switched gears pretty quickly.

646
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,460
He's struggling
now that the tables have turned.

647
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,080
Anyway, where the hell
is Min Ju-yeong hiding?

648
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,670
How can there be no trace of him
with all those people searching?

649
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,750
Damn bastard.

650
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,100
Hey, Dae-yong. Did you find the rookie?

651
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,870
It can't be you, Jong-hun!

652
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:13,950
This can't be real!

653
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,040
-Hey.
-Damn it, you bastard!

654
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,540
What the hell happened?

655
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,830
I don't know.

656
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:20,750
We came after receiving a report too.

657
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,130
Jong-hun would never do such a thing.
Something's not right.

658
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,460
-Goddammit.
-Jong-hun!

659
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,110
When Min Ju-yeong
slipped away from Goldengate,

660
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,400
it would've been hard to leave undetected.

661
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,070
But there were cops
and firefighters everywhere.

662
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,780
How did he escape?

663
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:04,130
<i>Over 500 men have been dispatched</i>
<i>under the commissioner's special orders.</i>

664
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,340
What's gotten into him?
He can't seem to make up his mind.

665
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,090
I hear the commissioner
is basically living at the agency.

666
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,760
<i>That damn coward.</i>

667
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,680
<i>I think I know</i>

668
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,480
where Min Ju-yeong is.

669
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,600
<i>Bastards like him</i>

670
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,480
<i>instinctively hide in the safest place</i>
<i>when they sense danger,</i>

671
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,570
<i>latching themselves</i>
<i>onto the strongest person</i>

672
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,610
<i>among those around them.</i>

673
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,030
Has the mayor called?

674
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,660
Yes, sir.

675
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,500
He's going to send someone soon.

676
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,750
Would you like a cup of tea?

677
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,630
I have excellent green tea.

678
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,600
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

679
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,970
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

680
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,860
You can't enter.

681
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,020
Move.

682
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,570
Seriously, what the hell?

683
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,650
Get the hell off me.

684
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,320
Why are you blocking me?

685
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,030
-Hold onto him.
-What are you doing?

686
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,830
Let go. Didn't you hear me?

687
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,080
Why the hell are you blocking me?

688
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Who the hell are you?

689
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,170
Block access properly!

690
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,620
What the hell are you saying?

691
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,460
Why are you stopping me?

692
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,340
What are you people doing?

693
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,970
Get out of my way.

694
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:37,140
Whose orders are you following?

695
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,970
Move.

696
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,430
You'll face legal consequences for this.

697
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,230
Let go.

698
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,350
-Watch it.
-I'm not kidding.

699
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,520
-Come at me!
-You could get hurt.

700
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:51,650
Let go, damn it.

701
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:59,950
Hey.

702
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,370
So this is where you were hiding,
you damn coward.

703
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,450
Commissioner!

704
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,250
Lower your guns!

705
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,710
Hey, what are you doing?

706
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,800
Put the gun down.

707
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:20,140
Hey, lower your guns.
He's just going downstairs.

708
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,220
Lower them!

709
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,690
Hey, Ji Han-na!

710
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,280
Lower your gun!

711
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,620
Ji Han-na, I said lower your gun!

712
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,660
Are you trying to get me killed?

713
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,090
Commissioner!

714
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,260
Commissioner!

715
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,430
-You heard gunshots, right?
-You can't do this.

716
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,600
We all need to go upstairs.

717
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,770
One, two, three. Let's go!

718
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:10,850
Move!

719
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,610
Are you okay, sir?

720
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,200
Don't touch me!

721
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,700
Sergeant Kim!

722
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,080
Move him slowly!

723
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,250
Hey, be careful!

724
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,840
What happened to him?

725
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,550
Senior Officer Ji Han-na shot him.

726
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,590
Just go!

727
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,340
Hurry up. No, go slowly!

728
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,930
-Hurry!
-She shot him?

729
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,770
I see.

730
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,770
-She had her reasons.
-Sure, it couldn't be helped.

731
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,190
I see.

732
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,860
Hey, where do you think you're going?

733
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,790
Do you have insurance?

734
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,540
If not, I can introduce you to someone.

735
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,750
I'm about to break a lot of your bones.

736
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,310
You've been through hell,
but you seem to be holding up fine.

737
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,940
You underestimated me.

738
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,270
Shut up and stand up.

739
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,780
You're the one
who did the underestimating.

740
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,270
Dong-ju!

741
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,660
Hey, were you going somewhere?

742
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,130
I thought you took off,

743
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:46,970
but here you are.

744
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,220
Why would I when you're right here?

745
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,650
Jeez.

746
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,650
Just give up already.

747
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,530
I'm getting tired of this.

748
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,760
<i>Jeez.</i>

749
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,550
Seriously.

750
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,270
<i>Hold on.</i>

751
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,110
<i>Don't tell me you can't see.</i>

752
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,440
Stop talking bullshit.

753
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,160
<i>Hey.</i>

754
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:04,920
I was right.

755
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,420
This bastard can't see anything.

756
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:13,100
Didn't I tell you
to watch your blood pressure?

757
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,060
Serves you right for not taking
your coach's words seriously.

758
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:22,150
How do you expect to fight me
in that state?

759
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,740
<i>Jong-hyeon!</i>

760
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,620
Yoon Dong-ju!

761
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,670
Stop!

762
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,590
Sir, we have a shitstorm at our hands.
Are you not going to do anything?

763
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,090
<i>I don't think it was our rookie.</i>

764
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,800
So there's another rat.

765
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,430
<i>That rat is on our team.</i>

766
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,220
I can't get involved.

767
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,140
<i>Money isn't the only thing</i>
<i>in his arsenal, huh?</i>

768
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,560
<i>If it's not money…</i>

769
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,640
Let's just ask one person.

770
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,140
<i>He'll make a move first.</i>

771
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,690
<i>Min Ju-yeong will head toward Gumyeon-dong</i>
<i>through the Gumyeon Intersection.</i>

772
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,650
<i>I guess I meant a lot to you.</i>

773
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,110
<i>How long are you going to pretend</i>
<i>that you're fine in front of me?</i>

774
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,280
<i>You can look forward to it.</i>

775
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,070
<i>Han-na, are you on your way?</i>

776
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,870
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

777
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
