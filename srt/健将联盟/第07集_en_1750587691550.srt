1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,360
-Hey, open this up.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,070
Mr. Min.

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,830
I'm sending them to the City Council,
the mayor, and the Prosecutors' Office.

6
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,370
Divide them up and pack them well.

7
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,710
Got it.

8
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,500
-Hey, pack them up.
-Yes, sir.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,920
Can we go out now?

10
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,000
What was that?

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,510
These guys helped bring in the goods.

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,390
What should we do?
They could be trouble if we leave them.

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,470
Please don't kill us.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,480
We won't tell anyone what we saw here.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,020
Wouldn't it be better…

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,900
if they couldn't speak at all?

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,190
Nice and neat.

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,900
-I came to see my family.
-Hey.

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,530
-Please let me go.
-You stink.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,620
Don't you have a family?

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,280
Unfortunately, I don't.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,080
Even if I had one…

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
Please spare me!

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,040
Please spare me!

25
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,890
I would've killed them
like I did just now.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,800
Did I do something wrong again?

27
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,390
No.

28
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,560
I did something wrong.

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,440
I should've just beaten you to death
back then.

30
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,400
It's my fault.

31
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,610
Your face tells me

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,410
my counterpunch landed pretty well.

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,750
So it really was you.

34
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,290
Even a champion like you

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,540
should've been ready to take a hit or two
once you entered the ring.

36
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,300
Thanks.

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,510
For what?

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,510
For giving me a reason
to beat the hell out of you

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,760
without a second thought.

40
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,470
I'm going to…

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,730
kill you right here.

42
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,790
Hey.

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey!

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey!

45
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,130
Where the hell did this punk go?

46
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,670
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

47
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,170
Captain.

48
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,800
I think I know where Dung-ju is.

49
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,030
What are you doing here
after causing trouble?

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,790
Do you know what you did?

51
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,500
You need to control your temper.

52
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,330
-Do you know what--
-What?

53
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,470
What was I supposed to do?

54
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
Hey.

55
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,750
Fortunately, she's going to make it.

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,010
But we'll have to wait and see
when she'll wake up.

57
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
With no CCTVs
in and out of the restaurant,

58
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,090
it won't be easy to find out
what exactly happened.

59
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,680
We found traces of gunfire,

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,640
but your gun was clean
with no fingerprints.

61
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,940
We need to find evidence
that Min Ju-yeong did it.

62
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,520
But isn't it strange?

63
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,070
The bullet went through
the scapular artery.

64
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,820
There would've been much blood loss.

65
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,950
On top of that, it took 15 minutes
for the ambulance to arrive

66
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,410
after residents heard the gunshot
and called it in.

67
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,790
Under normal circumstances,
she would've bled out in that time.

68
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,410
According to the paramedics,

69
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,580
she had already received first aid
by the time they arrived.

70
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,750
How's Min Ju-yeong?

71
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,090
He got first aid
at Insung University Hospital

72
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,550
and was admitted as an inpatient.

73
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,180
We'll need to wait for the test results,

74
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,510
but his injuries seemed pretty severe.

75
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,100
Take over the case
from the local precinct.

76
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,520
Keep canvassing the area
and trace Min Ju-yeong's movements.

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,810
And put out an APB for Kim Yeon-ha.

78
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,110
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,360
Multiple facial contusions,

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,650
along with a number of
lacerations and bruises.

81
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,200
Total recovery time, 24 weeks.

82
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,280
This is enough to be charged
with aggravated assault.

83
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,490
What happens now?

84
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,500
The ball is in Min Ju-yeong's court.

85
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,170
What do you mean?

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,920
He has a video of Dong-ju assaulting him.

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,300
Without appropriate disciplinary actions,

88
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,630
he'll make the video public.

89
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,260
And what does he mean by
"appropriate disciplinary actions"?

90
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,550
He wants Dong-ju relieved of his duties

91
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,180
and the SCIT…

92
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,060
dissolved.

93
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,070
He wants to stop us
from investigating further.

94
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,940
Everything was planned.

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,240
Everything from stealing the captain's gun
to provoking Dong-ju.

96
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,370
I can cover for a simple gun misplacement,

97
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,500
but not when there has been a casualty.

98
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,790
I don't think you can avoid a demotion.

99
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,670
And just like that,
my lieutenant rank is gone.

100
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,550
What did the commissioner say?

101
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,680
This is a headache for him too.

102
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,970
If that video goes public,

103
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,760
he'll get in trouble
since he created the SCIT.

104
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,060
The nomination is right around the corner.

105
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,690
It seems he wants to
handle this discreetly.

106
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,780
Give it a few days
until the disciplinary hearing.

107
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,860
He has a team dinner tonight, right?

108
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,120
RECRUITMENT & SELECTION NOTICE:
INVESTIGATION DIVISION POSITION

109
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,200
-What are you staring at?
-Hello, sir.

110
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,540
I heard rumors of your team dissolving.

111
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,580
You must feel uneasy.

112
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,090
I mean,
you switched teams to get promoted.

113
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,010
You can't catch a break, can you?

114
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,590
-Are you going home now?
-No, there's a senior officials' dinner.

115
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,140
I bet he's going to put on a show tonight.

116
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,100
Who do you mean?

117
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,560
Your captain.

118
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,140
I hear he's bent on begging
and pleading with the commissioner

119
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,440
to save that officer and your team.

120
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,480
Man, I can't believe
how that one officer ruined the team.

121
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,280
Why did he take that kid in anyway?

122
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,490
Man-sik, par terre!

123
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,780
-You got this, sir!
-Par terre.

124
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,530
-Good luck, sir!
-Good luck, sir!

125
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,530
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,650
What do you think, punk?

127
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm drinking.

128
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,040
You won't be
relieved of your duties for now.

129
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,340
The disciplinary hearing or whatever
will be held in a week.

130
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,420
So make sure to prepare yourself.

131
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,340
They'll take circumstances into account.

132
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,090
The commissioner
is also aware of your situation.

133
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,930
You didn't have to do this!

134
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,390
Don't you raise your voice.

135
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,270
Sit down and stop talking nonsense.

136
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,790
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,760
I dragged you and the team into this mess.

138
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,760
I'll just quit.

139
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,260
Don't be ridiculous.

140
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,520
Who said it was your fault?

141
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
It's my fault for not having enough power.

142
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,150
I'm supposed to be the captain,
but there's nothing I can do.

143
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,030
So I'm just trying to do whatever I can.

144
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,070
You did nothing wrong.

145
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,830
That bastard.

146
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,200
Had I been in your shoes,

147
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,540
I would've beaten the hell out of him
like my life depended on it too.

148
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,500
And what's this talk about quitting?

149
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,630
If you quit,

150
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,630
does that mean
you'll let Min Ju-yeong off the hook?

151
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,720
Jeez, you fool.

152
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260
You're a boxing champion
and a national team athlete.

153
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,850
But you want to give up
before the match is even over?

154
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,680
I bet Min Ju-yeong
would love to hear all this.

155
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,980
Who said I was giving up?

156
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,150
Exactly, so stop talking nonsense,
all right?

157
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,610
You're a simple kid,

158
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,400
so don't overthink things,
looking all serious.

159
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,360
Hey, I've heard enough crap from you.

160
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,910
Come here and put this on me.
I'm aching all over.

161
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,830
Come on.

162
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,340
Jeez, that stings.

163
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,220
It stings!

164
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,260
What's this old handkerchief
you always carry with you?

165
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,760
I can get you a new one.

166
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,850
What?

167
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,810
Hey, this is priceless.

168
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,690
My wife gave this to me

169
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,820
when she was pregnant with Jeong-a.

170
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,900
I won the bronze medal
after she gave me this handkerchief.

171
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,200
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

172
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,630
-He held on!
-He won the bronze medal!

173
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,790
-Jae-gyeong!
-Go Man-sik of South Korea!

174
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,430
This is my lucky charm.

175
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,550
I know it doesn't look like it,

176
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,050
but it's mine.

177
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,470
Hey, put more of that on the other side.

178
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,790
I brought your stuff.

179
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,580
See if anything's missing.

180
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,130
Thank you.

181
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,140
Nobody blames you.

182
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,730
So don't make that face.

183
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,020
It makes you look pathetic.

184
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,820
But I ruined everything.

185
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm no help at all.

186
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,700
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,870
Hey!

188
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,370
Our team hasn't been dissolved yet,
so why are you apologizing?

189
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,790
Seriously.

190
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
See you.

191
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,070
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

192
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,370
Things are a mess right now,

193
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
but we can't just sit back and do nothing.

194
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,460
But there isn't much
we can do at the moment.

195
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,420
The outcome will be the same
even if we stay put,

196
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,750
so we might as well do something.

197
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,460
But we need a lead to dig into the guy.

198
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,170
Excuse me.

199
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,600
Here's the restored data
from Min Ju-yeong's burner phone

200
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
and Kim Yeon-ha's file.

201
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,390
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
that the passport was forged.

202
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,100
In addition to Kim Yeon-ha,

203
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,270
she has several fake identities
of different nationalities.

204
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,740
Excuse me.

205
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,760
Sir, how are you feeling?

206
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,510
Not great.

207
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,180
Would you like me to help you feel better?

208
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,230
Many calls were made to the phone number
registered under Kim Yeon-ha.

209
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,860
They seem pretty close.

210
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,780
Are you here to kill me?

211
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Why would I do that?

212
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,790
From the looks of you,
I think someone else might do the job.

213
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,330
If you die,

214
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,370
things will only get difficult for me.

215
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,130
There are a few other numbers
he often called besides Kim Yeon-ha's.

216
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,960
If you catch the burner phone dealer,

217
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,920
you can identify the people
Min Ju-yeong was in contact with.

218
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,550
Most of the burner phones
are registered to Russians and Chinese.

219
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,930
What's going on? Why is he here?

220
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,270
When did this punk get here?

221
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,600
What are you planning
to trick our naive captain with this time?

222
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,190
Good point.
Why share this all of a sudden?

223
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,520
What are you up to now?

224
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm not that bad a person.

225
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,490
I do feel bad about what happened.

226
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,780
Anyway, this is the best I can do to help.

227
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,160
We'll keep an eye on Min Ju-yeong,
so do what you can.

228
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,040
Good luck. Bye.

229
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,920
Senior Officers Shin and Ji,
analyze this data.

230
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,510
Sergeant Kim and I
will find the burner phone dealer.

231
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,470
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,890
What about me?

233
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,550
Hey, what about me?

234
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,970
Wait. What do you want me to do?

235
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,270
Don't do anything.

236
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,850
Just stay put!

237
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,640
-Stay with Ms. Jeong.
-What?

238
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,310
But you told me not to give up.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,730
This is all my fault. Do you really
expect me to stand by like an idiot?

240
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,860
Yeah!

241
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,240
I won't get in trouble again.

242
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,110
I'll only do what you tell me to do.

243
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,160
As if I can trust you.

244
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,820
Let's take him with us.

245
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,540
It's better to keep him with us
than risk him causing trouble.

246
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,250
Unless he's an idiot,
he won't cause any more trouble.

247
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,710
I guess.

248
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,590
Move, punk. Get in the car.

249
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,470
Where will we find
the burner phone dealer?

250
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Don't worry.

251
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,730
I know just the person
who can help us with that.

252
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,030
These are the texts Min Ju-yeong received
right before he was arrested,

253
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,620
but there's no way they were work-related.

254
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,540
"Bonded warehouse 201."

255
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,450
It's a cold storage warehouse
near Chinatown.

256
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,580
It used to be run
by the Golden Bunny Gang,

257
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,330
and the manager was Lee Sang-su.

258
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,040
Lee Sang-su?

259
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,670
Golden Bunny's younger brother,
Silver Bunny?

260
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,840
Yeah.

261
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,760
The warehouse is shut down now,
and Silver Bunny is still on the run.

262
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,470
Kim Yeon-ha's arrival time
was also 4:10 a.m.

263
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,720
She departed from Manila, Philippines.

264
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,020
"Filipino air cargo ETA,
next day at 4:10 a.m."

265
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,440
There's a Russian ship
that arrived at Insung Port at 5 a.m.

266
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,730
It's called the Victory.

267
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,280
It's owned by a shipping company

268
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,070
that smuggled used cars
and drug precursors.

269
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,700
"Russian sea cargo ETA,
next day at 5 a.m."

270
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,030
I wonder what came in.

271
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,870
Let's investigate the bonded warehouses
in the Russian cargo sector.

272
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,830
Okay.

273
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,010
Hey, be gentle.
I got new hair transplanted there.

274
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,300
That hurts a bit.

275
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,890
Okay, that's good.

276
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,970
Hey, be careful.

277
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,310
What are you doing?

278
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,480
Damn it.

279
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,730
What do you want now?

280
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,700
Jeez, you scared me.

281
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,700
If the burner phone is registered
under a Russian or Chinese name,

282
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,370
there's only one go-to guy in Insung.

283
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,870
Get off the bus!

284
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,000
Burner phone dealers
usually do business with tour guides.

285
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,920
All right, everyone.

286
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,590
They collect everyone's passports,
saying that it's necessary

287
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,470
-for hotel or tourist site reservations.
-Okay, good job.

288
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,340
After they do that,

289
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,510
they take photos of the passports
to get information.

290
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,430
CLEANING SUPPLY CLOSET

291
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,230
I told you to stay with the group.

293
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,440
Here, hold onto this.
I can't get a good shot.

294
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,980
No, back up a little.

295
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,400
Who are you?

296
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,860
Who do you think? I'm a cop.

297
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,410
A cop?

298
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,340
Hey, look at this.

300
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,300
You know who these people are, right?

301
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,680
They were in your tour group.

302
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,930
You used their passports
to make burner phones!

303
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,890
I don't know.

304
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,270
All I did was take and send photos
for 10,000 won each.

305
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,230
So tell us what you know.

306
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,520
I just told you everything.

307
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,150
I even gave you my phone.

308
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,650
Who's Daepodong Number One?

309
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,530
The burner phone market's boss.

310
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,660
I don't know his real name.
He just goes by Daepodong.

311
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,740
Where's that bastard?

312
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,740
How should I know?

313
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,620
I heard he was wanted by the police,

314
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,830
but I only met him once
when I first started working.

315
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm telling the truth. Hey, that hurts!

316
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,630
No.

317
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,630
That's not him.

318
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,510
No. It's not him.

319
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,760
-Are you really looking?
-I am.

320
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,640
No. Not him.

321
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,550
Okay.

322
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,600
Let's keep at it until we find him.

323
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,730
It's not him.

324
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,100
Not him.

325
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,850
No…

326
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,270
You're not answering.

327
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,280
Are you sleepy?

328
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,450
Next guy, please!

329
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,450
That isn't him.

330
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,700
Open your eyes!

331
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,990
Okay!

332
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,700
Sir, wake up.

333
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,290
Morning's here.

334
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,710
It's not him.

335
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,960
We have to find our guy.

336
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,750
Toasted egg sandwiches
are the best in the morning.

337
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,630
-Everyone!
-What?

338
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,510
I thought we could use a hearty breakfast.

339
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,430
Please enjoy.

340
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,770
-Here.
-Thank you.

341
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,730
Here, Dung-ju.

342
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,890
Thank you, sir.

343
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,150
Thank you.

344
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,500
Isn't Dung-ju pushing himself too hard?

345
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,500
It's not him.

346
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,920
-He pulled two all-nighters.
-He can do two more.

347
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,960
-Detective?
-Yes?

348
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,460
I'm too hungry to focus.

349
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,800
Can I have some food before we continue?

350
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,800
-Do you want it?
-Yes.

351
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,850
Thank you.

352
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,530
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,830
Hey, it's this person!

354
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,830
This is him! Daepodong!

355
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,000
Daepodong!

356
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,290
-Are you sure?
-I am. It's Daepodong.

357
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Not Nam Po-dong, the actor?

358
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,550
Not Nam Po-dong! It's Daepodong!

359
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,010
I found you, Daepodong

360
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,550
Don't come after me!

361
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,690
-Calm down and open the door.
-I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

362
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,600
Holy crap!

363
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,810
Don't you know Daepodong Number One?

364
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,440
I can't believe he's only 32 years old.

365
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,530
This guy is Daepodong Number One?

366
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,150
I've never seen him before!

367
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,110
So you've never met the warehouse owner,
and they've been out of business?

368
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,240
No, I have no idea.

369
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,080
-Go, Commissioner!
-Go, Commissioner!

370
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,330
-Go, Commissioner!
-You're so strong, sir!

371
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,460
Have you heard anything
about the Russian mafia around here?

372
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,590
Who are you guys?

373
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,970
Just a second.

374
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,600
I swear I'm not in that business anymore.
I live an honest life!

375
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,850
Okay, fine.

376
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,180
Do you know this person?

377
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,770
No, I don't.

378
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,810
I'd remember him if I had seen that face.

379
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,820
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

380
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,750
If you die,

381
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,630
things will only get difficult for me.

382
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,590
Or do you want to tell me

383
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,130
where I can find that bitch?

384
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,840
What do you say?

385
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,020
If I tell you…

386
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,400
it'll make things difficult for me.

387
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,980
Make the goods, and I'll tell you then.

388
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,450
You really are a bad boy.

389
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,620
Here's your vitamin.

390
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,380
About the lady from the noodle place…

391
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,630
I wonder how she survived.

392
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,510
By all accounts, she should've died.

393
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,850
Can I get you something?

394
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,150
Damn it.

395
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,960
RECENT CALLS

396
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,300
DONG-JU

397
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't do that.

398
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,490
People might think
I'm a gang boss or something.

399
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,370
Yes, sir.

400
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,200
Will you be heading home?

401
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,540
No, I want to buy some fruit.

402
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,880
WANTED: JANG CHUNG-GI (DAEPODONG)

403
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,470
Find anything?

404
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,600
Man, I'm exhausted.

405
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,640
Oh, dear.

406
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,350
Everyone looks exhausted.

407
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Here, try it.

408
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,320
On your shoulders like this.

409
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,370
-Hey, that feels good.
-Good.

410
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,290
They're starting to loosen up.

411
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,460
Your shoulders will feel better.

412
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,710
LEE JONG-HUN

413
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,170
Hey, what is it?

414
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,260
Hey!

415
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,260
What the hell are you doing here?

416
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,390
Stop it.

417
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,850
What a rude way to greet a visitor.

418
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,110
She's badly injured.

419
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,650
I guess she can't have these.

420
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,280
The two of you should enjoy them instead.

421
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,240
Are you kidding me?

422
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,410
I brought them as a gesture of goodwill.

423
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,370
You shot a person,
and you speak of goodwill?

424
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,330
You need another beating?

425
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,540
There you go again.

426
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,210
Accusing me without evidence or witnesses.

427
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,960
Don't you agree?

428
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Or maybe…

429
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,760
that lady saw me.

430
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,010
I see you're injured.

431
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,930
It happens
when you hold a handgun incorrectly.

432
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,520
Especially for someone inexperienced,
just like yourself.

433
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,110
You got me.

434
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,860
But does this count as evidence?

435
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,740
If she wakes, tell her this.

436
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,660
Although it's unlikely
that she saw her shooter,

437
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,830
even if she did,

438
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,450
she should stay quiet.

439
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,660
If not, who knows what might happen?

440
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,250
Do whatever you want.

441
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,050
I'm going to have you locked up,
no matter what.

442
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,130
You scumbag asshole.

443
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,470
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

444
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,680
Don't even dream about it.

445
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,520
The law, rules, fair play…

446
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,770
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

447
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,980
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

448
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,240
Don't you get it?

449
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,240
You bastard.

450
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,870
I said stop it.

451
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,240
You should stop as well and go.

452
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,080
When you have time, please teach me…

453
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,040
how to shoot a gun.

454
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,220
I'd like to make sure
to hit my mark next time.

455
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,060
Goddammit!

456
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,070
Excuse me.

457
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,730
You forgot to take this.

458
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,700
What a shame.

459
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,370
It looks like nobody saw that.

460
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,880
Here. Get your vitamins in.

461
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,210
It'll help with your recovery.

462
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,680
What is it?

463
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,720
I just like you.

464
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,100
-What do you mean?
-How can I not like someone so cool?

465
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,940
It's your fault.

466
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,860
Stop staring.

467
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju?

468
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,320
Can I have a word with you?

469
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,960
If you keep this up,
the bones won't heal properly,

470
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,460
and it'll leave your hand stuck like this.

471
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,670
Would you be able to use it properly then?

472
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,760
Why would you say that, Doctor?

473
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm telling the truth.

474
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,970
You're not one to listen, are you?

475
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,850
Since you're here, let's do an MRI scan.

476
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,940
A head MRI.

477
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,740
What did the doctor say?

478
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,490
What?

479
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,660
Oh, nothing.

480
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,750
He said my hand
could end up looking like this,

481
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,670
so I should be careful.

482
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,130
What?

483
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,760
Seriously?

484
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,800
That was it?

485
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,140
I know, right?

486
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,470
He's a funny guy.

487
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,690
There he is. It's Daepodong.

488
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,900
You should go to Cheongpo-dong.

489
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,950
From what I've heard,
he shows up there often.

490
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,570
-Daepodong?
-Yes?

491
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,540
Oh, no!

492
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,210
Where are you going?

493
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,510
What are you doing? What's wrong?

494
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,550
It's nothing. Let's go.

495
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,360
Captain, I found them.

496
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,690
Even the records of people
who called Min Ju-yeong's burner phone.

497
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,610
You know Min Ju-yeong,
the customs officer, right?

498
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,530
I can't say.

499
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,990
I don't really know any civil servants.

500
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,660
And what kind of a civil servant in Korea

501
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,830
uses a burner phone?

502
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,330
There's a bastard who does.

503
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,330
Let's get your wheels turning.

504
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay, then.

505
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,010
Who did you sell those burner phones to?

506
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,380
If I tell you, I'll die.

507
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,470
Oh, I see.

508
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,720
And who'd come after you?

509
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,600
Okay, I'll tell you!

510
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,230
Just calm down.

511
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,810
Every week,

512
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,150
some Korean Chinese guys
come and buy them in bulk.

513
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,610
-Korean Chinese?
-Yes.

514
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,360
Have you heard of Baek?

515
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,030
Call him up. I want to see him.

516
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,080
You want me to call?

517
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,120
Yeah.

518
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,500
They're really scary people.

519
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,000
You're just going to see his face, right?

520
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,250
Worry about yourself.

521
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
What the heck? Let me go!

522
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,740
Our Father, who art in heaven,

523
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,660
Hallowed be thy name.

524
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,780
Thy kingdom come,

525
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,700
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.

526
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,910
I'm sorry, sir!

527
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,750
I didn't mean to snitch,

528
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,500
but I had to because of the cops.

529
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,670
If I'd known it was connected to you,
I wouldn't have said anything.

530
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,050
I'll stay out of sight and live quietly.

531
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,720
And lead us not into temptation,

532
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,680
but deliver us from evil.

533
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,690
Through the blood of the cross,
grant us forgiveness.

534
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,620
It's been abandoned for a while.

535
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,160
Will we find any traces of them?

536
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,920
If we don't find anything here,

537
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,380
we'll search the port warehouse
in Gyosa-dong.

538
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,960
-Let's go.
-Okay.

539
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,140
You're driving?

540
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,850
Yes. Why?

541
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,850
Hold on a second.

542
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,600
Is it that car?

543
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,250
This is Senior Officer Shin Jae-hong
of the SCIT.

544
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,290
Please run the plate number 25J 8405.

545
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,710
Thank you.

546
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,380
It's unregistered.

547
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,140
Step on it.

548
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,810
I think they're on to us. Who are they?

549
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,770
We'll know when we catch them.
Hold on tight.

550
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,840
He has a gun!

551
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,050
Duck!

552
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,640
He shot at us!

553
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,350
Are you okay?

554
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,190
Those bastards.

555
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,620
Look at this.

556
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,160
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

557
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,250
He's coming this way.

558
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,850
He united Korean Chinese gangs
from the three Northeastern Provinces

559
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,310
to form the Northeastern Syndicate

560
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,940
and took over Chinatown,
which used to be Golden Bunny's territory.

561
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,520
Introducing…

562
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,360
Baek Seok-chun, also known as Baek.

563
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,240
My brother will kill you.

564
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,070
Open wide. It'll be over soon.

565
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,160
The rental warehouse was run by the mafia
operating in the Russian Far East

566
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,870
including Sakhalin and Khabarovsk.

567
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,130
It looks like they came to Korea
on a ship recently.

568
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,460
We have no intel
on the boss's description or identity.

569
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,180
My mother's homeland.

570
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,260
The one who controls the drug supply
across Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia

571
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,600
is Drug Monster, also known as Drugmon.

572
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,810
She came to Korea
under the false identity of Kim Yeon-ha,

573
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,980
and she's wanted by Interpol
and the police agency.

574
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,780
Then there's Oh Jong-gu,
the CEO of J9 Security.

575
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,240
And the person at the center of it all

576
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,000
is the Grade 7 customs officer,

577
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,370
Min Ju-yeong.

578
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,210
They're all expanding their profits
through smuggling.

579
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,840
Gangs, drugs, smuggling, and mafias.

580
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,680
It's a cartel of evil.

581
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,470
This is what we've figured out so far.

582
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,890
If we look into the suborganizations,

583
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,970
we'll likely find
most of the criminal groups in Insung.

584
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,850
This is intense.

585
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,940
Can we handle this case?

586
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,230
We'll need at least
a few months to investigate.

587
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,110
Will our team still be around by then?

588
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,780
He probably has the commissioner
in his pocket too.

589
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,570
We can't exactly investigate openly.

590
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,990
Cops shouldn't be worried about authority
when catching bad guys.

591
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,950
Bad guys need to get arrested.

592
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,410
-Hello, Commissioner!
-Hello, sir!

593
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,410
-Were you on night duty?
-Jae-hong!

594
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,010
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir.

595
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,970
What were you doing?

596
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,810
We were reflecting on
our poor behavior, sir.

597
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,720
That's what we've been doing, right?

598
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,060
I was working out, sir.

599
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,040
You sure do look like a troublemaker.

600
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,870
You never do as you're told, do you?

601
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,710
-Landscape mode.
-Portrait is the trend, sir.

602
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,090
He's been looking for a way to recover
his dropping social media views.

603
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,340
By the way, it appears that the SCIT

604
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,060
will be dissolved within a week.

605
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,480
He'll be helping out
instead of Golden Bunny from now on.

606
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,570
Introduce yourselves.

607
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,240
Yes, sir.

608
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm Oh Jong-gu.

609
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,780
I run a small security firm
and a logistics company.

610
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,370
And I was…

611
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,410
a heavyweight boxing champion.

612
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,840
Take a seat.

613
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,750
Yes, sir.

614
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,010
By the way,

615
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,720
did you find the bastards
who stole my Candy precursors?

616
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,810
There were more than just a couple.

617
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,770
The mayor's son got hooked on Candy
and crossed the line.

618
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,730
The remaining precursors
will be collected soon.

619
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,320
Hey, Mr. Min.

620
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,280
Why is everything a mess?

621
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,860
The bunny bastard is in jail,

622
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,320
and the bribed mayor's son
is making a shitshow.

623
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,490
And the cops are swarming in like flies
because of that shitshow.

624
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,160
At this rate,
this place may be left unfinished as is.

625
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,620
That won't happen.

626
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,170
This is our starting point.

627
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,840
It can't fall apart already.

628
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,800
Can you swear to God on that?

629
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,640
I want my trust in partners
to be bulletproof.

630
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,640
My mother told me
not to trust others so easily.

631
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,520
I swear.

632
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,060
Is this good enough?

633
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,980
You…

634
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,320
shouldn't trust me.

635
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,870
Don't trust me. Trust money.

636
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,660
Trust the unimaginable amount of money
that will fall into your laps.

637
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,090
"Though thy beginning was small…

638
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,420
yet thy latter end
should greatly increase."

639
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,890
-Captain, can I--
-Go home.

640
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,190
So do we…

641
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,200
just sit back and do nothing?

642
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,410
I wish we could do something.

643
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,750
What's going to happen now?

644
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,960
Say something!

645
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,580
Do you even need to ask?

646
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,750
This is it for us.

647
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,490
The team will get dissolved.

648
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,740
We'll all face disciplinary action.

649
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,200
Then we'll return
to our respective positions.

650
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,460
We will now begin the disciplinary hearing

651
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,790
regarding the dismissal
of Officer Yoon Dong-ju.

652
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,090
Anything to say before we begin?

653
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,470
Dung-ju's disciplinary hearing
probably started.

654
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,220
I hope he's doing okay in there.

655
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,970
He'll be lucky if he only gets suspended.

656
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,570
Officer Yoon Dong-ju?

657
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,450
That's how it'll end.

658
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,580
The bad guys will go on living
without a care,

659
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,120
while the dead are left with injustice.

660
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,540
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

661
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,000
Don't even dream about it.

662
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,960
The law, rules, fair play…

663
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,010
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

664
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,220
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

665
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:17,270
On behalf of all the athletes,

666
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,690
I hereby pledge

667
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,230
to compete with honor
and a true spirit of sportsmanship,

668
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,950
respecting and abiding by the rules.

669
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,950
Athletes' representative, Yoon Dong-ju.

670
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,000
Officer Yoon Dong-ju, please sit--

671
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Officer Yoon!

672
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,880
What?

673
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,970
Then where the heck is he right now?

674
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,200
How can I--

675
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,740
We need to talk.

676
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,090
His last visit to the hospital
was three days ago.

677
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:28,550
If he's not in the on-call room
or at the hospital, then where is he?

678
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,510
We haven't been able to reach him
for two days now.

679
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,680
Are you sure Dong-ju
last met with Oh Jong-gu?

680
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,180
Yes, I checked with the female bookkeeper.

681
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,390
We can't reach Oh Jong-gu either.

682
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,600
She says he's on a business trip,
but she doesn't know where he is.

683
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,360
Do you think…

684
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,940
Dung-ju got himself into big trouble?

685
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,740
I don't know, damn it!

686
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,490
What about Min Ju-yeong?

687
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,290
He took a sick leave and went on vacation
after getting discharged,

688
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,950
but we can't locate him.

689
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,750
Where the hell is Dung-ju holed up?

690
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,670
I'll go and check out

691
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,710
a gym in Dongho-dong
where Dung-ju used to go.

692
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,880
In any case, once we locate
Oh Jong-gu and Min Ju-yeong…

693
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,130
-What the heck?
-What is it?

694
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,260
It's moving.

695
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,310
You scared me, you little bastard!

696
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,520
What are you doing there? Come out!

697
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,230
For crying out loud, you idiot!

698
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,200
What happened to your face? Let me see.

699
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,490
Let me see.

700
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,750
You got into trouble again, didn't you?

701
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,170
I spent the weekend
going around looking for you!

702
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,420
I didn't get into trouble.

703
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,920
I just thought I should do something.

704
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,640
So you went to Oh Jong-gu
to settle things once and for all?

705
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,680
To get a confession from him?

706
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,520
I can't believe you, Dung-ju.

707
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,520
You little brat!

708
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,320
You couldn't help yourself
and had to get into a fight, didn't you?

709
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,820
Why can't you see
that this accomplishes nothing?

710
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,530
Man, this is frustrating!

711
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,840
Why are you following me?

712
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,760
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

713
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,430
Here.

714
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,650
I don't have anywhere to go.

715
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,110
Can I stay with you?

716
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,990
Are you always like this?

717
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,070
What?

718
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,740
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

719
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,660
You think it's okay to ignore the problem
and laugh things off, right?

720
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,960
Just go.

721
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

722
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,290
RICE PORRIDGE

723
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,040
This pitiful act doesn't suit you.

724
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,460
Where on earth are you staying, you punk?

725
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,680
Dung-ju looked pretty bad.

726
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,640
Do you think the other person
got hurt badly too?

727
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,950
What do you mean?

728
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,660
The commissioner decided
to put the SCIT's dissolution on hold.

729
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,290
Your team won't face
disciplinary action either.

730
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,670
Wait a minute.

731
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,720
He was so set on dissolving the SCIT.
What changed his mind?

732
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,380
-Didn't Yoon Dong-ju tell you?
-Tell me what?

733
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,840
It seems that

734
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,220
he met with Min Ju-yeong
and settled things.

735
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,980
Settle what?

736
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,650
This is interesting.

737
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,570
So you're willing to take
as many hits as you've given

738
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,780
as long as I leave the SCIT alone?

739
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
That's right.

740
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,530
Just get rid of me.

741
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,790
A man shouldn't be so petty
and drag other people into things.

742
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,580
Our problem should be resolved between us.

743
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,290
You're here to apologize,
yet you seem so brazen.

744
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,880
All right.

745
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,140
We're friends. A friend can do that much.

746
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,430
But we're in different weight classes,

747
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,810
so we should balance the scales.

748
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,810
If you're still standing
after getting beaten up…

749
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,940
I'll think about what to do.

750
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,570
Who does he think he is, Jesus?

751
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,990
Why take on all the burden?

752
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,330
Are you always like this?

753
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,420
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

754
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,170
Just go.

755
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,380
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

756
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,220
He hasn't come
to the on-call room in days.

757
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,800
Where in the world is he?

758
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,890
Where's the gym Dong-ju used to go to?

759
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,060
It's called Victory Gym in Dongho-dong.

760
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,520
-Thank you.
-But…

761
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,230
It's Victory Gym in Dongho-dong!

762
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,690
VICTORY GYM

763
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,870
Excuse me, is Yoon Dong-ju here?

764
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:29,950
I don't know.

765
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,000
STEAMED BUN

766
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,150
DUNG-JU

767
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,740
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME,
BUT ANSWER YOUR PHONE

768
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,870
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE DEAD

769
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,170
TEXT FROM STEAMED BUN
MISSED CALL FROM STEAMED BUN

770
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,890
VICTORY GYM

771
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,320
Have you experienced
any discomfort lately?

772
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,740
Anything like hand tremors
or blurry vision?

773
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,530
Maybe sudden moments of dizziness?

774
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,330
Why do you ask?

775
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,330
The repeated impacts sustained
during your athletic career

776
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,120
may have caused brain damage.

777
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,330
They call it becoming punch-drunk.

778
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,380
You might be okay right now,

779
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,170
but the symptoms can get worse.

780
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,590
I recommend an in-depth examination.

781
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,220
Just getting home?

782
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,020
-I don't see him around at all.
-Excuse me?

783
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:46,400
The guy who followed you around
like a mutt.

784
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,570
Did you two fight?

785
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,650
What's wrong with him?

786
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,240
They say he has a cold.

787
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,700
He got a shot this afternoon,
but he's still listless.

788
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,290
My goodness, why is this mutt
making me worry so much?

789
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,750
He won't eat either.

790
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,960
-Can I?
-Yeah.

791
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,630
Go ahead.

792
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,510
Dung-ju, have some sausage.

793
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,680
Goodness, he's eating it.

794
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,390
He's eating.

795
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,600
Are you eating it
because the sweet lady gave it to you?

796
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,020
Goodness.

797
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,230
Do you feel better now?

798
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,240
STEAMED BUN

799
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,870
DUNG-JU

800
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,830
WHERE ARE YOU? DID YOU EAT? ARE YOU SICK?

801
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,750
I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING TO YOU

802
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,090
CONTACT ME OR YOU'LL REALLY REGRET IT

803
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,260
Still can't get in touch with Dong-ju?

804
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:02,770
No.

805
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,980
The little punk
is driving me absolutely crazy.

806
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,080
DUNG-JU

807
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,710
What kind of champion gets beaten up?

808
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:16,960
How humiliating.

809
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,390
I couldn't think of a way
to beat Min Ju-yeong,

810
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,850
no matter how hard I racked my brains.

811
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,390
I don't have anything or any influence.

812
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,020
But then I thought it over and realized…

813
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,770
I know how to take hits.

814
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,020
I'm really good at taking hits.

815
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,410
So I thought that was the only way…

816
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,500
I could protect us.

817
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,750
That's why I did it. I'm sorry.

818
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,250
I'll leave now.

819
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,550
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

820
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,310
Good job.

821
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,980
So is that it?

822
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,730
Is that what you want to do?

823
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,070
Do you want to give up now?

824
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,150
So?

825
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,740
Should we stop?

826
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
No.

827
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,290
No.

828
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,380
I won't give up.

829
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,340
Why would I?

830
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,350
Lying on the floor

831
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,600
isn't humiliating.

832
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,730
That's just how life is.

833
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,740
You push through it,

834
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,410
enduring it with gritted teeth.

835
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,780
If you can hold on and stay down
without getting turned over,

836
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:54,330
you can get back up and fight again.

837
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,720
It doesn't matter
how many times you fall…

838
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,350
as long as you get back up.

839
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,020
The fight isn't over.

840
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,070
There are still more rounds to go.

841
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,770
-They say everything has its purpose.
-What are you doing? Stop being gross.

842
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,770
Why are you leaving
that little mutt of a cop alone?

843
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,690
-Where are the rest of the precursors?
-He only heard that there was a delay

844
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,400
due to customs clearance procedures.

845
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:51,860
This one's a bit too much.

846
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,700
It is, isn't it?

847
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,030
-If there are red fire ants…
-This is our chance.

848
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,040
You can stay at my place.

849
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,580
Breath. Tremors. Wind.

850
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,290
You take everything into account.

851
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,630
Let's begin.

852
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,920
There are days…

853
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,140
that feel like a stray bullet.
