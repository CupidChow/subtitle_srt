1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,800
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,200
The third round has begun.

4
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Yoon Dong-ju needs to push a bit harder.

5
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,460
The gold medal is just within reach.

6
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,710
He needs to focus
and put his weight behind every punch.

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,130
Right hook!

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,300
He's got to keep pressing in!

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,630
Yoon Dong-ju is doing a great job.

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,470
He and his opponent are exchanging blows.

11
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,010
He tagged him with that left hook.

12
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,140
Yoon Dong-ju is putting up a great fight.

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,100
His opponent targets his right side
and then moves in for the clinch.

14
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,190
Yoon Dong-ju needs to hang in there.

15
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,820
We're underway again.

16
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,910
He lands a left hook.
Yoon Dong-ju needs to push through!

17
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,950
He has to keep moving
and not take these hits!

18
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,540
It's too late to dodge
if you wait to see the fist.

19
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,920
A punch doesn't start with the fist.

20
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,680
It starts with the shoulder.

21
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,850
Now aim for an opening…

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,060
outside the line of sight…

23
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,480
of your opponent.

24
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,980
The person you are calling
cannot be reached.

25
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
You will be directed to…

26
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,770
DUNG-JU

27
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,780
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

28
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,740
Han-na, I'll call you in a bit.

29
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,670
VICTORY GYM

30
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,350
The flower fell.

31
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,890
And there are only four leaves left.

32
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,690
Just like me.

33
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,530
BRAVE CITIZEN IS THE SUSPECT?
TWIST AFTER ILLEGAL BUSINESS BUST

34
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,700
TURD DUNG-JU

35
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,990
The phone is turned off…

36
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,950
He won't answer his phone.

37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,540
He hasn't come home for days.
What in the world is he doing out there?

38
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,340
GWANG-SE

39
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,720
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service…

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,810
-What is it?
-What the heck?

41
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,270
EMERGENCY ALERT
LOOKING FOR LEE GWANG-SE

42
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,940
-What's going on?
-Isn't it that guy over there?

43
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,980
-It looks just like him.
-It does.

44
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,360
-Right?
-You're right.

45
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,480
-It's him.
-I think it's him.

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,440
He matches the description.

47
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,650
MALE, 40S, CHUBBY, BALD EAGLE TATTOO

48
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,910
-It says the guy has a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

49
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,410
-Isn't that it?
-Is that an eagle?

50
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,490
No, it's not.

51
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,290
-It's not?
-No, please don't mind me. Bon appétit!

52
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,200
This is a shame. You had a great team.

53
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Hello, sir.

54
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,710
-Did you get discharged?
-Yes.

55
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,540
Good to see you're doing better.

56
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,500
All your teammates
were assigned to different teams.

57
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,880
What's happening to you?

58
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm not sure.

59
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,550
I don't know.

60
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,350
FORENSIC

61
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,520
Oh, right.

62
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,350
Do you have some time?

63
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,940
I need to show you something.

64
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,950
AUTOPSY REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

65
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,410
3 BODIES FOUND IN TOTAL

66
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,330
1 IDENTIFIED, 2 UNIDENTIFIED

67
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,340
Is it okay for you to show me this?

68
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,420
I can tell something is off about a case
just by looking at the bodies.

69
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,090
And I know who'll take an interest in it.

70
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,510
Ask the NFS for more details.

71
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,470
All the files have been sent to them.

72
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,890
Okay.

73
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,610
I'm so stressed.
No wonder I'm losing hair.

74
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,370
-Hey.
-Oh, jeez!

75
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,450
A comb-over won't make a difference.

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,370
Detective.

77
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,960
You did this, didn't you?

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,500
Isn't this a waste
of government resources?

79
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,000
Are you allowed
to use your authority like this?

80
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,380
This is a waste of taxpayer money.
Haven't you considered that?

81
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,220
Whatever. You don't even pay taxes.

82
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,090
You shouldn't have changed your number.

83
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,300
Why are you looking for me?
What is it this time?

84
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,180
You know where Dong-ju is, don't you?

85
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,520
How should I know?

86
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,530
-Goodness, that man's hair…
-Who? What about it?

87
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,030
-It's already unlocked.
-Damn it.

88
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,200
-Let's see here.
-I'm so stressed.

89
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,990
"Dragon PC Café,"
and "Gyelim Day Labor Agency."

90
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,830
These are all the places
where Dong-ju caused trouble.

91
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,040
You're the only one
who can give him this information.

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,540
Where's Dong-ju now?

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,550
Oh, my, hello.

94
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,640
Is Senior Officer Ji not here?

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,350
She's out of the office
to verify some files.

96
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,720
Out for work or whatever. Who knows?

97
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,310
It's hard to work with kids these days.

98
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,060
Anyway, how are you feeling?

99
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,690
I've never met someone who's been shot.

100
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,740
-Was it your side?
-I'm fine now.

101
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
-You sure?
-Yes.

102
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,860
-Good day.
-Okay.

103
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,370
Or was it his arm?

104
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,950
RECORDS ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

105
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,540
Excuse me.

106
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,460
Yes?

107
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,670
Do you know where she went?

108
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,290
INIL DINER

109
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,460
Oh Bong-chan?

110
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,050
Do you mean Oh Dollar,
the smuggler from way back when?

111
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,180
Yes.

112
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,010
You were the detective
in charge of the case back then.

113
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,680
I suppose, but not really.

114
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,690
Excuse me? What do you mean?

115
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,980
That was my first case
when I got transferred.

116
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,530
But I didn't do much.

117
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,320
They obviously got into an altercation
with each other and died.

118
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,410
What else is there to investigate?

119
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,290
Let's wrap things up here and go.

120
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,500
The higher-ups did the investigation.

121
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,130
All I did was sign the papers.

122
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,260
Then, by any chance, is there someone
who might be familiar with the case?

123
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,880
Goodness, it's been so long.

124
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,260
My senior colleagues from back then
have passed away.

125
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,350
Wait.

126
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,480
-You know what?
-What?

127
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,230
There's no food.

128
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,730
-Ma'am, can we get--
-Grilled hagfish.

129
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
A large order of grilled hagfish, please.

130
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
You sure know how to treat someone right.

131
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,700
There's a place called Hyedong Oil.

132
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,710
You'll find a thug that sells ship fuel.

133
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,040
HYEDONG OIL

134
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,500
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

135
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,550
Be careful.

136
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,720
Officer Yoon stirred up the place,
so everyone is pretty riled up.

137
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,430
-You're not coming?
-Jeez, no.

138
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,390
It'll be a real pain if they see me.

139
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,600
-So I'm not--
-Run!

140
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,440
Keep still!

141
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,320
What was that?

142
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,910
Damn, the shit already hit the fan.

143
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,620
I'll see you later.
Good luck meeting with him!

144
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,790
What the hell do you mean?

145
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,460
Damn it, now everyone knows my hideout.

146
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,300
So you're looking for
a lady police officer?

147
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,130
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,800
Can I get a large order of flounder?

149
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,510
-Make it an extra large, please.
-An extra large, please.

150
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,180
HYEDONG OIL

151
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,950
-Hey, Gwang-se. Where's your loyalty?
-Move!

152
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,030
Hey!

153
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,990
I guess you don't have any.
Wait, you punk!

154
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,290
-Who are they?
-The guys Officer Yoon stirred up.

155
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,870
If they catch us, we're dead!

156
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,080
-That idiot!
-Get them!

157
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,380
Dae-yong, get over here!
We're in big trouble!

158
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,880
Get your ass over here!

159
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,840
Let go of me!

160
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,800
No, not you!

161
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,180
Come quickly!

162
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,220
My location is…

163
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,520
Hyedong Oil in Jinam-dong!

164
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,560
We're about to die here!

165
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,570
Hey, kill them.

166
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,330
Are you okay?

167
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,120
Dong-ju!

168
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,500
Yoon Dong-ju.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,920
You're the bastard from earlier.
Who the hell are you?

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,210
-Rude little bastards.
-I got you now.

171
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,880
Hey, kill them!

172
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,130
Move.

173
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,890
-Senior Officer Ji!
-Ma'am!

174
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,970
You rude little punk.

175
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,340
Why did you get discharged already?

176
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,840
You had a few more days left.

177
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,680
I just wanted to get out.

178
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,560
Why are you here anyway?

179
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,060
Are you investigating something?

180
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,020
It's nothing.

181
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,070
There was a reference statement
missing from a file.

182
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,320
Don't worry about it.

183
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,700
This is Yoon Dong-ju's doing, right?

184
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,250
And the wholesale supermarket
and club incidents?

185
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,410
I don't know. Just pretend you don't know.

186
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,420
Fine by me.
It'll improve my performance record.

187
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,710
But be careful.
Things at the agency are bad.

188
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,960
What about the Russian mafia
who shot Sergeant Kim?

189
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,670
We've put out an APB,

190
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,970
but the other agencies aren't cooperating,

191
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,470
so it's hard to track him down.

192
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,350
The good news is

193
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,640
there's no sign he stowed away
or left the country yet,

194
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,600
and the cargo ship is still docked here.

195
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,810
He's waiting for things to quiet down.

196
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,490
Are you going to sit there
and not say a word?

197
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,870
You little bastard!

198
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,580
I ought to take this smoke vent
and shove it in your mouth!

199
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,260
You idiot.

200
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,010
Do you think beating up some thugs
will make any difference?

201
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,720
Nothing happened even when we had
officers getting stabbed and shot.

202
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,140
No matter what you do,
the higher-ups will just cover it all up!

203
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,350
Digging into a cold case
will only lead to trouble.

204
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,060
If it's gone cold,
we'll make it hot again.

205
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,110
What?

206
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,150
We've been looking at this the wrong way.

207
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,530
We have to watch the shoulder
instead of the fist.

208
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,070
We should've thought of

209
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,780
the source of his power.

210
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,370
What do you mean?

211
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,080
An ordinary civil servant

212
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,210
mobilizes the local gang,

213
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,330
the Korean Chinese gang,
and even the Russian mafia.

214
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,920
The power to control the mayor
and cover things up

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,130
comes from money.

216
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,760
It's money.

217
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,550
That's the source of his power.

218
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,430
Used cars, drugs,
and firearms trafficking.

219
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,010
Including earnings from other businesses,
a rough estimate of his total revenue

220
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,100
is over several hundred billion won.

221
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,850
Where did all that money go?

222
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,730
Is that the reason you've been taking down
everyone wearing gold watches?

223
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,900
Yes.

224
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,030
By yourself?

225
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,660
Any leads?

226
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,540
Does anyone know where he hid the money?

227
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,080
No.

228
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,040
I haven't had any luck so far.

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,750
It's not like we can ask
Min Ju-yeong for the location.

230
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,920
At this point, it seems impossible.

231
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,470
It's not entirely impossible.

232
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,510
Three bodies were found inside a container

233
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,680
on the Russian cargo ship.

234
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,440
One was a Japanese international student.

235
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,520
The other two were dead for too long
to get a positive ID.

236
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,860
But one of them was missing
their two front teeth.

237
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,030
No front teeth? Could it be Silver Bunny?

238
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,700
I'm not sure, but it's very likely.

239
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,620
If we can confirm this,
Golden Bunny might talk.

240
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,420
Let's wait for the NFS results for now.

241
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,920
We'll figure out
what to do afterward and--

242
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,130
-Here are your two extra bowls of rice.
-We didn't order that.

243
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,340
Over here, ma'am.

244
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,550
Enjoy your meal. Oh, this is hot.

245
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,990
I'm going to take off first
to deal with this punk.

246
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,070
You're driving.

247
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,280
-At least let me finish my meal.
-Earn your keep!

248
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,290
So…

249
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,500
How's your ankle?

250
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,550
I still need to get treatment,

251
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,130
but I can walk on it.

252
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,890
I'll drop you off. Get in.

253
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm good. I can walk on my own two legs.

254
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm walking too.

255
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,440
See you later.

256
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,650
Get home safely.

257
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,950
See you.

258
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,840
Why did you come here?

259
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Do you even need to ask?

260
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,810
Are we going up there?

261
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
I'll walk you home.

262
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,610
No.

263
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,690
VICTORY GYM

264
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,850
What are you doing in there?

265
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Let's spar.

266
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,290
You said you'd teach me.

267
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,290
Next time.

268
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,960
You can get hurt if you're unprepared.
Step down.

269
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,590
Come on.

270
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,980
Hey.

271
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,780
Why do you keep avoiding me?

272
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,860
What?

273
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,570
Why do you keep avoiding me?

274
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,660
I have no choice but to avoid you.

275
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,000
It was me.

276
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,840
I started this whole thing alone, so--

277
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,550
That's it? That was your reason?

278
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,840
Still, how could you not tell me?

279
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,850
I waited for you.

280
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,890
You really…

281
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,390
You really deserve a beating.

282
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,060
Seriously.

283
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,730
Why go off on your own?

284
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,400
What can you do all by yourself?

285
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,860
Why risk yourself all alone?

286
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,280
Stop it.

287
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,660
You'll wear yourself out.

288
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,280
I said stop.

289
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,700
Once I start,

290
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,330
I won't hold back anymore.

291
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,080
INSUNG CITY GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY
CONSTRUCTION SITE

292
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Please wait until things settle down.

293
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,910
I'm taking care of it.

294
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,170
Once the Candy is restocked,
I'll cover your losses to date.

295
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,420
Mr. Oh, handle the businesses
for the time being.

296
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,010
Excuse me?

297
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,720
-You want me to do it?
-What did you say?

298
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,890
Why is this dumb bastard in charge?

299
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,180
I said "for the time being."

300
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,980
If that's what you want,
I'll do it for the time being.

301
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,190
-Excuse me.
-Hey, where do you think you're going?

302
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,030
Hey!

303
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,570
Mr. Min.

304
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,740
We're being patient here.

305
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,660
Stop messing around with the cop
and focus on conducting business.

306
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,710
Of course.

307
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,290
Speaking of, I have a favor to ask of you.

308
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,220
I need someone to distribute this.

309
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,140
Are you saying
you want to sell that in Insung?

310
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,070
My guys will sell to anyone,
regardless of age.

311
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,700
But what if Drugmon finds out?

312
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,280
It's a breach of contract.

313
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,330
This business is solely between us.

314
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,380
Nobody else will know.

315
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,890
Take it easy and sit down.

316
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,270
Don't overdo it, or you'll pass out.

317
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,230
Chocolate?

318
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,740
I don't plan on staying in Korea for long.

319
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,570
When do you depart?

320
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,780
On Friday.

321
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,080
Want to come with me after this is over?

322
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,540
Will your mama like me?

323
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,960
Of course.

324
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,960
I chose you.

325
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,130
No chance.

326
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,760
Sorry, but I don't have time for you.

327
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,770
Because of the person you're looking for?

328
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,770
Yeah.

329
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,440
Who exactly are you looking for?

330
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,690
Someone whom I miss…

331
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,780
but also want to kill.

332
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,360
It's a relief that she's going to the US.

333
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,950
But the parents
seem to have a drug problem.

334
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,080
I mean, every family has problems.

335
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,460
But the real problem is that she might
refuse to leave her younger sister.

336
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,340
We just need to send her off.

337
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
What is it?

338
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,050
Go ahead and wait for me.

339
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,760
I promise to come and get you.

340
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,980
Okay, then.

341
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,070
Hold on to this hairpin for me
until I see you again, okay?

342
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,780
Promise me.

343
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,280
Okay, I promise.

344
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I mean it.

345
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,080
She sent me to the US…

346
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,920
in her place.

347
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,690
Everything disappeared.

348
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,780
My life.

349
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,610
And even my name.

350
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,780
She's the only one who remembers who I am.

351
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,000
Hello?

352
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,260
Have you eaten yet?

353
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,680
If not, should we eat together?

354
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,820
Can I order this too?

355
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,450
An assorted platter, please.

356
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,870
Sure. Eat as much as you want.

357
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,580
Man, it's great having a friend
who can treat you to such expensive meals.

358
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,210
We should stay in touch more.

359
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,300
People come here for oyster and rice soup,
but the other dishes are good too.

360
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,130
I'm exploring good restaurants
to eat at these days.

361
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,380
This place is going on my list.

362
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,400
You seem to be in a different mood.

363
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,150
You think so?

364
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,900
You must be hungry
after stirring up trouble everywhere.

365
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Darn it.

366
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,210
You got me.

367
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,680
How do you manage to work so diligently?

368
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,350
It's rather touching to see.

369
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,100
Everyone lives like me.

370
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,150
They do honest and diligent work,

371
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,740
putting in sweat and effort…

372
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
unlike you.

373
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,360
I work hard

374
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,450
and put in effort too.

375
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,410
But without breaking a sweat.

376
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,870
That's enough fun and games.

377
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,290
If you keep acting up,

378
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,540
you might die.

379
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,670
I mean it.

380
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,590
It doesn't matter.

381
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,630
The count has started.

382
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
I used to struggle
and live the way you do…

383
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,430
but it didn't change anything.

Aren't you the Hanguk University student

working part-time at customs?

393
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,760
I like the look in your eyes, kid.

395
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,850
To be a Grade 5 civil servant.

396
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,430
What will you do once you've become one?

397
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,230
Make money, of course.

398
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,520
Make money?

399
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,400
You want to study your ass off

You might be book-smart,

401
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,360
but you have no idea
how to make money, do you?

402
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,780
You saw all that, right?

403
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,620
That's how you make money.

404
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,630
That costs more
than what you make in a year.

405
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,260
Consider it a consolation
for working hard to cover tuition.

406
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,950

Are you sure it's my brother?

Yes.

423
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,740
His two front teeth were forcibly removed.

424
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,700
We compared them
to your brother's dental records,

425
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,080
and the DNA test results are a match.

426
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,580
This is from the NFS.

427
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,460
What did you do to my brother?

428
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,880
He's still alive.

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,260

Mr. Lee Sang-gon.

431
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,430
Just how much money
does Min Ju-yeong have?

432
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,100
-Several hundred billion won?
-Several hundred billion?

433
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,980
You guys really have no idea, do you?

434
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,110
Min Ju-yeong
is on a whole different scale.

435
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,110
He's beyond all your wildest imaginations.

436
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,530
Just how much are we talking about here?

437
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,290
You know what he said
when we first started working together?

438
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,600
How much would it be
if this space were filled?

439
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,260
Excuse me?

440
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,600
It only took me two years
to realize he wasn't joking.

441
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,150
I'm sure you guys are well aware

442
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,570
that common sense
doesn't apply to that bastard.

443
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,070
He doesn't count money.

444
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,860
He weighs it.

445
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,160
By the ton, at that.

446
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,640
The entire city of Insung is controlled
by that bastard's money.

447
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,430
His money is everywhere.

448
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,020
It spreads like blood,

449
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,400
flowing from the bottom
all the way to the top.

450
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,930
It's the reason why
you can't catch Min Ju-yeong,

451
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,100
no matter how hard you try.

00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,620
My apologies for being late.

454
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,660
Everyone, please say hello.

455
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,500
-This is the police commissioner.
-Hello.

456
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,340
I see the departmental chief prosecutor
is here too.

457
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,340
-It's all thanks to you.
-That's enough.

458
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,090
Let's take a seat.

459
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,470
Min Ju-yeong

460
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,520
is Insung itself.

461
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,360
That's insane.
So how much money does he actually have?

462
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,650
That's not the issue.

463
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
The issue is how we're going to find it.

464
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,160
Golden Bunny said

465
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,160
there was a well-known smuggler
named Oh Dollar.

466
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh Dollar.

467
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,330
And Oh Dollar had a Russian henchman.

468
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,880
One of the Russians
who worked for Oh Dollar

469
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,170
now works for Min Ju-yeong.

470
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,970
His name is Sergei.

471
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,220
He'll know
where Min Ju-yeong hid the money.

472
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,140
-Sergei?
-Sergei what?

473
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,390
That's all we got.

474
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,640
Golden Bunny only knew what he went by.

475
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,140
He didn't know Sergei's exact name or age.

476
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,070
The only thing he mentioned
was that he had a rather prominent nose.

477
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,440
If you call out the name Sergei in Moscow,
everyone will turn their heads,

478
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,700
and they'll all match that description.

479
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,370
Things would be easier
if he had a petite nose.

480
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,500
I have the list of references
from the Oh Dollar murder case.

481
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,410
I remember seeing
a man named Sergei on it.

482
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,380
Here. It's this person.

483
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,500
Sergei Kirillovich Vronsky.

484
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,550
Wait a minute. Why do you have this list?

485
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,760
Did you put it together?

486
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,810
I was organizing old case files
in the records room,

487
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,180
and I've been gathering similar cases
involving smuggling or the Russian mafia.

488
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,020
SERGEI KIRILLOVICH VRONSKY

489
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,070
Wait.

490
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,480
I've seen this guy before.

491
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,570
Seobu Station has jurisdiction
over that wholesale supermarket.

492
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,870
If Senior Inspector Kang
can get us the parking lot CCTV footage,

493
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,280
we can get the plate number.

494
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,380
Oh, I almost forgot.
Min Ju-yeong called me today.

495
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,130
-He asked to meet up.
-What did he say?

496
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,960
Not much. He probably feels cornered.

497
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,630
By the way,

498
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,100
is it just going to be us?

499
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,100
What about Senior Officer Shin?

500
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Right. What about Jae-hong?

501
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,770
I'll reach out to him.

502
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,230
But it'll be just us for now.

503
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,440
-Just us?
-Us?

504
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,260
Hey, you in the jacket.

505
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,840
Bring me some water.

506
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,310
-Me?
-Yeah, you punk.

507
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,930
Don't just stand there.

508
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,310
Go get some water.

509
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,770
Didn't you hear me?

510
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,440
I said go get some water.

511
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,740
-Are you crazy?
-He says he wants some water.

512
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,240
-Excuse me?
-He wants water.

513
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,490
Yes, of course.

514
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Captain.

515
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Yeah?

516
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,430
What's going on with Jae-hong?

517
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,940
I heard he was cut from promotion review
because of the disciplinary action.

518
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,480
I called him,

519
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,780
but I couldn't bring myself
to ask him to join us.

520
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,110
Jae-hong works rotating shifts
and has applied for overtime.

521
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,740
And it seems he works part-time at night.

522
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,120
I don't know for sure
because he won't answer my questions,

523
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,870
but he's risking disciplinary action
for a secret side job,

524
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,790
so things must be tough at home.

525
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,710
He's got four kids. That can't be easy.

526
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,630
Sir, we're almost there.

527
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,050
Sir?

528
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,130
KI BANK
YOUR LOAN REPAYMENT IS DUE…

529
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,440
It's been a while.

530
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,700
Why are you here?

531
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,870
Everyone seems busy.

532
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,250
I should've stopped by.
Guess I'm the only one missing.

533
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,040
I heard about your situation.

534
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,500
-If you need my help--
-It's okay.

535
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,710
Don't worry about me.

536
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,510
About your promotion…

537
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,810
I know I'm partly to blame
for why it didn't happen.

538
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,310
Jeez, come on.

539
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,600
That was ages ago.

540
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,060
You did what you had to do.

541
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,440
I'm still sorry.

542
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,860
I should've apologized sooner.

543
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,950
I don't want your apology.

544
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,660
Sorry?

545
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:36,950
How should I put this?

546
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:42,040
I think I need someone to be angry at
to feel a little better.

547
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,920
Thanks for the concern.

548
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,090
Tell the others that I'm sorry. See you.

549
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,640
CITIZEN-FOCUSED INSUNG SEOBU POLICE

550
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,690
VEHICLE/CCTV SEARCH REPORT

551
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,610
The owner is the Russian guy
you mentioned,

552
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,570
and he's often spotted in Texas Town.

553
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,690
What are you up to this time?

554
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,000
Captain, 4889 is over there.

555
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,260
47G 4889

556
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,350
The engine's still hot. He just got here.

557
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,350
-It's an electric car.
-What?

558
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,860
Let's split up and look for him.

559
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,520
Sergeant Kim and I will stay down here.

560
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,480
You and Senior Officer Ji go upstairs.

561
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
I'll go with him.

562
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,580
I'll go upstairs.

563
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,450
Let's go.

564
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,800
Don't overdo it. Let me go in first.

565
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,130
Why? Are you going to protect me?

566
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,550
You can't wind up in the hospital again.

567
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,140
Don't treat me like I'm injured.
It's not that bad.

568
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,390
Hey, owner of 4889.

569
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,980
Hey!

570
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,030
You little bastard.

571
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,710
Hey, stop!

572
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,710
I said stop, you bastard!

573
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,380
-Hey!
-Isn't that Yoon Dong-ju?

574
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,640
Isn't that Jong-hyeon?

575
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,730
Kim Jong-hyeon!

576
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,820
He's the best.

577
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,370
Don't overdo it. You'll hurt yourself.

578
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,670
Get out, Sergei.

579
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,540
You're Sergei, right?

580
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,010
Do you know who Oh Dollar is?

581
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,260
What's going on? Who are you?

582
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,600
What did he just say?
Don't you know how to speak Korean?

583
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,980
Are you cops?

584
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,900
You fool.

585
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,440
-Hey, fool.
-Fool?

586
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,740
Han-na, do you speak Russian?

587
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,780
A little bit.

588
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,700
Who the hell are you?

589
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,250
What?

590
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,790
What the hell?

591
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,500
Idiot.

592
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,050
Fuck off.

593
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,010
You little brat. How old are you?

594
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,680
Watch your language, lady.
Where did you learn Russian anyway?

595
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Hold on.

596
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,850
Senior Officer Ji,
did you just curse at him in Russian?

597
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,140
Oh, they were curse words?

598
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,740
You know, at times you seem totally fine,
but then you get really weird.

599
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,490
Do you understand Russian?

600
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,370
Yeah, I went up against a lot of Russians
in international competitions.

601
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,240
I picked up some then. Let me see.

602
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,080
We have a question.

603
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,290
How should I phrase this?

604
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,210
Oh Bong-chan. Oh Dollar. You know him?

605
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,300
What are you saying?
Your pronunciation is crap.

606
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,050
I can't understand anything.

607
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,920
Oh? How should I know?

608
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:05,930
He's speaking too quickly.

609
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,970
Too fast.

610
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,350
Slowly, please.

611
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,100
This one stutters,

612
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,980
this one curses,

613
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,020
and this one is wearing weird glasses.

614
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,020
You're all crazy.

615
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,150
This won't do. His accent is too strong.

616
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,450
Let's get a Russian interpreter.

617
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,070
There are different accents in Russian?

618
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,070
Of course, it's a huge country.

619
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,410
Let's take him in for now.

620
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,330
I'll find an interpreter right away.

621
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,540
Looks like we won't need an interpreter.

622
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,500
Oh, my.

623
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:42,340
-This is a nice phone.
-Give it back to me!

624
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,470
Fuck, it got scratched.

625
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,930
I'm still paying it off.

626
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,560
Your Korean is really good.

627
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,360
You even exchange text messages in Korean.

628
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,360
I knew it, you lying Pinocchio.

629
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,780
Hey, you owe me a new phone!

630
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,280
-I said stop laughing.
-Oh, jeez.

631
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:11,030
Hey, so you're Sergei.

632
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,590
You act like the fridge is yours.
I'm keeping count, you know.

633
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,300
This is so refreshing!

634
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,430
I'm going to enjoy this slowly.

635
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,060
I said I don't know anything.
You've been asking me for hours.

636
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,430
If you keep lying,

637
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,690
your nose will only get bigger.

638
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,110
Hey, aren't you cops?
Are cops allowed to do this?

639
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,320
I'm starving, but you won't even feed me.

640
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,320
I'm a Russian citizen.

641
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,610
This could become a diplomatic issue.

642
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,570
His Korean is excellent.

643
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,160
-Exactly. Hurry it up so we can eat.
-I told you we couldn't reason with him.

644
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,450
I ought to just…

645
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,620
Why don't we let him go?

646
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,040
What? What are you talking about?

647
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,050
At least someone here speaks some sense.

648
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,010
Speaks some sense, my ass.
Why release him after all that trouble?

649
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,680
I'm going now, okay?

650
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,300
You're not going anywhere.

651
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,470
He said I could go.

652
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,680
Go ahead.

653
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,770
Captain.

654
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
But there's something you should know.

655
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,940
You won't last a day
if you walk out that door.

656
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,070
You'll also end up like this.

657
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,240
THREE BODIES FOUND ON THE VICTORY

658
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,120
You could bleed out
after your teeth are ripped out,

659
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,620
die from a bullet to the head,

660
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,410
or die from organ failure
after a savage beating.

661
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,750
So many died already.

662
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:45,170
But I didn't say anything.

663
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:47,800
Who'd believe you?

664
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,090
Who gets released without consequences
after getting arrested?

665
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,470
Right. Nobody would believe it.

666
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,140
Min Ju-yeong

667
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,220
especially would never buy it.

668
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,650
Do you want to die in a gutter
or have some ox bone soup here?

669
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,190
It's your choice.

670
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,110
We're the only people
who can keep you alive.

671
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,950
Didn't you say you're a certified player
or something? Hurry up.

672
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,120
A real pro doesn't rush things.

673
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,660
The sun will be up at this rate.

674
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,380
Are you sure this is it?

675
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,050
This is all I know.

676
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,840
I swear.

677
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,510
So 21 locations in total.

678
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,800
-Did I get it right?
-Yeah.

679
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,640
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

680
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,300
-You're positive?
-I'm positive.

681
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,020
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

682
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,520
These are the locations Sergei provided

683
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,810
and Oh Bong-chan's land
registered under others' names.

684
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,690
There are 53 locations in total.

685
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:51,110
So the container filled with cash
could be in any one of these places.

686
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,240
We must find it before he catches on.

687
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,160
It's a race against time now.

688
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,790
We're bound to attract his attention
if we snoop around too blatantly.

689
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,660
Let's carry on as usual
so he doesn't catch on,

690
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,080
as if nothing's going on.

691
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,230
I lost my appetite
after being on my feet all day long.

692
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,610
It tastes good to me.

693
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,320
Hey, this place is great.

694
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:41,080
-Right? Have some meat too.
-Eat up.

695
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,460
Eat up while you can.

696
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,170
We won't be able to for a while.

697
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,290
It's time to act on
what we discussed yesterday.

698
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,800
Cheers!

699
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,640
-Let's check it out.
-Okay.

700
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,150
250-9, DEOKCHANG-DONG, GANGI-GU, INSUNG

701
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,440
There's nothing to see here.

702
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,570
1183, MOUNTAIN, CHANGJIN 2-DONG,
GANGMYEON-GU, INSUNG

703
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,160
One, two…

704
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,460
I know it's there. I saw it in my dream.

705
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,290
155, MOUNTAIN,
BANSANG-DONG, GIWON-GU, INSUNG

706
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,380
253-5, SAMRIN-DONG, JEONG-GU, INSUNG

707
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,300
OH BONG-CHAN'S PROXY LAND LIST

708
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,030
Sir?

709
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,000
At first, I thought you were really cold.

710
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,790
But I was surprised

711
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,300
by your gracious response
to such a misunderstanding.

712
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,300
That's when I realized
you're nothing like I originally thought.

713
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,260
Where could you be?

714
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,020
Did something urgent come up?

715
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,350
No. Please eat.

716
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,400
1632, YANGSAN-DONG, HADO-GU, INSUNG

717
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,240
Take a picture for me.

718
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,160
Step down.

719
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,720
Hippety-hop,
on my way to find the treasure.

720
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,140
It's not there, is it?

721
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:08,890
It's not.

722
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,740
Let's go.

723
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,940
Let's take one together.

724
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,080
You have to smile in photos.

725
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,250
Smile. One, two, three.

726
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,040
LOAN ASSISTANCE FOR ATHLETES

727
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:40,090
Here.

728
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,340
May I ask when I might receive a response?

729
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,970
With so many applicants,
the document review might take a while.

730
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,970
I'll get in touch once it's finished.

731
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,560
PRIDE OF KOREAN ATHLETES
NATIONAL ATHLETE AVENGERS

732
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,980
INSUNG POLICE AGENCY FORMS
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

733
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,750
What does this lunatic want?

734
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,720
Did you look into it?

735
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,020
Who took Silver Bunny's autopsy report?

736
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,000
Where could you be?

737
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,000
Do something bad, and I'll eat you up.

738
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,880
Hippety-hop,
on my way to find the treasure.

739
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,590
Where could you be? Maybe here? Click!

740
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,260
Webs, incoming!

741
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,970
In the name of justice,
your wrongs won't go unpunished!

742
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,220
Hey, I see you.

743
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,560
Eat eggs. They're good for you.

744
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,810
Target found. Bang!

745
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,350
Last one.

746
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,510
KO.

747
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,730
You might die.

748
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,020
It doesn't matter.

749
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,810
The count has started.

750
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,670
The mystery of hidden cash in containers
continues to unfold.

751
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,250
Yesterday, more cash was discovered
in yet another container.

752
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,960
Who could be hiding
such large amounts of money?

753
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,880
Insung will get messy,
like the sweet and sour pork I'm chewing.

754
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,010
It's going to blow up.

755
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,720
This is nuclear bomb-level news.

756
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,560
The Korean National Police Agency
and the SPO are also monitoring it.

757
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,100
-The case got hot.
-Of course!

758
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,640
It's so hot that even the mayor,
prosecution, or the commissioner

759
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,940
can't cover things up.

760
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,820
It's so hot that they can't touch it!

761
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,610
We have to make it hotter.

762
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,610
It has to get boiling hot.

763
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,450
-It's so hot!
-Super hot!

764
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,120
Is it good?

765
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,790
Look who knows how to smile.

766
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,500
How sloppy. Are you a kid?

767
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,340
Smile big and show your teeth.

768
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,680
Gosh, this jjajangmyeon is hot and spicy!

769
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:39,890
It really is.

770
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,640
Captain, wipe your mouth.

771
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,310
-Wipe it for me.
-Here.

772
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,940
This is totally crazy.
It'll take all day to count the money.

773
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,350
Don't mess with her.

774
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,690
Remember what I said.

775
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,980
-Take a seat.
-Hey.

776
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,360
I'll turn up the noise for him.

777
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,610
Why all this fuss over a dead kid?

778
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,570
Where the hell are you going?

779
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,240
This has a strange power.

780
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,750
Is there something
you want me to do in return?

781
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,830
Thanks.

782
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:50,540
I've always been thoughtful.

783
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,590
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

784
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,170
Let me apologize.

785
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,430
I'll push you

786
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:03,390
further into a corner.

787
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,850
Okay.

788
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,350
I'll look forward to it.

789
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,270
Senior Officer Shin.

790
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,860
Shin Jae-hong!

791
