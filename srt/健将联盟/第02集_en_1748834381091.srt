He's always impressive.

You're Shin Jae-hong, the 2012

120
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,040
Shin Jae-hong, that's me.
You're correct. Bronze medal.

121
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,291
Oh, Dong-ju!

122
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,543

- It's Shin Jae-hong, that's right.

123
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,171
- Wait, you're Officer Yoon Dong-ju?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,590
Is it true that you took down
the entire Golden Bunny Gang by yourself?

125
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,967
[reporter 2] What made you
go up against them all alone?

126

Well... [chuckles]

127
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,472
...you know, that's the thing
we do as cops, we gotta catch criminals.

128
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,224
Could you strike a pose for a photo?

129
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,768
Korea's top 1%.
He really is something else, huh?

130
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,312
Guess he was a national athlete
for a reason.

131
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,939
I thought he was just a turd.

132
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,026
Is he actually the kind
that helps flowers bloom? [snorts]

133
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
[crowd gasping, clamoring]

134

Do you even know what you're saying?

00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,955
[detective 1] Officer Ji Han-na.
The gun you used at home

136
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,873
- was a paintball gun, right?
- Yeah.

137
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,542
[detective 2] A manhole cover?
You mean that big heavy thing?

138
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,461
Yeah, the round metal thing on the road.

139
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,545
- [Man-sik] Hey, there.
- Yeah?

140
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,923
- Sergeant Kim... Kim is done here?
- [detective 3] Yeah, he's done.

141
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,008
Can we talk for a second?

142
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,846
[sighs] Listen, Kim,
don't worry about Officer Ji.

143
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,598
They're gonna patrol the neighborhood.

144
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,269
There'll be guys watching
24-7 from the local substation.

145
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,313
Man, that Rat Snake Gang.
Those bastards are insane.

146
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,233
Trying to murder an officer...

147
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,858
Tell me this.

148
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,153
With your skills, you might as well
be in the Violent Crimes division, no?

149
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,574
- It's a waste of national talent.
- This job just suits me a lot better.

150
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,702
Ah. Okay, well...

151
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,247
Anyway, things are taking
an odd turn, don't you think?

152
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,458
Like Dung-ju told us, it wasn't
just a simple hit-and-run, that's clear.

153
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,754
Lee Jin-su, who reported the
Golden Bunny Gang's smuggling is killed.

154
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,965
Then these armed guys
break into Ji's house, you know?

155
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,260
And Ji's file seems to be the only reason.

156
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,720
Anything we'd know about this?
Ji know what it is?

157
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,849
There was no way to look inside,
but she did see some kind of seal on it.

158
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,102
Seems that document
is what started this whole mess.

159
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,895
I wonder what it is.

160
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,148
I'd be surprised
if these men know anything.

161
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,026
Guess we'll have to get
the guys who ran to find the answer.

162
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,195
[sighs] Now wait, hold on.
I'm getting a gut feeling.

163
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,780
And maybe, if I'm lucky,

164
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,075
I'll be on an actual
first-class flight soon.

165
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,246
[chuckles, muttering]

166
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,374
Oh, I think I should take you.

167
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,255
[sighs]

168
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,007
[camera shutter clicking]

169
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,426
[sighs]

170
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,266
How much longer are you gonna stalk me?

171
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,018
Going home alone is dangerous.

172
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,145
And your place must be a mess.
Let me help you clean up.

173
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,731
It's dangerous with you.

174
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,524
You don't really believe that, do you?

175
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,152
I'm just very strong, I'm not dangerous.

176
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,113
[scoffs] You're so full of shit.

177
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,450
I'm full of shit? I'm only here
because I'm worried about you.

178
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,035
You're worried about me? Aw, that's cute.

179
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,247
Why don't you keep that worry
and bury it before I bury you, okay?

180
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,624
Cold Bun.

181
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,418
- [groans] What?
- [doors open]

182
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,131
Who the hell's out here
causing trouble again?

183
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,342
What are you doing,
harassing the lady officer?

184
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,511
- Who are you?
- I'm an officer as well.

185
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,013
Then why are you bothering
the nice young lady?

186
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,392
You little... Beat it.
I was chopping kimchi.

187
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,644
[Dong-ju] Whoa, wait...

188
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,020
Uh...

189
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,481
I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,482
Call me if you get scared.

191
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,110
Same as always. The number, I mean. Later!

193
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,614

YOUR INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT
HAS MATURED

195
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,790
I don't get it. Why is that guy
stalking you just like a stray dog?

196
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,042
- Who is he?
- He's a fellow officer, like he said.

197
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,670
Oh, really? Well,
I heard what happened to you.

198
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,548
- Everything all right?
- Oh, whoa, it's all good. I'm fine.

199
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,427

thanks very much.

202
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,447
You all right?

203
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,157
Want a ride?

204
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,325
Do I look like a child?

205
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,035
What's wrong?

206
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,953
Embarrassed? [laughs]

207
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,538
There's no one here.

208
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,206
Hop on. Come on.

209
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,292
- Beat it.

- Hey, easy.
- [sighs]

211
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,880
Hold on. Wait.

212
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,716
- [laughs] How's it going? Huh?
- [scoffs]

213
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,177
You see, I'm in that totally dark factory,

214
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,512
- where paint's just bursting everywhere...
- [gasps]

215
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,264
...and I uppercut that Golden Bunny dude,

216
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,141
just punching him
to the ceiling like this.

217
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,851
- You did good.
- [chuckles]

218
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,145
[chuckles] Still,
you need to be careful, okay?

219
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,771
I'm just scared, because you've been hurt.

220
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,024
Not a big deal.
Just a couple of scratches, I'm fine.

221
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,903
Oh, God. The soup,
I left it over on the stove.

222
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,821
It's okay.

223
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,869

That one's for the other thing.

227
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,465
Hey, why aren't you
using the device I got you?

228
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,342
The medical thing.

229
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,969
It's not gonna fix me, so don't
get any more of that stuff, all right?

230
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,597
This one's supposed to be really good.
Just try it?

231
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,808
Trust me, you're gonna
feel the difference.

232
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,812
It's great quality, okay? Made in Korea.

233
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,689
They say that it loosens up
your muscles real--

234
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,900
Knock it off!

235
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,737
What the hell is the matter with you, huh?

236
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,988
Be grateful, will you?

237
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,323
Pick it up right now.

238
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,325
Uh... [sighs]

239
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,453
Sorry, I was just eating.

240
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,913
That's all.

241
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,331
I'll do it when I'm done, okay?

242
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,415
After dinner?

243
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,209
Okay. When we're done eating.

244
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,294
[chuckles]

245
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,629
You didn't have to knock it down, did you?

246
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,006
- You didn't have to get it.
- All right, all right.

247
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,091
How's the rolled omelet?

248
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,677
- You didn't even open any of it.
- I never asked for it.

249
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,971
- Well, you know I bought it for you...
- Will you please stop?

250
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,683
- Whoa, this is actually pretty good.
- Wait are you just messing around?

251
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,601
- I'm being serious.
- It's really strong.

252
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,729

You asleep?

260
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,483
- Are you sleeping?
- What? Stop it.

261
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,612
So what are you doing with Jong-gu, huh?

262
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,617
Hey.

263

[huffs]

264
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,000
You should stop hanging out
with him, you know.

265
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,793
And take better care of your mom.

266
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,295
I did some research.

267
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,130
Surgery could help you get better.

268
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,258
And then, she wouldn't
have to worry about you, huh?

269
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,594
Until you get the surgery,
just help her at the restaurant--

270
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,972
Stop with the good guy act.
Who said I even want surgery?

271
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,141
Just leave me alone, okay?

272
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,061
Surgery could help you,
which would help your mom, too.

273
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,356
What about how I feel? You're just
doing this to make yourself feel better.

274
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,484
You were born good, so go ahead
and be the good son she never had.

275
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,277
'Cause I never will.

276
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,405
There isn't anyone who's born good.

278
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,414
I just try to do good as a choice, 'cause...

279
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,876
I don't want regrets, that's all.

280
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,836
Well, I don't care.

281
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,341
You keep trying to win some good boy award
or something like that. [scoffs]

282
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,343
Hold on a sec,
are you just gonna lie there

283
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,095
with your back to me while I'm talking?

284
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,306

- You little... Don't wake up Ms. Jeong.

To do what with them?

304
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,815
My taking them would get rid of

I want to stay on it.

00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,865
I'll remove the partition
so we can use the space, cool?

368
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,199
Wait, no no, put it back.

369
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,911
Now stop all that and prepare to go
and question Golden Bunny.

370
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,829
He got released from the hospital.

Why remove all our files, huh?

423
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,018
Because the commissioner ordered it.

for your special little team,

You can prep for
your promotion exam, am I right?

471
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,643
But the thing that's a lot more important
than your exam result,

You knew what this is.

What? What do you mean?

493
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,493
Get real. What, you thought
the commissioner gave you a special team

494
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,954
because he trusts you
and those kids? Really?

- Can you quickly just walk her through it?
- Yes.

pushed it through before even telling me.

- Right?
- I knew this whole thing was too easy.

508
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,074
All right. This shotgun holds six rounds.
You load it right here, and then--

509
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,701
Yeah, I've got it.

- Yeah.

00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,208
She's badass.

512
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,877
Badass.

513
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,714
[tense music playing]

514
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,764
What's she shooting at?

515
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,533
Hey, Ms. Han-na. Don't shoot here.

516
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,785
Shoot this part right here,
you understand?

517
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,663
You want a show? I'll give you a show.

518
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,420
[grunts]

519
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,382
[crowd gasping, clamoring]

520
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,804
Medic! Call a medic!

521
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,890
[clamoring continues]

522
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,017
Commissioner! Are you all right?

523
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,604
[clamoring continues]

524
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,780
He's okay. He's got
the stab-proof vest, huh?

525
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,781
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

526
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,825
Sorry, coming through. Excuse me.

527
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,413
[Pan-yeol groaning]

528
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,832
All right, please take a deep breath.

529
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,417
[whimpers]

530
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,877
Stop. Just stop, okay?

531
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,545
He probably fractured a rib.

532
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,923
He needs to go to the hospital
for a few more tests.

533
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,300
[groaning]

534
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,303
I don't understand,
a fortune went into this.

535
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,181
Why would a stab-proof vest
tear so easily?

536
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,102
Listen, I want an investigation
into the company that designed it

537
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,020
- and everyone involved.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,315
Also, Ji Han-na. Fire that girl tomorrow.

539
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,652
I've been so nice to her,
now look at this.

540
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,154
Why aren't you answering me?

541
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,823
- Sir, if I may.
- [groans]

542
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:23,119
To punish Officer Ji Han-na
would cause us all serious backlash.

543
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,996
Why don't you use this as an opportunity.

544
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,833
Just think,
there's still a lot of press here.

545
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,335
<i>It was a pre-planned demonstration</i>

546
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>designed for us to test out
our stab-proof vest.</i>

547
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,257
[anchor] <i>Commissioner Cho
is being credited</i>

548
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:40,135
<i>with easing public concern by personally
wearing the new stab-proof vest...</i>

549
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,596
She just disappeared,
won't even pick up her phone.

550
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,809
[sighs] She...
She's cool even when she resigns.

551
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,105
[gunshot]

552
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,608
NO ENTRY

INSUNG SUPERMARKET

555
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,701
So is he an officer, or...

556
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,536
What's he doing for hours out here?

557
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,706
[scoffs] Is he stalking her?

558
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,338
[lamp buzzing]

00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,224

[phone beeps]

561
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,481
- Hey...
- [line ringing]

562
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,233
Uh, yeah, hello.

563
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,651
I just wanted to see if--

564
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,737
[gunshot]

565
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,616
[sighs]

566
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,618
How did you guess?

567
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,205
I called the office,
and was told you picked up your gun,

568
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,665
so I figured it was likely
you decided to come here.

569
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,751
[sniffles]

570
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,878
You're calm for someone
who almost killed a man.

571
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,296
[chuckles]

572
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,674
All right, so, you here to arrest me?

573
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,719
That hasn't been decided yet.

574
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,139
But you fired a shot at the commissioner,
so you'll get disciplined.

575
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,935
Whatever they decide to do,
I don't care anymore.

576
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,981
Aren't you giving up too easily?

577
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,817
It's your dream, isn't it?

578
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,362
It wasn't an easy decision.

579
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,030
Han-na.

580
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,241
The men who broke into your place
still haven't been caught.

581
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,284
It's possible you're still
somebody's target.

582
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,702
Staying on the force is safer.

583
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,871
If you want to quit,
can you at least wait until the case--

584
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,083
[sighs] Your concern is appreciated,

585
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,627
but I'm good, thank you.

586
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,639
[sighs]

587
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,071
Oh! Han-na!

588
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,407
[Dong-ju chuckles]

589
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,327
Where have you been, huh?

590
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,121
What happened? I've been calling you.

591
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,623
Were you out firing your gun?

592
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,168
So, did you eat yet?

593
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,504
[Han-na] Just go, okay?
I'm not in the mood to talk.

594
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,091
Why don't we grab some dinner, huh?

595
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,850
You aren't really gonna quit, are you?

596
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,560
You shouldn't.

597
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,021
What you did wasn't wrong, you know that.

598
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,315
So why quit?

599
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,277
- Hey.
- What?

600
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,903
I don't know why you're even asking.

601
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,781
- So I quit, what do you care?
- Of course I care, come on.

602
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,617
We're in this together, the both of us.

603
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,661
What do you mean,
"we're in this together?"

604
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,083
I meant it. Stop liking me, Dong-ju.

605
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,379
Don't tell me how to feel.

606
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,048
It's not something I can control.

607
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,591
And who knows?

608
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,218
One day, my charm might persuade you.

609
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,262
- Then you'll feel it too.
- [scoffs] You think I'm that easy?

610
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,015
Han-na, I like you.

611
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,731
[sighs]

612
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,525
Not gonna happen, okay?

613
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,945
I will never fall for you.

614
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,116
Come on,
you don't have to say it like that.

615
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,661
I think that's a bit brutal, no?

616
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:35,829
I can say it again, you know.

617
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,081
I don't like you, okay?

618
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,333
Just, no.

619
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,098
Ah, that damn stray dog is back again!

620
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,058
[sighs]

621
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,861
Whose dog is this?

622
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,238
No idea.

623
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,407
He's been wandering around
for the last few days.

624
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,575
Maybe someone abandoned him. [barks]

625
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,412
- Aw, he's so cute. [laughs]
- [dog whimpers]

[shopkeeper kisses]

627
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,208
"Not gonna happen?"

628
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,668
"I don't like you?"

629
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,128
She's so cruel.

630
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,838
I just wish she wasn't cute.

631
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,548
- [dogs barking]
- Ah, shut up!

632
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,510
- [barking continues]
- [gasps]

633
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,977
- Hey, search it.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,272
These are the items we seized when we
took down the so-called Golden Bunny Gang.

635
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,816
I will take questions now.
All right? Go ahead.

636
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,777
- [reporters clamoring]
- Oh?

637
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,705
[phone ringing]

638
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,502
Your phone's ringing.

639
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:12,050
Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,
Regional Investigation Unit.

640
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,051
Location?

641
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,304
- [intriguing music playing]
- [clamoring continues]

642
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:20,058
All right, we're gonna
take care of it, don't call anybody else.

643
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,186
Wha... What?

644
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,482
Yeah. RIU Captain An Dae-yong.

645
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,566
Ah, the reception is...

646
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,611
[imitates line breaking up]

647
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,408
So they were chasing down some guys
wanting to take off to China, including

648
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,994
the guys who committed
the break-in at Officer Ji's place.

649
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,079
We have to beat the RIU team to it,
you understand?

650
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,123
They will not be
looking down on us after this.

651
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,292
- Now we'll prove it to them.
- There's only three of us, though,

652
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,960
sir, is that enough?

653
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,880
- We've got some backup on site.
- Oh, who?

654
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:53,257
- Han-na? Han-na, no?
- [groans] Would you quit it?

655
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,759
Hi there, hello?

656
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,053
Anybody there? Hello.

657
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,473
Who are you?

658
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,766
Uh, hello there.

659
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,684
I, uh, work for Insung Police.

660
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,436
- I'm here to deliver this.
- [sighs]

661
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,816
I guess this is about her son.
There's nobody home right now.

662
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:13,194
The lady left early this morning
to go look at burial sites for her son.

663
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,613
Thank you very much.

664
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,950
[sighs] The poor lady
hasn't even held a funeral for him yet.

665
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,577
[sighs] This is just awful.

667
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,169
Hmm? Hold on.

668
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,130
- Kim Jong-hyeon?
- [laughs]

669
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,007
[scoffs]

670
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,346
Hey there!

671
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,975
So what's the Inspection Division
doing out here?

672
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,852
- Not enough going on?
- [sighs]

673
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,728
He's come here to help us, so cut it out!

674
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,647
They got a tip that there's
about eight guys who are hiding

675
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,692
inside of that office building somewhere.

676
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,987
It's the building in the back.

677
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,573
The gate we came through
is gonna be covered by the patrol unit.

678
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,450
Officer Shin and I will take
the left side, Captain Go and Officer Yoon

679
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,703
- can go take the right.
- So you wanna be my boss

680
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,871
and run the operation?

681
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:05,956
Who decided that?

682
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,082
This man should be-- [grunts]

683
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,876
- [coughing]
- Listen to me, all right.

684
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,961
Let's get the two
Korean-Chinese guys first

685
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,337
and the patrol unit will handle the rest.

686
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,048
- Show the way.
- Right here.

687
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,323
[laughs]

688
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,782
What are you doing? They went in already.

689
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,034
Where am I?

690
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,162
[chuckles] Okay. [grunts]

691
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,789
- Dong-ju! Dong-ju!
- [shushes]

692
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,750
Hey, let's go to Jeju Island, Dong-ju.

693
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,501
To see the flowers. Yeah?

694
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,253
- [sighs]
- Jeju Canola flowers...

695
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,380
[grunts]

696
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:56,881
Whoa.

697
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,050
- Are you all right?
- My mom likes Canola flowers.

698
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,843
Hey, wake up. Hey, what's going on

699
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,180
- with you all of a sudden, sir?
- We need to go to Gate three.

700
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,933
[phone ringing echoes]

701
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,770
- [clock ticking echoes]
- [ringing continues]

702
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,938
[Dae-yong] Have you analyzed the evidence?

703
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,773
This isn't just any candy.

704
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,941
[ticking continues]

705
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,150
It's a type of hallucinogen.

706
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,486
<i>A highly purified new synthetic narcotic.</i>

707
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,947
[Dong-ju echoing] Sir, wake up!

708
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,949

00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,159
[whimpers]

710
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,244
- I'd like a bibimbap.
- Get it together, sir.

711
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,704
- Come on!
- [whimpers]

712
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,498
Wake up, sir!

[whimpers]

714
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,585
Sir?

715
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,587
Are you okay?

716
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,173
Man-sik.

717
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,425

[Dong-ju whimpers]

719
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,430
- [groans] God, that hurt!
- [Man-sik screaming]

720
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,432
What was that? Is someone here?

721
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,517
Shit.

722
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,143
- What are we gonna do?
- Stay there.

723
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,478
[screaming continues]

724
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,563
Shin, hey.

725
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,859
- [screaming continues]
- [footsteps running]

[thudding on door]

730
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,626
[Man-sik] There you are. [screams]

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,153
[all screaming, clamoring]

735
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,414
Hey, they're gonna run! They're gonna run!

736
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,540
Stay where you are! Stay where you are!

737
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,251
Don't run away!

738
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,381
Hey, stay here! Stay here!
Stop resisting me!

739
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:03,758
It's okay.

740

[grunting, straining]

741
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,219
It's okay, chill!

742
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,638
[panting]

743
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,099
- Shit. Shit!
- Let's go.

744
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,227
A-site!

745
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,937
A-site!

746
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,689
Come on. Why are you
just standing there like that?

747
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,108
B-site!

748
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,277
[distorted cackling]

749
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,489
[whooping]

750
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,784
Fire in the hole!

751
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sir, wait!

752
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,248
[speaking gibberish]

753
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,754
- [shouts]
- Hold on, sir! You have to hang on!

754
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,589
Watch out!

755
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,509
[dynamic music playing]

756
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,849
[Man-sik] A-Site.

[sighs]

758
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,105
I, uh... Hang on a minute,
sir, I'll be right there!

759
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,732
- Go down. Go down.
- [Man-sik groaning]

760
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,652
Hey, where the hell are you? [pants]

761
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,655
Just help us out here, okay?
We have the documents.

762
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,907
Sounds good, all right.

763
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,575
I'll see you there, yeah. [panting]

764
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,119
[grunts]

765
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,203
Ah, shit!

766
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,704
Goddamn it!

767
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,040

[groaning, grunting]

769
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:30,010
Yang Chun-bae, you're under arrest
for unlawful entry and aggravated robbery.

770
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,180
[grunts, pants]

771
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,976
Don't chase me, asshole, you hear?

772
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,394
I've got nothing to lose.

773
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,814
You wanna die? Then come at me, bastard!

774
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,945
[breathing heavily]

775
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,533

- [weapon stabs]
- [panting]

778
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,256
What the hell?

779
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,675
- [panting]
- [chuckles]

780
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,513
- Oh, fudge.
- [thuds]

781
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,604
- Ah! Captain!
- Captain!

782
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,106
Shit. Shit.

783
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,940
Sir, wake up.

784
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,610
- Sir--
- Hurry up you gotta call an ambulance now!

785
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:30,154
- Uh-huh.
- Sir, please, come on. Are you all right?

786
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,281
Beep bop, beep bop,

787
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,241
- beep bop...
- Kim Jong-hyeon, get it together!

788
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,701
[siren blaring]

789
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,620
Why aren't we going? Let's go.

790
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,705
There's been a major accident
on the bridge ahead.

791
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,083
- It's gonna delay us by an hour.
- [groans]

792
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,501
- How's he doing?
- We gave him first aid,

793
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,754
but we won't know how bad it is
until we get to the hospital.

794
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,089
He's bleeding,
but if there's internal damage,

795
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,759
- it could be serious.
- The clouds are coming down. [grunts]

796
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,387
[through speaker] <i>We have an emergency
patient on board. Please clear the way.</i>

797

[yelps]

799
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,897
- Good, you're awake.
- [whimpers]

800
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,608
You had no internal bleeding, so we just
had to give you a few stitches.

801
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,277
- God, your jaw does not look good--
- [yelps]

802
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,447
- You took quite a beating, didn't you?
- Yeah, I guess.

803
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,993
How the heck did I
get here anyway, doctor?

804
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,417
[ethereal music playing]

805
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,007
[doctor] If you had gotten here
even a little bit later,

806
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,634
the blood loss could've been fatal.

807
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,053
He saved your life.

808
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,846
[upbeat music playing]

809
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:41,268
<i>He pushed you in a shopping cart
and ran for over 30 minutes.</i>

811
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,365
[panting]

812
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,783
Hey, move it!

813
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,577
Just step aside and let us through!

814
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,664
You gotta step outta the way!

815
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,378
SMILE WITH CONFIDENCE!

816
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,964

[sighs]

819
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,898
Hey, Jong... So I just got word,

820
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,278
- seems the Captain is gonna be fine.
- That's good news.

821
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,197
You got hurt too.
Don't you need to see a doctor?

822
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,242
It's just a scratch.

823
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,202
Okay.

824
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,130
[sighs]

825
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm sorry, we couldn't find his papers,
all we have are these here.

826
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,407
I, uh, apologize

827
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,951
that it took so long to bring them by.

828
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,537
No, thank you so much
for dropping them off.

829
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,874
[crying]

830
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,754
[sobbing] Can you try to catch the guy

831
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,048
who hurt my dad?

832
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,801
'Cause you work for the police, don't you?

833
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:42,138
[sobbing]

834
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:47,894
- [Jin-su's mother] It's okay.
- [sobbing continues]

835
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,168
What happened there, Mister Oh?
Couldn't handle it?

836
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,586
[tense music playing]

837
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,589
I guess you've gone
a bit soft, haven't you?

838
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,014
Things are not like they were
when you showed me the ropes.

839
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,766
[sighs] You've become too nice.

840
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,185
- The water.
- [thug] Yes, sir.

841
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,569
[ticking]

842
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,245
[thug] Here you go.

843
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:50,122
- Here.
- [breathing shakily]

844
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,332
Bite into it.

845
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,511
Bite into it.

846
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,783
Why are you overthinking this?

847
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,037
It's not that complicated, is it?

848
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,250
When you kill someone in a hit-and-run,
the minimum sentence is five years.

849
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,378
But if you settle,

850
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,171
it's three or less.

851
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,672
Could be just probation.

852
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,841
I think Mister Oh over here

853
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:46,054
has explained what I'm saying already,
through his lawyer.

854
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,932
[sighs]

855
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,603
The victim's mother has also
already agreed to settle.

856
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,231
[grunts, groans]

857
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,403

858
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,280
Lee Gyeong-il.

859
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,618
You already have a record.

860
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,746
He explained the Narcotics Control Act
to you, right?

861
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,915
You know what I mean
by aggravated charges?

862
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,210
They'll put you away
for at least ten years.

863
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,795
It's pretty simple, isn't it?

864
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,089
You want three years?

865
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,091
Or you want ten?

866
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,094
Ten years...

867
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,849
or a mere three?

868
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,312
You understand me?

869
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,108
Nod if you do.

870
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,026

[tense music continues]

872
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,077
Get the kid ready
and have him taken in tomorrow.

873
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,830
- I'll have my guys take-
- No. No.

874
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,207
You need to do it yourself, Mister Oh.

875
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,503
- No mistakes.
- [Jong-gu] Right.

876
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,047
No mistakes.

00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,827
[spits] Hey, Min. Baek here.

880
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,788
They're on the ship with us.
So now what do I do?

881
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,832
What're you doing?
Did you pack everything?

882
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,125
[thug 2] No, give me a second.

883
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,378
- [Chun-bae] What's taking you so long?
- Yeah, I've got the documents.

884
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,298
- [Chun-bae] All right, let's go home.
- [thug] That's right!

885
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,675
Hey, get ready.
The boat will be here soon.

886
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,886
Yes, Boss.

887
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,055
Sounds good.

888
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,850
Hey, where are you two headed, huh?

889
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,977
- I'm from Yanbian.
- Harbin, for me.

890
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,604
Ah, Yanbian, huh?

891
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,939
- Yeah.
- Too bad. The fare has just doubled.

892
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,025
Sorry. [chuckles]

893
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,569
You can't pay that, can you?

894
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,117
- [Chun-bae] What's going on?
- [thug] Let go.

895
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,203
- What? Don't do this.
- Boss, come on.

896
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,537
[Chun-bae] We did everything!

897
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,289
We're your people, don't! No!

898
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,709
- [weapon stabs, squelches]
- [Chun-bae grunts]

899
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,504
[stuttering] Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

900
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:26,673
- Stand straight.
- [weapon stabs]

901
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,925

905
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,860
Oh, looks like we're getting
the lights turned on.

[metal clanking]

907
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,239
Thought they wouldn't fix that
for a month, they're already here?

908
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,493
Well, somebody must've chewed them out
for them to come at night.

909
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,036
[chuckles]

910
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,539
You know, that little stray dog
that's been following, that guy?

911
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,541
Dong-ju, Dung-ju, whatever.

912
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,293
I hear the district office
is completely sick of the guy

913
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,753
tearing into them, so they gave in.

914
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,506
And they didn't even listen
when I called to complain.

915
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,967
He really must be driving them nuts.

916
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:15,096
[metal clanking]

917
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,684
Oh, and all the broken CCTVs
got fixed, too.

918
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,395
He somehow managed that, as well.

919
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,065
[Dong-ju] Listen,
the streetlight's out over here. Yeah.

920
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,568
No, no, across from Insung Supermarket.

921
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,153
The CCTV is dead, too.

922
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:34,198
It looks really old.
There's no light or anything.

923
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,158
That one.

924
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,869
[romantic K-pop-style song playing]

925
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:42,915
I'll see you later.

926
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,757
So number nine's dark, as well.

927
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,800
You have to fix the street lights here

928
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,761
[song continues]

929
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:58,055
How's anyone supposed to
walk up here in the dark?

930
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,894
Oh, Number 13 and 15, same thing.

931
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,271
Almost no light at all.

932
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,108
[gasps] Now, over here,
there are no lights at all.

933
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,236
Totally dark over at Building 16.

934
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,742
Exactly, no lights on
at all outside Number 16.

935
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,286
Please make sure they all get fixed.

936
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,501
[song continues]

937
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,763
- Could you do something?
- Yes.

938
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:44,060
Give this boy a nutritional IV, please.

939
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,270
[nurse] Sure.

940
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:53,778

[humming]

944
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,940
Why didn't you wake me?
We could've gone together.

945
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,358
You're gonna pop my stitches, damn it!

946
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,068
- [groans]
- Ah.

947
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,821
So, boss, don't I deserve
a little more after saving you?

948
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:39,739
All right, forget it then. Give them back.

949
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,449
No way, you can't take back a gift.

950
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,826
- Dung-ju!
- Hey.

951
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,536
- You're back already.
- That little prick, I could--

952
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,663
[screams] Don't!

953
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,207
What's wrong with you idiots?

954
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,293
You're back already, sir?

955
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,337
- I thought you're out with a stab wound.
- It's not a big deal.

956
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,132
I mean, every cop gets stabbed
once or twice, you know.

957
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,926
- You wanna see it? You wanna?
- Yeah.

958
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,761
- [imitates drumroll]
- [grunts]

959
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,889
[yelps]

960
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,932
So you got stabbed
and stoned, good for you.

961
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,976
What a badge of honor.
You should be proud.

962
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,227
I thought it was candy.

963
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,855
Well, try a bit more caution, and
don't you ever pick up our phone calls.

964
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,232
I only answered the phone
'cause nobody else would!

965
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,235
But of course, now I'm the bad guy!

966
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,030
Ow.

967
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,032
- Sir, for you. Here you go.
- Huh?

968
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,408
Oh! Thank you, thank you.

969
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,201
- I borrowed it from my brother.
- Thanks.

970
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,579
Why do you have a suit?
You're moving on fast.

971
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,830
Got a blind date?

972
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,708
No, it's Mister Lee's funeral
today, you know.

973
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,085
Oh, did you know? The suspect's here.

974
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,505
- He just turned himself in.
- What do you mean?

975
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,340
Which suspect did?

976
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:40,759
Uh, the one who
committed that hit-and-run.

977
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,843
He just gave his statement.

978
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,470
They're taking him
to the prosecutors' office.

[breathing shakily]

982
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,281
Tell me why you're here.

983
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,453
- Hey, what's this?
- Would you please not tell Ma?

984
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,830
- I'll handle it.
- What are you saying, huh?

985
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,540
Enough. He's going to
the prosecutors' office.

986
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,626
Hey, hold on a minute.

987
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,878
Why would you take him there?

988
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,837
He confessed, that's why.

989
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,673
Look, this is getting a little annoying.
Who are you?

990
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,385
What has he confessed to? Tell me.
Why're you treating him like a criminal?

991
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,638
Hey, what have you told them you did?

992
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:29,641
- What happened to your face? What is this?
- Hey, you have to let him go.

993
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:31,977
If you have any more questions,
talk to his guardian.

994
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,896
- His guardian?
- Let's go.

Where are you going?

1000
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:46,993
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

1001
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,955
We're almost finished. Uh...

1002
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,582
I just need your signature right here
and we're good to go,

1003
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,667

- Yeah.

- Oh Jong-gu did this, didn't he?

1006
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,218
I said stay away from that guy,
I told you he was a bad influence.

1007
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,888
But you didn't do this.
So why would you say that you did? Huh?

- [grunts]
- Hey, are you okay?

Did Oh Jong-gu do this?

I wanna hear it.

This doesn't concern you.

Good job convincing the kid
to turn himself in.

1018
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,970
And you even reached a settlement too,
with the victim's family.

1019
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,264
You're really looking out for him.
You even got him a lawyer.

1020
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,850
Yeah, sure, I mean I trained the kid,
I need to take care of him.

I thought I was clear.
I told you to leave Gyeong-il alone.

What kinda nonsense is this, huh?

He's the one who screwed up.
I'm cleaning up after the kid.

1030
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,334
What, are you going to punch me?

1031
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,546
I'm the one who taught you, and now
you're gonna punch your own teacher?

1032
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,341
Teacher?

1033
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,094
You think I really learned
anything from a thug like you?

1034
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,346
A single punch and you're done.

1035
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,060
All right, since we're at the station,
you wanna go right here?

1036
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,062
Looks like you're might need
another lesson.

1037
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,397
Sure, you're on.
Just try your best not to shit your pants.

1038
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,816
[scoffs] You little shit.

1042
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:51,407
Hey, Dong-ju! Dong-ju, open the door!

1043
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,202
Open the door right now!

1044
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,414
Come here, punk.
You goddamn piece of shit.

1045
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,252
- Stop it, now.
- [detective] What the hell are you doing?

1046
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,379
- [grunts]
- Huh?

1047
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,713
You little shit.

1048
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,801
Sorry about him. He's a good guy,
he's just a little off in the mornings.

1049
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,136
You shouldn't have stopped me, you hear!

1050
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,470
Didn't you see I had him on the ropes?

1051
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,681
If I hadn't, you think
you'd still be standing?

1052
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,474
What the hell were you thinking
going up against

1053
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,268
a heavyweight champion
when you're just a middleweight?

1054
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,604
You think your fists are made of
steel or something?

1055
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,525
I just put you on supplements,
and this is what you do with it?

1056

- [slaps self]
- [yelps, sucks teeth]

1057
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:27,569

1062
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:44,128
Sir, are you okay, Mister Oh?

1063

1072
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,616
- I have lunch ready.
- Oh, oh, no, no.

1073
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:17,453
What brings you here then?
Aren't you supposed to be working?

1074
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,705
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd say hi.

1075
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,125
Oh, silly you. [laughs]

would you mind giving
Gyeong-il a call if it's no trouble?

1078
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:31,549
He's been ignoring my calls
ever since I told him off the other day.

1079
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,218
Just say he should try
and come home early.

1080
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,928
I'm making beef bone soup.

1081
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:37,597

What is it? Huh?

1084
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,354
Can you call him for me then?

1085
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,897
Oh.

1086
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,608
Oh, he might not have told you.

1087
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,195
He said he'd go to Seoul
to do some work for a while,

1088
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,614
- is what he said.
- Seoul?

1089
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,450
Yeah, Seoul, he said.

1090
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,661
Oh.

1091
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,874
No need to worry, though.
He's gonna return in a few days.

1092
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,295
[scoffs]
He could've at least told me about it.

1093
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,131
I'm gonna have to save the soup for later.

1105

Yeah. Um,
I think co-workers of his, mostly.

1106
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,568
From the Customs office.

1107
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:38,862

- Mr. Lee Myeong-sik?
- Yeah? Who are you?

1113
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,670
Hi, good afternoon, Mr. Lee.
Insung Police.

1114
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:58,382
Excuse me, please. And now...

1115

Please turn this way,

1116
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,512
Now turn your head
just a little over there. All right, good.

1117
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:07,850
Now, hold this as if you're
currently driving, like a steering wheel.

1118
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,103
Yeah, a bit more that way,
just a bit more, hold it.

1119
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:17,276
[sighs] Not it.

1120
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,944
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1121
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,737
You're not my person. Thanks a lot.

1122
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,282
Please hold this like
you're driving a car, just like that.

1123
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:26,159
- That's enough of that, stop it now.
- Now if you would turn...

1124

Give me a moment. Almost done here.

Now, let's go. You can't come in here.

- Just let me have a quick look, okay?
- No. Come on, let's go right now.

1132
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,110
Employees are already complaining.

1133
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,905

Yoon Dong-ju,
with the Metropolitan Police.

1144

You don't remember, do you?

1145
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,058
I remember you very clearly.

1146
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,936

everything Dung-ju says,

1159
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,121
