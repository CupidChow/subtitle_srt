1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Jong…

4
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,870
Jong-hyeon.

5
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,370
Jong-hyeon!

6
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,770
-Run!
-Kim Jong-hyeon!

7
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,610
Kim Jong-hyeon!

8
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,290
Oh, dear.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,290
Things are about to get messy.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,170
MAYOR OF INSUNG

11
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Kim Jong-hyeon.

12
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,100
Kim Jong-hyeon, wake up.

13
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Jong-hyeon.

14
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,490
You can't come in.

15
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Doctor…

16
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,050
INSUNG CITY COUNCIL
SAFE AND CLEAN INSUNG!

17
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,100
INSUNG CITY HALL

18
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,270
The person you are calling
cannot be reached.

19
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,350
You will be directed to voice…

20
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,650
It's me.

21
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,660
Send over the thing I prepared

22
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,820
with a few of your men.

23
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,500
Our district caught a break
thanks to the quick approval

24
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,710
of the development project.

25
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
Cheers to that.

26
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,170
-It's good that we can count on you.
-Cheers.

27
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,430
Here you are, Mayor Roh.

28
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,950
What kind of civil servant
doesn't answer calls?

29
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,530
Well…

30
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
It's not that I didn't answer on purpose.

31
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,410
Something urgent came up.

32
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,540
I heard about your situation--

33
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,880
If my civil complaint has reached you,
shouldn't you process it?

34
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,180
I'm short on time, you see.

35
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,140
As much as I want to help--

36
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
What is it?

37
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,010
Haven't you been paid enough already?

38
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
How much more do you want? Tell me.

39
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,480
No, it's not that.

40
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,390
I'm telling you, my hands are tied.

41
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,740
Oh, jeez.

42
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,030
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

43
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,410
This isn't about money.

44
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
What's this? Come on!

45
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,750
What's this all about?
I swear it's not about the money!

46
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,830
Open wide.

47
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,590
Open wide.

48
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,060
Isn't it a civil servant's duty

49
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,270
to aid a petitioner?

50
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,270
Especially when the said petitioner
always goes out of his way to make sure

51
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,650
you get everything in return?

52
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,880
Do you still need more?

53
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,420
No!

54
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,630
Then take care of it, okay?

55
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,930
-Okay?
-Okay.

56
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,890
Good.

57
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,190
KOREA COAST GUARD

58
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,650
INSUNG CUSTOMS

59
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,070
I'm Sergeant Lee Ji-seok
of the Insung Coast Guard.

60
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,490
-Please stop what you're doing.
-The Coast Guard?

61
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,160
-We're from the Korea Customs Service.
-This is our jurisdiction.

62
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
The Korea Customs Service?

63
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,740
So what's going on right now?

64
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,000
The Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service
are fighting over jurisdiction.

65
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
I can't do anything.

66
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,710
That's not right.
What about the commissioner?

67
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,210
He's not answering.

68
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Damn it, they're here too?

69
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,220
-Who?
-The prosecution.

70
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,810
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,390
Understood, sir.

72
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,900
-Everyone, stop!
-What the heck?

73
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,610
Stop right now!

74
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,650
Damn, this is so annoying.

75
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,410
I'm Prosecutor Kim Seok-hyeon.

76
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,910
Jong-hyeon might die any minute,

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,750
but his older brother is busy kissing ass.

78
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,120
Captain!

79
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,500
Sergeant Kim has been moved to the ICU.

80
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,630
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

81
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,890
Fortunately, the bullet missed his heart,
so they say he's going to live.

82
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,890
Has he come to?

83
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,270
He just got out of surgery,
so we'll have to wait.

84
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,360
I'll go talk to the doctor.

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,860
Thank goodness
Dung-ju learned how to swim.

86
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,320
He saved Sergeant Kim.

87
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,870
Good work, Senior Officer Ji.

88
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,410
Where's Dong-ju anyway?

89
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,790
KIM JONG-HYEON, RUPTURED LIGAMENT

90
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,510
Wait, 2018?

91
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,930
Is this from back then?

92
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,150
Where are you going?

93
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,610
You said you wanted to try boxing.

94
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,070
Sorry, but I have to go somewhere.

95
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,530
When will you be back?

96
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,370
It won't take long.

97
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,490
Want me to go with you?

98
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Go ahead to the gym.

99
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,580
Okay.

100
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,690
GYM RESERVATION
JULY 26TH, YOON DONG-JU, 6:30 P.M.

101
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,720
Where did you go without a word?

102
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,840
What's that?

103
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,010
He'll be here for a while,
so I brought a few things he'll need.

104
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,560
How is he?

105
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,020
It's too early to tell.

106
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I'm not sure he can return to work
even if he wakes up.

107
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,820
What do you mean?

108
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,860
Something's wrong
with Sergeant Kim's ankle.

109
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,530
It wasn't good even when he was competing,

110
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,530
but the fracture is serious this time.

111
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,330
What are you waiting for?
Senior Officer Ji is alone.

112
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,450
I'm going to the agency.

113
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,330
Hey!

114
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,710
Yes?

115
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,590
Are you okay?

116
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm fine.

117
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,170
I guess that's a relief.

118
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Sir?

119
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,600
Are you awake?

120
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
Just a moment. I'll call the doctor.

121
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,070
Okay.

122
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,320
Jong-hyeon, are you okay?

123
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,370
I'm so glad you're awake.

124
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
Here.

125
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,370
What did the commissioner say?

126
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,920
I shouldn't have put together this team.

127
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,300
Who was I kidding?

128
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,840
This all happened

129
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,380
because of my greed.

130
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,550
I'm sorry, Senior Officer Shin.

131
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,010
I'm ashamed to face you.

132
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,910
You're really irresponsible.

133
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,700
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

134
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,580
Don't underestimate your condition.

135
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,670
If your blood pressure spikes
from reckless behavior,

136
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,420
it can cause a cerebral hemorrhage

137
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,300
as well as blindness
due to optic nerve damage.

138
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,430
This hearing is to address accountability
for the officer casualty accident

139
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,060
that occurred
during SCIT's overzealous investigation.

140
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,850
As the incident occurred

141
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,690
while carrying out a duty…

142
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
That's it.

143
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,520
Hey, that's a foul!

144
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,200
Was that a right hook from the opponent?

145
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,450
I think he got hit with an elbow.

146
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,700
It looks like Yoon Dong-ju

147
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,080
has a cut above his eye.

148
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,460
Everything

149
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,420
is a mess.

150
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,290
Damn it.

151
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,330
Nothing is going my way.

152
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,680
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

153
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,140
3 MONTHS LATER

154
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,190
I'm glad to see you're doing better.

155
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,110
You'll be discharged in no time.

156
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,570
Yes, sir.

157
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,450
Did you hear the SCIT got dissolved?

158
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,070
Let me know
if you have a department in mind.

159
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,870
The commissioner
will accommodate your request.

160
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,950
What about the team members?

161
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,660
They returned to work not long ago
after receiving suspensions and pay cuts.

162
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,710
This is an abduction, I tell you.

163
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,380
-I'm sorry.
-Let go of me.

164
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,170
-Come on, babe.
-I'm sorry.

165
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,960
-You can't do this, ma'am.
-Come on!

166
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,180
Hey.

167
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,050
Did you just touch me?

168
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,640
No, I didn't touch you. You fell.

169
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,390
-I'm a cop--
-You touched me!

170
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,310
Pull over! I want to get out!

171
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,440
-Let me out right now! Hey!
-Please be quiet.

172
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,480
-Damn it, let me out!
-I said be quiet!

173
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,280
Who the hell are you?

174
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,910
TRAFFIC POLICE

175
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,330
-Please stop.
-Let me out!

176
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,700
Why won't you stop the car?

177
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,000
Stop the car right now!

178
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,080
-Please save me!
-Just pull over!

179
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,790
-I said pull over!
-Save me!

180
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,420
SCHOOL ZONE

181
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,050
Save me! Please!

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,440

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,200
INTRODUCING NEW BODY CAMERAS
TO SAFEGUARD INSUNG CITIZENS

185
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,250
This is the only place
we can assign you for now.

186
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,710
You see, the others feel a teensy bit
uncomfortable around you.

187
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,710
Feel free to tell me
if you don't like it here.

188
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,250
I'll look into another place for you.

189
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,720
RECORDS ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

190
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,970
It's not too bad.

191
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,220
I like being alone anyway.

192
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,270
What about Officer Yoon?

193
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,980
Do you mean Yoon Dong-ju?

194
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,650
He got himself a sweet assignment,
courtesy of the commissioner.

195
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,360
He's a special support officer.

196
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,910
Hurry it up. We need to mobilize tonight.

197
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,990
I'm on it.

198
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,040
Why don't you help me then?

199
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,470
ROOM 4, JEONG MI-JA
INSUNG NANUM NURSING HOME

200
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,890
Ma'am, it's me.

201
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,810
Let me freshen you up.

202
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,770
This is nice and warm.

203
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,790
I didn't know this before,

204
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,660
but Insung has
a lot of great places to eat.

205
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,420
There's a famous knife-cut noodle place
in Gumyeon-dong.

206
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,380
In Baekdang-dong,
there's a good oyster and rice soup place.

207
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,300
Right, and this place in Jinhang-dong

208
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,010
has mind-blowing nakgopsae.

209
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,850
Do you know what that is?

210
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,640
I think you'd really like that place.

211
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,810
We'll go for a walk to admire flowers…

212
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,690
and enjoy the fall foliage.

213
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,860
I hope we'll get to visit
many different places together.

214
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,170
You're suspected of drug use,

215
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,920
so I need you to provide
a urine sample right away.

216
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,680
Mister, can you hold it steady down there?

217
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,760
My hands feel weak.

218
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,850
What kind of nonsense is that?
You're not a kid.

219
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,520
Here, take this and aim well.

220
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,890
Go ahead. You can manage.

221
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,020
Hurry up. We need to send it
to the Narcotics Unit.

222
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,110
Do it yourself then.

223
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,070
Seriously.

224
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,490
-Excuse me.
-Okay, that's nice.

225
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,740
Get ready.

226
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey!

227
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,290
Stop showering,
or your skin will peel off.

228
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,550
How many times have you showered?

229
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,010
That damn junkie.

230
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,550
I can still smell the stench.

231
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,430
What's that?

232
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,020
Is this mukeunji, aged kimchi?

233
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,320
Braised chicken and mukeunji
go well together.

234
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,070
-This is delicious.
-It's good, right?

235
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,290
Dad, can we get a dog?

236
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,370
What's this crazy talk
in the middle of the night?

237
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,460
We already have an annoying mutt.

238
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,710
Hey, mutt! Come and eat.
I bet you're hungry.

239
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,210
I already asked him to eat.

240
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,210
Come on. Let's get a dog.

241
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,130
Who will clean up after it?

242
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,220
I will.

243
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,260
As if. Clean up your room first.
It looks like a pigsty!

244
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,770
What are you doing?

245
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,020
Hey, stop making a mess when you eat.

246
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,780
Did you talk to your mom?
What about school?

247
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,240
And why isn't your mom coming back?

248
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,030
The wind slammed the door!

249
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,380
Where are you going?
I know you're hungry. Come and eat!

250
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,670
This mutt is going out for a walk.

251
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,010
Where were you assigned today?

252
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,890
Event support for the mayor.

253
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,100
What about tomorrow?

254
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,350
Cracking down
on illegal objects on the road.

255
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,140
And I'll be doing community service
at the bank the next day.

256
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,230
They call it special support duty,
but they treat you like a day laborer.

257
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,940
They send you wherever
and make you go through hell.

258
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,820
A suspension and pay cut are enough.
What kind of crap is this?

259
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,150
I know, right?

260
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,330
There's an opening at a security company,
so go work there.

261
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,870
My friend runs the place.

262
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,620
You'll get paid better there.

263
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,130
Ms. Jeong's nursing home bills
must be steep.

264
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,890
Why are you staring at me?

265
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,890
Because I'm thankful.

266
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,560
Where's this coming from?

267
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,730
Why do you care so much for me?

268
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,730
It makes me feel bad.

269
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,820
Who says I care for you?

270
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,950
I just don't want to hear you whine
like a little mutt.

271
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,540
I don't know why I bothered with you.

272
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,540
My nose still aches every time
the seasons change because of you.

273
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,710
I should've just ignored you back then.

274
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,460
I don't know why I felt sorry for you.

275
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,590
-Hey, are you sick?
-Come here.

276
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,260
Hold on a second.

277
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,050
You little…

278
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,390
Give it back to me
before things get worse.

279
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,220
You're letting a sick bastard beat you up?

280
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,650
-Damn it.
-Give it back.

281
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,540
Hey!

282
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,130
Word has spread about him
being the best fighter in Insung.

283
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,800
So kids pick fights with him every day.

284
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,760
But I hear he's a good kid.

285
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,020
What good kid uses his fists?

286
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,890
My son is an only child
and never causes mischief.

287
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,360
I'm telling you,
he's the one who hit my kid.

288
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,810
Where's his guardian?

289
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,650
He doesn't have a father,
and his mother isn't answering.

290
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,570
I left a contact number though.

291
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,120
MEDICINE

292
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,580
CHOI SEONG-HUI

293
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,340
THE LATE CHOI SEONG-HUI
SON: YOON DONG-JU

294
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,060
Mom…

295
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,400
Well, this is a surprise.

296
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,070
I guess you didn't fight back today.

297
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,490
You're here way too often.

298
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,910
Let's see here.

299
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Take them.

300
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,420
If you want to keep fighting,
put those to good use.

301
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,710
Don't get into fights on the streets.

302
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,060
What are you staring at?

303
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,320
The CAS has announced its decision
regarding boxer Yoon Dong-ju,

304
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,110
who faced losing his gold medal
due to doping allegations.

305
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,120
After a protracted two-year legal battle,

306
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,870
the CAS confirmed there was no evidence
of banned substance use by Yoon Dong-ju

307
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,620
and declared
his suspension from competition invalid.

308
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,380
Let's move on to soccer news.

309
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,430
2020 CAREER COMPETITIVE RECRUITMENT
MARTIAL ARTS ATHLETES (OFFICER)

310
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,020
COMPETITIONS ELIGIBLE FOR EVALUATION:
AQUATIC SPORTS, COMBAT SPORTS…

311
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,080
Thank you for always helping me…

312
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,870
when things were tough.

313
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,500
You'd actually listen to me
if you meant that.

314
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,460
Stop staring at me like that.
I know I'm handsome.

315
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,460
I'll arrange a meeting with my friend
for you soon, so be ready.

316
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,930
I can handle it on my own.

317
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,140
Nice and slow.

318
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,100
One.

319
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,970
Two. Take it slowly.

320
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,020
One.

321
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,150
Don't overdo it.
It's your first day of physical rehab.

322
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,190
This is harder than I thought.

323
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,650
Should we stop here for the day?

324
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,490
-Yes.
-Okay. Take a seat.

325
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,870
-Good work.
-Thank you.

326
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,640
KIM JONG-HYEON, RUPTURED LIGAMENT

327
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
Jong-hyeon.

328
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,650
Do you remember that day

329
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,320
when you met my mom
before the competition?

330
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,250
Oh, you're here early.
But why didn't you come with Jong-hyeon?

331
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,000
You called Jong-hyeon?

332
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,300
I told you we broke up.

333
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,380
You can always get back together.
Guys like him are hard to come by.

334
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,140
I'll take care of it.

335
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,680
Goodness, I don't know why
she didn't dress for the occasion.

336
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,560
Who's this?

337
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,890
Sit down.

338
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,650
-Shall I?
-Don't be shy.

339
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,070
He's the guy I mentioned before.

340
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,110
You look prettier in person than on TV.

341
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,370
I'm Richard Jung.

342
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,960
It's okay.

343
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,250
That's a nice tie clip.

344
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,920
It is, isn't it?

345
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,130
My darling said
it was an important day today

346
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,260
and gave it to me as a gift.

347
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,260
Actually, I bought that.

348
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,430
Thank you so much.

349
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,350
How did you find the time to buy it
with your busy training schedule?

350
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,350
When did you prepare this?

351
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
When I was 12.

352
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
I bought it

353
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,780
using the prize money I won
at the National Sports Festival.

354
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,070
It was my late father's birthday gift.

355
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,080
So don't thank me
because it's not yours.

356
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,750
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, my.

357
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,920
Honey?

358
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,550
I'm so sorry.
She's rather on edge these days.

359
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Han-na.

361
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,870
I'm so sorry.
She's rather on edge these days.

362
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,720
Are you okay?

363
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,430
Yeah.

364
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,980
You said you were okay.

365
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,520
That's why you lost that match, right?

366
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,120
Come in.

367
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,200
Are you ready?

368
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,870
Yes.

369
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,580
Is something wrong with his ankle?

370
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,130
Kim Jong-hyeon is having trouble
lunging forward today.

371
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,960
Why didn't you tell me?

372
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,050
I feel so bad. You should've told me.

373
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,720
You're right. I should've told you.

374
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,890
Would that have changed things between us?

375
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,360
I wanted to start over with you back then.

376
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,360
And I still want to

377
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,160
start over with you.

378
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
DUNG-JU

379
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,500
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

380

INSUNG SUPERMARKET

381
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,590
Why isn't she coming?

382
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,160
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

383
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,710
You should just leave the force.

384
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,840
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

385
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,780
DUNG-JU
HAN-NA, ARE YOU DONE?

386
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,200
And I still want to

387
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,910
start over with you.

388
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,830
But this is just how I feel.

389
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,410
I don't want to pressure you at all.

390
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,210
And I didn't lose the match
because of what happened that night.

391
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,800
So don't feel bad about it.

392
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,360
STEAMED BUN
I'M HOME NOW! DID YOU WAIT LONG?

393
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,710
INSUNG CLASSIC BULGOGI

394
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,680
-How about a speech, sir?
-What?

395
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,510
Me? No, it's okay.

396
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,140
Come on, sir.

397
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,640
Shall I then?

398
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,610
Mr. Min has been a dedicated member
of the Korea Customs Service,

399
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,700
so it's a shame to see him retire.

400
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,570
Thanks for all your hard work.

401
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,950
Same to you, sir.

402
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,910
-Right.
-I'll keep in touch.

403
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,380
What?

404
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,790
Oh, sounds good.

405
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,000
All right.

406
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,420
-Let's have a drink.
-Okay, sir.

407
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

408
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,890
Now that I think about it,

409
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,060
Mr. Min doesn't drink, smoke,
or have a girlfriend.

410
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,640
What's the fun in living then?

411
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm just curious. Aren't you, sir?

412
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,890
What?

413
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,350
Right.

414
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,060
I wonder what he does for fun.

415
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,990
I have more fun than you think.

416
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,530
-Can I choose whatever I want?
-Of course.

417
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,410
-Okay, then.
-Go ahead.

418
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,330
What should I get?

419
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,300
Welcome.

420
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Hello.

421
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,380
Looks like you're having fun.

422
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,440
You didn't call ahead of time.
What's going on?

423
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,400
Can I help you, ma'am?

424
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,490
It's okay.

425
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,860
Since when have we ever
called ahead of time?

426
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,280
I thought we were closer than that.

427
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,790
Are you going to leave him alone?

428
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,580
The cop, I mean.

429
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,630
A disobedient mutt
should be tied up nearby.

430
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,550
And as you said, he's cute.

431
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,340
Especially when he tries to fight back.

432
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,180
Did you come here to ask me that?

433
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,390
I did my part, so now you need to tell me.

434
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,690
Where's that bitch?

435
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,810
Why are you so impatient?

436
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,940
Do you even know where she is?

437
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,360
If I find out you lied to me,

438
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,870
you won't survive the repercussions.

439
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,080
Of course, I know where she is.
I wouldn't dare lie about that.

440
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,870
She's the only person…

441
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,540
who remembers who you are.

442
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,010
A little gift to motivate you.

443
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,060
You'll see her soon.

444
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,190
Once you finish producing
the last batch of Candy.

445
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,530
Go ahead and wait for me.

446
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,360
I promise to come and get you.

447
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,570
Okay, then.

448
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,660
Hold on to this hairpin for me
until I see you again, okay?

449
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,290
Promise me.

450
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,120
Okay, I promise.

451
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,670
I mean it.

452
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,270
JI HO-CHEOL

453
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,900
Gosh, it's so hot!

454
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,570
What's wrong with the weather?

455
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,900
Why are you so late?

456
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,030
There was way too much traffic.

457
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,240
Look at this.

458
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,370
I got these peaches from Jochiwon.
They're big and absolutely delicious.

459
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,250
These are hard to come by.

460
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,250
Look. It's as cute as a baby's bottom.

461
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,790
Take a whiff. It's so sweet that--

462
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,920
Forget it.

463
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,590
Why did you bring peaches?
Dad doesn't like them.

464
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,130
Who cares if your dad doesn't like them?

465
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,590
Why are you in your uniform?

466
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,720
Is there a special event today?

467
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Mom.

468
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,890
You don't know what today is, do you?

469
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,650
Today? What do you mean?

470
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,070
What is it?

471
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
Goodness.

472
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,070
What is it?

473
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Oh, dear.

474
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,660
Han-na, wait for me!

475
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,790
ANNIVERSARY OF DAD'S PASSING

WE LOVE YOU AND WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU

477
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,560
This is top-shelf.

478
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,770
Sorry. This is for someone else.

479
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,830
REQUESTED BY KIM SEOK-HYEON
RELATIONSHIP: OLDER BROTHER

480
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,460
You're all set for discharge.

481
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,970
Why are there so many forms to sign?

482
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,180
Family ties can be such a hassle.

483
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,060
I didn't ask you to come.

484
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,730
I'm not here
out of some brotherly love either.

485
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,480
The Prosecutors' Office has a ton of work
because of what your precious SCIT did.

486
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,570
And what if you'd gotten killed, huh?

487
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,440
You had us worried.

488
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,570
I mean, Father was worried.

489
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,370
I'm not a kid anymore,

490
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,330
but I'm still running his errands
at my ripe old age.

491
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,410
What a joke.

493
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,430
Father says if you're going to
waste your life like this,

494
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,970
you should hand over your shares to me.

495

TRANSFEROR:
TRANSFEREE: KIM SEOK-HYEON

496
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,350
You know how he is
better than I do, right?

497
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,520
As if becoming a cop wasn't bad enough,
you had to get shot, huh?

498
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,350
He won't just stand by anymore.

499
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,480
Once you decide,
send it back through Secretary Kim.

500
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,410
Hey.

501
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,540
If you're going to hide,
stay well out of sight.

502
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,410
If you're going to fight, go all in.

503
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,330
Not that I care much,

504
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,250
but take care of yourself.

Hello, ma'am.

00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,140
Welcome.

508
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,690
Welcome.

509
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
-Hello, ma'am.
-Welcome.

510
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Hello, sir.

511
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,150
Welcome.

513
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,090
Thank you.

514
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Thanks to you, I received severance pay.

515
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,730
So I opened a savings account.

516
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,110
You should buy me a meal
if you really are thankful.

517
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,320
Maybe I will.

518
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,360
What do you want to eat?

519
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,530
Unbelievable.

520
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,170
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

521
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,920
This is it?

522
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,720
I'm unemployed,
so I need to watch my spending.

523
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,430
Prices have gone up too much.

524
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,680
Look at you,
being so financially responsible.

525
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,640
Why not eat alone and save money then?

526
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,230
You don't seem to have friends either.

527
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,270
It's nice for loners to eat together.

528
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,210
Sorry.

529
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,210
This is for someone else.

530
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,800
Black Cat was a mafia organization

531
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,680
that operated in the Russian Far East.

532
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,800
There used to be a famous smuggler.
He went by Oh Dollar.

533
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,310
Where can I meet him?

534
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,810
He's dead.

535
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,730
It's been about 15 years.

536
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,850
Back in 2008,

537
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,730
a Russian mafia member
was shot dead in Insung.

538
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,540
Stop following us. It's embarrassing.

539
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,120
You can't hang out with us
until you ride a two-wheeler.

540
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,710
Go play with the little kids.

541
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,250
Those little brats.

542
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,320
What are you doing?

543
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,620
Are you playing detective?

544
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,620
Are you bored?

545
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,950
Is this what you've been doing
instead of working?

546
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,540
What now? Are you going up against
the Russian mafia this time?

547
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
I'm sorry.

548
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,630
Ranks and departments exist for a reason.

549
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,760
Carry out your assignment
of organizing the storage.

550
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,470
The fastest way to catch these criminals
is to focus on your job.

551
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,680
You should start with Section B.

552
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,640
Get moving,
or they'll be destroyed in a month.

553
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,560
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,730
Seriously.

Hello.

557
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,590
This is the Investigation Support Team
at Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

558
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,420
It's a pleasure to be here.

559
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,680
Many people are tuning in
to today's live broadcast.

SMUGGLER OH BONG-CHAN MURDER CASE

561
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
His real name was Oh Bong-chan.

562
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,230
He made a ton of money by dealing dollars.

563
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,270
That's why they called him Oh Dollar.

570
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,560
What is it?

571
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,350
Do you want to keep fighting?

572
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,520
Haven't you had enough?

573
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,270
You must be tougher than you look.

574
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,900
I'm used to slugfests

575
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,240
because I grew up taking beatings.

576
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,700
Eat up and get your head on straight.

577
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,410
I'm telling you this out of concern.

578
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,290
No matter how hard you try on your own,

579
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,410
nothing will change.

580
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,340
Do you still not understand

581
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,710
what drives people?

582
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,270
Welcome.

583
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,080
Haven't you had enough?

584
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,000
No matter how hard you try on your own,

585
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,550
nothing will change.

586
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,050
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

587
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:16,150
STEAMED BUN

588
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,660
Why aren't you riding your bicycle?

589
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,000
Is it broken?

590
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,830
The kids make fun of me.

591
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
They say I'm riding a bicycle for babies.

592
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,670
My dad was supposed to
take off the training wheels

593
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,470
and teach me how to ride without them.

594
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,860
Do you know what you're doing?

595
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,570
Of course I do.

596
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,410
Just wait. I'll get it done in no time.

597
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,080
-Mister.
-Yeah?

598
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,330
Have you stopped catching bad guys?

599
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:02,670
What?

600
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,040
Well…

601
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,220
Not exactly, but something came up.

602
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,140
Then what about the person
who hurt my dad?

603
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,560
What?

604
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,230
My grandma said

605
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,770
the man who confessed

606
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,030
wasn't the person who hurt my dad.

607
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,240
She said the real bad guy
hasn't been caught yet.

608
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,330
All done.

609
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,460
You want to give it a ride?

610
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,470
Are you sure I can ride this on my own?

611
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,050
Of course you can.

612
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,140
I learned on my own too.

613
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,560
-Why?
-I didn't have anyone to teach me.

614
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,190
I said get the hell up!

615
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,060
-Get up.
-Hey!

616
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,860
-You have a death wish?
-Don't hit your sick wife!

617
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,550
What if I fall?

618
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,920
If you fall, just grit your teeth
and get back up.

619
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,390
You can't achieve anything
if you don't face your fear.

620
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,560
I'll hold on from behind,
so don't be afraid.

621
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,150
You can do this.

622
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,730
And about the person who hurt your dad,

623
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,610
I'm going to catch them, no matter what.

624
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,730
I promise.

625
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:53,900
I'm a man of my word.

626
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Look straight ahead.

627
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,030
I haven't let go.

628
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,580
Okay, keep going.

629
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,660
-Okay.
-You're doing well. I'm holding on to you.

Hello, sir.

637
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,470
What's this?

638
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,270
The thing is…

639
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,100
Some random guy came in and…

640
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,540
-What the hell?
-Hey!

641
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,830
Stop right there!

642
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,170
Get him!

643
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,240
Catch the bastard and kill him!

644
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:52,790
You bastard!

645
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,640
Hey, get up!

646
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,640
Come on, get him!

647
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,390
Get him!

648
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,420
Hey. Go, go.

649
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,840
Move it!

650
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,390
-Damn it!
-Stay down.

651
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,600
Wait, please stop!
Please don't do this to me!

652
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,530
Hey, you bastard!

653
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,070
Did Kim send you?

654
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,900
Or was it Oh?

655
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,070
You bastard, do you know
who owns this store?

656
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,450
Why are you doing this?

657
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,160
Just give me one name.

658
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,870
That's all I want.

659
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,160
Whose name?

660
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,620
Sir?

661
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,670
This here.

662
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,750
Who else has this?

663
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,680
Excuse me, can you help me get out?

664
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,180
Pull me out, please.

665
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,510
Thank you.

666
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,350
Thank you, sir.

667
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,480
-Let's cuff you now.
-Can this wait?

668
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,480
Businesses involved in illegal operations

669
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,860
have recently been hit with penalties,
including suspensions and closures.

670
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,820
All of these businesses were exposed
thanks to a tip from a citizen

671
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,990
who is believed to be the man
seen in the CCTV footage.

672
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,780
While the man's identity remains unknown

673
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:52,040
due to his face being covered by a hoodie,

674
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,250
his appearance closely matches
that of the person seen in CCTV footage…

675
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,540
That bastard!

676
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,790
…from other recently reported
illegal businesses.

677
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,380
I'm not talking about you, sir.

678
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,750
That little punk.

679
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,300
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

680
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,300
The only things I'm proud of in my life…

681
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,970
are my gold medal and being a cop.

682
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,720
I won't let anyone take them away from me.

683
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,230
Not until I catch that bastard.

684
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,310
I won't.

685
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,740
SIGNS POINT TO THE MAN

CORPORATE SHARE WAIVER AGREEMENT

687
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,360
The fight is over
the moment you get scared.

688
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,280
If you're going to hide,
stay well out of sight.

689
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,200
If you're going to fight, go all in.

690
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,170
The person you are calling
cannot be reached. You will be directed…

00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,000

693
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,410
Between rounds…

694
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,000
there's a brief one-minute break.

695
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
That time

696
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,790
is not just for hydrating…

697
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,130
and wiping off sweat.

698
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,880
That's when you crouch down

699
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,300
to snatch a victory in the next round.

700
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,440
Let's go!

701
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,010
Damn.

702
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,090
This is a bit more than I thought.

703
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,550
What the hell?

704
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,930
Who the hell are you?

705
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,870
The match is simply on pause.

706
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,830
Damn it, get him!

707
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,160
The next round…

708
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,370
will soon follow.

709
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,320
SPECIAL THANKS TO KO JUN AND LEE JI-HOON
FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCE

710
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:00,660
Hey, why do you keep avoiding me?

711
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,240
Do you have some time?

712
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,830
I need to show you something.

713
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,080
He hasn't come home for days.
What in the world is he doing out there?

714
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,920
Just how much money
does Min Ju-yeong have?

715
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,510
What if Drugmon finds out?

01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,180
-Because of the person you're looking for?
-Yeah.

01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,760
Nothing happened even when we had
officers getting stabbed and shot.

718
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,520
The higher-ups will just cover it all up!

01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,480
He'll know
where Min Ju-yeong hid the money.

Hey, owner of 4889.

721
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,230
Have you eaten yet?

723
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,820
I have no choice but to avoid you.
