1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,020
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Shin Jae-hong of Insung City
is stepping up now for his fifth attempt.

4
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,070
The heavy rain today will make it tough
for the athletes out there.

5
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,360
Yes, absolutely.

6
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Shin Jae-hong is calmly getting ready
for his fifth attempt.

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,870
INSUNG

8
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,580
Yes!

9
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,380
Foul!

10
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,930
-Another foul is called.
-Why?

11
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,220
-I didn't go over the line!
-It didn't look like a foul on the screen.

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,430
That's a strange call.

13
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,270
Shin Jae-hong regains his composure
as he prepares for his sixth attempt.

14
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,580
Foul!

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,790
Load this up.

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
You're here.

17
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,180
Good work today.

18
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,550
Keep faking the import ledger
as you've been doing.

19
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,520
I can't tell you how reassuring it is
to have a reliable guy like you

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,390
working in the Korea Customs Service.

21
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,360
Why aren't you
wearing the watch I gave you?

22
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,740
Because it's too valuable.

23
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,450
This is a fake.

24
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,870
That can't be.

25
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,950
Can you look at it again?

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,500
I can look at it ten times,
but the answer won't change.

27
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,040
The color of the cubic zirconia is off.

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,580
If you don't believe me,
get it appraised somewhere else.

29
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,750
With the real thing,

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,380
<i>you know it at first glance.</i>

31
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,470
You're right.

32
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,430
I can tell just by looking.

33
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,690
I only thought of filling this container.

34
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,940
<i>I never knew I would see it empty.</i>

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,570
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,410
Let me apologize.

37
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,830
That's okay.
I should be the one apologizing.

38
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,500
I took away all the money
you led a life of crime for.

39
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>You've got some nerve though.</i>

40
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,250
How did you manage to live on
with all that money hidden away?

41
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,340
<i>Just work hard for a few years.</i>

42
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,390
Then you'll be able to fill this up

43
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,680
with your own goods.

44
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,940
<i>I was scared at first.</i>

45
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,230
<i>But you see,</i>

46
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,940
when you become unimaginably rich,
all your fears disappear.

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,070
You can do anything by then.

48
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,070
<i>But even that can get boring.</i>

49
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,410
<i>Then you showed up</i>
<i>and spiced things up for me.</i>

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,540
<i>Watching you struggle like a little mutt</i>
<i>tugged at my heartstrings,</i>

51
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,750
and I even saw myself in your persistence.

52
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,550
You think we're similar?

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,090
Damn, that's offensive.

54
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,840
Hey.

55
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,310
You must be in deep shock
to be talking all this nonsense.

56
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,270
<i>No.</i>

57
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,900
I feel…

58
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,150
really good.

59
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,240
It feels like I've gone back
to when it all began.

60
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,410
I don't think I can wait a few years.

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,620
Because I want the real thing

62
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,380
right this second.

63
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,880
Thanks.

64
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
You feel good?

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
That's good.

66
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,930
Make sure you eat well.

67
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,180
You need a full stomach
to stay on your feet.

68
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,510
<i>And eat your cucumbers.</i>

69
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,350
I'll push you

70
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,650
further into a corner.

71
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,940
Okay. I'll look forward to it.

72
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,510
<i>Police have seized cash</i>
<i>hidden in a container yard.</i>

73
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,230
<i>The staggering amount</i>
<i>completely filled the 40-foot container…</i>

74
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,640
<i>Bundles of 50,000-won bills</i>
<i>were stacked to the brim,</i>

75
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,310
<i>weighing 26 tons altogether.</i>

76
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,190
<i>What's even more astonishing</i>
<i>is that this isn't the only container.</i>

77
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,570
<i>The amount seized is unprecedented</i>
<i>in the country's history.</i>

78
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,660
<i>We're seeing a series of thefts</i>
<i>targeting containers.</i>

79
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,660
<i>As rumors spread about more hidden cash,</i>

80
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,040
<i>similar theft attempts</i>
<i>are occurring nonstop…</i>

81
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,170
<i>An investigation is underway</i>
<i>as police suspect the stored cash</i>

82
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>is criminal proceeds</i>
<i>from gambling and drug trafficking.</i>

83
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,420
Commissioner.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,170
Get that damn phone…

85
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,300
I told you to forward all calls.

86
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,470
You need to take this, sir.

87
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,640
It's the president's office.

88
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,140
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

89
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,440
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

90
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,480
-Hello?
-<i>Where are you?</i>

91
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,860
<i>Why won't you answer your phone?</i>

92
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,700
The commissioner is looking for you.

93
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,570
Bring your guys to the agency right now.

94
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,280
Sorry, but I requested my leave yesterday.

95
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,200
The same goes for my guys.
Tell him we'll be unavailable for a week.

96
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,250
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>Do you know what you did?</i>

97
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,710
The president's office just called!

98
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,750
My gosh, it looks like the commissioner
will become a nationwide star.

99
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,340
Sorry, I have to
book my plane tickets now.

100
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,840
Jeez, what's wrong with my phone?

101
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,300
Hello? Hello… Oh… Bye!

102
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,850
This is totally crazy.
It'll take all day to count the money.

103
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,770
Golden Bunny has agreed to testify
in all cases involving Min Ju-yeong.

104
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,060
He'll be transferred
to the SPO for questioning.

105
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,980
That's good.

106
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,020
He'll be safe once he's outside of Insung.

107
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,030
With the commissioner
and the mayor scared stiff,

108
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,150
Min Ju-yeong won't be able to
make a move either.

109
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,450
<i>GOPCHANG </i>RESTAURANT
THE VALLEY

110
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,570
Ma'am, please give us
the freshest <i>gopchang</i> you have.

111
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,700
-We're going to stuff ourselves today.
-Welcome back.

112
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,200
But why are there only four of you?

113
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,710
Where's the big guy?

114
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,790
You always came together.

115
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,050
-So a special set for four?
-Yes.

116
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,800
-A special set for four here!
-Okay.

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
It'd be nice if Jae-hong could join us.

118
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,010
He must be busy,
seeing that he's not answering.

119
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,430
Have you talked to him?

120
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,970
Well, yeah.

121
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,850
But he seems pretty busy.
He can join us next time.

122
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,360
It's still a shame though.

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,230
It's not like
we're never going to see him again.

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,150
This is frustrating. Let's drink today.

125
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,200
-Can we get some soju?
-Yes, sir.

126
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,950
STOP AT THE STOP LINE
SCHOOL ZONE

127
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,420
You've got some nerve.

128
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
I had no idea you had so much money.

129
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,970
How much more do you have?

130
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,550
I'm not sure. I've never counted it.

131
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,640
I guess I had a lot of it.

132
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,980
We should've pulled out
all of Golden Bunny's teeth.

133
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,820
What about the money that's owed to us?

134
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,400
You told us to trust it, and so we did.

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,030
What should we trust now?

136
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,660
Don't worry.

137
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,330
You'll receive the payment as promised.

138
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,910
How can we trust you?

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,370
The cops are searching everywhere.

140
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,920
That money is as good as gone.

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,460
You're not the same as before.

142
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,550
I don't know what you were like before,

143
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,920
but I'm disappointed.

144
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,670
Hey, where are you going?

145
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,850
I don't want to be more disappointed,
so this is it for me.

146
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,980
I'd like to extend…

147
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,560
our contract.

148
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,190
What are you talking about?

149
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,610
You have enough Candy.

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,570
We got more orders.

151
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,450
How is that any of my business?

152
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,580
Figure out the rest yourself.

153
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,700
If you leave right now,

154
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,910
I can't guarantee the safety of the woman
you're looking for.

155
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,010
Don't mess with her.

156
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,720
Remember what I said.

157
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,970
That bitch is mine.

158
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,980
Hey, that's enough.

159
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,980
If you don't let her go,
our deal ends here.

160
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,860
If you move a finger, I'll end you here.

161
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,230
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,990
Not yet.

163
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,490
But I'm about to.

164
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,740
Just like I did back in the day.

165
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,500
You should've done that from the start.

166
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,350
Honey.

167
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,640
Honey, I'm home--

168
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Welcome home, Senior Officer Shin.

169
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,810
Go and have dinner.

170
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,110
They were waiting outside
when I got home from work.

171
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't lift a finger today.
I'll take care of everything.

172
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,610
I feel so bad though.

173
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,820
Hey.

174
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,660
I got some toys your children might like.

175
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,240
I hope that's okay.

176
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,290
That's more than okay,
but what brings you here?

177
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,960
Dong-ju wanted to come.

178
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,250
-Let's take a break and have some snacks.
-Hurry up and come.

179
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,920
You must be tired.

180
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,390
Thank you.

181
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,730
This is really refreshing.

182
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,520
POLICE INVESTIGATE
CASH FOUND AT PORT CONTAINER YARD

183
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,900
Why don't you quit your part-time job?

184
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,320
It'll be a pain in the ass
if you get caught and disciplined.

185
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,410
You saw me?

186
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,530
Of course I did.

187
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,040
You're as big as a mountain.
It's hard to miss you.

188
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,580
I'm sorry I can't join you.

189
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,880
There's nothing to be sorry about.
We know the situation you're in.

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,460
So don't say that.

191
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,800
Things might get worse for you
if you join us now.

192
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,890
If this goes south,
it won't end with disciplinary action.

193
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,140
Look, these two don't care
about getting promoted.

194
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,430
That one's rich, so he's fine.

195
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,140
As for me, I'm already screwed.

196
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,520
You can join us later
when things get better.

197
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,490
I put in for a transfer
to Gangwon Province.

198
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,320
Apparently, they offer housing too.

199
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,830
-Sir.
-Yes?

200
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,540
Where should I go, mister?

201
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,080
Gangwon Province is too far away.

202
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,710
Where should I go…

203
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,890
See you.

204
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,970
Dong-ju.

205
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,520
Thanks.

206
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,390
For what?

207
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,810
For not asking me anything.

208
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,160
2013 NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL
DISQUALIFIED: SHIN JAE-HONG, INSUNG

209
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,450
<i>Thank you for being here for me</i>
<i>without saying anything.</i>

210
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,870
I've always been thoughtful.

211
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,170
I'll call you later.

212
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,300
Thanks. Get home safely.

213
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,470
I'll call you later. You go first.

214
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,600
What?

215
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,930
I have to talk to Jong-hyeon.

216
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,730
What kind of talk?

217
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,940
I'll call you. Go.

218
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,490
Okay.

219
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,490
Don't forget to call.

220
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,620
See you.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Jong-hyeon.

222
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,340
I don't think I've told you this yet.

223
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,680
-I--
-Han-na.

224
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,430
I'm a little tired right now.

225
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,310
Can we talk some other time?

226
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,150
I'm coming already. Jeez.

227
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,940
What's with the rushing?

228
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
What took you so long?

229
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,990
What is it?

230
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,120
Now that I've lost all my money,

231
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,120
you think there's nothing left
to take from me,

232
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,080
dear youngest-ever
departmental chief prosecutor?

233
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,500
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office
is taking charge.

234
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,960
I never once thought that, sir.

235
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,880
Right?

236
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,090
Of course.

237
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,930
How could I ever forget your kindness?

238
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,890
You almost hurt my feelings there.

239
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,890
My dear smart
departmental chief prosecutor.

240
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,350
Don't forget…

241
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,700
that money isn't the only thing…

242
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,290
in my arsenal.

243
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,870
Yes, sir.

244
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,170
-We have a special guest tonight.
-No, not at all.

245
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,630
I'm sorry for making the atmosphere
so tense.

246
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,630
-Take a seat.
-Hey.

247
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,050
Where are you going?
Go sit down. It's okay.

248
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,570
What else do I need?

249
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,370
Come on, not again.

250
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,430
Damn it.

251
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,150
STEAMED BUN

252
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,760
Please, come on!

253
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,860
Are you preparing
for the handover already?

254
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Take your time.
You still have a few days left.

255
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,530
Let's have a team dinner before you go.

256
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,820
You have to come this time.

257
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,620
I will.

258
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
LOAN ASSISTANCE FOR ATHLETES

259
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,090
YOUR LOAN APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED
KOREAN SPORT COMMITTEE

260
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,340
Excuse me, sir?

261
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,760
May I use my remaining paid leave days?

262
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,640
Four laptops, three office chairs,
one conference table,

263
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,190
one water purifier,
one Go board, and one <i>Janggi</i> board.

264
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,230
Complimentary coffee,
beverages, and toilet paper.

265
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,730
With the Internet
and the electricity bill…

266
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,150
All right. Here's what you owe me.

267
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,860
You're being so harsh.

268
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,490
Food expenses?

269
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,040
I don't have any money.

270
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,080
I'm freeloading here
because I don't have any funds!

271
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,790
I know you have money.

272
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,960
You swiped the RIU's operating funds.

273
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm a web of information.

274
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,300
Watch what you're saying.

275
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,050
I'm a clean, upstanding cop.

276
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,970
I gave you a discount,
so wire the money to me

277
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,680
before I kick you out of here.

278
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,890
Does he have to be that sharp?

279
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,940
What are you doing?

280
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,280
Hey, what are you doing?

281
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,280
Oh, there you are.

282
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,790
Why didn't you answer last night?

283
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,210
I fell asleep while waiting for your call.

284
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,010
What did you two talk about for so long?

285
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,010
Are you still going to stay there?

286
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,220
What?

287
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,310
I told you to come stay with me,
but you still haven't come.

288
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,060
Change your shirt.
You got something on it.

289
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,110
I must've spilled kimchi on myself.

290
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Yoon Dong-ju.

291
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
Yeah?

292
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,370
What is it this time?

293
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,870
Are you sure
the doctor said you were okay?

294
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,880
Of course.

295
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,880
If you don't come this time,
I'll never let you into my house again.

296
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,640
Okay, I'll pack my stuff. Let's go.

297
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,260
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

298
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,070
-An unattractive pair…
-Coming in together?

299
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,320
-Look at this.
-You're here.

300
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,660
Han-na, over there. Dong-ju, you sit here.

301
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,620
When did you set this up?

302
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,540
Is Jong-hyeon not here yet?

303
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,000
He's looking into things,
so he won't be here for a while.

304
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,250
In the meantime,
we should focus on obtaining

305
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,420
evidence and testimonies
proving Min Ju-yeong's crimes.

306
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,170
What about the RIU
and Seobu Station case files?

307
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Someone's bringing them.

308
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,890
Goodness. Speak of the devil.

309
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,680
What in the world?

310
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:26,720
Jae-hong!

311
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,270
I had some free time.

312
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,850
I'll help as much as I can
before my transfer.

313
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,070
Sounds good.
We need all the help we can get.

314
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,030
-Let's finish this before our leave ends.
-This place is cramped enough as is.

315
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,070
I'm charging extra for another person.

316
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
Sit here or over there.

317
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,120
You're the one eating, but I get the bill?

318
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
Hey, Dae-yong.

319
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,250
What?

320
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,000
Where?

321
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,340
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

322
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,460
Let them through.

323
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,510
What is it? What happened?

324
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,590
Sir.

325
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,060
This stuff left her in this state
in less than ten minutes.

326
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,350
It's on a whole other level.

327
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,860
We caught drug users
at Myeongjin Shopping Complex today.

328
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,570
It's been spreading throughout Insung.

329
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,780
Min Ju-yeong is probably behind this.

330
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,660
That damn bastard.

331
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,950
But why? Is it because he needs money?
Why sell to kids?

332
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,040
Where did she get the drugs?

333
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,540
A handoff was arranged
through a messaging app.

334
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,290
They're searching inside for more.

335
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,840
How old was she? She looks so young.

336
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,050
Sixteen years old.

337
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,340
The same age as Jeong-a.

338
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,010
Did you find anything?

339
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,570
Excuse me.

340
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,740
Hey. It's you, isn't it?

341
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,370
Hey!

342
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,830
You're selling to kids now?

343
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,290
Isn't that way out of line?

344
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,090
You're right.

345
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,170
It's out of line, isn't it?

346
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,840
-I'm not falling for that again. Get up.
-I need that.

347
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,850
Hey, enough with the act. Get up.

348
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,180
Please give me that.

349
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,430
Please.

350
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,330
Hey, get up.

351
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,130
Where's the needle?

352
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,760
You're good at dealing with patients.

353
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,740
Sorry.

354
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,410
You should say that

355
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,030
to the victims of the crap
you and your people pulled.

356
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,080
So save it.

357
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,170
Cuff her.

358
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,380
We finally got Drugmon.

359
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,680
-Let's move.
-Yes, sir.

360
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Move.

361
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,770
-I'll look into it and get back to you.
-Okay.

362
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,520
SERVING THE PEOPLE

363
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,650
Yes, Captain.

364
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,820
I just met with the chief
of the Criminal Department.

365
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,410
Golden Bunny will be transferred
to the SPO in Seoul by tomorrow.

366
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,830
-Drugmon?
-<i>That's right.</i>

367
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,370
I'll tell you more when you get back.

368
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,950
Good work. Get back safely.

369
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,210
We'll finish up here,
so bring her in safely.

370
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,580
-Yes, sir.
-Have a good one.

371
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,050
Isn't that Drugmon?

372
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,050
Dong-ju pulled off a big one.

373
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,930
How did you notice her?

374
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,270
You two go to Myeongjin Shopping Complex.

375
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,390
It seems that
Min Ju-yeong is distributing drugs.

376
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,310
Someone must've seen the guys
who made the handoff.

377
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,770
-Look into it.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,690
Right. Seobu Station called this morning.

379
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,150
A Seongnae-dong smuggler associated
with Min Ju-yeong turned themselves in,

380
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,030
and Senior Inspector Kang
is questioning them.

381
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,990
Min Ju-yeong's cronies
are starting to turn their backs on him.

382
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,790
I'm going to Seobu Station.

383
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,410
We'll call you.

384
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,790
Let's go.

385
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,050
<i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>cannot be reached. You will be…</i>

386
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,880
They won't even answer your calls.

387
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,300
This is pathetic.

388
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,430
Looks like the Seongnae-dong guys
turned against us.

389
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,140
Are you going to sit back and do nothing?

390
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,350
No.

391
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,350
Then they won't take me seriously.

392
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,200
What's our dear Dong-ju up to right now?

393
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,780
Hello, sir.
Have you seen anything like this?

394
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,870
No.

395
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,120
-Sir, have you seen a candy that looks--
-I don't know anything.

396
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,790
It could be stashed here.

397
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,830
Why would it be there?

398
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,380
<i>We're not having any luck today.</i>

399
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,420
Is everything on track for the transfer?

400
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,720
-Yeah. I'm sorry I can't help more.
-It's okay.

401
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,380
-Let's go here.
-Okay.

402
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,220
Hello.

403
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,140
Have you seen
this type of candy or wrapper?

404
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,230
THE LOAN APPROVED THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN DECLINED DUE TO UNFORESEEN ISSUES

405
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,440
Hello, have you seen
this type of candy or wrapper?

406
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,610
I don't think so.

407
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,030
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, it's nothing.

408
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,080
Dong-ju, can I take off
for about 30 minutes?

409
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,410
Sure. I just need to check this area.

410
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,210
Thanks. Sorry about this.

411
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,580
It's okay.

412
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,080
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

413
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,320
Stop the car if you want to live.

414
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,660
I'm not sure what to tell you.

415
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,120
Your application was approved,

416
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,950
but one of the review committee members
said additional requirements were needed.

417
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,250
Who's this review committee member?

418
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,330
He's a board member.

419
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,000
His name is Mr. Oh Jong-gu.

420
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,590
Okay.

421
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,800
MR. OH JONG-GU

422
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,930
MIDDLE SCHOOLER FOUND DEAD
AFTER TAKING "CANDY"

423
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,680
-What's this?
-"What's this?"

424
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,560
I should be asking you that.

425
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,310
Why is Candy being distributed
without my permission?

426
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,570
You said you'd only sell to the Japanese.

427
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,150
There was a condition
when selling my drug.

428
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,820
Did you forget it?

429
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,410
I said that women and children
were off-limits.

430
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,410
I'll look into it.
Don't get too worked up.

431
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,750
Where the hell are you going?

432
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,340
I'm not done talking.

433
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,010
Why all this fuss over a dead kid?

434
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,800
Hey, let's go watch something.

435
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Watch what?

436
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,480
Today is <i>boknal,</i>
one of the hottest days of summer.

437
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,810
It's a perfect day to slaughter the mutt!

438
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,310
Damn it!

439
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,320
Let him go.

440
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,030
That's enough. Good work.

441
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,460
Hey, Dong-ju.

442
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,050
Stop running around.

443
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,050
Your head is bleeding.

444
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,260
Are you trying to run away again?

445
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,890
You have to go through me to do that.

446
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,520
Think you can beat me in that state?

447
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,230
I can take you down no problem.

448
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,190
-You little punk.
-You bastard.

449
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,780
Damn it.

450
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,450
Why do all of these bastards

451
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,040
think I'm a goddamn sucker?

452
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,300
That's how you throw a right hook.

453
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,640
Pretty jarring, huh?

454
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,850
Hey, watch your blood pressure.

455
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,020
If you keep this up,

456
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,270
you'll damage your optic nerve

457
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
and go blind.

458
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,610
What the hell are you talking about?

459
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
What?

460
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,910
Did you think I didn't know?

461
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,330
I know you're punch-drunk.

462
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,380
You idiot.

463
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,760
I used to be your coach, remember?

464
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,470
Of course, I caught that.

465
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I knew it way back in 2018.

466
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,850
You wanted to win the gold
and earn the pension that came with it

467
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,810
to pay for Gyeong-il's surgery,

468
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,140
so you took those painkillers
and got in the ring.

469
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,270
I guess taking care of him
wasn't enough for you.

470
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,860
Now you're taking care of his mom too.

471
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,780
Seeing you as her caregiver
brings tears to my eyes.

472
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,240
It would've been a really touching story

473
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,700
had Gyeong-il known this
before he croaked.

474
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,700
Don't you agree?

475
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,660
You son of a bitch.

476
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Didn't I tell you
that's not how you throw a right hook?

477
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,300
You should've paid attention

478
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,680
when I taught you, you bastard.

479
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,020
Goddammit.

480
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,900
JAE-HONG, DONG-JU

481
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,780
Dong-ju!

482
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,700
Yoon Dong-ju!

483
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,490
Dong-ju!

484
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,810
Jae-hong, where's Dong-ju?

485
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,860
Senior Officer Shin.

486
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,580
Shin Jae-hong!

487
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,870
What the hell happened?

488
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,790
Dung-ju disappeared…

489
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,090
while I was gone.

490
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,340
STEAMED BUN

491
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,540
Your face is a mess.

492
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,420
Did you really think
everything would be over

493
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,300
after the count and the 12th round?

494
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
I told you.

495
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,970
You're in my ring.

496
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,300
We don't need rules or the law

497
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,720
because I'm the referee here.

498
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,850
Come here.

499
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,540
I hear you're quite unwell.

500
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,210
They say you can't recognize people
and you'll lose use of your limbs

501
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,960
if your condition worsens.

502
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,590
You should've gotten treatment
instead of following me.

503
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

504
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,680
Seeing that I recognize the bastard
I need to beat the shit out of,

505
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,640
I'm still fine.

506
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,400
Such tough talk.

507
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,110
There's no time
for you to go to a hospital,

508
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,490
so I'll have to treat you myself.

509
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,750
Come here. Let's get you fixed up.

510
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,120
-Let go of me.
-Hey.

511
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,290
Keep still.

512
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,750
This is good stuff.

513
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,260
The patient is ready, Dr. Min.

514
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,220
-Don't do it.
-Keep still.

515
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,260
It's quality stuff. Don't worry.

516
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,600
This will sting a bit.

517
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,830
So?

518
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,000
Do you feel better
now that you've seen the little mutt?

519
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,920
Yeah, I do.

520
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,880
Did you give him all of that?

521
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,050
It's over the lethal dose.

522
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,560
Is it?

523
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,680
Oh, dear.

524
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,100
I guess I made a mistake.

525
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,940
I did think that something was off.

526
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,370
I was wondering
what to fill this up with again.

527
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,660
Now I see it'd be perfect for you.

528
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,700
Isn't that nice of me?

529
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,460
I'm such a good friend
for giving you a big, sturdy coffin.

530
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,220
You'll be okay after a while.

531
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,180
It's been fun.

532
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,390
Enjoy your trip…

533
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,190
to the afterlife.

534
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,360
Escort him safely to the port.

535
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,040
Don't fight it. It'll make the pain worse.

536
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,590
Hold out for ten minutes.

537
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,350
Man, I didn't know you had it in you.

538
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,850
How did you catch him?

539
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,690
Asshole.

540
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,110
Don't just stand there. Lock it up!

541
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,170
Captain.

542
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,460
What's going on?

543
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm sorry, Senior Officer Ji.

544
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,260
BANG

545
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,390
AN DAE-YONG

546
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,020
Hey.

547
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,810
We lost Drugmon.

548
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,230
-I'm sorry.
-You goddamn idiot!

549
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,110
Why the hell can't you do your job?

550
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,570
Whatever, I'm hanging up!

551
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,830
What happened to cameras one and five?

552
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,170
Why are the feeds gone?
How much did they give you?

553
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,580
Look at me!

554
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,380
I said look at me!

555
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,440
Hold out for ten minutes.

556
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,630
Ten minutes,

557
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,800
I can handle.

558
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,350
What the hell?

559
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,900
Hey, what the hell is he doing?

560
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,270
That crazy mutt!

561
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,640
Hey!

562
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,640
We can't have a little mutt
run away on <i>boknal</i>!

563
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,810
Let him go. He's not getting away anyway.

564
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,560
Excuse me.

565
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,440
Please help. Please!

566
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,790
Sir, please save me.

567
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,550
Call the cops.

568
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,590
<i>A suspect involved in harming</i>
<i>innocent bystanders fled the scene.</i>

569
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,180
<i>The suspect on the run is Officer Yoon</i>
<i>of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency</i>

570
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,680
<i>who is under disciplinary review.</i>

571

572

<i>that is extremely addictive and fatal…</i>

573
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,750
Taxi!

574
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:55,960
Taxi!

575
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,130
<i>Myungjin Park entrance.</i>

576
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,090
<i>Trails left by the suspect have been found</i>
<i>at the Myungjin Park entrance.</i>

577
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,460
<i>Witness says the suspect was stabbed.</i>

578
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,680
<i>The suspect is likely drug-impaired</i>

579

00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,230
<i>Suspect was seen</i>
<i>fleeing to Eungcheon-dong.</i>

584
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,730
<i>Request backup from nearby patrol units.</i>

585
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,690
<i>Multiple vehicles collided</i>

586
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,280
POLICE PURSUE FUGITIVE OFFICER YOON

587
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,590
VICTORY GYM

588
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,380
Can we take a look at this intersection?

589
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,640
Where are you, Dung-ju?

590
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,200
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

591
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,080
Yes, Captain.

592
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,790
Sergeant Kim, are you up to speed?

593
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,580
I was just reading the article.
What happened?

594
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,540
We have to find Dong-ju
before the other officers do.

595
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,960
He's heading toward Eungcheon-dong
from Myungjin-dong. I'll check it out.

596
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,630
I'll head over there too.

597
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,470
A quiet exit would've been nice,
but he's making quite the ruckus.

598
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,730
If that's what he wants…

599
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,070
I'll turn up the noise for him.

600
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,210
Have you seen this man?

601
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,170
No.

602
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,510
What happened? Did you find Dong-ju?

603
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,050
Not yet.

604
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,720
By the way, Insung is in utter chaos.

605
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,100
I know that already!

606
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,480
I don't think you do. Min Ju-yeong
put a huge bounty on Dong-ju's head.

607
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,060
-Over here, boss.
-Hold on.

608
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,980
-Is his info solid?
-It is, boss.

609
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,860
We have to find him first.

610
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,990
Don't worry about a thing, boss.

611
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,570
We can't live like this forever.
We need to make it big.

612
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,700
All the gangs
and even the local street rats in Insung

613
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,370
are hunting down Dong-ju right now.

614
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,960
-Yes!
-Let's do this!

615
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
It's 100 million won!

616
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,710
-Let's kill him! 100 million won!
-By the way, that's a fine-looking dude.

617
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:46,670
YOON DONG-JU / 32 Y/O / 182 CM

618
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,920
The bastard's info is up.

619
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Hey, it's up!

620
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,100
Let's go get 100 million won!

621
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,560
I'll round up the guys!

622
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,440
Those damn street rats.

623
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,020
<i>I'm not sure</i>

624
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,070
if I can accept something like this.

625
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,700
Why? Do you think it's fake?

626
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,610
It's not that.

627
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,830
This has a strange power.

628
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,960
It's nothing special,
but when I put this on,

629
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,960
it feels like I've become
an important person.

630
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,290
I hold my head a little higher.

631
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,140
If I may ask,

632
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,770
is there something
you want me to do in return?

633
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,560
Don't do anything.

634
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,400
That's all I ask.

635
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,690
Don't do a single thing.

636
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,320
From Buk-dong to Myungjin-dong,

637
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,530
then Eungcheon-dong…

638
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,710
<i>The door is open.</i>

639
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
<i>The door is locked.</i>

640
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,540
Yoon Dong-ju.

641
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,250
Yoon Dong-ju!

642
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
Yoon Dong-ju!

643
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,010
Yoon Dong-ju.

644
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,840
Yoon Dong-ju.

645
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,850
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Wake up!

646
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,060
Yoon Dong-ju, get up.

647
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,980
Let's get you up. Come on.

648
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,440
Get up.

649
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,790
What are you doing?

650
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,000
Let go, or else he'll die.

651
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,920
Dong-ju.

652
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,750
Are you okay?

653
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,180
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay?

654
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,640
Take him to a hospital
and flush his system.

655
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,730
He won't last if he goes into shock again.

656
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,520
Come on. Let's go.

657
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,290
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

658
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,210
You found him? How is he?

659
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,380
Not good.
We need to get him to a hospital quickly.

660
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,010
Not Insung University Hospital.
They'll be all over the place.

661
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,970
-<i>Meet me in Seongjin City.</i>
-Okay. We'll be there in 20 minutes.

662
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,550
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay? Yoon Dong-ju!

663
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,010
Are you busy?

664
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,310
Hand that damned little mutt over!

665
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,060
Let go, you bastard!

666
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,690
Hey, what are you doing?

667
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,610
Get back here!

668
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,570
It's here.

669
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,740
Our food is here. Go get it.

670
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,490
Hurry up.

671
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,370
<i>Jjamppong </i>is the best on a rainy day.

672
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,140
What?

673
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,060
Hello.

674
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
What's going on? Why aren't you here yet?

675
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,460
Captain, I don't think
we can get out of Insung.

676
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,670
We were just attacked.

677
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,790
And Dong-ju is in bad condition.

678
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,880
What should we do then?

679
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,260
HANO GLASS

680
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,690
KIM JONG-HYEON

681
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,020
Damn it.

682
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,150
What is it?

683
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,120
So? Did you make a decision?

684
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,210
I told you to send it
through Secretary Kim.

685
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,630
Did you have to come bother me?

686
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,880
What happened to your car?

687
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,890
Isn't that…

688
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,350
Why did you bring that bastard here?

689
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,810
What are you playing at?

690
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,320
Help us.

691
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,150
We need a place to stay and a doctor.

692
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Damn it.

693
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,030
Did that bullet mess up your mind or what?

694
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,910
This is the Prosecutors' Office,
and I'm a prosecutor, you little shit.

695
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,750
Are you asking me
to help a criminal escape?

696
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,630
I signed the document

697
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,590
you gave me in the hospital.

698
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,060
I'll hand over all my shares to you.

699
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,310

701
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,650
Still causing trouble recklessly, huh?

702
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,830
How typical of you.

703
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,460
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

704
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,870
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

705
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,130
His internal injuries are pretty severe.

706
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,460
Don't you think
he needs a thorough examination?

707
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,680
He may have other issues
I might've missed,

708
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,930
so monitor him closely.

709
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,220
Okay.

710
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,360
I stopped the bleeding,

711
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,530
but it'll be a tough recovery for him
until the drug is completely flushed out.

712
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,110
You need to get him to a hospital
as soon as you can.

713
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,450
He's in critical condition.

714
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,700
All right.

715
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,460
Thank you. Good night.

716
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Thank you.

717
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,810
I know he's your brother,
but he did a number on us.

718
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,820
-Can we trust him?
-We can.

719
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,490
He never makes deals
where he stands to lose.

720
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,280
You have three days.
That's the best I can do.

721
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,540
Is this really worth
giving all that up though?

722
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,050
Dong-ju.

723
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,380
I'm here.

724
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,510
Look at me.

725
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,260
Dong-ju.

726
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,350
Please look at me.

727
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,100
Yoon Dong-ju.

728
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,300
You'll be okay.

729
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,680
Just hang in there.

730
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,680
You'll be okay.

731
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,650
You'll pull through.

732
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,070
It's…

733
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,980
It's okay.

734
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,820
It's okay.

735
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,080
I'm sorry.

736
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,040
This is all my fault.

737
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:37,380
I should've been with him,
but I left because of a stupid loan.

738
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,050
How is this your fault? That's enough.
Don't beat yourself up.

739
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,640
Does he have to be on the run like this?

740
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,180
He's hell-bent on killing Dong-ju.

741
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,140
He won't stop until he does.

742
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,440
This will only end
if we catch Min Ju-yeong.
