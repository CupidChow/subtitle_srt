1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Breath.

4
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,990
Tremors.

5
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,870
Wind.

6
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,410
You take everything into account…

7
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,790
and still,
the bullet strays off course sometimes.

8
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,760
There are days

9
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,550
that feel like a stray bullet.

10
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,890
Like today.

11
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,820
So is that it?

12
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,650
Is that what you want to do?

13
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,950
Do you want to give up now?

14
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,120
No.

15
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,710
I won't give up.

16
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,630
Why would I?

17
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,930
What good would that do?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,980
I think I've really lost my mind.

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
You should go inside.

20
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,750
I'll see you later.

21
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,010
Where are you going?

22
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,180
You said you had nowhere to go.

23
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,470
Stay here.

24
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,640
Just for the time being.

25
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,070
Yoon Dong-ju.

26
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm heading out first.

27
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,840
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
COMMUNITY DAY WITH THE POLICE

28
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,260
SHOOTING EXPERIENCE

29
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,190
All right, everyone.

30
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,150
CPR has a four-minute golden window.

31
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,990
I'll teach you about CPR today.

32
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,120
Check where your patient is,
quickly go to their side,

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,490
then lace your fingers like this.

34
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,990
We have to make sure no air escapes.

35
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,290
So open your mouth wide.

36
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,750
You can't do that. No fooling around.

37
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,050
This is an emergency. Don't fool around.

38
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,010
Everyone, you can't… Stop!

39
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,170
En garde.

40
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,300
Prêts?

41
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,590
Allez.

42
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,820
It's okay.

43
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,650
You couldn't let a child win?

44
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,990
I'm sorry, ma'am.

45
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,360
It's okay. Don't cry.

46
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,540
-It's a dog!
-Let's go.

47
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,440
How long does my team
have to keep this up?

48
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,270
I'd say until the commissioner softens up.

49
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,570
Goodness, they've still got it.
National team athletes are different, huh?

50
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
-One more time!
-One more time!

51
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
-Would you look at that?
-One more time!

52
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,370
-One more time!
-One more time!

53
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,540
What about Dong-ju?
What's going to happen to him?

54
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,550
I must be getting old.

55
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,380
I attended one event,
and now my whole body aches.

56
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,300
Drink this, sir.

57
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,850
So this is supposed to be good
for my joints, huh?

58
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,140
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Hey, this is good!

60
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,440
That feels great.

61
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,150
You could make a living giving massages.

62
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,490
Are you certified?

63
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,950
Yes, I have Level 1 certification
in sports massage.

64
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,700
Then you should've pursued that instead.

65
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,370
Why did you become a cop
and get into all sorts of trouble?

66
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm sorry, sir.

67
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,920
A former athlete should know better
than to throw punches so recklessly.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,130
You have to know when to use your fists

69
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,720
for them to have real significance.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,470
A former athlete should never be so rash.

71
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,470
You're a professional.

72
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,560
Am I right or not?

73
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,970
You're right, sir.

74
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,890
In any case,
I'll let this slide just once.

75
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,730
So do better, okay?

76
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,730
Yes, sir. I will.

77
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,900
All right. That's it.

78
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,070
That's the spot. Oh, dear.

79
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,780
Your muscles are really tight.

80
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,160
I'll loosen them up.

81
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,990
Goodness, Mayor Roh.

82
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,830
I'm sorry, Mayor Roh.

83
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,050
What are we doing here?

84
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,760
It's like we're using a sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

85
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,220
But we're still here, thanks to Dung-ju.

86
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,890
They say everything has its purpose.

87
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,140
-I'm proud of you. Come here.
-What's going on?

88
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,770
What are you doing? Stop being gross.
Get off me. It's hot.

89
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,650
Thanks for everything.
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

90
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,650
What's the matter with all of you?
Get away from me.

91
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,860
What did the commissioner say?

92
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,780
It's a one-month suspension
if I stay out of trouble.

93
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,910
It could've been worse.

94
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,660
That's a relief.

95
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,290
Good luck. You'll need it.

96
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,250
What do we do now?

97
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,960
We show them what we're made of.

98
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,470
Launching an investigation
into the mayor's connections

99
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,720
may not be feasible right now.

100
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,300
And it'll be difficult to get evidence
on Min Ju-yeong in one attempt.

101
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,510
We need to work our way up,
one step at a time.

102
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,060
For now, we can start with the drugs.

103
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,900
We might find some leads if we look into

104
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,610
Bbong-pil's drug precursor shipment route.

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,900
As always,
excellent input from Sergeant Kim.

106
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,440
Okay, let's do that.

107
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,450
And you stay behind the scenes
and support us.

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,780
Got it.

109
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,250
Wait a minute.

110
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,500
You should be exhausted right now,
but you look strangely good.

111
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,750
Your face is all glowy.
What did you do yesterday?

112
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
I did something you don't know about.

113
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,760
This guy probably doesn't know either.

114
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,490
So…

115
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,150
Let's keep our personal
and professional lives separate.

116
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,070
Don't make it obvious.

117
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I didn't.

118
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,450
You're being really obvious.

119
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,660
You are too.

120
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,290
What do you mean?

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,830
See? You're getting flustered.

122
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,380
I'm acting as I always have.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,460
When did I get flustered?

124
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,210
Just now.

125
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay. I won't make it obvious.

126
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,770
See you at home tonight.

127
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,440
You said I could stay with you
since I don't have a place to go.

128
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,870
I'll bring my stuff over.

129
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
Without being obvious.

130
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,480
One, two, three, four, five…

131
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,400
My poetry book.

132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Where did it go?

133
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,660
SKY, WIND, STARS, AND POEMS

134
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,580
What are you reading?

135
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,580
Poems.

136
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,340
How sweet. Why poems all of a sudden?

137
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,750
No reason. I just got interested.

138
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,470
So he likes stuff like this.

139
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,430
He's so sentimental.
It's giving me butterflies.

140
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,510
You've never had anyone
give you real butterflies, huh?

141
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,680
"Returning home in glory."

142
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,940
-What do you think?
-It sucks.

143
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,400
"Disgusting, uncomfortable,
nauseating, vile."

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,860
This is when I can use these words.

145
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,440
-Exactly.
-Goddamn.

146
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,200
I apologize for being late.

147
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,620
When will I get my Candy precursors?

148
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,710
It's taking a while.

149
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,750
And there's too much fake Candy out there.

150
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,340
This isn't what you promised me.

151
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,260
Isn't it a breach of contract?

152
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,970
Departure is in a week.

153
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,300
I need to load the goods before then.

154
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,060
The Japanese guys won't wait long.

155
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,270
I'll give you something else
before the goods come in.

156
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,140
A fancy appetizer of their liking.

157
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,020
Mr. Min, you need to get the goods moving
for us to do business.

158
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,280
The container has already
been cleared by customs.

159
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,320
The transportation is the issue,

160
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,450
so unfortunately, there's a delay.

161
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,960
The vehicles have been arranged,

162
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,750
but we're short on truck drivers.

163
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,210
We'll have them soon.

164
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,050
No idle dog should get to enjoy
the luxury of food and comfort.

165
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,340
Hey, come on.

166
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,340
It's okay. Take a seat.

167
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,050
By the way, Mr. Min.

168
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,350
Why are you leaving
that little mutt of a cop alone?

169
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,810
Why not just bury him?

170
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,150
It's cute when he tries to fight back.

171
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,570
And it's fun toying with him.

172
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,530
Where do I start looking for
Min Ju-yeong's drug precursor route?

173
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,580
Nothing's easy about this.

174
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,870
We first need to find the dealer
who supplied ephedrine to Park Bong-pil.

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,790
Tracking isn't an option
because they all use burner phones.

176
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,960
This is so tricky.

177
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,840
Captain.

178
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,170
Oh, my!

179
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,260
It's been so long.

180
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,680
All right, that's enough.

181
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,390
What brings you by?

182
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,100
What are you doing?

183
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,850
What do you mean?

184
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,310
-What do you want for lunch?
-Ginseng chicken soup?

185
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,940
You're on suspension, so why are you here?

186
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,530
-You should be resting at home.
-I came here to eat. Got a problem?

187
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,450
What is it? What do you need?

188
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,120
The shooting case at the bonded warehouse

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,660
was assigned to my unit.

190
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,750
This is the analysis of the blood
found at the scene.

191
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,630
BLOOD ANALYSIS REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

192
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,960
That guy right there. You know him, right?

193
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,970
CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD
NAME: LEE GWANG-SE

194
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,770
-The phone is turned off…
-Damn it. His phone is turned off.

195
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,100
Captain.

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,480
It seems he was kidnapped
in front of the hair salon.

197
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,650
His phone was last pinged there.

198
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,610
-Did something bad happen to him?
-Of course not.

199
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,860
The RIU is looking for him, so let's wait.

200
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,200
-Captain.
-Sergeant Kim, did you find anything?

201
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,290
It seems there was more ephedrine
that came through Insung Port.

202
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,580
More drug precursors?

203
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,840
Yes, according to
Park Bong-pil's testimony,

204
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,500
he was supposed to
get more goods from a smuggler.

205
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,130
Where are the rest of the precursors?

206
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,680
He only heard there was a delay
due to customs clearance procedures.

207
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,430
If it didn't clear customs…

208
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,560
It means it's still at Insung Port.

209
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,400
Regarding the goods I mentioned,

210
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,030
please handle them separately.

211
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,860
How did you get here?

212
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,660
But the thing is…

213
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Okay, I got it.

214
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,790
INSUNG CUSTOMS

215
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,010
Mr. Oh.

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,430
I'm moving everything today,
so get the vehicles ready.

217
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,270
But without permission
from the Korea Customs Service,

218
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,600
we can't seize it even if it's there.

219
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,690
They won't cooperate at all
without any hard evidence.

220
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,270
If this drags on,
Min Ju-yeong will take off with it.

221
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,070
We just need to find evidence
that it's there.

222
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,070
But how do we do that?

223
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,500
Why have you been scratching yourself?
I'm starting to itch now.

224
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,950
You should shower more often.

225
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,750
I shower twice a day!

226
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,040
Then what's the matter? Let me see.

227
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,550
What's this?

228
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,760
What's wrong with you?

229
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,510
I got bitten by some ants or something.

230
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,640
-Why is it getting worse?
-Ants?

231
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,470
I think I got bitten by ants
when we seized Bbong-pil's drugs.

232
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,060
Nice!

233
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,810
This is pollock, right?

234
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,270
-Damn it.
-What's the matter?

235
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,490
Were they red ants, by any chance?

236
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,990
And were the tail ends brown?

237
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,240
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,200
Ants aren't red. They're shiny and black.

239
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,200
Hold on a second.

240
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,290
I'm fine.

241
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,460
Really, I'm fine.

242
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,340
Look here.

243
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
We saw this while investigating
the port containers.

244
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,510
They found red fire ants
at Insung Port last year.

245
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,050
It led to a major pest control operation.
Check out the stinger.

246
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,300
That thing is huge.
Did you say red fire ant?

247
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,350
They're also called killer ants
because of the venom in their stingers.

248
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,560
Don't be ridiculous.

249
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,020
Killer ants?

250
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,690
It says you could die
if you get bitten by it.

251
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,860
Stop with all the talk about dying.

252
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,320
The red fire ants came in the cargo
that passed through Russia.

253
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,240
They came through the same route
as the seized drug precursors.

254
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,740
Do you have any symptoms
like vomiting or trouble breathing?

255
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,710
I have indigestion, but that's because
I have chronic gastritis.

256
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,710
"Loss of consciousness due to paralysis
or sudden low blood pressure."

257
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,920
You should go to the hospital
just in case.

258
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,880
-No, I'm fine.
-You could go into anaphylactic shock.

259
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,890
Look, it says you could die!

260
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,140
You little punk!

261
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,470
It sounds like you want me to die.

262
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,850
Nobody's dying. Who dies from ant bites?

263
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,060
It just itches.

264
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,900
Be quiet and get back to work.
Stop slacking off.

265
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,230
And you, Dong-ju.

266
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,900
You shouldn't joke about…

267
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,320
-Captain!
-Captain!

268
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,240
We'll monitor his condition
while he rests for a couple of hours.

269
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,990
Why did he collapse?

270
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,580
Was it because of red fire ants?

271
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,580
Yes. There are bite marks,

272
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,040
and based on the hives,
it seems that's the case.

273
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,420
But…

274
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,380
He also seems to have indigestion.

275
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,130
And he has severe constipation.

276
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,340
He has issues overall.

277
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,850
I knew you ate too much.

278
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,140
You scared us for no reason.

279
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,890
Doctor, am I going to die?

280
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,940
Yes, get some rest.

281
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,150
He said yes.

282
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,400
Thank you.

283
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
Sergeant Kim…

284
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,070
-Sergeant Kim…
-If there are red fire ants…

285
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,240
This is our chance.

286
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,240
What do we do now?

287
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,450
What else?

288
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,910
We're going to sucker-punch
that bastard Min Ju-yeong.

289
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,420
ON OFFICIAL DUTY
KDCA

290
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
The Korea Customs Service
and the Insung Port Authority

291
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,220
have announced that they will deploy
an emergency response team

292
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,590
to address the red fire ant infestation
at Insung Port's Dock 1.

293
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,510
Working together with the KDCA,

294
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,430
authorities are enforcing
access restrictions…

295
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,430
What's the next step?

296
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,350
The next step?

297
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,520
Just leave it to me.

298
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,150
You shouldn't get up right now.

299
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,610
-Captain!
-Jeez.

300
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,740
J9 SECURITY

301
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,700
What with the quarantine inspections,

302
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,530
my hands are tied
with all eyes on the port.

303
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,990
In fact, I tried everything I could,

304
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,500
but I'm afraid it's too difficult
for me to help this time.

305
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
I see.

306
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,550
It's too difficult, huh?

307
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,710
Yeah, this one's a bit too much.

308
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,430
Right.

309
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
It is, isn't it?

310
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,390
Yeah.

311
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,020
How's your daughter doing in school?

312
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,270
Oh, right.

313
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,980
They don't normally accept new students
during the semester.

314
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,980
It's all thanks to you
putting in a good word for her

315
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,360
that they accepted her.

316
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm truly grateful.

317
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,900
Don't mention it.

318
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,990
We're just helping each other out.

319
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,530
But isn't that country…

320
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,580
a bit dangerous?

321
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,920
The public safety there isn't great.

322
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,290
Korean students who study abroad there

323
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,750
often get kidnapped and held for ransom.

324
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,460
And if they're girls,

325
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,180
I hear they get trafficked
into the red-light district

326
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,050
so that their families
can't ever find them.

327
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,430
They also get injected
with strange substances.

328
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,180
No. Mr. Min, don't do this.

329
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,810
Not my daughter!

330
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm not saying
I'll do that to your daughter.

331
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,730
I was merely stating facts out of concern.

332
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,820
She should be careful.

333
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,320
-No, wait.
-It's a dangerous place, after all.

334
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,370
Wait! Hang on! Please, Mr. Min.

335
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,120
Ask me anything else, and I'll do it.
But the situation at the port…

336
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,330
There's just nothing I can do
about clearing the goods.

337
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,330
Please…

338
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,970
It seems your broken finger has healed.

339
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,230
It healed well.

340
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,030
Contact our guests
and ask them to meet with us.

341
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,410
And take him to the hospital.

342
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,910
Yes, sir.

343
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,540
INSUNG PEST CONTROL

344
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,290
-Come on, Man-sik.
-I'll make it up to you.

345
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,800
-I really can't.
-Make it happen, okay?

346
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,750
For goodness' sake.

347
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,760
Those are expensive,
so be careful putting them on.

348
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,550
I'm only doing this
because it's you, Man-sik.

349
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
If anything goes wrong…

350
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,970
I got it, you punk.

351
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,230
Guys, just go in and check
which container it's in. Understood?

352
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,230
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,350
By the way, when did you
build a connection like this?

354
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,690
Do you think
I spend all my time doing nothing?

355
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,030
Damn it, that's expensive.

356
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,490
I think it's smaller
than it's supposed to be.

357
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,820
Let's go.

358
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,910
We'll keep watch out here.

359
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,460
-How's it going?
-Let me do a quick check.

360
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,550
-How many people?
-Four, sir.

361
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,100
INSUNG PEST CONTROL

362
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,410
It's like a maze in there.

363
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,910
If you get lost,
you won't be able to find each other.

364
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,660
Identify the containers,
and I'll open them for you.

365
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,830
Go inside and start disinfecting!

366
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,870
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

367
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,440
-This one.
-Okay.

368
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I think it's this one.

369
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,470
Sir?

370
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,840
Yes, where are you?

371
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,340
Can you try opening this one?

372
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,310
Did you want me to open something for you?

373
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,560
Sir?

374
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,520
Sir?

375
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,070
Sir?

376
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,110
What the heck?

377
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,280
Sir, can you…

378
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,280
Hey, Steamed Bun.

379
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,620
Han-na, did you find something?

380
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,290
Where's the manager?
I think we should open that one.

381
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,920
Hey, why aren't you answering me?
Where are you going?

382
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,380
Where did the sneaky jerk go?

383
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,090
Damn it, I can't see anything.

384
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,260
Why are you walking so fast?

385
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,760
Steamed Bun!

386
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,680
Slow down.

387
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,930
I have to tell you…

388
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,270
Now isn't the time to tell you,
but I packed my stuff.

389
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,110
Let's go home together later, okay?

390
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,360
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

391
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,900
Where's the manager?

392
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,740
Why are you coming from there?

393
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,950
Who's this?

394
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,750
Who's this?

395
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,170
Who are you?

396
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,500
Get her!

397
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,550
Nice.

398
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,510
Damn it.

399
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,520
Hi there.

400
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,230
It's been a while.

401
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,650
I can't believe this.

402
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,740
I'm sorry, but can you take these off?

403
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,660
They hurt a lot.

404
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,240
Seeing how you showed up,
your guys must've left something behind.

405
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,910
My wrists really hurt.

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,210
Can you please remove these?

407
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,960
No.

408
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,170
You've been arrested
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

409
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,800
Did Min Ju-yeong put you up to this?

410
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,680
You're so mean.

411
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,350
Can you take a look at this?

412
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,270
I think I got bitten by something.

413
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,020
-Is it a red fire ant bite?
-It looks like you pinched yourself.

414
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,030
Me?

415
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,570
You'll get treated if it gets worse,

416
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,450
so just keep still until then.

417
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,610
You're in for a long interview
when we return to the agency.

418
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,990
We'll start with your name.

419
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,710
Those questions are boring.

420
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,130
Why don't you ask something else?

421
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,170
What?

422
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,720
For example, why do those two smell like
they use the same shampoo?

423
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,720
Is it lavender?

424
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,680
Stop talking nonsense.

425
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,810
How ridiculous.

426
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
Seriously?

427
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,030
What do you think you're doing? Get up.

428
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,330
Get up and pull it together.

429
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,870
Get up right now.

430
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,580
Jeez, she's really
putting on a show, isn't she?

431
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,960
Would you look at that?

432
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,750
She could be an actress.

433
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,590
Excuse me.

434
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,420
Hey.

435
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,050
Is she not faking it?

436
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,470
I think it's a seizure.

437
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,510
Hey, get up. Come on!

438
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,060
Hey!

439
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,060
We need to call an ambulance.

440
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,730
Is she breathing?

441
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,690
These damn bastards!

442
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Hey.

443
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,660
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

444
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,710
Hey, Steamed Bun.

445
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,800
I think I know

446
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,260
where the remaining ephedrine is.

447
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,640
Did you find it? Still no luck?

448
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,730
-Check the containers discreetly.
-Hold on.

449
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,560
It'll be a headache
if security catches you.

450
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,070
Hello? Why aren't you answering?

451
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,730
Sergeant Kim!

452
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,990
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ID
KIM JONG-HYEON

453
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,870
Hey.

454
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,750
Did you track where Drugmon went?

455
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,250
-I lost her.
-Damn it.

456
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,840
It's okay. Focus on these teddy bears.

457
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,130
The drugs are here.

458
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,600
-What's wrong?
-What?

459
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,150
I just…

460
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,650
Did you get bitten?

461
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,900
Did you?

462
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,570
This is bad. Doctor!

463
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,410
Doctor!

464
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,740
INSUNG PORT RED FIRE ANT QUARANTINE AREA

465
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,910
It seems you're allergic to the venom.

466
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,370
When did you get bitten?

467
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,170
I'm not sure. Maybe 20 minutes ago.

468
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,500
Your heart will start racing,
and you'll have trouble breathing soon.

469
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,470
But don't worry about it too much.

470
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,260
You don't look so good,
and you have a fever.

471
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,260
You just need a shot in the thigh.

472
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,010
-Just wait here.
-A shot?

473
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,890
-In the thigh?
-A shot in the thigh.

474
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,850
I think a prescription will do.

475
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,480
Getting a shot right now is more effective

476
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,150
-than a prescription.
-He's right.

477
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,940
Are you okay, Sergeant Kim?

478
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,820
He's clearly not okay.

479
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,240
Look at him sweating.

480
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,910
Hurry, Doctor.

481
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,490
Doctor, I…

482
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,240
I'll be okay without the shot.

483
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,330
What do you mean? It's not okay with me.

484
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,500
Keep your arm still.

485
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,920
Why are you scared of a shot?
You're acting like a kid.

486
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,290
Doctor, please wait.

487
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,170
-I'm really okay. I just need to rest.
-Sergeant Kim.

488
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,250
You're not okay.
You look as pale as a ghost.

489
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,050
You could go into anaphylactic shock.

490
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,800
One shot of epinephrine, and you're good.
So hang tight.

491
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,930
-Now's not the time to be stubborn.
-Wait a second.

492
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,930
Please wait! I…

493
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,850
-Wait, I just…
-I can't give him a shot in this state.

494
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,270
-All good, right?
-Right.

495
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,810
Jeez.

496
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,150
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

497
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,490
What do we do with that?

498
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,250
Thank you, sir.

499
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,060
Let's go!

500
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,150
What's this?

501
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,150
Don't act so shocked.

502
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,530
Is that really it?

503
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,830
I bought it on my way here.

504
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,710
What did Man-sik bring back this time?

505
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,800
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

506
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,380
We'll make do with soda tonight

507
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,220
since things will get busy
starting tomorrow.

508
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,430
Make sure to eat your fill here tonight.

509
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,140
It's on the commissioner.

510
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,560
Hey, RIU. Let's go.

511
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,900
Where are you going? Let's eat together.

512
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,360
Go ahead and eat up.
We're not jealous, we're just full.

513
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,570
We can't enjoy it without you.

514
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,650
Whatever, let's eat!

515
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,900
Let's eat!

516
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Han-na.

517
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,910
Try eating it like this. It's good.

518
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,750
It's good, right?

519
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,540
Yeah, it is.

520
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,710
This is good.

521
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,850
-Why do I still feel empty?
-You ate a lot.

522
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,350
-Thank you for dinner.
-See you tomorrow.

523
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,230
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Senior Officer Ji.

524
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,770
Where are you going, Dung-ju?

525
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,360
-What?
-Where are you going?

526
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,530
You don't have a place to stay.
My house is this way. Come on.

527
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,320
Of course, I have a place to stay.

528
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,490
Don't worry about me and go.
I can look after myself.

529
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,790
What is it?

530
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,130
-You can stay at my place.
-Why?

531
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,300
It's the least I can do
for someone who saved my life.

532
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,310
-Thanks for the meal.
-Good night.

533
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,360
The door is open.

534
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,500
The door is locked.

535
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,920
Just how many properties do you own?

536
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,050
Here.

537
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,020
You can use this room.

538
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,520
Room?

539
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,110
Don't you mean storage?

540
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,940
I don't have extra rooms,
and I don't like a messy living room.

541
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,200
Or do you want to sleep with me?

542
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,490
No way.

543
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,120
Same here.

544
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,370
I'll move the boxes next time.
Can't say when though.

545
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,800
I can't sneak out to Han-na's.

546
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,720
Has he caught on?

547
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,390
Whatever.

548
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,060
Be careful. The boxes might fall over.

549
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,980
Well, thanks for the heads-up.

550
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,160
It's Han-na.

551
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,870
What's all this?

552
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,250
She's so cute.

553
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,460
But why is he still holding on to these?

554
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,090
Once you break up, you need to move on.

555
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,010
He's still stuck in the past, huh?

556
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,840
Look at this cute heart pose.

557
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,390
I wonder if he has more.

558
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,980
Hey, I'll organize the stuff
that fell over.

559
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,870
FENCING SILVER MEDALIST KIM JONG-HYEON
RETIRES DUE TO INJURY

560
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,500
"Fencing silver medalist, Kim Jong-hyeon."

561
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,620
Pretty cool.

562
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,420
FENCER WITH BOWED HEAD, STILL A HERO TO US

563
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,880
"Still a hero to us."

564
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,010
Fine, I admit it. You're pretty cool.

565
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,470
LEFT EYE INJURY
ENDS KIM JONG-HYEON'S BID FOR GOLD

566
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,600
En garde.

567
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,850
Prêts?

568
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,150
Allez.

569
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,490
A counterattack point.

570
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,710
What the heck? He's losing.

571
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
So much for showing off.

572
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,590
Here, sit down.

573
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,010
Have some water.

574
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,760
My ankle hurts.

575
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,180
But you were fine yesterday.

576
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,030
Roger attacks.

577
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,740
Kim Jong-hyeon parries
and goes in for an attack.

578
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,660
He has to keep going.

579
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,080
He gets blocked but follows through.

580
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,250
Kim Jong-hyeon succeeds!

581
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,920
Kim Jong-hyeon scores a point!

582
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,710
What are you doing? Get up.

583
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,310
En garde.

584
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,980
Prêts?

585
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,270
Allez.

586
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,820
I punched his left side.

587
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,070
I should've punched his right side.

588
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,760
I'll be right back.

589
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,530
Where's the gym Dong-ju used to go to?

590
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,990
JI HO-CHEOL

591
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:02,470
HAN-NA
ANY LUCK FINDING DONG-JU?

592
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,140
DUNG-JU

593
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,860
Can I help you?

594
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,900
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

595
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,030
This dog's name is Dung-ju?

596
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,700
That's right. Dung-ju.

597
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,530
The lady police officer calls him that.

598
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,790
Goodbye, ma'am.

599
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,420
Come here, Dung-ju.

600
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,590
Dung-ju!

601
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
It's time to eat, Dung-ju.

602
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,450
What are you doing?

603
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,780
Oh, no. Looks like it'll scar.

604
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,500
Open wide.

605
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,960
It's all scraped up in here.

606
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,710
There's no way you'd be fine
after my punch.

607
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,290
What do you think you're doing?

608
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,420
I bought ointment. I'll put it on for you.

609
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,420
Cut it out. It doesn't hurt.

610
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,220
I said I'd put it on for you.
Come over here.

611
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,850
I said it doesn't hurt.

612
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,600
Even if it doesn't,
you need it to prevent scarring.

613
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,180
-Come here.
-What's wrong with you? Get lost!

614
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,100
What now? Come here.

615
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,640
Seriously, stop it.

616
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,350
Get away from me, Yoon Dong-ju.

617
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,060
-What's wrong with you?
-Come here.

618
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,030
Hey, are you okay?

619
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,620
-Indefensible par terre!
-Wait!

620
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,040
-Keep still.
-Wait!

621
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,950
"EPHEDRINE" HIDDEN IN TOYS

622
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Goddammit.

623
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,290
Looks like we won't get our goods.

624
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,550
Some of that belongs
to the Japanese, right?

625
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,050
If this is how we start out,
it won't go well for both of us.

626
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,340
May God help us.

627
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,010
Drugmon.

628
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
It won't do for you to catch a cold.

629
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,270
My black cat.

630
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,850
Meow.

631
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,690
Hey, do you have a fever?

632
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,610
Don't you dare.

633
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,860
Damn, you're so snappish.

634
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,030
-Meow.
-Meow.

635
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,110
Mr. Min, what are you going to do?

636
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,530
Once they take it
to the evidence storage tomorrow,

637
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,910
we'll never get our goods, will we?

638
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,460
Mr. Min?

639
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,130
We'll get it back.

640
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,380
It's ours, after all.

641
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,300
How?

642
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,050
If we know the route

643
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,340
and the departure time…

644
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,350
the answer is clear.

645
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,440
What was that?

646
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,580
I'm sorry, but can I please
use the bathroom?

647
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,080
Who are you?

648
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,500
My name is Lee Gwang-se.

649
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,230
Be quiet!

650
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,810
Mama?

651
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,110
I told you not to call when I'm working.

652
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,280
That's not what I meant.

653
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,360
I'm not killing people. I swear.

654
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,780
I'll call you back when I'm done. Got it.

655
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,120
I love you, Mama.

656
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,970
You received Mama's blessing.

657
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,060
Thank you, Mama.

658
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,110
Well, he received Mama's blessing.

659
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,240
Blessing, my ass.

660
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,530
Isn't this the dumb bastard
the cops are after?

661
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,080
He probably heard everything.

662
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,910
We can't let him live.

663
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,160
How much did you hear?

664
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,870
My hearing isn't good,
so I didn't hear a single thing.

665
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,880
That's a relief.

666
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,430
Why are you upsetting me?

667
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,430
You keep lying and making excuses.

668
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,270
This is why…

669
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,690
This is why…

670
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,860
I can't help but go insane.

671
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,980
I'm sorry, sir.

672
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,320
You bastard.

673
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,370
Hey!

674
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,510
When did he put these on my face?

675
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,310
Yes, Mayor Roh.

676
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,310
RELIABLE AND PROUD INSUNG POLICE

677
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,020
I GUARANTEE INSUNG CITY'S SAFETY

678
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,070
Yes, sir.

679
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,900
I'll make sure to do that.

680
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,410
Go straight to the evidence storage.

681
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,870
The riot police will control the traffic.

682
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,040
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,620
-One more thing.
-What are you looking at?

684
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,960
Fax the documents to the evidence storage,
Senior Officer Shin.

685
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,080
Yes, sir.

686
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,670
Be careful and come back safe.

687
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,260
The weather is beautiful today.

688
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,590
Drive safely!

689
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,220
Hello.

690
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:36,990
Hello?

691
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,910
Oh, jeez!

692
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,750
Why are you here?

693
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,660
I came to eat.

694
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,960
You're suspended. You don't get to eat.

695
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,330
This isn't a boarding house.

696
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,090
Let's just go for now.

697
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,380
Are we going out to eat? Really?

698
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,510
Are we going far? We can just eat
at the barbecue place nearby.

699
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,550
Barbecue, my ass. We're not going to eat.

700
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,600
Hurry up and get in.

701
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,060
Then where are we going?

702
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,890
Where are we going?

703
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,940
We found Gwang-se.

704
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,900
-Just rest.
-Thank you, Doctor.

705
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,610
What was that?

706
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,030
I said thank you!

707
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,950
Thank… Jeez, whatever.

708
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,340
What?

709
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,300
As I said, I wanted to live a quiet life,
but you dragged me into this mess.

710
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,130
Now look at me!

711
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,680
I just wanted to live quietly!

712
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,890
Instead, I got shot and stabbed!

713
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,560
Who gets shot in Korea?
Do you know how badly it hurts?

714
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,640
I'm the only one who got shot.
It's so unfair!

715
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:54,610
Who can I talk to about this injustice?

716
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,690
Blow your nose.

717
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,030
I'm sorry, okay? Just calm down.

718
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,700
Tell me the whole story. What happened?

719
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,490
What do you think happened?

720
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,240
I almost died twice.

721
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,290
Mr. Min, what are you going to do?

722
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,120
-We'll get it back.
-"We'll get it back."

723
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,290
It's ours, after all.

724
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,420
If we know the route
and the departure time,

725
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,800
the answer is clear.

726
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,470
So you're saying Min Ju-yeong
is going to steal the seized goods?

727
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,180
He already knew the date,
the time, and the route.

728
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,600
He has an effective inside man
within the agency.

729
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,690
You're not lying, are you?

730
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,690
How could you ask that?

731
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,150
Why would I lie for a man
who stabbed me in the leg?

732
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
I'm risking my life

733
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,120
by telling you this.

734
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,750
Is that a cat?

735
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,160
It's a tiger!

736
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,710
Did you check it out?

737
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,010
Because of the protest at City Hall,

738
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,670
the riot police sent a few guys
to Sergeant Kim and Senior Officer Ji,

739
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,630
and the rest are stationed at City Hall.

740
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,930
Who gave that order?

741
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,970
The commissioner.

742
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,930
It was his direct order?

743
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,980
POLICE

744
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,870
We'll have to leave
through the back door, sir.

745
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,040
-This way, sir.
-Okay.

746
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,910
Gosh, look at all those people. Let's go.

747
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,250
Han-na, is everything okay? Where are you?

748
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
We're entering the Jungdong Tunnel soon.

749
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,050
You good, Sergeant Kim?

750
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,930
Take a different route once you've
passed through the Jungdong Tunnel.

751
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,640
We have a leak within the agency.

752
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,560
-Yes, sir.
-We're on our way there right now.

753
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,480
-Be careful.
-Okay.

754
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,700
INSUNG'S LONGEST TUNNEL SECTION AHEAD

755
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,840
Dae-yong, did you meet with Gwang-se?

756
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,100
Is this some kind of joke?
What's going on?

757
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,350
I'm here, but he's not.

758
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,890
I'll see you back at the agency.

759
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,400
Running away?

760
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,490
Go ahead. I'll let you go.

761
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:52,830
Sorry?

762
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,910
And go tell those bastards

763
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,210
everything you heard.

764
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,590
Tell them every single word.

765
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,300
If you don't, I'll make sure
you can't use your other leg either.

766
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,230
Gwang-se, you punk.
You can run, but you can't hide.

767
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,530
Your call cannot be connected…

768
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,780
The call won't go through.

769
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,370
-Hey, Jae-hong.
-Captain.

770
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,500
I'm heading over with the RIU.
I'll call you when I get there.

771
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,580
Okay. Call the Jungdong Substation
and get all the manpower you can.

772
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,500
Yes, sir.

773
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,380
How much longer?

774
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,050
We'll be there soon.

775
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,050
Are we all set?

776
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,320
This guy won't be able to
call his mama either.

777
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,650
Step on it.

778
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,590
Let's begin.

779
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,540
Hold on a second.

780
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,040
What the heck?

781
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,370
Why is it blocked?

782
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,380
-Who are these punks?
-Damn it.

783
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,750
Are those assholes serious?

784
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,460
Let's go.

785
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,470
Who the hell are you guys?

786
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,180
Why bother asking? They're the bad guys.

787
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,020
Let me borrow this for a second.

788
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,060
What are you doing?

789
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:11,820
How many can you take on?

790
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,820
Let's see.

791
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,940
Three?

792
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,650
That's more than enough.

793
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,240
No, I mean two!

794
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Damn it.

795
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,880
Hey!

796
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,180
You bastard!

797
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,790
Captain!

798
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,130
Hey!

799
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,920
You're not going in blind!
Wait until Jae-hong arrives!

800
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,800
That's exactly why I'm going.
We don't know the situation.

801
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,220
Don't go!

802
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,600
Hey!

803
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,060
I said don't go!

804
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,520
They're getting up.

805
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,890
I told you I could only take on two!

806
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,890
Hey there, pal.

807
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,640
You're in Korea, so speak Korean!

808
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,560
Hey, RIU.

809
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,360
RIU…

810
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,250
Where are you going?

811
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,790
Did I surprise you?

812
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,090
What are you looking at?

813
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:17,980
Hey, you bastards!

814
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,320
You bastard.

815
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,820
There are days like that.

816
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,330
Breath.

817
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,840
Tremors.

818
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,090
Wind.

819
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,400
You take everything into account…

820
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,450
and still,
the bullet strays off course sometimes.

821
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,120
You son of a bitch.

822
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,250
I have to go, you bastard.

823
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,270
There are days…

824
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,110
that feel like…

825
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,030
a damn stray bullet.

826
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,490
Like today.

827
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:08,040
Those of us stepping into the ring
risk our lives just the same.

828
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,460
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

829
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,580
We have to keep looking.

830
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,460
Han-na will be there.

831
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,930
It's unlike you to be so calm.
I thought you'd be losing your shit.

832
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:26,760
I'm holding back.

833
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,770
I'll lose my shit…

834
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,850
Han-na.

835
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,230
…once I find her.

836
