What the hell were you doing?

70
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,784
Uh, sir, you should wash your hands.

71
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,832
So, how's the new project coming along?

72
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,583
Well, it's about bringing in new weapons,

73
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,128
so there's concern about the police
looking too aggressive

74
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,130
and it's pretty costly, so we'll have to--

75
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,465
-So?
-So…

76
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,554

that popped. Just the one.

Wow. You've been driving
that thing forever.

It's been over ten years, right?
Let me see.

99
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,536
Hey. If you're replacing the tire,
use a new one.

100
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,371
-Why put on a used one?
-That's all I can afford.

is killing me. [sighs]

103

what's left for you to enjoy anymore?

104

Tell you what. Replace all four with this.

105
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,176
What is this? You wouldn't offer
unless there's an angle.

106
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,512
Help out Dae-yong
in the Investigations Unit for a while.

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,472
He's dealing with a crazy case right now.

108

[chuckles] Golden Bunny?

109
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,643
You know the commissioner's
watching the case.

110
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,061
If you back him up the right way,

111
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,021
you'll at least get a few crumbs
in return.

112
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,148
That was actually my case.
You know that right?

113
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,358
Yeah it was.

114
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,777
Until you took money from the victim
for introducing them to a lawyer,

115
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,195
and got yourself suspended.

116
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,405
Just let Dae-yong handle it.
He'll wrap it up today.

117
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,784
Dae-yong's never gonna catch Golden Bunny.
That bastard's slippery as hell.

118
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,868
I told you, all right.

119
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,036
That whole operation stays airtight

120
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,830
until someone gets Silver Bunny
out of the picture.

121
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,374
Say stuff like that and we might
as well throw in the towel now.

122
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,000
Ah, shit. Whatever.

00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,423
There's a new recruit.
You're taking him on.

126
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,677
[grunts] New recruit?

127
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,388
[shopkeeper] Hmm, this is junk.

128
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,182
-What?
-Junk.

129
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,685
Now, this is some finely crafted junk.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,311
Think I'm running a dumpster? Huh?

131
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,366

-Mm-hmm.

I don't have all day.

Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,348
You're… [gasps] …that--

139
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,017
That little turd?

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,393
The gold medalist.

141
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,687
[imitates punches] Special recruit.
That guy.

142
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,315
Why are you dumping that little mutt
on me all of a sudden?

143
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,774
He's with the riot police in Seoul.

144
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,651
[chief] He got into some trouble.
Got demoted to officer,

145
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,738
-and he's reassigned here.
-Two, four, six, eight, ten…

146
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,489
Two, four… Come on, man.

147
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,744
[sighs] It's got a piece of meteorite.
It was worth so much more.

148
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,995
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

149
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,249
Broke two jaws, smashed three noses
and didn't even break a sweat.

150
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,792
Come on, they demoted him for that?

151
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,837
-It's messy work dealing with criminals.
-They weren't criminals.

152
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,883
Like you're some kind of saint? Asshole!

153
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,468
[Chief] They were his teammates.

154
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,012
Apparently, they took bribes
from some shady clubs.

155
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,681
Dong-ju found out what they were up to,
called them out,

156
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,642
and got pulled straight into that fight.

157
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,477
You're just crooks, shame on you.

158
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,647
And now, he's blacklisted.
Nobody wants him.

159
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,607
Okay, but what's that got to do with me?

160
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,858
Why do I have to take him on?

161
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,861
He's stuck covering his teammates'
hospital bills and compensation.

162
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,821
And they even seized his salary account.

163
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
Sir, I'd like to pre-order this.

164
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,620
Here's 450,000 won,
and I'll wire you the rest.

165
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,622
-Sure.
-When will it be delivered?

166
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,916
But why me? Why me, of all people?

167
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,709
Come on, don't you feel for the kid?
You're his senior.

168
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,753
A special recruit too.

169
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,255
You should be helping him.

170
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,258
You're the one who got him into boxing
and made him a cop.

171
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,884
He's your responsibility.

172
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,056
Besides, he's a good kid.

173
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,728
[officer] Good kid, my ass.

174
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,689
What am I supposed to do
with that piece of shit?

175
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,107
That piece of shit
could be your fertilizer.

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,650
No. He's just shit, okay?

177
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,734
I mean, look…

178
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,611
[chuckles] I used to have a nice,
high-bridged nose.

179
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,072
But one punch from him
gave me chronic sinus infections.

180
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,408
[snorting]
And I can't even breathe right, okay?

181
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,617
-So…
-[sighs] Look.

182
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,244
You've been a cop for 14 years now.

183
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,454
How long are you going to keep
getting kicked around like that?

184
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,206
You need to jump on stuff like this.

185
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,000
Get on the commissioner's good side.

186
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,044
Earn just a little mileage if you want
an economy seat to the Philippines.

187
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,504
If not, do what Dae-yong did.

188
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,881
Land a big case.
Get a business-class ticket.

189
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,800
Just hang in there.

190
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,595
The commissioner will set you up
with your own team in time.

191
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,557
-Hmm?
-[sighs]

192
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,684
Yeah, right.

193
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,360
[director] Cut!

194
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,737
Cut. Let's try it again.

195
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,364
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

196
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,117
Why can't she get it right
for crying out loud?

197
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,745
Miss Han-na! [groans]

198
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,831
You… Miss Han-na!

199
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,044
It's not that hard.
It's all about your stance and your eyes!

200
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,879
You need the determination in your eyes,

201
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,589
that says you'll never
let a criminal get away!

202
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,507
That's what we need here, all right?

203
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,343
Oh, for God's sake.

204
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,802
-Director Sim.
-Yes, sir.

205
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,764
Look, this is a serious problem!

206
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,849
We can't keep going like this. If we do…

207
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,601
This is really the last time, right?

208
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,937
[sighs] Finish this.
You just need to tough it out.

209
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,482
Take a few pictures with the commissioner,
and we're done.

210
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,649
You brought your medals, right?

211
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,859
[commissioner] All right, stand by!

212
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,403
Miss Han-na, again. Do it right.

213
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,531
Just give the rifle that intense glare.

214
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,658
Stare at it like it's your
only weapon in the world!

215
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,785
-You understand?
-Places!

216
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,620
[commissioner]
All right, let's go! Stand by!

217
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,373
-They should be starting soon.
-Yes, sir.

218
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,749
What's the operation called again?

219
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,459
Bunny Hunt, sir.

220
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,211
[sighs]

221
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,463
Catching Golden Bunny is an event.

222
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,257
We have to make sure the damn press
and city council

223
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,385
have nothing to complain about.

224
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,303
I want you to give them this headline.

225
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,889
"Insung's Crime Syndicate,
Golden Bunny Gang,

226
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,225
Completely Taken Down in a Single Sweep."

227
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,228
This is the largest operation
in Insung Police history,

228
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,105
with the biggest personnel deployment yet.

229
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,524
All divisions will report
to the Investigations Unit.

230
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,858
And I expect flawless coordination.

231
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,319
-Insung! Insung!
-Investigations Unit!

232
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,822
-All right. Catch the Bunny!
-And close the rabbit hole!

233
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,907
[officers] Investigations Unit, let's go!

234
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,534
-[clapping]
-All right.

235
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,785
INVESTIGATION SUPPORT TEAM

236
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,209
[team member 1]
Look who's born for the spotlight.

237
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,794
Right? She should've
just gone into showbiz.

238
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,421
What's the Shooting Fairy
doing playing cop?

239
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,965
[team member 1] Apparently,
being a cop was her lifelong dream.

240
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,466
But has she gained weight?

241
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,219
Officer Ji. If you're back,
you should report to me.

242
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,597
Oh, I was thinking we should get ready
to head out to the field soon.

243
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,474
-Ah.
-[snickering]

244
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,642
[superior] Actually,

245
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,311
I've got something else for you.

246
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,314
DRUNK DRIVER'S STATEMENT REPORT

247
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,650
[officer on radio]
Unit four-two do you copy, over?

248
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,902
I thought we were
backing up the operation.

249
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,655
-Why is our team handling this?
-Well, not everyone is handling it.

250
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,865
Just you, Officer Ji.

251
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,659
[chatter on radio]

252
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,785
[superior] Wow.

253
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,913
You're working harder
than the investigations unit.

254
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,542
Hmm. You really want to be out there
with them, don't you?

255
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,793
[sighs]

256
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,753
That's why I became a cop, isn't it?

257
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,590
[inhales sharply] Don't tell me you still
think you're getting transferred

258
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,134
to a field position
in the next promotion round?

259
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,053
Your request was already denied.
Commissioner's orders.

260
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,681
[chuckles]
You're more naive than I thought.

261
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,476
Why do you think you were hired
as a national athlete special recruit?

262
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,560
Isn't it obvious?

263
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,061
You didn't seriously think they hired you

264
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,439
so you can carry a gun
and take down criminals, did you?

265
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,523
This isn't some movie.

266
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,901
This is a personnel order.

267
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,360
It's actually someone you know.

268
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,653
He's transferring here.

269
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,739
Thought you might like that.

270
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,035
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

271
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,662
[officers chatter]

272
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,251
FOR APPROVAL

273
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,097
TO BE DEMOLISHED

274
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,307
[officer] Hey.

275
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,353
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

276
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,688
-Nice face. Mine used to look like that.
-Hmm?

277
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,565
Some champion.
Getting your ass kicked now?

278
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,067
What are these, pillow fists?

279
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,444
Well, if you're that worried about me,
take a shot and find out.

280
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,321
-[grunting]
-[chuckles]

281
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,283
How have you been? Still jumpy?
Thought you'd be tougher by now.

282
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,202
And you're still
a cheeky little shit, huh?

283
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,372
-Oh, you freaking idiot.
-What do you mean idiot?

284
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,416
What are you doing, are you undercover?

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,418
Broadcasting you're a cop, idiot.

286
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,503
[mumbling]

287
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,346
Come on. What a circus, huh?

288
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,015
Using drones to catch a damn Bunny.
What a joke.

289
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,064
He's supposed to be
the top gang boss around here, right?

290
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,566
Sounds like a big deal.

291
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,734
Big deal, my ass.
He's just a worthless punk.

292
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,572
-Hey. What are you doing? Hey.
-[grunts]

293
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,532
I've got to warm up
if I'm going to catch the bunny.

294
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,702
[sighs] We're far from the operation area.
Just keep civilians out.

295
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,330
We're just keeping civilians out.
It's already a damn mess out there.

296
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,623
Quit jumping around!

297
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,335
-[panting]
-Oh, uh…

298
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,713
-I gotta take a wiz.
-Now?

299
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,839
[officer] Bagboy on the move.

300
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,258
Hey, I'll be right back. One second.

301
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,682

-Suits, blouses…
-Hey, hey, there he is.

Dry cleaning!

00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,436
-[panting]
-[officer on radio] Hey, what was that?

315
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,188
What's going on? What happened?

316
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,356
[hisses]

317
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,316
-You, with the laundry!
-Get him! Come on!

318
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,569
Bagboy, stop right there!

319
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,322
You're done, shitbag!

320
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,823
Damn it. Hey!

-[siren wailing]
-Jesus!

322
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,577
Yo, Boss! Hey, Boss! Get out of there!

323
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,289
Where is he? Where's his boss?
Let's check this building!

324
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,875
We gotta catch Bagboy! Don't lose him.

325
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,169
Hey, hey, behind you! Damn it, hey!

326
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,506
That's Lee Sang-gon! Lee Sang-gon!

327
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,801
Get the Bunny first! Get him first!
Do not lose him!

-We've got a situation. Urgent, urgent.
-Goddamn Golden Bunny.

00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,764
-We have to get that guy.
-Spread out and search.

00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,600
Red top, blue pants.
Spread out and search, now!

331
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,408
Where is he? Let's fan out.

332
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,534
We need to move fast!

333
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,120
You check in there, I'll head up this way.
Move!

334
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,664
He's headed to Eungcheon 2nd Street.

335
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,416
2nd street? Eungcheon?

336
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,960
Dong-ju! This is Eungcheon 2nd street.

337
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,295

[mumbles] Dung-ju!

349
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,664

Where's he? [panting]

362
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,517
Where is he?

363
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,185
What happened?

364
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,479

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,487
Why didn't you radio us, huh?

368
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,822

-What?

369
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,200

-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

378
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,357
Jae-hong, I heard that maniac
was tearing through the school zone again.

379
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,317
Yeah. Uh, it looks like
the car's unregistered.

380
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,485
It didn't come up in the system.

381
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,946
We've really gotta catch him
before he causes any serious trouble.

382
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,031
How are we supposed to catch him
without backup?

383
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,783
That's true.
Hey, you wanna go for a cup of coffee?

384
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,202
-No, thanks. I'm good.
-Yeah? All right, then.

385
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,330
You're working so hard,
studying between shifts and all. Wow.

386
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm sure you'll get it this time.
Keep it up.

387
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,125
Thank you, sir.

390
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,216
Isn't it hard
for Jae-hong to get promoted?

391
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,177
They sent him here after he messed up
that Viper Gang case a few months back.

392
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,722
I heard he didn't pass
the promotion review that time either.

393
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,891
Well, if he keeps trying
it'll happen eventually.

394
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,309
You know how athletes are.

-[sighs]

396
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,896
But does discus even count
for special recruitment?

397
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,356
-That doesn't make much sense.
-Yeah, I know.

398
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,482
All right.

-I'm sorry, sir!
-I'm sorry, sir!

[commissioner]
You couldn't even catch one guy?

409
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,853
He got away right under your noses!

410
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,272
Goddamn idiots! Get out!

411
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,358

my guys went months chasing
this god damn bastard, all right?

416
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,204
And this was given to you
on a silver platter.

417
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,373
But you had to go and
flip the whole damn table!

418
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,047
Okay. Look, we're sorry for what happened.
But you're being a little harsh.

We're on the same team here.
It wasn't intentional--

We're on the same team now?
Don't make me laugh.

Don't act like you're one of us.

422
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,596

And don't talk to me like we're friends,
okay?

But whatever the job is,
he's at it all day.

518
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,425
He barely comes home. [sighs]

519
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,345
Go on, eat. [chuckles]

520
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,181
Ah, look at you eating like a champ.

521
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,016
[chuckles] I'll get you some more.

522
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,226
-Thanks.
-[chuckles]

523
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,423
[sentimental music playing]

524
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,701
[chuckles]

525
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,956
THE 3RD INSUNG MAYOR'S CUP
BOXING TITLE MATCH

526
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,666
[chuckles]

527
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,933
Have you found a place to stay?

528
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,144
If you haven't, you can stay here
and save yourself some money.

529
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,855
I found a place.
Don't worry, it's all good.

530
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,858
Yeah? That was quick.

531
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,277
Come on, that's enough for tonight.

532
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,781
-I should get going now.
-You're leaving?

533
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,325
Yeah, I should get started on unpacking.

534
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,994
Okay. Let's call it a night.

535
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,624
Thank you so much for dinner.

536
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,959
Oh, please. Don't mention it.

537
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,797
Good night. [chuckles]

538
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,757
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

539
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,513
Whoa, are you people serious?

540
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:51,100
If it's on the ground, you pick it up.
How can you just walk past it, huh?

541
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,726
Wow, that's so messed up.

542
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,312
Man, there's a scratch.

543
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,940
Shoot, they're so heartless.
I can't believe them.

544
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,527
[gasps] Oh, man! Look at this.

545
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,405
[sighs] Come on.

546
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,535
[chuckles]

547
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,790
ON-CALL ROOM

548
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,764
SKY, WIND, STARS, AND POEMS

549
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,287
Gyeong-il, why aren't you answering
your phone?

550
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,663
I'm here in Insung.

551
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,123
Call me when you get this.

552
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,461
HAD DINNER YET? DON'T SKIP MEALS
CHECK OUT THE PACKAGE I SENT YOU

553
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,046
-I WILL
-DON'T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDS

554
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,715
BANG

555
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,028
BOXER YOON LOSES
IN TODAY'S SÃO PAULO QUALIFIER

556
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,863
NEXT WEEK'S FINAL QUALIFIER
IS HIS LAST CHANCE

557
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,650
BANG

558
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:19,790
[sighs]

559
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,461
What is he doing here, though?

560
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,180
Is there still something going on
between them?

561
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,286
[scoffs]

562
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,081
-Do you still like me?
-Mm-hmm.

563
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,083
Why, am I not allowed?

564
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,548
He's so obvious.

565
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:18,849
I'm not late, am I? [breathing heavily]

566
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,100
Come on.

567
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,520
You're the one who told me
not to show up late, big hypocrite.

568
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,898
Listen.
Watch what you say in there, all right?

569
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,108
They'll want to know
if we followed orders.

570
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,277
No. Don't. Just-Just don't say anything.

571
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,155
If you open your mouth,
they'll just hit us with more punishment.

572
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,490
You keep your mouth shut.

573
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,283
Don't talk.
I'd sew your mouth shut if I could--

574
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,786
-Just dress properly, all right?
-[choking]

575
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,002
Oh, for God's sake.

576
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,007
-This is the room.
-Oh, this room here?

577
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,178
Hello?

578
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,807
Hello?

579
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,811
-Excuse me.
-[exclaims]

580
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,562
Shit!

581
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,147
-What'd you do that for?
-What did I do?

582
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,732
-You knocked it down.
-Come on.

583
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,068
-You kicked the door and it dropped.
-A single kick would make it drop?

584
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,821
-You hit it, and it dropped on the floor.
-You're taller than me, just--

585
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:15,948
-Hey, did you see him?
-[gasps]

586
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,908
Oh, I'm a big fan.
Think we should ask for an autograph?

587
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,744
Oh, hello sir. How are you?

588
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:21,912
-[chuckles]
-Hello, sir.

589
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:26,124
-Hello, Sergeant Kim.
-Hello, Sergeant Kim.

590
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,127
I'm a big fan of yours.
Could I get your autograph please?

591
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,629
Uh, my autograph?

592
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,965
-Is he some kind of celebrity now?
-How about a picture instead?

593
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,716
[cackles]

594
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,801
Wait. Oh, my god!

595
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,178
-You thought they were talking about you?
-Hey. What?

596
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,596
What's he got that I don't?

597
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,139
Height? Looks? A better jawline?

598
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,600
Besides, he got a silver medal.
And I won gold, man.

599
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,602
-Come on, get real.
-Good for you.

600
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,438
-You won gold and ended up like this.
-Like what?

601
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:49,690
-What're you talking about?
-You punk.

602
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,316
[officer] Thank you. [giggles]

603
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,029
Hello. Lieutenant Go Man-sik, right?

604
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,990
-I'm Kim Jong-hyeon.
-Oh, hi! How are you?

605
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,492
-I've heard so much about you, actually.
-[scoffs] Yeah, right.

606
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,952
-You've never heard of him.
-Quiet.

607
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,541
So, what brings you here, Kim Jong-hyeon?

608
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,626
-Are you in trouble too?
-No, I'm not.

609
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,086
This is my office, sir.

610
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,423
Ah. You mean this one?

611
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,174
Yes, Audits and Inspections.

612
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,551
I was assigned here today.

613
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm in charge of your investigation.

614
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,558
Ah, Audits and Inspections. [chuckles]

615
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,935
[stammering] So, you're in charge
of our investigation?

616
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,563
Yeah,
sorry if you've been waiting a while.

617
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,398
The meeting with the commissioner
ran a little long.

618
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,109
Yeah, you should be sorry.
You made us wait.

619
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,069
He's a busy man. It happens.

620
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,448
Uh, excuse me.

621
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,660
Uh.

622
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,704
Uh.

623
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,130
[groans]

624
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,925
If he takes money off my pay, I'm screwed.

625
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,927
[sighs]
Shit, I'm about to lose my damn mind.

626
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,762
No. He'll let it slide I guess, right?

627
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,138
I got seniority over him, yeah?

628
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,556
What are you talking about?

629
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,975
He's supposed to handle this
fair and square.

630
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,519
You're a cop. How can you rely on
connections, man?

631
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,942
Look at how much food you're eating.

632
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,611
I mean, buffet's empty now.
Anything left for the rest of us?

633
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,447
Can't catch Golden Bunny
on an empty stomach.

634
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,158
[scoffs] Golden Bunny?
You kidding me right now?

635
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,577
-Hey, let me see.
-Hmm?

636
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,746
You've got nothing left
but water weight, man.

637
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,665
No muscle. Just zip your damn sweater.

638
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,751
You don't work out.
You don't watch your weight.

639
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,252
No wonder you get beat up, champ.

640
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,255
You can't even stay on your feet.
You're not catching any criminals.

641
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,340
No, that was…

642
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,885
Never mind. [sighs]

643
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,306
Well. If you were so eager,
why didn't you catch him?

644
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,434
-Weren't you too busy taking a leak?
-What, you never have to pee?

645
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,439
[chuckles]

646
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,740
Whoa, he's so cool.

647
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,743
He's the most successful one
of all the national athlete recruits,

648
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,036
unlike someone.

649
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,038
Ha! One gets sent here
on a special promotion,

650
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,581
the other on a demotion.

651
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,750
Wait, are they back together?

652
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,379
-How the heck should I know?
-I wasn't asking you.

653
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:21,508
Wonder why they broke up.
They looked so good together.

654
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,344
Didn't they?

655
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:25,846
No, they didn't.

656
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,560
Geez, how can you still have an appetite?

657
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,653
You've got food all over your chin, man.

658
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,281
[plates clattering]

659
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,577
[tense music playing]

660
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,246
That's Captain Oh from Seobu.
What's going on?

661
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,541
[Captain Oh]
Damn, the food here tastes like shit.

662
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,543
You screwed up people's careers,

663
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,046
and you're just gonna act
like nothing happened?

664
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:02,132
Two of my guys got suspended
because of your report.

665
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,136
Oh, look. Another one you screwed over.

666
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,263
[scats]

667
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,433
He's never getting promoted now,
because of you.

668
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,768
You happy?

669
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,686
Bet you are.

670
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,065
You sold out your colleagues and
got sent up here on a special promotion.

671
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,151
-I was just doing my job, all right?
-Your job?

672
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,445
Hey. If they brought you in
for your swordplay,

673
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,489
then go take down some goddamn criminals.

674
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,533
You think your job is stabbing
your own teammates in the back?

675
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,995
What, too scared to fight
without your face mask and foil?

676
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,538
You've never even been out in the field,

677
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:36,625
and you've got the nerve to mouth off
and drag people down?

678
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,126
Why would someone
who knows the field so well

679
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,336
-take bribes?
-You jerk!

680
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,505
Isn't that what dishonors
your fellow officers?

681
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,562
Look, you'd better watch yourself.

682
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,064
I'm saying this for your sake.

683
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,361
Continue like this,
you might get bit by a snake.

684
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,740
Shit, I couldn't hear 'em.

685
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,659
[sighs]

686
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:16,957

00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,558
-You shouldn't drink and drive!
-I didn't drink.

863
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,477
Just take the ride
while I'm still offering…

864
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,687
-Where's my car?
-No, I'll just grab a cab.

865
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:08,357
-Jesus, just give me the keys. Come on.
-They're still in the ignition.

866
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,610
-Where's the car?
-Somewhere in the parking lot.

867
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,863
-Where?
-Well, I guess somewhere out back.

868
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,281
[sighs]

869
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,451
What? I don't see it though.

870
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,912
-Yes, it's over there!
-Over where?

871
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,288
Is there a second floor or what?

872
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,458
-I'm sorry! [panting]
-Hey, Dung-ju, where's my car?

873
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,626
Dong-ju?

874
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,086
[grunts]

875
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,589
Dong-ju.

876
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,093
Yoon Dong-ju!

877
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,186
You little shit!

878
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,441
[whimpers]

879
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:54,278
[shutter clicks]

880
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,658
Damn.

881
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,701
[groans]

882
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,954
[sighs deeply]

883
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,664
-Crazy. Huh?
-[phone buzzes]

884
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,167
GYEONG-IL'S MOTHER

885
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,044
Oh, hey, Ms. Jeong.

886
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,424
Gyeong-il still hasn't come home?

887
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,054
[stammers] Yeah, I'll check it out.

888
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,347
Don't worry, Ms. Jeong.

889
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:26,060
Where'd he go? He never called me back.

890
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,563
[line ringing]

891
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,531
[Dong-ju] Where's Gyeong-il? Is he out?

892
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,534
Coach Oh got him a job at some
security company or something.

893
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,411
It's been about two weeks.

894
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,003
FROM CEO OH JONG-GU

895
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,215
LOCATION: CONVENTION HALL

[host] Please welcome the host

897
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:02,555
Former national boxing coach, ex-secretary
of the Korean Sports Committee,

898
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,683
and top contender
for the International Sports Committee.

899
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:09,353

Big round of applause!

900
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:13,024
-[audience applauding]
-[anthemic music playing]

901
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,862
PROUD OF YOU
WHO HAVE BROUGHT GLORY TO KOREA

902
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,363
Yes, thank you.

903
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,867
Enjoy your evening.
Enjoy dinner. [chuckles]

904
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:28,539
Welcome. Oh, I'd love a drink.
Great, cheers. [chuckles]

905
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:29,665
All right.

906
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,063
Huh?

907
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,023
What's that clown doing here?

908
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,068
[scoffs] Jesus.

909
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,703
Long time no see. I didn't know
you got the invitation too.

910
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,289
[scoffs] I guess my guys screwed up.

911
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:11,540
[chuckles]

912
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:15,503
-So, how's that cop life of yours?
-Don't bother with the small talk.

913
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,005
-Not really your style.
-[scoffs]

914
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,132
Where's Gyeong-il?

915
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,759
Gyeong-il?

916
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,179
[inhales deeply]
Why are you asking me about him?

917
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:29,558
-[sighs] You gave him a job, didn't you?
-[chuckles] That little shit.

918
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,687
Yeah, I tossed him some work
'cause he looked pathetic,

919
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,273
but he took the advance and vanished.
He won't even return my calls.

920
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,526
That useless junkie.

921
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,320
He's probably doped up
and passed out somewhere again.

922
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,531
Watch how you talk about him.

923
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:47,034
You know damn well who did that to him.

924
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,870
You think it's a crime
to give a guy in pain some pills?

925
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,039
Let me ask you this.

926
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:56,168
Who made him need those pills
in the first place?

927
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:57,420
That was you.

928
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,673
You beat him down and left him crippled.

929
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,175
Then you became a cop
to pay his hospital bills.

930
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,594
Man, you're so full of shit, aren't ya?

931
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,516
Gyeong-Il… [sighs]

932
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,270
-Where's he now?
-[groans]

933
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,692
Come on, kid. Ah, you couldn't even bother

934
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,446
to throw on a decent suit
for something like this?

935
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,114
This is… Ugh.

936
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,908
It's just embarrassing. Jesus Christ…

937
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,245
It's been ages since you were
on the national team,

938
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,913
and this is what you wear?

939
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,249
[groans, sighs]
Aren't you embarrassed at all?

940
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,793
Why should I be embarrassed? About what?

941
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:39,795
You know what's wild?
This actually matters.

942
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,464
You never even got to put one on.

943
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:42,965
Ah.

944
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:46,510
Dung-ju, my boy.
You haven't changed a bit.

945
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:48,512
Look, come on,

946
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,682
you really think you deserve to wear this?

947
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,729
Hey, we've already got the investment.
You can't back out now.

948
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,231
-[phone buzzing]
-See? They won't stop calling me.

949
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:02,318
I'm not interested.
How many times do I have to say it?

950
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,196
-[sighs]
-I'm here to give it my all and win gold…

951
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,532
-then I retire.
-Dong-ju, come on.

952
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:11,827
With your skills… MMA, is it?
You'll be swimming in cash.

953
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,371
A gold medal pension?
That's chump change, man.

954
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:15,623
You can't live off that.

955
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,960
It won't even cover, you know,
Gyeong-il's hospital bills.

956
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,468
I'll figure something out.

957
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,053
Just scrap the contract, all right?

958
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,807
[sighs]

959
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,482
Gyeong-il, Ms. Jeong!

960
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,983
Are you watching now?

961
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:46,487
I did it. I won the gold medal! [chuckles]

962
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,531
Man. See?

963
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,326
I told you I'd bring one home now,
didn't I? [chuckles]

964
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,328
[sighs]

965
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,331
You can count on me now.

966
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,750
From now on,
I've got it all under control.

967
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,378
[chuckles] See you soon.

968
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,213
Let's have some beef tonight, yeah?

969
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,506
You injured your right hand.

970
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,966
-Is it okay now?
-Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

971
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,927
There are rumors you're moving
to MMA. Is that true?

972
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,641
Oh, nothing's been decided yet.

973
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,018
-How does it feel to win the gold medal?
-[phone buzzing]

974
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,229
It hasn't fully sunk in yet, but…

975
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:21,647
-Hello?
-…I think I was able to win,

976
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,567
thanks to all the love and support
from everyone. So, thanks to you all.

977
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,527
Do you feel the fame
now that you've won gold--

978
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,070
That's it for today's interview.

979
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:29,238
-Thank you!
-[reporters clamoring]

980
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,531
Come on. Let's go.

981
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,827
[clamoring continues]

982
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,707
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

983
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,835
Thanks.

I guess you're proud
of that medal you won, all doped up.

996
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,973
[guests murmuring]

997
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,767
It was a prescribed painkiller.

998
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,311
You know better than anyone
I won that all on skill.

999
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,271
Why does that matter?

1000
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,107
What matters is what people remember.

1001
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,526
Is that why you spent two years
on that lawsuit?

1002
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,362
Just to get that one thing cleared?

1003
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,197
Come on. [inhales sharply]

1004
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,491
Why would you do that?

1005
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:59,620
You could've used that money
to buy yourself a decent suit instead.

1006
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,414
You may have won that case,
but it didn't make headlines.

1007
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:03,666
No one talked about it.

1008
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,210
Man, seriously. [scoffs]

1009
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,047

1010
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,759
Oh, you idiot. You big idiot. [chuckles]

1011
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,637
From where I stand,

1012
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:20,266
this means more than a number on a check.

1013
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,394
Way more.

1014
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,235

I gotta go.

So soon?

1024
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:17,031
I wouldn't be here if the sport
committee chairman hadn't asked.

1025

About what?

1033
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,533
What, you think I didn't earn it,
is that it?

1034
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,619
-Did you earn it?
-Of course I did!

1035
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,787
Then prove it, Dong-ju.

1036
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:06,955
Don't take it out on the wrong thing.

You really think you deserve to wear this?

Don't act like you're one of us.

1045
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,653

Don't take it out on the wrong thing.

I'll show you exactly what I'm made of.

a bunch of times.

[clears throat] Look,
I checked with Customs, all right?

1067
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:43,385
The car wasn't officially imported,
and the plate's not in the system.

1068
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,679
And none of the cameras
caught anything helpful.

1069
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:48,765
And so?

1070
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,350
[officer] It's a smuggled car
with fake plates.

1071
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:53,020
That makes it almost impossible
to track down.

-[phone buzzing]

1202
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,818
TURD DUNG-JU

1203
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,112
What's up?

1204
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,865
[stutters] What? Slow down.

1205
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,868
What did you say?
What the hell are you talking about?

1206
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:48,495
I think I've got a shot at him!

1207
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,121
The hit-and-run guy, you know.

1208
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:52,207
I just got a call from someone
who says he knows him,

1209
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,793
so I'm heading right there now.
28 Beonji Street, Gihyeon-dong.

1210
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,878
Do you even know who this guy is
who called you?

1211
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,381
I have no idea! Relax.
When I get there, I'll figure it out.

1212
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,841
That's gotta be a prank call!
You've got to be kidding.

1213
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,886
Call it a prank if you want,
but he said too much to ignore.

1214
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,847
If I lean on him hard enough,
he might crack and give us a lead.

1215
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,684
Knock it off.
You're not making any sense right now.

1216
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,143
-Do you know where--
-[engine revving]

1217
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:13,561
Hello? What's that sound?

1218
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:14,938
Where are you at?

1219
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,565
Oh, shit. Did you take my bike?

1220
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,651
Come on, just get there now!
28 Beonji Street!

1221
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,319
-I'll see you there!
-You little shit.

1222
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:22,612
Who are you to boss me around?

1223
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:24,447
Bring my… He hung up.

1224
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,661
[grunting]

1225
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,371
-Sir.
-Huh? [sighs]

1226
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,415
-There you are. [panting]
-Hey.

1227
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:36,751
-I have something to ask you.
-Sure, sure. What is it?

1228
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,421
Come on. Come here.

1229
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:44,926
Uh, was there anything that seemed off
during the Bunny Hunt operation?

1230
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,011
-Off? Why?
-Yeah.

1231
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,429
Wh-What's going on?

1232
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:51,599
Turns out the fire during the operation
was actually arson.

1233
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,146
And someone called 911,
five minutes just before it broke out.

1234
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,814
No caller ID.

1235
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,568
Wait, that means our plan
for the operation leaked.

1236
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,279
-From the inside.
-Probably.

1237
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,574
The Investigations Unit is handling
the Golden Bunny case now,

1238
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,034
but it used to be yours, right?

1239
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,329
-That's right.
-Then, does Lee Jin-su ring a bell?

1240
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:15,373
He's the one who reported
Golden Bunny's smuggling.

1241
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:16,708
Lee Jin-su.

1242
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:19,878
-The guy from Customs?
-Yeah, do you know him?

1243
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:22,756
Not personally, but actually he was…

1244
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,925
in a hit-and-run yesterday,
and I just heard he passed.

1245
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,720
-[sighs]
-He's the one who reported it, huh?

1246
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,932
-Why, what's wrong?
-Um, something feels off.

1247
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,351
I gotta go. I'll keep you posted.

1248
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:38,646
Little shit!

1249
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,945
[line ringing]

1250
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,991

[operator] Investigation Support Team.

1252
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,329
Hi, Sergeant Kim
from the Inspection Office.

1253
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,707
Uh, I need to check the belongings
of a hit-and-run victim, Lee Jin-su.

1254
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,543
Off work?

1255
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,962
What's the name of that officer?

1256
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:35,620

Dung-ju, Dung-ju,
that freaking little turd!

1260
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,555
Why the hell isn't he picking up?

01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,016

PAWNSHOP

1264
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:01,729
[sighs] I'll call you back later.
I can't talk right now.

1265
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,190
You told me to call
when Silver Bunny made a move.

1266
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:05,984
-Did he?
-I'm not sure what he's up to,

1267
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,069
but he's gathering his boys
and heading out for a job.

1268
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,154
Where are they going?

1269
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:12,282
You know, the paint factory
in Gihyeon-dong. The address is…

1270
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,408
[Dong-ju] 28 Beonji Street!

1271
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:16,452
-28 Beonji Street.
-Damn, you already know.

1272
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,391
3 MISSED CALLS FROM JONG-HYEON

[doorbell chimes]

1274
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:52,655
Who is it?

1275
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,366
Hi, good evening.
I'm from the Customs Service.

1276
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,619
Are you Officer Ji Han-na?

1277
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,412
You said you're from the Customs Service?

1278
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,538
Uh, yeah.

1279
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,999
I heard that you had
some customs documents

1280
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,751
that belonged to Mr. Lee Jin-su.

1281
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,629
I was asked to come by
and pick them up from you.

1282
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,090
I'm really sorry
to drop in on you so late.

1283
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,842
Hope it's not too much trouble.

1284
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:14,969
All right.

1285
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,640
[phone buzzes]

1286
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,893

1290
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,317
Open the door now!

1291
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,194
-Open it or I'll kill you!
-[Jong-hyeon] Han-na. Ji Han-na!

1293
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,380
Where the fuck did she go?

1294
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:54,842
-Find the papers first.
-[thug] Got it.

28 GIHYEON-DONG

1296
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:12,527
[Dong-ju] Hello?

-Yeah!

1300
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,438
-Dae-yong. I need a favor.
-No.

1301
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,815
-Just hear me out. Dae-yong!
-No! I said no!

1302
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,192
[sighs] I don't have time
for this right now.

1303
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,653
-Just hear me out before you--
-You've got nerve asking for a favor

1304
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:57,697
after stealing my file.
Thought I wouldn't notice, huh?

1305
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,951
Right. I'm… I'm sorry about that.
I really am.

1306
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:04,078
But you… you're the only unit available.

1307
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,332
Please, I'm asking you.
Dong-ju is in serious danger right now!

1308
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:09,417
-All right.
-[chuckles] Thanks a lot!

1309
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,880
-Beat me and I'll think about it.
-What? [screaming]

1310
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,761
[thug] Did you find it?

1311
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,847
Damn it. Damn it. I don't see it anywhere!

1312
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:30,772

1313
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:36,444
[Han-na] Five.

01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:44,994
Three.

01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,942
-Shit.
-Wow, nice driving.

1323
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,402
You all right?

1324
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:20,071
Well, well, well, Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon!

1325
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,365
Evening, sir.

1326
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:25,118
Continue like this,
you might get bit by a snake.

1327

-[chuckling]
-[cackling]

1328

-Wow.

[gangsters clamoring]

1330
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,758
What the… [panting]

1331
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:46,848

-Hey! Come back!

01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,690
Hey! Get the fuck outta the car!

1335
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,988
Oh, he didn't run.

1336
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:05,366
I thought you'd be long gone.

1337
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,243
Glad you're still here.

1338
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,664
[Sang-gon] Someone asked me
to take care of you before I go.

1339
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,585
Look, why would you go
and give me extra work?

1340
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:21,090
Is that someone this jackass?

1341
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,969
-Is he the one?
-Wow. [chuckles]

1342
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,138
-You must be Silver Bunny.
-[sucks teeth]

1343
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,640
You really get a kick
out of your teeth, huh? [clicks tongue]

1344
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,476
Tell me now.

1345
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:33,478
Who'd you dump your car on?

1346
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:35,646
Who'd you dump the car on?

1347
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,859
-[chuckles]
-Those get on my nerves.

1348
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,154
Flash them at me again,
and I swear to you I will knock them out.

[gibbering]

1351
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,454
I won't ask you again.

1352
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:55,958
-Who is it?
-[groans]

1353
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,503
-He's just as dumb as he looks, huh?
-[Silver Bunny] Damn right.

1354
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,005
[chuckles] Look at me…

1355
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,299
You think I'm just gonna
roll over and talk?

1356
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,261
Damn, he's so dumb.

1357
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:08,721
-[tape unrolls]
-[chuckles]

1358
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,390
Do you know why my name is Yoon Dong-ju?

1359
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:16,229
"Wishing to live without a speck
of shame when I look up at the sky,

1360
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,982
even the wind passing
through the leaves made me ache."

1361
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,779
My mom wanted me to live like
Yoon Dong-ju, you know, the poet.

1362
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,323
She hoped I'd never do anything wrong.

1363
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:31,577
That's the reason she gave me his name.

1364
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,164
Figures none of you thought
to check the sky.

1365
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,793
Have some shame, goddamn sons of bitches.

1366
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,796
Okay guys, let's teach him a lesson.
