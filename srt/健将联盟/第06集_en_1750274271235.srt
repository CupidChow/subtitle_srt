1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Can you see clearly?

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,200
Yes, very clearly.

5
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,620
Your body temperature is slightly high.

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,660
You also have dizziness
and low blood pressure.

7
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,490
I think it's a mild case
of heat exhaustion.

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,660
Did you experience any other symptoms?

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,790
It came out of nowhere,

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,290
so I got dizzy.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,170
Excuse me?

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,180
What on earth happened

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,970
to put him in this state?

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,560
He's talking nonsense from the heat.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,520
I see.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,440
What kind of national team athlete
collapses so often?

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,280
You took tests at the hospital.
What did they say?

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,780
What do you think?
It's just the same old stuff.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,240
Nothing serious.

20
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,000
This is about the Korea Customs Service.

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,470
What's this?
What?

22
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,680
Oh, call records from Min Ju-yeong's phone
that we seized that day.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,350
I checked every number,
but they're all work-related calls.

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,520
There's nothing.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,640
Anything else?

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,650
There was nothing unusual about
his belongings at the time of his arrest.

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,980
These records are almost too clean.

28
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,610
He didn't make any personal calls.

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,780
In terms of text messages--
There's nothing there either.

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,490
And there's no sign he deleted anything.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,950
Min Ju-yeong knew what we were up to.

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,250
He knew we had found the hit-and-run car.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,750
Someone told him.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,170
I'll handle it without any problems,
so don't worry.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,340
Understood.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,940
Hey, where are we going?

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,360
We need to go somewhere.

38
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,820
Go by yourself. I have work to do.

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,330
But we're partners.

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,040
If you don't listen to me, I'll--
You'll what?

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,580
I'll spread rumors

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,790
about how you kissed--
Let's go.

43
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,130
On his way to the airport,

44
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,210
he learned that we had found
the hit-and-run car and hid here.

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,630
There you are.

46
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,220
Somebody definitely called and told him.

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,600
But if there's no record of that call…

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,770
it means that the bastard
used a burner phone.

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,230
It wasn't on him when he was arrested,

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,320
so he likely ditched it here.

51
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,580
Found it!
You found it?

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,040
Yeah, hold on.

53
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,790
I found it!

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,750
But the other half is missing.

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,720
It probably fell through here.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Can I lift this?

57
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,140
I wonder where this connects to.

58
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,470
It probably fell to the bottom.

59
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,190
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Here.

60
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,560
Thank you.

61
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,340
Why won't you answer--

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

63
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,760
Hey.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey.

65
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,230
Ta-da.

66
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,280
What are you doing? Get up.

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
My arm is stuck.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,780
It's really stuck.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,450
Hold on, I feel a cramp coming.

70
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,370
It feels as if mice were climbing my arm.
So?

71
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,960
It's getting worse.
What do you say to catch mice?

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,580
Come on, help me out.

73
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,670
Meow!

74
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,420
Hey, that did the trick.

75
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,510
I'm sorry about earlier. I apologize.

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,060
Everyone loses their mind
at some point in life, right?

77
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm really sorry.

78
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,860
So can you forget it
and treat it like it never happened?

79
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,860
Man, it's hot.

80
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,400
The sun is really strong.
Can you put some sunscreen on me?

81
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,700
And can I have some water?

82
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm craving sausage today.

83
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,620
You know, the pink one.
Hey.

84
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,410
Who knows what nonsense I'll say
if I collapse again?

85
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,170
Let's get you out of there. Come on.

86
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,130
Let's try.
I'm really stuck.

87
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,290
One, two…

88
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
It seriously won't come out.

89
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,880
Seriously? Is it really stuck in there?

90
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah, I can't get it out for real.

91
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,890
Stay here.

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
Where are you going?

93
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,850
If you just leave me here

94
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,980
I'll spread rumors about us

95
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes, his arm is stuck in a sewer grate.
Rumors will fly

96
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,530
About how you and I…

97
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
You know.

98
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,050
The kind of sausage
that you coat in egg and lightly fry.

99
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,850
I really want sausage.

100
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,470
I bet my arm will heal quickly
if I have some.

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,020
How do you get in trouble every day?

102
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,520
I didn't get in trouble.

103
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm in the process of collecting evidence.

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,320
Min Ju-yeong's burner phone.

105
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,540
Hey.
What?

106
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,210
Did something happen
between you and Han-na?

107
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,510
It might hurt your feelings if I tell you.

108
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,230
Let's just say

109
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,270
it's a little secret

110
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,070
between me and Han-na.

111
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,520
THANK YOU

112
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Hey.

113
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,120
Soak up the sun.

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
They say vitamin D is good for your bones.

115
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,660
It might get that stupid grin
off your face too.

116
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,170
Hey.

117
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
Hey!

118
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,090
ANALYZING FINGERPRINTS…

119
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,140
It's a match.
They're Min Ju-yeong's fingerprints.

120
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,310
Yes!

121
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,020
The data's recoverable, right?

122
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,890
It'll take some time, but it's possible.

123
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,310
It's all over once we recover the data
and get the call history.

124
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,310
Counterpunch!

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
You adorable little punk!
What are you doing?

126
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,990
Great job.

127
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,120
GYEONGIL NOODLES

128
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,340
What are you kids doing?

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,800
We're being arrested
if the wall isn't squeaky clean.

130
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,590
Who said that?

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,010
A police officer.

132
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,940
Stop right there.

133
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
I can run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

134
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,610
If you run, I'll get you
and give you a hard time.

135
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,540
Hey, kids.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,540
You kids drew on the wall and ran, right?

137
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,960
Don't deny it. I saw it.

138
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,000
We didn't do that one. Jae-seok did.

139
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,050
What's your name?
Kang Seung-wan.

140
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,340
And you?
Lee Won-ho.

141
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Seung-wan and Won-ho.

142
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,840
Listen very closely.

143
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,300
If I see doodles again
when I drop by next time,

144
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll arrest all of you.

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm a police officer.

146
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,850
Is it good?

147
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,520
Yes.
Yes.

148
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,810
Will you draw here again?

149
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
No.
No.

150
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,730
Keep an eye out for people who do, okay?

151
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,070
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

152
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,710
I'm horrible.

153
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,650
GYEONG-IL'S MOTHER

154
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,860
Dong-ju.

155
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,110
If you're free tomorrow evening,
can you come to the restaurant?

156
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,790
OKAY

157
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,580
Goodness, Officer Yoon.

158
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,210
Hello, ma'am. How have you been?

159
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,420
Here you are.

160
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,420
I was about to call you.

161
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,970
What for?

162
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,930
I heard you got injured
while rescuing Han-na.

163
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,850
It's really nothing.

164
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,970
It's to be expected.

165
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,140
How is this something to be expected?

166
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm always nervous about Han-na
working a job like this,

167
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,280
but I feel better knowing
she has someone reliable by her side.

168
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,650
Please continue
to take good care of Han-na.

169
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,820
Of course, ma'am.
There's no one here better than me.

170
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,990
You don't need to
worry about Han-na at all.

171
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,410
Don't worry, Mother.

172
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,710
You even have a great personality.

173
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,000
This is an insurance sign-up gift.

174
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,220
By law, I'm only allowed to give gifts
worth up to 30,000 won.

175
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,220
But I felt so grateful

176
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,680
that I got this for you personally.

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,310
It's just my small token.
I hope you find it useful.

178
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,440
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

179
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,320
Thank you.
I should be the one thanking you.

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
It's fortunate that you took out a policy
just before the accident.

181
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,900
Don't you agree?
Yes.

182
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,280
If I come across better products,

183
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,080
I'll recommend them to you.

184
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,950
But don't tell Han-na, okay?

185
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,540
Get well soon.

186
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,330
I'll see you later.
Thank you.

187
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,970
Hello.

188
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,640
What's that? Did you buy something?

189
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,730
No, it's a gift.

190
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,730
Guess what?

191
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,230
Han-na's mother was so grateful
that I saved Han-na

192
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,450
that she dropped this off for me.

193
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,490
What is it?
It's an air purifier.

194
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,240
Nice.
A black one.

195
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,250
Where should I put this?

196
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,790
I'll put it in the middle here.

197
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,540
Are you sharing with us?
Of course.

198
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,960
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

199
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,960
Holy cow!

200
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,470
Let's put mine in the middle.

201
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,260
Yeah, let's put yours there
instead of Dung-ju's.

202
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,760
Dung-ju, move it.

203
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,940
Senior Officer Ji, you're here.

204
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,040
Yoon Dong-ju isn't coming.

205
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm bored out of my mind.

206
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,640
It's too expensive.
That's not the right stance.

207
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,970
Have you ever golfed before?

208
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,350
Yeah, I have. Don't pretend like you know.

209
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,230
Captain.
What?

210
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Do you need anything?
No, I'm okay.

211
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,820
That's not it.

212
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,740
Damn it.

213
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,530
Just some water.
Right.

214
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,130
Damn it.

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,680
I don't know if I can take on five.

216
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,730
I need to hunt down the bastard
making fake Candy.

217
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,070
Wait a minute.

218
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,830
You're home.

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

220
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,630
Did you sell insurance
to Jong-hyeon and Officer Yoon?

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,970
What?

222
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,930
Oh, well, they said they needed it.

223
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,220
I told them they didn't have to.

224
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,020
What are you doing?

225
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,270
It's been a while since we ate together,
so I went to the market--

226
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,900
I told you not to come back.

227
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,610
Hey, I have a stake in this house too.

228
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,070
Don't be so mean.

229
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,370
Besides, you make me come looking for you.

230
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,570
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,750
What documents did you request
from your father's insurance provider?

232
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,500
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,790
The case manager contacted me.

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,670
I hear that might prompt
reinvestigation into your father's death.

235
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,260
If it turns out
he didn't die in the line of duty,

236
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,380
it'll be hard to receive
the insurance payout.

237
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,260
Don't go around causing trouble.

238
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,560
I need that money to pay off my debt.

239
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,720
Who's the case manager?

240
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,850
What's their number?
Hey, wait.

241
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,600
I'll take care of it. You just stay put.

242
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,980
Why are you suddenly doing this?

243
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,980
This isn't like you.

244
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,990
Aren't you curious?

245
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,240
Don't you want to know how he died?

246
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,910
Why would I be curious about that now?

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,410
It's been over ten years.

248
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,790
He might've been good to you,
but not to me.

249
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,340
Do you know how much I struggled
because of him?

250
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,510
You brat, why are you upsetting me?

251
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,220
Hey, the stew is ready! Eat before you go!

252
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,470
Han-na!

253
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,940
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

254
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Come here.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,460
SAUSAGE

256
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
What is it?

257
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,390
Do you want some sausage?

258
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,640
What kind of dog likes sausage so much?

259
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,980
Kim was having some earlier
when it stole some and gobbled it down.

260
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,900
Reminds me of someone.

261
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,190
What's his name?

262
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,530
He doesn't have one. He's just a mutt.

263
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,860
You should give him one.

264
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,290
Hey, Dung-ju.

265
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,130
Han-na.

266
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,470
Did you see your mother?

267
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,390
I'm sorry

268
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,850
for not telling you.

269
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,150
Have you kept in touch
with my mom this whole time?

270
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Yeah.

271
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,570
I'm not comfortable
with you keeping in touch with her.

272
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,650
Please stop.

273
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,990
I know we broke up,

274
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,910
but it doesn't feel right
to avoid her calls.

275
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,910
Just ignore her.

276
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,540
She's acting like this
because you let her.

277
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,080
You know how she is.

278
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,620
I'm craving sausage today.

279
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,460
You know, the pink one.

280
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,060
What's this? Sausage?

281
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,280
Okay.

282
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,440
Tae-sik and rookie, stay here.
The rest of us are moving out.

283
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,490
Yes, sir.

284
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,950
All right.
Good luck, sir.

285
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,070
All right.

286
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,950
Sergeant Kim, call Senior Officer Shin
and go to Bukgu Port with the gear.

287
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,170
Where are we going?
Tell us what's going on.

288
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,250
We're going after Drugmon.

289
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,930
Where's the other bastard
putting out fake Candy?

290
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,010
Will you let me live if I tell you?

291
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Sure.

292
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,560
Bukgu Port.

293
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,360
Every Friday night.

294
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,900
So you're saying this guy is Drugmon.

295
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,660
Also known as Bbong-pil,

296
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,120
he used to live in Seoul
but recently came to Insung

297
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,450
to expand his operation.

298
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,620
Her statement was true.

299
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,370
I remember now.

300
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,830
He said Bukgu Port

301
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,670
and something about manufacturing candy.

302
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,550
It turns out Bbong-pil set up a drug lab

303
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,180
on a workboat in the sea.

304
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,970
After working through the night,

305
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,470
they return to the port at daybreak
with the goods and distribute them.

306
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,310
So you'll have to wait a bit longer.

307
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,310
We'll cover the back road to the port.
You guys can handle things here.

308
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,730
I'm tired already.

309
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,730
You're tired?

310
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,900
Here.
What's this?

311
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,150
What is it?
Everybody can have one.

312
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,030
Here, take one.

313
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,250
Hey, I'm wide awake now.

314
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,840
Get ready to pull an all-nighter.

315
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,340
Then I'll let myself out.

316
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,380
Good luck.
All right. Stay off the radar.

317
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,390
When did you grab your gun?

318
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,680
Try getting stabbed
and hit in the head with a wrench.

319
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,810
You'd need a weapon to feel at ease.

320
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,020
Can we trust that woman though?

321
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,030
Don't you think it's strange?

322
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,900
She can't even remember her own name,

323
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,280
but crucial information like this
somehow returned to her?

324
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,080
No, I don't think it's a lie.

325
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,250
Dae-yong checked it out,
and it seems credible.

326
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,330
Let's catch Drugmon

327
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,050
and pin drug charges on Min Ju-yeong
so that he rots in prison.

328
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,420
I dare him to come.

329
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,620
Is it that car?

330
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,930
That's Bbong-pil, right?

331
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,430
It's Bbong-pil.

332
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,640
Where? Let's go catch Drugmon.

333
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,430
Damn it.
Has he conked out again after drinking?

334
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,610
I tell him to show up on time,
so why the hell is he always late?

335
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,690
Hey, where's the boat docked today?

336
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Damn it.

337
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,460
Let's move! Run!

338
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,820
Did your legs give out already?

339
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,940
Real men have strong legs.

340
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,650
Keep your focus ahead.

341
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,890
Focus on Drugmon! Catch him!

342
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,310
Hey, over there!

343
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,850
Kim Jong-hyeon!

344
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,560
Dung-ju!
Dung-ju!

345
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,810
Get out of the way!

346
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,170
I just love him!

347
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,340
He's so cool!

348
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,460
Grab Dung-ju on the way!

349
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,560
BUKGU PORT FISHERS' ASSOCIATION

350
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,480
You're alive!

351
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,940
Looking good.
What are you on about?

352
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,700
Hold on.

353
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,700
Those look good on you.
What are you talking about?

354
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,700
"Focus on Drugmon"?

355
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,950
So making an arrest is more important
than saving a life, right?

356
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Jeez.

357
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,500
This is attempted murder.

358
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,540
That's what the captain said.
I saved your life.

359
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,170
You should've learned how to swim.

360
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,760
You purposely aimed for my head,
didn't you?

361
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,470
What are you talking about?
It landed exactly around your head.

362
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,640
Exactly! You got revenge
because I ate your rabbit food.

363
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,480
I should've aimed for your mouth,
but I slipped.

364
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,360
I knew it. You hit me on purpose.

365
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,570
YOU

366
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,760
What's wrong?

367
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,590
The wrapping looks different. Take a look.

368
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,720
I don't think
there's a trace of Drugmon here.

369
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,440
The manufacturers also said
they've never seen or met Drugmon.

370
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,940
Isn't that weird?

371
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,270
Is Bbong-pil

372
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,190
really Drugmon?

373
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,500
He's forthcoming about everything,
Okay.

374
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,670
but he says he doesn't know
Drugmon or Min Ju-yeong.

375
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,080
I don't think he's lying.

376
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,630
Of course, he's lying.

377
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,300
He's spilling everything else.

378
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
So he must not know--

379
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,050
I need to collect a hair sample.
Hello.

380
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,930
I'll do it.

381
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,930
Hey. Do you know how to?

382
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,930
I learned it at the police academy.

383
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,350
I'm here to collect a hair sample.

384
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,690
This way. Slowly.

385
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,610
This way!

386
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,530
Slowly!

387
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,330
Nice!
Awesome!

388
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,120
Very nice.

389
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,830
"TAE Corporation."

390
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,460
"Russian… pollock."

391
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,250
Russian pollock.

392
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,260
Let's take a look.

393
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,260
It's pollock, and it's frozen solid.

394
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,180
Be careful with those.

395
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh my.
Sir, we need you.

396
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,020
Hey, this is ephedrine.

397
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,900
It's used to manufacture painkillers,

398
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,690
but it's also often used
to make narcotics.

399
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,610
Goodness, there's a lot.

400
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,650
How much can be manufactured
with this amount?

401
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,990
There are 50 more boxes over there.

402
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,490
I'm not sure, but considering the amount…

403
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,370
This might be the largest bust
in the country's history.

404
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,040
You two really pulled off a big one.

405
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,130
See? I positioned the SCIT well.

406
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,040
My strategy worked.

407
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,710
Strategy?

408
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,210
National team athletes are the best!
Strategy, my ass.

409
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,270
Are you really not Drugmon?

410
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,060
I've never even seen Drugmon.

411
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,230
So you don't know who Min Ju-yeong is?

412
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,860
How many times do I have to tell you?

413
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,900
I've never met or seen anyone
with the last name Min.

414
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,990
Goddammit.

415
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,450
Just get a hair sample already.

416
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,870
Okay.

417
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,120
Do you see this?

418
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,960
The "thank" in "thank you" is gone
because of you.

419
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,300
So?

420
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,880
So if I catch you lying
from this moment onward,

421
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,930
consider yourself done for.

422
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,140
Done.

423
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,220
Done.

424
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,270
Done!

425
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,360
Jeez, this guy.

426
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,150
We collected plenty of samples
just in case.

427
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,660
Oh, thank you.

428
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,160
Seriously, don't be so difficult.

429
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,870
I just went there to sleep.

430
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I have nothing to do with them.

431
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,500
So please let me go.

432
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,880
We were just at the same motel.

433
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,300
Aren't you still in school?

434
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,590
What minor stays alone at a motel?

435
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,510
I already told you
there's a reason for it.

436
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,100
I've only just arrived in Korea.

437
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,180
All right. But you're not going anywhere
until your parents get here.

438
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,810
Come and write down a contact number.

439
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,230
Bbong-pil

440
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,610
Bbong-pil

441
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,490
Bbong-pil
Bbong-pil

442
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,650
Hey, be careful.

443
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,070
JUVENILE DIVISION

444
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,790
What are you doing?
Get back here.

445
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,040
Let go of me!

446
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,330
Hold on.

447
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,210
Hey, where are you going?

448
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Are you okay?

449
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Unbelievable.

450
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,020
Hey, kid. Why were you running?

451
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,770
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,860
Hey, why are you clinging to him?

453
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,190
Step away from him.
Let go of me.

454
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,700
"Let go of me"? Move away from him.

455
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,240
Who is this?
Stop right there!

456
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,540
Captain, this kid ran off
while being questioned.

457
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,290
Go Jeong-a.

458
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,750
What are you doing here?

459
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,130
When did you return from the Philippines?
Where's your mom?

460
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,260
Did you come alone?

461
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,970
And why is your face so red?

462
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,760
What are you doing?

463
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,970
Her own daughter ran away from home,
but I guess she didn't tell you.

464
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,270
Let go of him.

465
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,810
Come with me.
Will you please let go?

466
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,980
What are you doing?

467
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,070
Let go of me!

468
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,150
Come on.

469
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,820
I said come here!
Let go of me!

470
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,160
So why is our kid here right now?

471
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,490
Do you think I'd be calling you
if I knew the reason?

472
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,500
Hey, Han-na.
That's what I want to say.

473
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,330
Could you check this number for me?
Who's that?

474
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,590
She's a fairy. Isn't she pretty?

475
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,760
Not at all.
What are you talking about?

476
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,880
Then what about that detective?

477
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,600
Oh, he's a sneaky jerk.
A sneaky jerk?

478
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,060
Why would you bring up
the three-year extension--

479
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,810
She always hangs up on me.

480
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,690
Come here, you.

481
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,730
Go change out of those pants right now.

482
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,150
Get over here.
We're at a police station. This is abuse.

483
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,030
Go ahead and report me then.

484
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,910
Let's share a moment in jail
as father and daughter.

485
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,240
You can look forward to it.
It'll be really great.

486
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,410
Let go! Where are we going?
Hey, rookie. Come over here.

487
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,160
I'm a little busy right now.

488
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,960
If she tries to go anywhere,
put her in cuffs or do whatever.

489
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,880
Go with this handsome rookie, okay?

490
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,750
Go change, you punk.

491
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,800
Gosh, I'm so busy.

492
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,470
Sergeant Kim, do you have mousse?

493
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,550
Mousse?

494
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Who's this?

495
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
This is Captain Go's daughter.

496
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,310
He said to watch her closely
and not let her step outside.

497
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,940
He said to cuff her if she didn't listen.

498
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,980
So I brought her here.

499
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,110
Please take a seat.

500
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,570
I'll take this shift.

501
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,150
Bye.
Goodbye, sir.

502
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,530
Did you eat?
Not yet.

503
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,630
Why are you getting so dolled up?

504
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,970
Be quiet, you punk.

505
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,130
I'm back.

506
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,010
Gosh, Captain. You look great.

507
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,930
The commissioner?
He's still exercising nearby.

508
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,810
I should be doing this
while the commissioner is watching.

509
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,270
The reporters?
They're waiting in the briefing room.

510
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,360
Okay.

511
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,110
"I will provide an update
on the investigation

512
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,820
into a large-scale drug ring
and a new drug seized at Bukgu Port."

513
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,240
"Early this morning, the SCIT received
a tip about a new drug called Candy

514
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,830
and was conducting a stakeout
at Bukgu Port when…"

515
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,000
Man, you look great.

516
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,210
Hey.

517
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,290
Mic check.

518
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,750
I will provide an update
on the investigation

519
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,590
into a large-scale drug ring
and a new drug seized at Bukgu Port.

520
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,840
Early this morning,
the SCIT received a tip

521
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,640
about a new drug called Candy.

522
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,770
Twelve suspects with records…

523
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,850
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,560
Including Park,

525
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,560
we have apprehended
a total of 28 members of the drug ring.

526
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,230
EVIDENCE

527
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,480
The seized drugs and pharmaceuticals
are valued at…

528
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,610
Goodness.

529
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,150
A total of 12 billion won.

530
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
Please stand up.

531
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,870
Watch your head.

532
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,330
Sergeant Seo Do-jae.
What now?

533
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,920
Did you meet the survivor from the scene?

534
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I did.

535
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,800
What about the survivor's statement?

536
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,460
Look at me.

537
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,590
She's the only survivor
who knows Park Bong-pil.

538
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,840
We need her statement to…

539
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,010
I said look at me, Sergeant Seo Do-jae.

540
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,180
I'm already looking at you.

541
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,970
Please take down the survivor's statement.

542
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
I'm counting on you.

543
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,940
He's loving it.
How do you feel about solving

544
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,400
the country's largest drug case?

545
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,860
That's not an official question,
so I'm unable to comment on it.

546
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,320
It's the greatest success to date.
Sir.

547
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,870
Please share your thoughts.

548
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,080
Later.

549
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,120
This is Cheongil Shipping's sales data.

550
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,630
In 2006, it was 210 billion won.

551
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,590
In 2007, it was 225 billion won.

552
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,170
And in 2008, it was 238 billion won,
showing steady growth.

553
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,930
At the time, they were competing for third
or fourth place in domestic shipping.

554
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,680
But the following year, they defaulted on
their maturing promissory notes

555
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,810
and were declared bankrupt.

556
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,390
So what about it?

557
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,400
The promissory note they defaulted on
was only 400 million won.

558
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,860
Cheongil Shipping
deliberately caused the bankruptcy.

559
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,900
The then CEO was sued on charges of fraud
including bankruptcy fraud,

560
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,780
embezzlement, and breach of trust,

561
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,070
but was acquitted of all charges.

562
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,660
Why is this important?

563
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,990
The company that bought
Cheongil Shipping at a bargain price

564
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,160
was TAE Corporation.

565
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,460
The company that imported the pollock
we found this morning on the workboat?

566
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,710
Yes. It was a startup at the time,

567
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,210
but after acquiring Cheongil Shipping,

568
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
it quickly rose to second place
in the industry.

569
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,880
And the company handling
TAE Corporation's logistics

570
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,390
belongs to Mr. Oh Jong-gu.

571
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,850
J9 Security.

572
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,270
So that's how they're connected.

573
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,810
So you're saying TAE Corporation
smuggled drug materials

574
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,070
by concealing them
in frozen Russian pollock.

575
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,150
Then J9 Security's Oh Jong-gu
handed off the goods

576
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
to Drugmon.

577
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,410
Or rather, he gave it to Bbong-pil.

578
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,160
REQUEST GRANTED BY MIN JU-YEONG

579
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,580
That bastard Min Ju-yeong
covered for them.

580
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,290
The truth is out. Let's go arrest them.
Let's round them all up.

581
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,130
It's not that easy.

582
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,880
The CEO of TAE Corporation is…

583
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,430
Steve Roh. Roh Seong-tae.

584
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,970
Roh Seong-tae's father
probably holds more power

585
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,850
since he's actually in charge.

586
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,270
Who's his father?

587
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,350
Roh Seong-tae's father?

588
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Who is it?

589
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,860
Wait.

590
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,740
Move your feet!

591
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,570
The mayor of Insung, Roh Deok-gyu.

592
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,660
He and the commissioner
have something going on under the table.

593
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,590
Your backhand is a thing of beauty, sir!

594
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,590
It's all thanks to this racket
you bought me!

595
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,800
How about another set?

596
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,890
Of course, sir!
Okay, great!

597
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,100
The bastard must be full of energy
because he's young.

598
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
I think you should take this, sir.

599
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,650
Okay.

600
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,110
Hello?

601
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
What's going on?

602
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,040
So that's how that bastard Min Ju-yeong
has been getting away with it.

603
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,290
He had the mayor backing him.

604
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,420
The reporters will catch on soon enough.
What do we do?

605
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,670
We really stepped in shit this time.

606
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,210
Why is it shit?

607
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,590
Let's push out the commissioner
while we're at it.

608
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,970
Yeah, don't be scared. Let's push him out.

609
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,680
If there's a chance of illegal activity,

610
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,850
we must investigate,
no matter the sacrifice.

611
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,770
Hang on.

612
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,640
So the RIU figured out

613
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,770
the mayor's connection in all this
and set us up to take the fall, right?

614
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,730
You should give the briefing
for this case.

615
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,440
Why not give it together?

616
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,360
What's the point of sharing credit anyway?

617
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,780
Besides, you've put in a lot of work.

618
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,240
An Dae-yong, you bastard!

619
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,290
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

620
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,370
An Dae-yong!

621
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,720
How long have you known?
I find out right before the briefing!

622
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,140
You should've called it off then!

623
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,010
Damn it.
Captain!

624
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,890
Aren't I right?
Don't be like this.

625
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,850
Separate them!
Pull them apart!

626
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,350
Captain!

627
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,690
Come on!
It's the commissioner!

628
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,770
The commissioner!

629
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,500
Who was it?

630
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,500
Excuse me, sir?

631
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,750
Who investigated

632
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,170
TAE Corporation?

633
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,680
I guess it was me, sir.

634
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,100
I'm sorry, sir.

635
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,690
Man-sik!

636
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,860
Mr. Min.

637
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,250
You've been monitoring
this company, right?

638
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,370
Yes, sir.

639
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,500
The mayor wanted things handled thoroughly
to avoid issues like this.

640
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,500
That's why he pulled the strings

641
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,960
to keep someone like you here for so long.

642
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,380
How dare you
get us dragged into this mess?

643
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,220
I'm sorry, sir.

644
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,390
I'll apologize
and make sure this gets resolved.

645
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,310
INSUNG CITY HALL

646
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,860
What's that?

647
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,780
I thought it wouldn't be proper
to come empty-handed.

648
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,700
You can go in now.

649
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,680
MAYOR ROH DEOK-GYU

650
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,740
Watch.

651
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,750
Watch.

652
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,830
Mayor Roh.

653
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,790
Mayor Roh.

654
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,430
Have you already forgotten

655
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,520
who made it possible
to get your name on this?

656
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,150
No, I haven't.

657
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,110
You shouldn't forget a favor, right?
Right.

658
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,740
Why?

659
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,450
Seriously, why?

660
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,290
Why did you take my goods behind my back
and cause all this trouble?

661
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,370
I'm sorry.

662
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,500
Mayor Roh.

663
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,680
You know,

664
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,720
I spoon-feed everything to you.

665
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,010
A politician once said,

666
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,720
"If your spoon is too big,

667
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,020
it'll tear your mouth."

668
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,860
By the way,

669
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,830
I've got a lawsuit on my hands.

670
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:27,990
Take care of it.

671
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,950
Understood?

672
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,460
What did I tell you to do
if you understood?

673
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,500
I understand.

674
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,990
I don't like doing this.

675
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,570
It's hard to make a living, isn't it?

676
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
It is.

677
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,080
You said you coached Officer Yoon Dong-ju
back in your boxing days, right?

678
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,710
Yes.

679
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,170
You can say I practically raised him.

680
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,340
Was he annoying back then too?

681
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,880
Don't get me started.

682
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,380
He's beyond stubborn
and has a way of getting under your skin.

683
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,720
I see.

684
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,890
What do you think, Mr. Oh?

685
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,610
Do I look like a bad guy?

686
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,320
Excuse me?

687
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,980
Officer Yoon keeps calling me a bad guy.

688
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,110
So I'm wondering
if I really did do so many bad things.

689
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,240
I'm not really sure.

690
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
What do you think?

691
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,580
Am I really that bad?

692
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,550
No, of course not.

693
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,640
Why would he say that then?

694
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,020
I guess there's no choice.

695
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,100
I'll need to borrow some guys.

696
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,520
I want tight-lipped ones.

697
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,770
What do you need them for?

698
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,610
If that's his wish, I should oblige.

699
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,650
I'll show him how bad I am.

700
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,080
I've been through so much today
that I'm exhausted.

701
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,080
You traitors.

702
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,040
How could you
throw your captain under the bus?

703
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,540
There was no need
for all of us to get blamed.

704
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,590
That's what a captain is for.

705
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,590
Thank you for treating me like a captain.

706
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,300
"Push out the commissioner"?

707
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,220
I meant if you pull us forward
and lead the charge,

708
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,640
we'll be right behind
to give you the push you need.

709
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,350
What do you have to say?

710
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,770
I'd like to remind you
that an investigation like this

711
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,060
demands a small sacrifice, sir.

712
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,320
I didn't say a word.

713
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,740
You were the first to go.
And I sincerely apologize for that.

714
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,740
I should've turned a deaf ear.

715
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,500
Do your cauliflower ears trouble you?

716
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,830
As captain, I--

717
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,630
What are you doing?

718
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,170
What the heck?

719
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,130
This place sure has good meat.

720
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,510
It's delicious!

721
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,720
After we eat, we have to go back
to the house and reinvestigate,

722
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,720
so let's just have water tonight.

723
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,230
The toast will be
"Small sacrifices for the great good."

724
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,520
Small sacrifices…
For the greater good!

725
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,900
Try some. It's good, right?

726
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,400
Eat up.

727
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,160
Where are you going?

728
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
The bathroom.

729
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,370
I can make it there.

730
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,710
Hold on.

731
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,960
RIU ROOKIE

732
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,760
Come on. You can do it.

733
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,300
It's locked.
Captain Go Man-sik.

734
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,810
What?

735
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,190
What's taking him so long?

736
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,690
Tell me about it.

737
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,360
Want to go check on him?
Yeah, let's go.

738
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,860
We'll be back.
Okay.

739
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,530
Jeez, what's wrong with you?

740
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,030
You're not even drunk.

741
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,700
Get up already.
You can't just sleep on the street.

742
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Captain.

743
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,080
Captain, it's cold. Get up.

744
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,670
Captain!
What is it?

745
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,050
What is it?

746
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,470
Captain, wake up!
Captain! What happened?

747
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,300
His head is bleeding.

748
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,470
What happened?

749
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,890
He was on the ground.

750
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,850
Call an ambulance.
No, don't.

751
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,440
Don't call an ambulance.
Call the agency first.

752
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,980
Those bastards

753
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,270
took my gun.
Gun?

754
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,240
WE PROMISE SAFE CONSTRUCTION
OF GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY

755
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,660
One hour ago, shots were fired
from an unidentified location,

756
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,870
posing a threat to the safety of citizens.

757
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,000
A vehicle's windshield
and a window of a home

758
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,960
in a redevelopment zone were shattered,

759
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
leaving the citizens in fear.

760
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,800
The four bullets that were fired
included a blank round

761
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,220
and were 6 mm caliber bullets
issued to the police…

762
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,130
I think it's your gun, sir.

763
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,180
It had one blank round
and four live rounds in it.

764
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,020
So there's one round left.

765
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,850
They've set up checkpoints
on all roads leading to Yeonseo-gu.

766
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,360
They'll catch the perp soon.

767
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,650
No. We can't just stay here.

768
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,740
You're in no shape to go anywhere!

769
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,910
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

770
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,830
Remember the woman who saw Drugmon?

771
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,670
I found traces of the dead junkie's blood

772
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,590
in the bloodstains on her clothes.

773
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,550
Maybe it was a coincidence.

774
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,630
She was in close proximity to the guy.

775
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,840
The bloodstains were found
in the neck area of her top and jacket.

776
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,890
The junkie's epithelial cells
were also found there.

777
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,850
It means the junkie grabbed the collar

778
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,600
with his bloodied hands.

779
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,190
BLOODSTAIN ANALYSIS REPORT

780
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,150
Have you run the fingerprints
of the witness?

781
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:21,570
Authorities found that a synthetic drug
called Candy was manufactured.

782
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,950
The drugs were distributed
by TAE Corporation.

783
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,290
I got rid of the fake Candy maker,

784
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,250
but now this?

785
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,210
…and the shock is spreading.

786
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,250
Mr. Min must be pissed off.

787
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
Now what should I do?

788
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,390
Look what we have here.

789
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,890
Oh, now I remember.

790
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,730
What do you mean?

791
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,480
I remember where I saw you.

792
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,150
Me?

793
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,150
You know me?

794
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,660
Yeah. From the plane.

795
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,200
Please stop crying.
Mommy.

796
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,290
You can sleep at home.

797
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,000
Mommy.

798
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,720
Kim Yeon-ha.

799
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,390
I even know your name.

800
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,060
I'm sorry.

801
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,160
But you look

802
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,250
very different from when I first saw you.

803
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,590
I almost didn't recognize you.

804
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,970
I see.

805
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,480
That's where you saw me.

806
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,020
Why do you overdo things?

807
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,940
That's why you keep collapsing.

808
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,030
This is so frustrating.

809
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,570
Han-na, did you get the results?

810
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,670
It burned to the ground.

811
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,170
Are you okay?

812
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,000
We think this is the source.
Thank you.

813
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,380
Captain, here.

814
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,440
It's my daughter's.

815
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,940
Where is she?

816
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,820
She disappeared
while I was in the bathroom

817
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,150
along with that woman.

818
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,700
I'm so sorry--
You punk!

819
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,160
Captain.

119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

821
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Come with me.

822
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,860
Where are we going?

823
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,610
We're going to see something pretty.

824
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,570
Let's go.

825
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,200
Jeong-a!

826
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,950
Captain!

827
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,670
Let's get you up.
Jeong-a…

828
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,500
I'm going to check my place.

829
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,500
The rest of you,
keep looking for them here.

830
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,380
Jeong-a!

831
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,510
Let's go.
Okay.

832
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,760
Jeong-a!

833
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,030
It's so pretty.

834
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,660
It's been a while, Mr. Min.

835
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,290
When did your style change?

836
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,170
I know it's a bit childish.

837
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,210
Why were you there for so long?

838
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,130
They must've watched you closely.

839
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,380
No, it wasn't that.

840
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,600
It was quite heartwarming and nice there.

841
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:01,390
What's that?

842
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,270
Looks like you picked up a weird hobby
while I was gone.

843
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,530
It was more fun than I'd thought. Get in.

844
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,240
I have a friend.

845
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,580
The daughter of the SCIT captain.

846
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,670
What should we do?

847
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,010
There's one more round left.

848
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,760
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?

849
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,560
Have you seen this girl?

850
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,390
If you see her…

851
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,150
Hello.
Welcome.

852
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,270
I'm with the police.

853
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,360
I'm looking for someone.
Can I check the CCTV footage?

854
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,700
Have you seen this person?

855
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
No, I haven't.

856
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,280
Excuse me.

857
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,540
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

858
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,670
Where are you again?

859
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,670
She's gone missing!

860
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,300
What? Did you try tracking her phone?

861
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,390
Her phone is damaged,
so I can't track her location.

862
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,180
Didn't I tell you to send her back to me?

863
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,720
Whatever! Just text me anything
that might help!

864
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,810
Okay.

865
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,100
They called me because she couldn't pay
for her ice cream.

866
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,020
Apparently, she gave my name
to the precinct officers.

867
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,490
You little brat!

868
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,000
Stop crying.

869
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,170
Where's Kim Yeon-ha?

870
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,550
Oh, Yeon-ha?

871
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,140
I have to get going now.

872
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,140
Where are you going?

873
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,600
I have something more fun to do.

874
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,400
Something fun?

875
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,980
Officer Yoon Dong-ju?

876
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,490
Yes, that's me.

877
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,570
You're Yoon Dong-ju, right?

878
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,660
Excuse me.

879
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,290
Who's the sender?

880
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:06,830
I don't know. I'm just the courier.

881
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,580
Have a good night!

882
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,710
Let me see that.

883
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,210
OFFICER YOON DONG-JU

884
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,720
It's my gun.

Hello?

889

When you're in the ring,

890
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,390
don't take your eyes off your opponent
until they're down.

DONG-JU

892
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,850
Ma'am?

893
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,850
The moment you think
you have them cornered…

894
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,650
The second you let your guard down…

895
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,610
That's when you get hit
with a counterpunch.

I said get up, you bitch!

918
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,570
Who do you think you are
coming into my house?

What did I just do?

927
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,720
Right. I lost my mind for a second.

928
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,380
It's because of the hot weather.

929
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,930
The heat can do that to you. That's right.

01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,170
Is that what you want to do?

938
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,050
