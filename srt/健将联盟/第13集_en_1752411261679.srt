1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,100
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,810
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,370
I'm stepping out for a bit.

5
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll bring Dong-ju
a change of clothes too.

6
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,620
Do you need anything?

7
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,750
Jong-hyeon.

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,720
I like Dong-ju a lot.

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,180
I'm sorry, Jong-hyeon.

10
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,190
Don't say you're sorry.

11
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,650
It makes it feel like I really lost.

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,410
I'll be back.

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,660
POLICE IN FULL PURSUIT
OF FUGITIVE OFFICER YOON

14
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,380
What's going on? Where's the commissioner?

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,250
He took off for Seoul yesterday
to attend a seminar.

16
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,800
-No contact with him since.
-What about Min Ju-yeong?

17
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,920
We're looking,

18
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,340
but we can't track him down.

19
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,260
What about the senior superintendent?
I can't reach him either.

20
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,760
He went on a business trip
to the US a few days ago.

21
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,430
I think he'll be there for a while.

22
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,690
So there's no one to help us.

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,690
Is Yoon Dong-ju okay?

24
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,060
Where is he right now?

25
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,190
We moved him to a safe place,
but he isn't doing well.

26
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,070
Captain.

27
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,880
Yes, Captain.

28
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,680
Captain!

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,510
Hey.

30
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,020
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

31
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,190
This is a total mess.

32
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,270
The whole jurisdiction is falling apart,

33
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,270
but the damn commissioner
is covering his own ass.

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,900
Just like Min Ju-yeong planned it.

35
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,360
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

36
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,900
How've you been?

37
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,950
Where are you going?

38
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,370
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,880
You bastard.

40
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,680
You had to run your damn mouth.

41
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,900
That mouth of yours
is what got you into trouble.

42
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,030
We can't do anything
because of that damn bastard.

43
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,530
The police are a joke now.

44
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,570
Damn it!

45
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,490
He wouldn't be so bold
unless the rumor were true.

46
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,500
Welcome, sir.

47
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,630
This is the SPO's chief
of the Criminal Department.

48
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>I just met with the chief</i>
<i>of the Criminal Department.</i>

49
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,140
<i>Golden Bunny will be transferred</i>
<i>to the SPO in Seoul by tomorrow.</i>

50
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,930
Please take a seat.

51
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,720
There's a rumor that the commissioner
and the SPO are forming a new SCIT.

52
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,320
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

53
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,330
<i>-The person you are calling--</i>
-He's not answering.

54
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,990
What the hell are these bastards up to?

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,750
They're trying to cover up everything.

56
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,960
Just in case, let's move our files
that are at the pawnshop.

57
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,460
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

58
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,000
What happened here?

59
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,090
Hey!

60
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,300
Hey, wake up!

61
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,010
Hey.

62
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
He's already dead.

63
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,730
Pawnshop.

64
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,520
Answer the damn phone, Pawnshop!

65
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,650
I'm right here, punk.

66
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,270
I stumbled into the wrong place, right?

67
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
-What happened here?
-What the hell happened?

68
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,570
Oh, goodness.

69
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,160
What about the bald eagle?

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,700
-Gwang-se?
-Gwang-se!

71
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,870
-Look for a bright spot.
-Gwang-se.

72
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,160
-Hey, Gwang-se!
-Look for the shiny guy!

73
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,040
-Gwang-se!
-Hold on!

74
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,300
It's here.

75
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,510
Our food is here. Go get it.

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,730
<i>Jjamppong</i> is the best on a rainy day.

77
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Hello.

78
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,460
Please don't come near here.

79
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,010
RUSSIAN MAFIA GANGS AND A KOREAN SMUGGLER

80
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,930
Hey.

81
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,270
Who are you?

82
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,110
Why didn't you come sooner?

83
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,490
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

84
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,910
If I go to the hospital
and those guys see me,

85
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,670
they'll definitely kill me.

86
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,590
Sergeant Kim, call the police.

87
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,710
Your shiny head deflected the bullet.

88
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,880
-You won't die. You were lucky.
-Hello?

89
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,720
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.
I'm at the Insung Pawnshop.

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,930
We need backup.

91
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,140
You're not going to die.
You'll live to see all your hair fall out.

92
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,230
Captain, something's off.

93
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,350
What do you mean?

94
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,820
If their plan
was to kill him from the start,

95
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,730
they wouldn't have gone this far.

96
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,030
You're right.

97
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,830
It wasn't a quick kill attempt.

98
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,660
Did you see anything else?

99
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,710
Well…

100
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,540
Sergei said…

101
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,710
It's okay.

102
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,760
Vlad…

103
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,220
Vlad…

104
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,600
Leo Vladimirovich Svarsky.

105
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,970
Svarsky.

106
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,430
Vladimir Ilyich Svarsky.

107
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,480
Hang on.

108
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,190
Leo Vladimirovich Svarsky?

109
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,070
Russians have names
derived from their father's name.

110
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,200
If that's the case,

111
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,490
they're father and son.

112
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,200
After he said that,

113
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,950
the guy just shot up the whole place.

114
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,090
What?

115
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,760
Why are you

116
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,730
only now

117
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,100
telling me that?

118
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,780
That means Sergei passed on a clue.

119
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
Those damn bastards.

120
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,900
Don't be scared, okay?

121
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,660

125
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,920
Hey, this is too scary for me.

126
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,340
I have a chronic heart condition,

127
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,640
so please leave.

128
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,310
I won't charge you for using the place,
so please leave!

129
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,020
You're the biggest curse in my life!

130
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,310
Isn't this the file from before?

131
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,650
OH DOLLAR'S CONTRABAND FROM 2008

132
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,940
I think Han-na has been investigating
this case on her own.

133
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,530
OH DOLLAR
OH BONG-CHAN, 8 PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,780
Senior Officer Ji dug this deep into it?

135
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,460
Did you find her?

136
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,300
I confirmed that she left by car,
but I don't know where she went.

137
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,180
I can't get in touch with her.

138
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,060
Hurry up and find her.

139
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,570
Hey, Mr. Min.

140
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,830
<i>How did it go?</i>

141
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,910
We packed up the goods,
but the trucks haven't arrived.

142
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,710
That lazy-ass bastard is way too slow.

143
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,880
Just move the goods
as soon as they arrive.

144
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,970
But won't she lose it
when she finds out they're gone?

145
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,050
She's a little busy today.

146
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,430
Something came up, you see.

147
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,760
SEONGIL INN

148
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,870
<i>What made you tell her?</i>

149
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,780
The deal is done,
so I have to keep my promise.

150
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,000
What about Yoon Dong-ju?

151
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,410
<i>We're looking for the little mutt.</i>

152
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,120
We're combing through Insung,
so we'll find him soon.

153
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,500
What should I do when I find him?

154
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,500
Should I bring him in alive?

155
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,460
What for? Don't bother.

156
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,050
Just…

157
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,140
kill him, nice and neat.

158
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,100
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>everything would be over</i>

159
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,270
after the count and the 12th round?

160
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,650
<i>It's been fun.</i>

161
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,190
Enjoy your trip to the afterlife.

162
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,700
Yoon Dong-ju.

163
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,410
I'm right here.

164
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,530
Yoon Dong-ju. Look at me.

165
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,700
Dong-ju.

166
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,870
It's okay, Dong-ju.

167
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,960
It's fine.

168
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
I thought…

169
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,170
I'd never see you again.

170
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,670
I'm so glad I'm able to…

171
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
see you again.

172
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,180
Don't smile.

173
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
You look silly.

174
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,990
I wish

175
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,240
I could look at your face for longer…

176
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,750
but I'm sleepy.

177
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,540
It's because of the medicine.

178
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,090
Go back to sleep.

179
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,090
I'll be right here.

180
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,020
Who are you?

181
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,230
Are you my sister?

182
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,000
You found my hairpin for me.

183
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,170
Thank you.

184
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,920
But…

185
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,010
who are you?

186
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,180
You shouldn't be living like this

187
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,970
after sending me off that way.

188
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,640
Why did you end up like this?

189
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,900
You sent me to that hellhole

190
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,110
and promised to come.

191
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,150
You said you'd come and get me.

192
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,200
Do you know what my life was like?

193
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,660
At the very least,

194
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,990
you shouldn't have forgotten me.

195
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,700
I came here to kill you,

196
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,250
but you don't even recognize me.

197
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,040
Why are you doing this to me?

198
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,840
Take a good look at me.

199
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,420
You swore you'd remember my eyes,
no matter how much I changed.

200
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,130
Look at me.

201
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,510
I said look at me.

202
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,890
Look me in the eye!

203
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,190
Please give me more candy.

204
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,110
You promised to give me candy

205
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,940
if I waited here quietly.

206
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,820
So give me some candy now!

207
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,950

Open it!

318
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,440
Now swallow it.

319
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,660

334
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,200
Hey, stop!

335
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,030
Wait. Stop!

336
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,280
Help us! We need your help!

338
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,420
Where are all of you going?

339
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,800
The Victory Hotel.

340
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,680
The Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,
Insung District Prosecutors' Office,

341
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,430
and Supreme Prosecutors' Office
have announced

00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,600
they will form a special joint task force

347

Even if there were any left,
nobody would help.

348
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,910
Simply mentioning the bastard
is enough to trigger an audit,

349
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,620
and the press won't react to it.

350
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,120
They've lost their damn minds.

351
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,120
They're kissing his ass

352
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,130
<i>By the way, about Senior Officer Ji,</i>

353
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,710
one of my guys
saw her this morning at the station.

354
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,590
I apologize for the inconvenience,
but for security purposes,

355
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,880
we'll be collecting everyone's phones.

356
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,090
There are many reporters,
so we must be careful.

357
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,230
There she is. Get her!

358
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,030
Get her! Come on!

359
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,630
Mr. Min, are you okay?

360
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,140
How did it go?

361
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,400
You damn idiots. You can't catch one girl?

362
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Who cares if she has a gun?

363
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,490
Bring her here now.

364
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,700
Mr. Min, you head up first.

365
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,270
Where's Min Ju-yeong?

366
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,190
You bitch!

367
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,220
The 20th floor.

368
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,520
Or the penthouse.

369
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,770
Over there.

370
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,820
Damn it, where is she?

371
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,570
Find her.

372
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,570
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

373
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,930
Over there!

374
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,740
Kill that bitch!

375
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,880
You damn bitch!

376
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,260
THE CENTER OF THE WORLD AND FUTURE
GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY

377
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,680
Don't just stand there! Kill that bitch!

378
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,910
Did you get her?

379
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,310
Fucking hell.

380
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,650
That crazy bitch!

381
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,200
-Hey!
-Who are you?

382
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,450
-What the hell?
-We have an intruder.

383
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,530
Come at me.

384
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,640
"WATERFALL"

385
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,430
You came to kill me with just this?

386
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,140
I'd be dead
if that bullet had hit its mark.

387
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,940
But it seems like you've lost your touch,
Shooting Fairy.

388
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,110
Or maybe you can't shoot moving targets.

389
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,240
Guess you're right.

390
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,660
So you'd better keep running
until the end.

391
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,750
If you stop, you're dead.

392
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,920
Why is everyone
so hell-bent on killing me?

393
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,210
Because you're a bad guy.

394
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
Staging the murder of
Korea Customs Service Officer Lee Jin-su

395
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,760
as a car accident.

396
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,340
Forcing a confession
from Mr. Lee Gyeong-il

397
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,720
and soliciting his murder.

398
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,930
Soliciting the murder
of a correctional officer as a cover-up.

399
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,890
Smuggling vehicles and illegal firearms.

400
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,480
Manufacturing and distributing drugs.

401
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,270
Bribery and obstruction
of official duties.

402
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,350
Now we can add

403
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,230
an attempted murder of an officer.

404
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,150
Isn't it okay to just kill a guy so vile?

405
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,530
I don't remember any of that.

406
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,840
Actually, I do.

407
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,800
I crushed Lee Jin-su with my car.

408
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,850
I solicited murder.

409
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,640
I manufactured and distributed drugs.

410
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,070
Do you have any solid evidence
I did all of that?

411
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,030
Or did you think

412
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,990
you could catch me if you had evidence?

413
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,660
You can bark and growl all you want.

414
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,870
But no one will ever know…

415
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,880
who I really am…

416
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,880
or what I've done.

417
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,090
They'll know now.

418
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,930
They'll know who you are

419
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,640
and who owns that money.

420
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,480
<i>Please.</i>

421
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,900
You just have to go live.

422
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,320
So that the world can know
who that bastard really is.

423
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,700
<i>Say hello, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.</i>

424
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,240
Everyone's watching live.

425
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,590
INTRODUCING NEW BODY CAMERAS
TO SAFEGUARD INSUNG CITIZENS

426
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,800
THIS IS THE UGLY TRUTH OF INSUNG.
PLEASE HELP, SHE'S FIGHTING ALONE.

427
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,220
Shouldn't we provide backup?

428
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,550
Come on, nobody will do that.

429
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,510
Hey, Jae-hong. What's this about?

430
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,930
Does this have to do with the SCIT?

431
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,680
URGENT! UNCOVERING THE MASTERMIND
BEHIND INSUNG'S CRIMES

432
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,640
Is this a recording?

433
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,310
-No, it's streaming live right now.
-That's insane.

434
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,110
This bastard shot a cop?

435
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,860
Isn't everyone else at the Victory Hotel?
Shouldn't we provide backup?

436
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,110
Who is this? He looks pretty normal.

437
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,490
He's not an ex-convict, is he?

438
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,360
Isn't this Senior Officer Ji Han-na?

439
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,780
She was dying to get out there and now…

440
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,200
But this looks too dangerous.

441
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,910
Captain, have you seen…

442
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,660
Captain?

443
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,830
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up and share this.

444
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,760
EVERYONE, PLEASE WATCH THIS…

445
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,720
LIVE CHAT

446
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,220
Do these people know about this?

447
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,180
Publicly, we'll present a strong response

448
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,480
through the special joint task force
and control the media narrative--

449
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,350
If this keeps up,
we can't cover for Insung anymore.

450
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,770
I understand.

451
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,230
-That's why I'm telling you--
-A comment, please, Commissioner!

452
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,690
What are you doing behind locked doors?

453
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,400
-What's going on?
-Seriously!

454
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,160
-Do you even know what's going on?
-Hey, bring me my phone.

455
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,580
Hey, give me mine.

456
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,380
What's this all about?

457
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,300
PROSECUTION-POLICE JOINT TASK FORCE
HOLDS EMERGENCY PRIVATE MEETING

458
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,090
I went to so many convenience stores to--

459
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,470
Why?

460
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,900
So what's the deal?

461
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,030
PROSECUTORS AND POLICE BLOCK PRESS ACCESS
MEETING HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

462
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,770
You crazy bitch.

463
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,230
Mr. Min, she's really something else.

464
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,440
My clothes are ruined because of you.
I'm covered in powder.

465
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,110
Boss.

466
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,530
Damn it.

467
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,660
Mr. Min.

468
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,040
Starting from Yoon Dong-ju…

469
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,590
You guys are such a pain in the ass.

470
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
Please take care of the goods.

471
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,390
Go downstairs and get the trucks ready.

472
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,510
Yes, sir.

473
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,810
Hey. Don't you dare move.

474
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,020
Let's go.

475
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,700
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

476
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,670
Why are you taking so many painkillers?

477
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,080
I have to go.

478
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,790
No, you don't.

479
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,170
Hey, Dung-ju.

480
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,420
Dung-ju, you can't go out in that shape.

481
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,010
-Officer Yoon, you might die.
-You'll just be a burden.

482
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:26,850
Officer Yoon!

483
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,580
I'm exhausted.

484
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,370
Should we wrap this up?

485
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,330
Come on.

486
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,460
This is the end of the line.

487
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,550
I'll give you an unforgettable experience.

488
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,660
Who the hell are you?

489
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,040
PAWNSHOP

490
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,710
What's going on?

491
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,840
We're outnumbered!

492
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,600
-They're fighting like crazy!
-Help us!

493
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,480
That's right! Get him!

494
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
Get him!

495
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,060
Good job!

496
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,150
Where are you going?

497
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,900
<i>-Officer Yoon!</i>
-What are you saying?

498
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,460
Hey!

499
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,130
You punks.

500
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,690
Go upstairs! Hurry!

501
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,360
That's dangerous!

502
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,770
Bye now.

503
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,030
If you pull that trigger, you'll die too.

504
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,000
Everyone's after me today.

505
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,910
But it seems

506
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,000
you're aiming at the wrong person.

507
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,750
No, it was always aimed at you.

508
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,140
I know who killed your father.

509
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,260
What?

510
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,100
Oh Dollar didn't kill your father.

511
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,900
I know who killed your father.

512
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,530
Do you want my help?

513
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,650
Who was it?

514
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,950
Oh Dollar.

515
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,500
The man who killed your father
gave you that gun.

516
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,390
Hey. Go.

517
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
You're forgetting your place,
you Black Cat bastard!

518
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,960
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

519
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:05,960
You asshole!

520
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,530
Fuck!

521
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,200
Mr. Min!

522
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,870
You okay?

523
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,490
Damn it.

524
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,540
I'm heading down.

525
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,960
There's one more left.

526
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,920
What took you so long to get here?

527
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,220
Jeez, it's been a while
since I've used my fists.

528
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,590
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

529
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,470
It's coming from my foot.

530
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,770
Where the hell is Dong-ju?

531
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,720
Dong-ju?

532
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:00,640
He helped out a bit before leaving.

533
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,270
Where did he go?

534
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,400
Hey.

535
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,320
Move.

536
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,950
Hey, make way.

537
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:22,660
Move.

538
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:34,890
What the heck?

539
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,050
Who is that?

540
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,820
What the hell?

541
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,280
You'd better bite down,
or this will knock your jaw loose.

542
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,330
-Hey, look!
-Quick! Get a shot of that!

543
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,110
Are you okay? What the hell did you do?

544
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,150
You'll get killed here!

545
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,030
Everyone needs to know who the bad guy is.

546
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,240
Hurry up and get in.

547
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,700
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

548
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,910
Who was that?

549
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,880
Move out!

550
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,850
Why are you helping me?

551
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,480
I'm merely returning kindness,
though it's belated.

552
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,570
Where's your father?
Why did you come alone?

553
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,320
-You little bastard.
-What's going on here?

554
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,200
Who the hell are you?

555
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,830
He must be a cop. Run!

556
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,390
It's okay.

557
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,730
What's your name?

558
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,350
Leo.

559
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,560
How old are you?

560
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,280
I'm 18.

561
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,570
Give that to me.

562
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,660
This doesn't look right for you.

563
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,250
<i>Maybe</i>

564
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,630
<i>this is God's way…</i>

565
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,670
of finally letting me make amends.

566
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,440
Let's get you up.

567
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,710
I didn't hurt you too badly, did I?

568
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,880
You son of a bitch!

569
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,430
Why can't you gentlemen calm down?

570
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,900
If you go down the hallway,
you'll see an exit.

571
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,700
My men will be there.

572
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,330
Take this.

573
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,540
It belonged to your father.

574
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,140
Hey, look who it is.

575
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,520
Where are you taking the elevator to?

576
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,570
I need to take it. Get off.

577
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,530
I said get off!

578
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,450
What are you waiting for?

579
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,990
Get back here!

580
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,260
<i>Is there anything you want?</i>

581
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,600
I want a digital camera.

582
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,640
A digital camera?

583
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,060
One that records too.

584
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,380
Where the hell is it?

585
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,020
-Captain, over there.
-Okay.

586
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,910
Captain, watch the truck!

587
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,080
Get out of the damn car!

588
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,200
-Ram into them!
-Out of the way!

589
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,580
Just ram into them!

590
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,330
Watch out, Captain!

591
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,880
Hold on tight! Oh, you're all set.

592
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,800
There's nowhere to go.

593
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,310
No turning back! Get out of my way!

594
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,220
Out of my way!

595
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:01,810
What's this?

596
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,410
Have they lost their minds?

597
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,580
Let's go up.

598
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,040
Go upstairs and get the money.

599
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,760
Yoon Dong…

600
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,430
-Who did you say it was?
-Yoon Dong…

601
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,520
Who was it? Tell me.

602
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,640
Yoon…

603
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,730
Jeez, take good care of yourself.

604
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,230
Take him away.

605
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,240
RESTRICTED NUMBER

606
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,360
<i>The person you are calling…</i>

607
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,380
It's so damn loud.

608
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,980
Hey.

609
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,650
Think you can manage?

610
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,730
Once you start a fight,
you have to see it through.

611
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,740
See you later.

612
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,200
I didn't mean he should take off.

613
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,490
<i>The moment you step into the ring,</i>

614
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,250
<i>there's no turning back.</i>

615
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,210
<i>Once you're in,</i>

616
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,710
<i>you've got to go all the way.</i>

617
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,550
Dong-ju, they're all here!

618
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
Over here!

619
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,160
<i>Give it your all and move forward.</i>

620
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:34,300
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

621
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,430
<i>Load.</i>

622
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,930
<i>Start.</i>

623
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:56,700
<i>It's time to pull the trigger…</i>

624
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,950
<i>and break the silence.</i>

625
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,790
<i>Take this.</i>

626
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,080
<i>It belonged to your father.</i>

627
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,960
Min Ju-yeong!

628
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,750
<i>Did you come alone?</i>

629
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,500
<i>-He's not one to die that easily.</i>
-You bastard!

630
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,130
<i>Han-na.</i>

631
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,880
<i>Han-na, get it together. Ji Han-na!</i>

632
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,140
<i>Shut the hell up!</i>

633
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,300
Your trucks came too damn late.

634
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,430
<i>Someone told Min Ju-yeong</i>
<i>that I came here.</i>

635
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,770
<i>Min Ju-yeong won't give up the Candy.</i>

636
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,650
<i>Just out of curiosity,</i>

637
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,690
<i>when did you start hating me?</i>

638
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,280
From the beginning.

639
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,990
Why?

640
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,650
<i>Your smile bothered me.</i>

641
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,280
<i>No matter how battered and broken he is…</i>

642
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,540
<i>a king never dies…</i>

643
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,580
<i>until he's crushed</i>

644
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,460
<i>his opponent.</i>

645
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,050
