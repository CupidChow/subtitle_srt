1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,020
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,350
In the 1960s,
the undisputed world heavyweight champion

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,060
was Sonny Liston.

5
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,360
There was a rookie who challenged him.

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,440
The challenger was only 22 years old,

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,120
and the world expected the champion
to win by a landslide.

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,870
Experience.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,540
Reach.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,620
Punch.

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,420
The champion dominated
the challenger in every aspect.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
However…

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,880
in the seventh round,

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,010
the challenger took down the champion.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,850
To win this match,

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,260
I have to float like a butterfly.

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,390
Just like the challenger,

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,190
Muhammad Ali.

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,950
My dear Dong-ju.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,280
Why did you cause trouble
right after getting your act together?

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,780
Why did you break the glass?

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,200
It's not like I wanted to break it.

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,540
I barely tapped it.
I see.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,000
Then what if I just barely tap your face?

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,960
How much can a glass window cost anyway?

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,300
Including sales taxes,
it costs 3.3 million won.

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,340
What?
What?

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,840
Why is it so expensive? Let me see that.

29
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,850
The Korea Customs Service sent over
a 3.3 million won repair invoice.

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,100
REPAIR INVOICE

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,890
This doesn't qualify
as a business expense,

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,600
so take care of it yourself.

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,810
Jeez, 3.3 million won…

34
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,860
It's double-glazed glass.
No wonder it's expensive.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Do you own a glass store?
Yeah.

36
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,910
My family owns one.

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,490
What the heck?

38
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,970
Mr. Min.

39
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,510
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,060
Why are you disrupting
the workplace these days?

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,270
I'm sorry, sir. This won't happen again--

42
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,020
That goes without saying.

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,070
I had a hard time
covering for you this time.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,820
You know that, right?

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,120
Thank you, sir.
That's it?

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,380
I made dinner reservations
at your favorite restaurant.

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,920
You did? That place is expensive.

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,840
It's the least I can do for you, sir.

49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,220
Also, about the Libya business trip.

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,760
Would you mind if I went in your place?

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,520
I've always wanted to go.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,520
Really?

53
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,020
That works for me.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,980
It's nice over there,
and it'll broaden your horizons.

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,200
I'll report this to the higher-ups.
Yes, sir.

56
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,990
Mr. Min.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,830
Mind your actions from now on, okay?

58
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,750
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,670
Hey, Mr. Min.

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,710
Why are you so cute?

61
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,630
You're just adorable.

62
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,550
All right, then.

63
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,240
Is it good?
Very.

64
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,990
Have they found
the missing correctional officer?

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,000
They claim he went into hiding
because of his gambling debts,

66
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,670
but I don't think they're going to try,
and it's not in our jurisdiction.

67
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,790
More importantly,

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,300
our priority should be
the two Korean Chinese fugitives.

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,130
The RIU hasn't caught them yet,
so let's beat them to it.

70
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,090
Let's canvas Chinatown
and figure out who they are.

71
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,550
They're illegal immigrants
from Yanbian and Harbin.

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
I already ran a background check on them.

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,270
Captain, remember the day
when you were high like this?

74
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,230
Shouldn't we locate the van
that picked up those two thugs?

75
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,940
I asked the Traffic Management Center
to track the van's route and its details.

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,860
Just having you here puts me at ease.

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,740
I feel full and satisfied already.

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,580
Here, have this.
Thank you, sir.

79
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,500
What are you talking about?
We need to get the hit-and-run guy first.

80
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,670
That case is more complicated
than you think.

81
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,670
We have to be thorough to crack it.

82
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,920
That's why we need
to arrest that bastard and--

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,050
Here, eat this.

84
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,720
Right. If we jump the gun now,
we can't do anything about it later.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,890
And someone within the agency
is leaking information.

86
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,810
This means we need to be
more discreet and methodical.

87
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,390
Sergeant Kim is always right.

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,350
I agree.

89
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm sure there are more cases
we're unaware of.

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,190
Right, we shouldn't rush into things.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,360
Look at you.
We shouldn't…

92
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,110
You hardly earn your keep,
but you never skip a meal, huh?

93
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,490
I heard you got reassigned, Sergeant Kim.

94
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,780
Is this where you ended up?

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,620
You could've joined the RIU.

96
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
A person should be in a place
that suits them.

97
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,170
This place feels right to me.

98
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,460
Is that so?

99
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,290
Then good luck to you.

100
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,800
Why are those punks being so childish?

101
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,640
Sergeant Kim and Senior Officer Ji,

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,470
find Silver Bunny
and the Korean Chinese guys.

103
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,430
Senior Officer Shin and Dung-ju,
look into Oh Jong-gu.

104
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,020
I'm sure you'll find something.

105
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,560
From now on,
our team will operate in these two pairs.

106
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,860
You can't just pair us up like that.

107
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,400
Even a captain should consider
everyone's opinions before deciding.

108
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,610
Is everyone okay with this?

109
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Yes, sir.
Yes, I like being with Dung-ju.

110
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm okay with it too.

111
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,870
Okay with what?

112
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,410
You want to partner with him?

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,710
Yeah.
Why? You should be with me.

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,420
Why?
Why?

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,040
Why?
Why?

116
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,510
What do you mean?

117
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,970
Why do I have to partner with you?

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,930
That's because…

119
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,260
I mean…

120
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,470
Why him?

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Because I can learn
a lot more from him than you.

122
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,730
Good point.

123
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,270
Senior Officer Ji sure is sharp.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,650
HANO GLASS

125
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,570
STOCK PRICE: 201,000
MARKET CAP: 1.7862 TRILLION

126
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,450
Hano Glass.

127
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,320
It's a key player
in the building material industry.

128
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,660
Didn't you know Sergeant Kim
is the second son of that family?

129
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,620
I knew he came from money,

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,250
but I mean,
you can't call this a glass store.

131
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,000
It's technically a glass store
but on a global scale.

132
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,920
We're definitely not compatible.

133
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,300
I'm surprised you agreed to
partner with me.

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,430
I didn't think you'd like it.

135
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't get the wrong idea.
It doesn't mean anything.

136
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,470
And there's nothing to dislike.

137
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,270
Dong-ju, you're acting insecure.

138
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,190
You're acting weird, Jae-hong.

139
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,730
You've been low-key
taking his side these days.

140
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,110
What are you talking about?

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,030
I'm not going with you.

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,070
Hey, Dung-ju!

143
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey, what are you doing?

144
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,750
I'm an ignorant officer
with a long way to go,

145
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,800
so I want to learn from an amazing mentor.

146
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,010
So please let me go with him,
Senior Officer Ji.

147
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,220
Cut the crap and get out.

148
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,720
Hey!

149
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,770
Suit yourself.

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,500
I can't wait to work with you, sir.

151
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,460
Stop acting cute.

152
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,330
And drop the formal tone
and just be yourself.

153
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,330
But why, sir?

154
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,170
Why? Tell me why, sir.

155
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,800
Shall we get going then?

156
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,390
Yes.

157
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,430
You're my senior colleague,
so feel free to speak casually.

158
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,730
That'll come in time.

159
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,610
Okay.

160
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,540
Please take a good look.

161
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,580
I said I don't know. Go away!

162
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm from the Insung Police Agency.
Have you seen--

163
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
I don't know him.

164
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,920
Have you seen this--
I said go away!

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,420
Don't you dare come back!

166
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,630
Let's go elsewhere.

167
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,650
J9 SECURITY

168
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,650
Why did you share my schedule
without even asking me?

169
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,780
When did they call?
About 30 minutes ago.

170
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,570
If they come here,

171
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,990
tell them I'm away on a business trip.
Okay.

172
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,100
You told me he had no plans today
when I called earlier.

173
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,020
That was then. This is now.

174
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,980
When will he be back?
I'm not sure.

175
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,110
Where did he go?

176
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,030
Seongjin City.

177
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,280
Isn't the car parked outside
Mr. Oh Jong-gu's car?

178
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,790
I guess he left his car behind.

179
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,620
He took the train.

180
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,250
But Seongjin City
doesn't have a train station.

181
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,880
They're gone.

182
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,340
Mr. Oh.

183
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,680
You should've sent them off quickly.

184
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,430
Why did you answer all of their questions?

185
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
I was just…

186
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,190
I wish you could use your head more.

187
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,150
Jeez, my neck feels so stiff.

188
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,110
Hello, sir.

189
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,030
Mr. Oh, I thought you were gone,
but you came out of nowhere.

190
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
I thought you had just left.

191
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,080
But then again,
there are many entrances here.

192
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,700
That's a nice watch.

193
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Thank you.

194
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,900
Damn it.

195
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,570
Not again.

196
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,450
Did we get a match
on that van from the system?

197
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,570
You were right.

198
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,070
It's an unregistered van.

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
What about its route?

200
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,080
I analyzed the CCTV footage
starting at the abandoned building,

201
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,120
but I lost track
at the Baekdang-dong Intersection.

202
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,340
So his family has more buildings like that
across the country, huh?

203
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,350
Then why did the young master
become a cop?

204
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,260
It must be the young master's hobby.

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,100
Becoming a cop is one thing.

206
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,560
Why did you join the SCIT?

207
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,150
You went back and forth.
You're all over the place.

208
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,400
It's for the same reason as you.

209
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,450
What?

210
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,950
I still like Han-na.

211
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
Get out. I have an appointment to attend.

212
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,720
I can't bring myself to like him.

213
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,550
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

214
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,140
Have a good night.

215
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,140
Okay.

216
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,680
Good night.

217
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,330
Get in.

218
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm here to rob you.

219
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,420
Cut the crap and come inside.

220
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,420
Okay.

221
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,520
I told you not to put eggs in it.

222
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,390
I ought to boil your mouth instead.

223
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,390
Without eggs,
ramyeon wouldn't have made it so big.

224
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,020
Ramyeon companies owe tons to the hens.

225
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,020
If you don't like it,
eat it raw and drink hot water.

226
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,120
Who's the big fish
in car smuggling these days?

227
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,950
When it comes to that market,

228
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,160
Gwang-se has been in control
for a long time.

229
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,790
Gwang-se?

230
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,040
As in the baldy Lee Gwang-se
with an eagle tattoo on his arm?

231
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,670
It's a bald eagle tattoo.

232
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,340
But he's not doing well
because some guy has invaded his turf.

233
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,380
Who's this guy?

234
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,670
I don't know everything.

235
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,430
Ask Gwang-se yourself.

236
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,300
I should've brought liquor instead.

237
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,600
Have you come across this recently?

238
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,650
My word, this again?

239
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,530
What is it?
Did someone come here with this?

240
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,410
A rather unattractive woman
came a while ago.

241
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,780
I've never seen
such an unattractive woman.

242
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,490
A woman?

243
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,790
Back in 2008,

244
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,170
a Russian mafia member was shot dead here.

245
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,090
Your father was in charge of the scene.

246
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,890
I'm not sure
whether I should show you these, but…

247
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,100
These are the crime scene photos
from your father's case.

248
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,740
The van was caught on camera
in a different area.

249
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Where?

250
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,490
On the hill leading to Sinhu-ro
from Cheongma-ro, Yuwol-gu.

251
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,160
It was caught on camera there a few times.

252
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,170
Let's go.

253
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,630

257
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,610

258
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,860

WINNER
THE 7TH YOUTH SHOOTING COMPETITION

262
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,840
Han-na, promise you won't tell your mom
we had hamburgers.

263
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,600
Obviously, Dad.

264
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,350
That's what you said before
but you told her we had pizza,

265
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,520
stabbing me in the back.

266
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,770
But she kept asking me.

267
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,940
Is there anything you want?

268
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,110
I want a digital camera.
A digital camera?

269
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,190
One that records too.

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,690
I want to record myself training
and correct my posture.

271
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,410
At this rate,
you'll sweep all the gold medals.

272
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,290
That's nothing, Dad.
I'm going to set the world record too.

273
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,790
Will you let me use this too?

274
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,790
No, it's just for me.

275
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,380
Come on, share with me.

276
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,550
Then let me see you fire your gun.

277
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,470
Han-na, the thing about real guns

278
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,640
is that you only show them to bad guys.

279
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Bang!

280
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,010
That's not fair.

281
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Then I want to be a cop.

282
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,310
Go for it.

283
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,940
You can be whatever you want.

284
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,730
This is mine, okay?

Hello, sir.

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,920
Hello, sir.

294
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,760
My word, this again?

295
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,020
Did someone come here with this?

296
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,270
A rather unattractive woman
came a while ago.

297
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,100
I've never seen
such an unattractive woman.

298
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,980
What's wrong?
What?

299
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,900
It's nothing.

300
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,200
How did it go with Oh Jong-gu?

301
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,750
He just gave routine answers.

302
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,420
"I only helped a former student

303
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
who was like a younger brother to me."

304
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,460
I only helped a former student
who was like a younger brother to me.

305
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,050
Is that a crime?

306
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,680
If I had committed a crime--

307
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,140
It would've been failing
to guide him on the right path.

308
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,850
You're repeating what you said
during your interview.

309
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,980
As if you memorized it.
You're pretty blunt.

310
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,440
What is this?

311
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm starting to get upset.

312
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,820
Are you implying
I had a hand in Gyeong-il's death?

313
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,500
Did you?

314
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,590
I don't appreciate…

315
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,680
the way you're talking to me.

316
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,970
"I don't appreciate the way
you're talking to me."

317
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,430
In any case, he was the last person
to see Lee Gyeong-il before he confessed,

318
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
so keep looking into him.

319
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,190
Will do.

320
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,730
What about you two?

321
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,150
We didn't find out much.

322
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,950
The Chinatown merchants couldn't even look
at the photos of the Korean Chinese guys.

323
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,660
It seems like someone shut them up.

324
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,870
And as for the getaway van…

325
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,080
It was unregistered
and difficult to track.

326
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,330
Chinatown is Golden Bunny's territory.

327
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,670
The gang has been broken up,
so why won't they cooperate?

328
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,710
I'm not sure.

329
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,840
Silver Bunny is wanted right now,
so he can't have any pull either.

330
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,260
But why did you two go together,

331
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,300
and not Sergeant Kim?

332
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
What is it?

333
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,400
Well…

334
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,520
Come on, tell me.

335
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,320
PAWNSHOP

336
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,610
Hello?

337
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,150
You found him?

338
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,950
Got it. Thank you.

339
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,250
All right.

340
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,410
Where's Yoon Dong-ju?

341
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,000
Dong-ju.

342
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,250
Hey, wake up.

343
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,880
Yoon Dong-ju!

344
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,090
What did you do last night
to still be sleeping like a log?

345
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,430
I ought to just…

346
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,220
That Min Ju-yeong…

347
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,270
Hurry up. We have somewhere to be.

348
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,310
Where are we going? Wait!

349
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,690
Where are we going?

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,240
GWANG-SE

351
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,430
The procedure turned out well, sir.

352
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,260
Look at all this hair you have now.

353
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,390
Be gentle.

354
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,560
It hasn't been long,
and my hair is fragile.

355
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,150
I told you to be gentle!

356
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,700
Lose the tension in your hands
and rub gently with your fingers.

357
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,780
Are you doing laundry or something?

358
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,080
Seriously.

359
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,410
What is this?

360
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,370
How much hair did I lose?

361
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,800
Do you know how much this cost me?

362
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,970
Detective, what are you doing here?

363
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,690
I have a question for you.

364
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,350
I see. You have a question for me.

365
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,150
Your eyes must sting.
Just a bit.

366
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,530
Move!

367
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Out of my way!

368
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,000
Get out of the way!

369
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,330
Move!

370
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,380
Wait for me!

371
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,470
Make way!
You have to return the gown!

372
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,260
Hey, you punk!

373
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,230
Sorry!

374
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,780
Take the other way and cut him off!
Yes, sir!

375
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,960
Jeez, what a heavy bastard.

376
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,130
Was that really necessary?

377
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,550
I just wanted to ask a question.
Why did you run?

378
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,470
What is it?

379
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
This here.

380
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,980
You smuggled it in and passed it
to the Golden Bunny Gang, right?

381
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,610
I'm out of the game,
so I don't know anything.

382
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,820
If you're out,
then who's running things now?

383
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,110
I said I don't know.
It'd be better if you do.

384
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,540
Goodness.

385
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,250
Most smugglers stash their earnings
in cash or gold bars.

386
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,840
But you stashed yours in your hair.

387
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,840
All criminal proceeds
must be confiscated by the government

388
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,170
one by one.

389
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,130
You learned a lot by copying that book.

390
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,390
The best kind of eagle is a bald eagle.

391
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,930
Your hair is too long.

392
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,140
Let's get started.

393
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,100
Start what? Hold on a second.

394
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,270
No, wait! I'll tell you!

395
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,940
His name is Monkey.

396
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,360
He's the best in the country
when it comes to smuggling cars.

397
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,160
There's a guy at Insung Customs
who covers for him.

398
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,280
He keeps detaining all of my goods

399
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,450
but clears Monkey's stuff
without inspecting them.

400
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,290
So what else can I do
but shut down my business?

401
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,160
That bastard customs officer…

402
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,460
There's this leech
in the Surveillance Division.

403
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
His name is Min Ju-yeong.

404
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,090
MIN JU-YEONG
KOREA CUSTOMS SERVICE

405
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,970
So are you saying

406
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,970
this guy named Monkey still has that car?

407
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,760
Yes. That car's a limited edition model,
even overseas.

408
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,930
With some minor repairs, you can resell it
at well over triple the value.

409
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,650
He moves his goods
through Libya and Russia.

410
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,400
When news spread
about that one being in Korea,

411
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,030
people have been contacting me nonstop

412
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,450
to learn when it'd go into the market.
When is it?

413
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,610
After all the paperwork is done,
it'll be gone by tomorrow at the latest.

414
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,790
They say egg yolk is good for hair loss,
so eat up.

415
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,670
It's a fertilized egg.

416
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,800
Answer when I call later.

417
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,300
Goddammit.

418
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,480
This is pretty.

419
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,310
You seem busy these days.

420
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,730
Come on, you should share
what you find out.

421
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,570
Not again. Why does everyone
get so quiet and on edge?

422
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,950
What are you doing?
Excuse me?

423
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,740
Oh, would you like an egg?

424
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,700
No.

425
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,200
What about you, Sergeant Kim?
Nothing.

426
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,500
You're smiling awkwardly again.

427
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,120
You guys are petty.

428
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,790
Good day, sir.
Thanks.

429
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,800
Use the messenger app.

430
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,680
This is Monkey, the car smuggler.

431
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,470
If Min Ju-yeong finds out
we're searching for a car,

432
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,310
it'll disappear along with any cooperation
from the Korea Customs Service.

433
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,440
We'll be racing against the clock
to catch the dealers

434
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,060
and search their warehouses right after.

435
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,480
Will that be possible?

436
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,860
If they're smuggling on a national scale,

437
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,690
they'll have a huge number of warehouses.

438
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,610
Right. We can't handle this on our own.

439
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,910
What in the world are we doing?

440
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,530
Just talk out loud!

441
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,330
Sit down.

442
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,920
Sit down.

443
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,460
I told you we need to be discreet,
you little punk!

444
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,890
I hear only one workshop handles repairs
and dashboard tampering before export.

445
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,760
We just need to raid that place, you punk.

446
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,270
I… understand…

447
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,810
Do you know the location?

448
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,310
We'll find a car they like
and put it out as bait.

449
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,400
That'll get the fence to make a move.

450
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,610
Where will we get a car?

451
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,320
I thought you were smarter than that.

452
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,240
Don't worry.
With this kind of information,

453
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,320
the commissioner will provide a car
and plenty of backup.

454
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,160
THEN ARE WE…

455
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,500
Fine.

456
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,500
Hello.
Hello.

457
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,670
Use that energy in your work.

458
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,960
Salute.
Salute.

459
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,670
Get out, you bastard!

460
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,260
I GUARANTEE INSUNG CITY'S SAFETY

461
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,550
If we can't have the riot police,
then how about a patrol unit?

462
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,890
A patrol unit?

463
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,100
Keep talking,
and I'll have you patrolling hell!

464
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,350
You idiot.

465
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,900
There he comes.

466
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,580
We meet too often.
Cut it, punk.

467
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,750
So what about this car?

468
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,460
What on earth is this junk?

469
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,870
Who would take this piece of crap?

470
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,540
A bait car should be shiny and powerful.

471
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,170
And it should be foreign.

472
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,170
Hey, it's not a piece of crap.
My wife bought it for me.

473
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,550
And who do you think you are
handing over my car?

474
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,180
Because we don't have one!

475
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,600
You promised we'd get support on this.

476
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,810
Forget backup for now.
We need something to catch the bastard.

477
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,930
What about my car?

478
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,100
Let's take a look.

479
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,440
Well, it's not bad,

480
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,320
but it's not enough
to make you drool over it.

481
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,700
Captain.

482
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,870
I inquired with the Korea Customs Service
and apparently,

483
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,740
Min Ju-yeong is going
on an overseas business trip.

484
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,290
He's leaving next Monday.

485
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,200
The bastard's making a run for it.

486
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,040
We should just drag him here.

487
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,210
Be quiet. I'm restless as is
even without you piling in.

488
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,710
Where can we find
a shiny new car in a day?

489
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,010
How about a black sedan with low mileage,
no prior accidents, and a 3,000 CC engine?

490
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,300
It's a German model too.

491
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,680
That's the type of car
that dealers go nuts over.

492
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,980
It'd be total chaos.

493
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,560
There's one right over there.

494
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,690
Hey, that's nice.

495
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,610
Whose is it? It has temporary tags.

496
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,570
What are you doing?

497
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,370
Is it the commissioner's car?
Did he get a new one?

498
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,080
It's perfect.

499
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,830
Are you out of your mind?

500
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,660
You want to use
the commissioner's car as bait?

501
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,710
Why not?

502
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,210
What?
It sounds good to me.

503
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,130
Not you too, Sergeant Kim.

504
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,750
Sometimes, you have to make bad choices

505
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,260
for the sake of justice.

506
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,760
Keep me out of this.

507
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,300
We'll borrow it and return it.

508
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,720
Captain.

509
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
I'm going to lose it.

510
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,480
But how many years would we get
for stealing the commissioner's car?

511
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,700
Anyone call a designated driver?

512
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,670
I don't feel good.

513
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,230
Everyone, focus.

514
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,230
Monkey has major trust issues,

515
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,070
so he doesn't do
face-to-face transactions.

516
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,240
When I drop off the car
at the designated location,

517
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,870
they'll remove the GPS and take it.

518
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,120
If you pull a fast one,

519
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,960
you know what'll happen, right?

520
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,250
Come on, I'd never do that.

521
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,460
I'm a professional when it comes to work.

522
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,710
I don't mess around.

523
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,340
I'll get in touch
once the location is set.

524
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,780
Please ring these up too.

525
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,570
We can't do a stakeout
on an empty stomach, right?

526
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,070
Please ring those up.

527
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,420
That woke me up.

528
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,430
You should wake up too, sir.

529
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,510
Thank you for the treats.

530
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,950
They left already. You're with me. Get in.

531
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,730
Those two look pretty cozy.

532
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,690
It's the perfect setup
for romance to bloom.

533
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,110
Like this. And this.

534
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,830
But it probably won't happen.

535
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,370
Hey.

536
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,590
Those little bastards.

537
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,510
Hey, is this it?
Yeah, it is.

538
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,560
Let's get rid of the GPS and go.

539
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,100
It's that egg sushi guy.

540
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,940
Hey! What are you doing to my car?

541
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
Those are the guys
who stole the captain's car.

542
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,610
I got you, you bastards.

543
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,030
Hey!

544
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,320
Is someone in there?

545
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,240
I don't know.

546
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,500
He's coming this way!

547
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,210
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,050
Keep still.
What?

549
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,470
Be quiet.

550
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,830
Have a good time, you two.

551
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,040
Hey, it's nothing.

552
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,170
Okay.

553
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,950
Stop.

554
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,370
Have a great time, you two!

555
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,250
Return to position.

556
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,710
What are you doing?

557
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,790
Returning to position.

558
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,350
The car is on the move.

559
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,640
Okay, Han-na.
We'll move out right now too.

560
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,820
Go find my car right now!

561
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,320
Are you kidding me?

562
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,160
I only had it for a day!

563
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,470
Look at you two.

564
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,890
You've got the undercover look down.

565
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,010
How many are inside?

566
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,270
There seem to be about ten people or so.

567
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,640
Piece of cake.

568
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,020
They usually go through the back to enter,

569
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,560
so let's park here and head in.

570
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,110
Don't worry about others.
Our priority is Monkey.

571
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,900
And don't forget to keep
the commissioner's car safe and sound.

572
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,320
I'll stand guard in the back
so that no one escapes.

573
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,990
Senior Officers Shin and Ji,
take the rear.

574
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,700
The three of us will face them head-on.

575
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,710
Yes, sir.
I hear they use whatever tool is handy,

576
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,290
so grab your gear.

577
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,300
Thank you.

578
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,010
That's mine.

579
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,090
All right.

580
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
Is this supposed to be this small?

581
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,910
Sergeant Kim,
that's way more than ten people.

582
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Let's just go in.
Seriously?

583
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,500
Go in?
Yes.

584
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
On the count of three.
Okay.

585
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,580
One, two, three!

586
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,300
What the heck?

587
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,630
Who are you?

588
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,800
Hey!

589
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,260
Freeze! Put your hands up!

590
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,560
Go find my car right now!

591
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,220
Hey, stop.

592
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,730
Hurry up.
That's what I'm doing.

593
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,070
That punk, Dae-yong,
is trying to take the credit.

594
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,410
RIU, move out!

595
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,490
Move out!
Move out!

596
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,160
Find Monkey. We have to catch him!

597
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,200
Let's do this!

598
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
You're not him!

599
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,860
We have to find Monkey.

600
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,030
Get over here.

601
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,990
You're not him.

602
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,120
Not you either.

603
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,960
Not you!

604
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,510
You're not him!

605
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,560
Where's Monkey?

606
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,110
Get away from me!

607
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,520
Don't come near me!

608
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,360
Go away!

609
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,570
You're not him!

610
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,070
You little punks!

611
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,950
Get lost!

612
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,870
Get away from me!

613
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,290
I said get away from me!

614
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,760
Don't step on the car, Sergeant Kim!

615
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,680
Sergeant Kim!

616
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Don't do that! Get down from there!

617
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,970
Don't step on it!

618
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,270
Sergeant Kim, get off the car!

619
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,980
Get down! You can't do that!

620
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,310
Goddammit!
Please don't do that!

621
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,320
You bastard.

622
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,070
Oh, no! What did I do?

623
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,830
The car! Captain Go, the car!

624
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Nice blocking!

625
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,910
Great job, Captain Go!

626
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,130
Great job, An Dae-yong!

627
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,920
Nicely done, Dae-yong!

628
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,720
Good job!

629
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,460
Hey, Monkey!

630
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,540
Monkey's over there!

631
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,630
RIU, move out!

632
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,630
Damn it!

633
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,840
Hey, grab him! He's climbing up!

634
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,510
You damn bastard!

635
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,390
Hey, they're climbing up!

636
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:04,800
Damn it.

637
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,430
Hey!

638
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,390
Throw the wrenches, boys!

639
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,350
Hey.
Nail them, you punks.

640
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,150
Hey!

641
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,730
Listen! We have to catch Monkey!
RIU, advance!

642
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,580
Hey! That crazy bastard.

643
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,710
Are you okay?
Yeah.

644
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, gosh.

645
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,670
Has that damn bastard lost his mind?

646
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,260
That way, you idiots.

647
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,390
Go that way!
We have to catch Monkey.

648
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,600
Wait here.

649
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,780
Jae-hong!

650
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,160
Jae-hong!

651
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,250
Jae-hong!
No!

652
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,580
Grab him!

653
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,430
Han-na!

654
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,580
Captain!

655
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,460
Captain, watch out!

656
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,340
I'm okay!

657
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,190
Monkey. Where's Monkey?

658
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,240
No, not this car!

659
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,280
Open the door, you bastard!

660
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,450
Why does he keep chasing me?

661
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,200
Where are you going, you bastard?

662
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,380
Please don't go!

663
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,020
Oh, man. We're so screwed.

664
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,940
Kim Jong-hyeon! Go after Monkey!

665
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,410
Captain.

666
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,950
What's this? Let's get you up.

667
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,000
Han-na, are you okay?
Yeah.

668
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,630
Sergeant Kim, please catch Monkey!

669
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,260
Hey!

670
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,050
Hurry up and get moving.

671
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Hurry up.

672
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,640
Stop resisting.
Let's get going.

673
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,770
Captain, the foreign car is gone.
I think they moved it already.

674
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,980
The others are checking the warehouses,
so we'll just have to wait.

675
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,490
And we can't ask Monkey about it.

676
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,240
So much for finding it easily.

677
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,490
Are you okay?

678
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,950
He's here.

679
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,150
Be strong.

680
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,990
I'm screwed.

681
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,620
Just die already!

682
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,040
Hey, Dong-ju.

683
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
Senior Officer Ji.
It's okay. Let them talk it out.

684
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,630
That car is worth more than you!

685
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,430
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

686
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,730
Sir.

687
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,310
Hey.

688
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,110
The perp didn't do any damage elsewhere

689
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,070
except for the single cut
to the carotid artery.

690
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,110
The weapon would've had a sharp tip,

691
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,700
but it's no ordinary knife.

692
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,990
He's a professional.

693
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,580
It was a screw-like knife
about ten centimeters long.

694
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,040
Like a screwdriver?

695
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,960
No, it was something different.

696
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,470
What do you think this is?

697
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,140
Take a look.

698
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,690
Hey, that stings!

699
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,490
I'm sorry, Captain.

700
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,070
Don't be.
Things happen when catching bad guys.

701
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,540
Dae-yong, that bastard!
He has no professional decency…

702
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,420
Do I regret it?

703
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,830
No, not at all.

704
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,710
I'm merely relieved
that my personal sacrifice was enough

705
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,090
to apprehend this group

706
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,760
that tried to exploit the law
for their own gain.

707
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,850
The suspects disguised scrap-bound cars
as legitimate through forgery.

708
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,480
Some of the exports
were vehicles they stole themselves.

709
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,190
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol,
who led this operation…

710
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,280
He's letting the whole world know.

711
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,740
I bet that bastard is watching this.

712
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,610
According to the ongoing investigation,

713
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,410
illegal weapons
such as Russian-made rifles,

714
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,370
swords, and crossbows,
as well as drugs and jewelry,

715
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,160
were discovered
in the vehicles they smuggled,

716
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,910
which have left authorities in shock.

717
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,210
That's a pretty wide range.
What's the total value?

718
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,630
I believe this is connected
to both the Russian mafia

719
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,050
and a drug operation
run by an armed Filipino group.

720
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,140
This goes beyond simple smuggling.
It's on a whole different scale.

721
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:29,850
Hey.

722
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,980
It's not there either?

723
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,730
Okay.

724
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,820
They didn't find Min Ju-yeong's car
in the last warehouse.

725
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,860
Do you think the bald eagle lied?

726
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,820
No, not a single ship has left
overseas yesterday or today.

727
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,660
I'm sure it's still in the country.

728
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,790
Here, Captain.

729
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,460
To export used cars,

730
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,670
you need to apply
for their registration cancellation.

731
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,460
But most of the cars
Monkey's gang tried to export

732
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,420
were unregistered or stolen,
making the paperwork tricky.

733
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,930
So they need to alter
the export approval documents,

734
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,220
but it's nearly impossible
without help from an insider.

735
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,470
Good work.

736
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,430
Mr. Lee Jin-su handled export declarations
at the Korea Customs Service.

737
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,520
The one who handled them before him

738
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,610
was this person.

739
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,610
Hold on. Let's take a look.

740
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,820
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

741
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,200
So the reason Min Ju-yeong

742
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,120
killed Lee Jin-su was…

743
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,700
Because Lee Jin-su realized

744
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,170
that this bastard was dirty.

745
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,290
LEE JIN-SU

746
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,210
CHEONGIL SHIPPING'S IMPORT/EXPORT

747
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,840
Confiscated goods, their management,
and smuggling enforcement

748
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,430
all fall under Min Ju-yeong's duties.

749
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,970
So he's not a regular
corrupt civil servant.

750
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,470
He's deeply involved in every case.

751
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,350
An ordinary civil servant
can't handle all this.

752
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,980
He's a rotten bastard through and through.

753
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:11,950
Here you are.

754
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,330
Did you watch the news?

755
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,080
I did.

756
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,540
It's a mess.

757
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,960
The Audit Office will be summoning

758
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,710
tons of people pretty soon.

759
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,680
Thanks for volunteering
to go on the business trip.

760
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,720
It was giving me a headache
because nobody wanted to go.

761
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,310
It's my job to help you, sir.

762
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,270
By the way,

763
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:43,770
the police agency called
and asked about your business trip.

764
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,450
They did?

765
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,080
What did you tell them?

766
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,490
Hold on. What now?

767
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,290
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

768
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,250
It's the police again.

769
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,590
They're really bothering me.

770
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,500
I'll take care of this on my end,

771
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,300
so don't worry about a thing,
and get ready for your trip.

772
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,510
What is it?

773
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,220
Sir.

774
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,400
Please tell them

775
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,480
that I'm going on the trip on your orders,
not voluntarily.

776
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,440
Otherwise, they might keep pestering you.

777
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,530
Okay.

778
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,660
I'll figure out what to say,
so don't worry.

779
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,540
What's the matter, Mr. Min?

780
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,910
You don't need to figure out what to say.

781
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,630
Just tell them what I told you.

782
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,090
What did I tell you to tell them?

783
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,710
What are you doing?

784
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,050
Hey, Mr. Min.

785
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,760
You little bastard.

786
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,220
I treated you well,
and now you're crossing the line.

787
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,480
Hey, you little punk.

788
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,310
You should know your place, you bastard.

789
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,730
Who do you think you are?

790
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,530
What are you doing?

791
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,700
Hey.

792
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,570
Be quiet.

793
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,580
Be quiet.

794
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,700
I said be quiet.

795
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,540
Sir.

796
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,420
Don't look down. Look at me.

797
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,550
I'm not joking around right now.

798
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,010
I'm being very serious,

799
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,090
so you shouldn't joke around either.

800
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,390
Look at me.

801
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,020
I said look at me.

802
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,690
Listen carefully.

803
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,320
I'm only going on the business trip

804
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,070
because you ordered me to.

805
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,530
Don't say anything else, okay?

806
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,080
Let's move the trip up a few days

807
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,460
so that I leave today.

808
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,790
And from now on,

809
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,210
don't put your hands on me.

810
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,580
I've had a small setback.

811
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,000
There's been a change of plans.

812
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,380
Contact the Philippines and Russia
and have them arrange the tickets.

813
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,010
There are over a thousand containers
going to Libya and Russia this week.

814
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,180
To find smuggled goods,

815
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,140
our only option is to check
each container one by one.

816
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,480
And it'll take time to get
the cargo owner's consent.

817
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,730
We still need to find it
before that bastard escapes.

818
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,900
I'm certain that hit-and-run car is here.

819
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,940
In any case, we need to find that car,

820
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,110
get that matching DNA sample,
and catch him.

821
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,780
I'll go to the back. You guys spread out.

822
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,590
Hello?

823
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,390
Okay.

824
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,180
What is it now?

825
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:48,440
Min Ju-yeong is leaving the country
tonight at seven.

826
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,980
It means he's really on edge.

827
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,400
That car is definitely here.

828
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,730
I'm exhausted as it is.
Why is this asshole making me work more?

829
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,900
Yoon Dong-ju, don't get into trouble!

830
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,450
Where are you going? Yoon Dong-ju!

831
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,360
I'll go with him.

832
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,460
That bastard.

833
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,510
You can't run, you bastard.

834
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,680
What is it now?

835
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,600
I'm Sergeant Kim
from the Insung Police Ageny's SCIT.

836
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,140
We're reinvestigating
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's case.

837
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,640
We'd appreciate your cooperation

838
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:30,560
in accompanying us to the agency
for an interview.

839
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,690
It won't take long.

840
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,520
Of course, I'll cooperate.

841
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,900
But I'm going on a business trip.

842
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,320
My flight leaves at seven,
so I'm afraid I can't today.

843
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,070
If you don't mind,
I'll cooperate when I return.

844
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,910
We do mind.

845
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,830
Listen carefully.

846
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,920
We can arrest you as a murder suspect
and interrogate you for 24 hours.

847
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,750
I see you studied a lot.

848
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:56,800
I guess my assignment helped.

849
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,550
I might take the bar exam, thanks to you.

850
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,890
If you think you can stop me
using legal means…

851
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,310
go ahead and try.

852
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,070
Also,

853
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,320
you should get your facts straight.

854
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,080
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il didn't die
because of me.

855
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,580
He died because of you.

856
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,670
If you had stayed out of it,
he might still be alive.

857
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,570
Hey, let's go.

858
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,970
That damn bastard.

859
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,640
What the heck? Where is he going?

860
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,180
Isn't the airport straight ahead?

861
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,940
Follow him.

862
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,070
Where did he go?
Jeez, did he have come up here?

863
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:50,160
This is the police.
We need your cooperation.

864
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,790
I'm getting a call. One second.

865
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,120
Did you find it?

866
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,630
We're on official duty. Please excuse us.

867
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,540
We found it.

868
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,590
He vanished.
I think he knows we found the car.

869
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:07,550
What?

870
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,300
Where are you right now?

871
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,470
So they found it?

872
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,100
All right.

873
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,190
So you're hiding
because you're scared, huh?

874
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,240
They're making things more complicated.

875
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,950
Wrap up the scene
and hand it over to the NFS.

876
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,250
And request a departure ban
against Min Ju-yeong.

877
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:38,170
Yes, sir.

878
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,000
Senior Officer Ji, let's go.
Yes, sir.

879
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,210
Yoon Dong-ju, did you find him?

880
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,170
I'm sorry!

881
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,430
There you are.

882
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,140
I'll make sure Min Ju-yeong
can't get on that plane,

883
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,730
so tell them to get an arrest warrant.

884
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,480
Yoon Dong-ju!

885
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,440
Take the radio.
Thank you.

886
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,080
You're done for.

887
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,910
Where are you?

888
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,380
We're in a residential area
on a hillside road near Seo-dong.

889
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,460
We'll head over there.

890
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,300
We're in pursuit on a residential road.

891
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,920
Okay, keep your radio on.
I'll go straight to the entrance.

892
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,980
Where are you, Dong-ju?
I don't see Min Ju-yeong.

893
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:29,150
You'll need to go to the lower part
of the residential area.

894
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,490
I'm going to catch up to you.

895
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,370
Got it.

896
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,060
What the heck? Hey!
I'm sorry, sir!

897
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,900
Hey, you little punk!
You can't just go like that!

898
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,860
Min Ju-yeong spotted.

899
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:57,360
I lost him.

900
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:02,910
Damn it.

901
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,790
I'm sorry.

902
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,030
Come on.

903
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,070
I'm sorry!

904
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,030
What the heck?

905
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:55,210
He's at the intersection.

906
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,720
We're almost there.

907
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,180
Come on, kids.

908
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,730
Hello. Are you dropping him off?

909
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,850
Where does the kid live? Here?

910
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:11,860
Okay, let's go.

911
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:45,470
Steamed Bun!

912
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,890
What the hell are you going to do?

913
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,810
Isn't it obvious?

914
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,360
To catch the bastard,

915
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,440
I have to float like a butterfly…

916
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,610
and sting like a bee.

917
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,870
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!

918
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,160
Dong-ju!

919
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,330
What's the matter with you?

920
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,000
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Are you okay?

921
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,300
Yoon Dong-ju.

922
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,600
Yoon Dong-ju.

923
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,430
Yoon Dong-ju!

924
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,600
Are you okay?

925
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,770
Seriously.

926
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,360
Of course.

927
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,360
I'm fine.

928
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:46,450
No, you're not.

929
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,370
I need to call 119.

930
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:54,880
Damn it.

931
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,050
Hello, is this 119?

932
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,800
The address here is…

933
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,180
Damn it.

934
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:04,890
Hey.

935
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,550
Hey!

936
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,150
Special Act on Traffic Accidents.

937
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,980
Violation of school zones,

938
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,070
and a casualty accident.

939
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:25,530
You're not getting on a plane today.
Want to know why?

940
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,910
Because I won't agree to a settlement.

941
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,950
You damn asshole!

942
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,050
Hey.

943
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:47,590
Hey.

944
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,100
He keeps laughing.
Please get here quickly.

945
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,140
You're crazy.

946
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,850
What's so funny?

947
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,320
You asshole!

948
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,320
That bastard is going to stall
until it blows over.

949
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:50,120
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

950
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,370
Senior Officer Ji, take care of Dong-ju.

951
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,910
He doesn't listen to others,
but he listens to you.

952
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,750
I'm here to tell you something, Han-na.

953
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,960
There's definitely someone backing him.

954
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,340
Run away as best as you can. Good luck.

955
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,680
This is a synthetic drug called Candy.

956
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,930
I think it made its way
into Korea recently.

957
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:14,310
The manufacturer of Candy

958
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:15,390
is Drug Demon.

959
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,060
Hey, Dung-ju!
Hey!

960
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,940
In this day and age,

961
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,770
how often do you see a man
willing to sacrifice himself

962
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,320
for the woman he loves?

963
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,030
