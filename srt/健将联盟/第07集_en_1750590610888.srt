1
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,720
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,970
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,360
-Hey, open this up.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,070
Mr. Min.

5
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,830
I'm sending them to the City Council,
the mayor, and the Prosecutors' Office.

6
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,370
Divide them up and pack them well.

7
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,710
Got it.

8
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,500
-Hey, pack them up.
-Yes, sir.

9
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,920
Can we go out now?

10
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,000
What was that?

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,510
These guys helped bring in the goods.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,390
What should we do?
They could be trouble if we leave them.

13
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,470
Please don't kill us.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,480
We won't tell anyone what we saw here.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,020
Wouldn't it be better…

16
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,900
if they couldn't speak at all?

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,190
Nice and neat.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,900
-I came to see my family.
-Hey.

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,530
-Please let me go.
-You stink.

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,620
Don't you have a family?

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,280
Unfortunately, I don't.

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,080
Even if I had one…

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Please spare me!

24
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,040
Please spare me!

25
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,890
I would've killed them
like I did just now.

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Did I do something wrong again?

27
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,390
No.

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,560
I did something wrong.

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
I should've just beaten you to death
back then.

30
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,400
It's my fault.

31
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,610
Your face tells me

32
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,410
my counterpunch landed pretty well.

33
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,750
So it really was you.

34
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,290
Even a champion like you

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,540
should've been ready to take a hit or two
once you entered the ring.

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,300
Thanks.

37
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,510
For what?

38
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,510
For giving me a reason
to beat the hell out of you

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
without a second thought.

40
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,470
I'm going to…

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,730
kill you right here.

42
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,790
Hey.

43
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,250
Hey!

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey!

45
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,130
Where the hell did this punk go?

46
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,670
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

47
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,170
Captain.

48
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,800
I think I know where Dung-ju is.

49
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,030
What are you doing here
after causing trouble?

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,790
Do you know what you did?

51
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,500
You need to control your temper.

52
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,330
-Do you know what--
-What?

53
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,470
What was I supposed to do?

54
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
Hey.

55
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,750
Fortunately, she's going to make it.

56
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,010
But we'll have to wait and see
when she'll wake up.

57
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
With no CCTVs
in and out of the restaurant,

58
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,090
it won't be easy to find out
what exactly happened.

59
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,680
We found traces of gunfire,

60
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,640
but your gun was clean
with no fingerprints.

61
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,940
We need to find evidence
that Min Ju-yeong did it.

62
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,520
But isn't it strange?

63
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,070
The bullet went through
the scapular artery.

64
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,820
There would've been much blood loss.

65
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,950
On top of that, it took 15 minutes
for the ambulance to arrive

66
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,410
after residents heard the gunshot
and called it in.

67
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,790
Under normal circumstances,
she would've bled out in that time.

68
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,410
According to the paramedics,

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,580
she had already received first aid
by the time they arrived.

70
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,750
How's Min Ju-yeong?

71
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,090
He got first aid
at Insung University Hospital

72
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,550
and was admitted as an inpatient.

73
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,180
We'll need to wait for the test results,

74
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,510
but his injuries seemed pretty severe.

75
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,100
Take over the case
from the local precinct.

76
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,520
Keep canvassing the area
and trace Min Ju-yeong's movements.

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,810
And put out an APB for Kim Yeon-ha.

78
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,110
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,360
Multiple facial contusions,

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,650
along with a number of
lacerations and bruises.

81
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,200
Total recovery time, 24 weeks.

82
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,280
This is enough to be charged
with aggravated assault.

83
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,490
What happens now?

84
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,500
The ball is in Min Ju-yeong's court.

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,170
What do you mean?

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,920
He has a video of Dong-ju assaulting him.

87
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,300
Without appropriate disciplinary actions,

88
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,630
he'll make the video public.

89
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,260
And what does he mean by
"appropriate disciplinary actions"?

90
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,550
He wants Dong-ju relieved of his duties

91
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,180
and the SCIT…

92
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,060
dissolved.

93
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,070
He wants to stop us
from investigating further.

94
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,940
Everything was planned.

95
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,240
Everything from stealing the captain's gun
to provoking Dong-ju.

96
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,370
I can cover for a simple gun misplacement,

97
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,500
but not when there has been a casualty.

98
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,790
I don't think you can avoid a demotion.

99
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,670
And just like that,
my lieutenant rank is gone.

100
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,550
What did the commissioner say?

101
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,680
This is a headache for him too.

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,970
If that video goes public,

103
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,760
he'll get in trouble
since he created the SCIT.

104
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,060
The nomination is right around the corner.

105
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,690
It seems he wants to
handle this discreetly.

106
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,780
Give it a few days
until the disciplinary hearing.

107
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,860
He has a team dinner tonight, right?

108
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,120
RECRUITMENT & SELECTION NOTICE:
INVESTIGATION DIVISION POSITION

109
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,200
-What are you staring at?
-Hello, sir.

110
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,540
I heard rumors of your team dissolving.

111
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,580
You must feel uneasy.

112
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,090
I mean,
you switched teams to get promoted.

113
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,010
You can't catch a break, can you?

114
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,590
-Are you going home now?
-No, there's a senior officials' dinner.

115
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,140
I bet he's going to put on a show tonight.

116
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,100
Who do you mean?

117
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,560
Your captain.

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,140
I hear he's bent on begging
and pleading with the commissioner

119
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,440
to save that officer and your team.

120
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,480
Man, I can't believe
how that one officer ruined the team.

121
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,280
Why did he take that kid in anyway?

122
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,490
Man-sik, par terre!

123
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,780
-You got this, sir!
-Par terre.

124
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,530
-Good luck, sir!
-Good luck, sir!

125
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,530
What are you doing here?

126
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,650
What do you think, punk?

127
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,280
I'm drinking.

128
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,040
You won't be
relieved of your duties for now.

129
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,340
The disciplinary hearing or whatever
will be held in a week.

130
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,420
So make sure to prepare yourself.

131
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,340
They'll take circumstances into account.

132
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,090
The commissioner
is also aware of your situation.

133
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,930
You didn't have to do this!

134
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,390
Don't you raise your voice.

135
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,270
Sit down and stop talking nonsense.

136
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,790
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,760
I dragged you and the team into this mess.

138
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll just quit.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,260
Don't be ridiculous.

140
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,520
Who said it was your fault?

141
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
It's my fault for not having enough power.

142
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,150
I'm supposed to be the captain,
but there's nothing I can do.

143
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,030
So I'm just trying to do whatever I can.

144
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,070
You did nothing wrong.

145
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,830
That bastard.

146
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,200
Had I been in your shoes,

147
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,540
I would've beaten the hell out of him
like my life depended on it too.

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,500
And what's this talk about quitting?

149
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,630
If you quit,

150
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,630
does that mean
you'll let Min Ju-yeong off the hook?

151
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,720
Jeez, you fool.

152
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,260
You're a boxing champion
and a national team athlete.

153
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,850
But you want to give up
before the match is even over?

154
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,680
I bet Min Ju-yeong
would love to hear all this.

155
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,980
Who said I was giving up?

156
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,150
Exactly, so stop talking nonsense,
all right?

157
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,610
You're a simple kid,

158
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,400
so don't overthink things,
looking all serious.

159
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,360
Hey, I've heard enough crap from you.

160
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,910
Come here and put this on me.
I'm aching all over.

161
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,830
Come on.

162
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,340
Jeez, that stings.

163
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,220
It stings!

164
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,260
What's this old handkerchief
you always carry with you?

165
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,760
I can get you a new one.

166
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,850
What?

167
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,810
Hey, this is priceless.

168
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,690
My wife gave this to me

169
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,820
when she was pregnant with Jeong-a.

170
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
I won the bronze medal
after she gave me this handkerchief.

171
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,200
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

172
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,630
-He held on!
-He won the bronze medal!

173
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,790
-Jae-gyeong!
-Go Man-sik of South Korea!

174
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,430
This is my lucky charm.

175
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,550
I know it doesn't look like it,

176
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,050
but it's mine.

177
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,470
Hey, put more of that on the other side.

178
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,790
I brought your stuff.

179
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,580
See if anything's missing.

180
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,130
Thank you.

181
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,140
Nobody blames you.

182
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,730
So don't make that face.

183
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,020
It makes you look pathetic.

184
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,820
But I ruined everything.

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,700
I'm no help at all.

186
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,870
Hey!

188
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,370
Our team hasn't been dissolved yet,
so why are you apologizing?

189
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,790
Seriously.

190
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
See you.

191
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,070
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

192
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,370
Things are a mess right now,

193
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,080
but we can't just sit back and do nothing.

194
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,460
But there isn't much
we can do at the moment.

195
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,420
The outcome will be the same
even if we stay put,

196
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,750
so we might as well do something.

197
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,460
But we need a lead to dig into the guy.

198
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,170
Excuse me.

199
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,600
Here's the restored data
from Min Ju-yeong's burner phone

200
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
and Kim Yeon-ha's file.

201
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,390
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed
that the passport was forged.

202
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,100
In addition to Kim Yeon-ha,

203
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,270
she has several fake identities
of different nationalities.

204
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,740
Excuse me.

205
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,760
Sir, how are you feeling?

206
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,510
Not great.

207
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,180
Would you like me to help you feel better?

208
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,230
Many calls were made to the phone number
registered under Kim Yeon-ha.

209
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,860
They seem pretty close.

210
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,780
Are you here to kill me?

211
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,660
Why would I do that?

212
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,790
From the looks of you,
I think someone else might do the job.

213
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,330
If you die,

214
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,370
things will only get difficult for me.

215
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,130
There are a few other numbers
he often called besides Kim Yeon-ha's.

216
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,960
If you catch the burner phone dealer,

217
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,920
you can identify the people
Min Ju-yeong was in contact with.

218
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,550
Most of the burner phones
are registered to Russians and Chinese.

219
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,930
What's going on? Why is he here?

220
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,270
When did this punk get here?

221
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,600
What are you planning
to trick our naive captain with this time?

222
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,190
Good point.
Why share this all of a sudden?

223
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,520
What are you up to now?

224
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm not that bad a person.

225
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,490
I do feel bad about what happened.

226
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,780
Anyway, this is the best I can do to help.

227
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,160
We'll keep an eye on Min Ju-yeong,
so do what you can.

228
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,040
Good luck. Bye.

229
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,920
Senior Officers Shin and Ji,
analyze this data.

230
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,510
Sergeant Kim and I
will find the burner phone dealer.

231
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,470
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,890
What about me?

233
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,550
Hey, what about me?

234
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,970
Wait. What do you want me to do?

235
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,270
Don't do anything.

236
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,850
Just stay put!

237
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,640
-Stay with Ms. Jeong.
-What?

238
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,310
But you told me not to give up.

239
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,730
This is all my fault. Do you really
expect me to stand by like an idiot?

240
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah!

241
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,240
I won't get in trouble again.

242
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,110
I'll only do what you tell me to do.

243
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
As if I can trust you.

244
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,820
Let's take him with us.

245
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,540
It's better to keep him with us
than risk him causing trouble.

246
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,250
Unless he's an idiot,
he won't cause any more trouble.

247
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,710
I guess.

248
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,590
Move, punk. Get in the car.

249
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,470
Where will we find
the burner phone dealer?

250
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Don't worry.

251
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,730
I know just the person
who can help us with that.

252
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,030
These are the texts Min Ju-yeong received
right before he was arrested,

253
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,620
but there's no way they were work-related.

254
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,540
"Bonded warehouse 201."

255
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,450
It's a cold storage warehouse
near Chinatown.

256
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,580
It used to be run
by the Golden Bunny Gang,

257
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,330
and the manager was Lee Sang-su.

258
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,040
Lee Sang-su?

259
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,670
Golden Bunny's younger brother,
Silver Bunny?

260
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,840
Yeah.

261
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,760
The warehouse is shut down now,
and Silver Bunny is still on the run.

262
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,470
Kim Yeon-ha's arrival time
was also 4:10 a.m.

263
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,720
She departed from Manila, Philippines.

264
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,020
"Filipino air cargo ETA,
next day at 4:10 a.m."

265
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,440
There's a Russian ship
that arrived at Insung Port at 5 a.m.

266
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,730
It's called the Victory.

267
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,280
It's owned by a shipping company

268
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,070
that smuggled used cars
and drug precursors.

269
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,700
"Russian sea cargo ETA,
next day at 5 a.m."

270
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,030
I wonder what came in.

271
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,870
Let's investigate the bonded warehouses
in the Russian cargo sector.

272
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,830
Okay.

273
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,010
Hey, be gentle.
I got new hair transplanted there.

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,300
That hurts a bit.

275
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,890
Okay, that's good.

276
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,970
Hey, be careful.

277
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,310
What are you doing?

278
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,480
Damn it.

279
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,730
What do you want now?

280
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,700
Jeez, you scared me.

281
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,700
If the burner phone is registered
under a Russian or Chinese name,

282
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,370
there's only one go-to guy in Insung.

283
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,870
Get off the bus!

284
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,000
Burner phone dealers
usually do business with tour guides.

285
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,920
All right, everyone.

286
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,590
They collect everyone's passports,
saying that it's necessary

287
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,470
-for hotel or tourist site reservations.
-Okay, good job.

288
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,340
After they do that,

289
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,510
they take photos of the passports
to get information.

290
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,430
CLEANING SUPPLY CLOSET

291
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,440
What are you doing here?

292
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,230
I told you to stay with the group.

293
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,440
Here, hold onto this.
I can't get a good shot.

294
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,980
No, back up a little.

295
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,400
Who are you?

296
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,860
Who do you think? I'm a cop.

297
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,410
A cop?

298
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,340
Hey, look at this.

300
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,300
You know who these people are, right?

301
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,680
They were in your tour group.

302
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,930
You used their passports
to make burner phones!

303
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,890
I don't know.

304
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,270
All I did was take and send photos
for 10,000 won each.

305
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,230
So tell us what you know.

306
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,520
I just told you everything.

307
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,150
I even gave you my phone.

308
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,650
Who's Daepodong Number One?

309
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,530
The burner phone market's boss.

310
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,660
I don't know his real name.
He just goes by Daepodong.

311
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,740
Where's that bastard?

312
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,740
How should I know?

313
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,620
I heard he was wanted by the police,

314
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,830
but I only met him once
when I first started working.

315
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,750
I'm telling the truth. Hey, that hurts!

316
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,630
No.

317
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,630
That's not him.

318
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,510
No. It's not him.

319
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,760
-Are you really looking?
-I am.

320
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,640
No. Not him.

321
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,550
Okay.

322
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,600
Let's keep at it until we find him.

323
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,730
It's not him.

324
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,100
Not him.

325
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,850
No…

326
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,270
You're not answering.

327
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,280
Are you sleepy?

328
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,450
Next guy, please!

329
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,450
That isn't him.

330
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,700
Open your eyes!

331
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,990
Okay!

332
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,700
Sir, wake up.

333
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,290
Morning's here.

334
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,710
It's not him.

335
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,960
We have to find our guy.

336
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,750
Toasted egg sandwiches
are the best in the morning.

337
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,630
-Everyone!
-What?

338
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,510
I thought we could use a hearty breakfast.

339
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,430
Please enjoy.

340
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,770
-Here.
-Thank you.

341
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,730
Here, Dung-ju.

342
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,890
Thank you, sir.

343
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,150
Thank you.

344
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,500
Isn't Dung-ju pushing himself too hard?

345
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,500
It's not him.

346
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,920
-He pulled two all-nighters.
-He can do two more.

347
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,960
-Detective?
-Yes?

348
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm too hungry to focus.

349
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,800
Can I have some food before we continue?

350
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,800
-Do you want it?
-Yes.

351
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,850
Thank you.

352
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,530
Unbelievable.

353
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,830
Hey, it's this person!

354
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,830
This is him! Daepodong!

355
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,000
Daepodong!

356
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,290
-Are you sure?
-I am. It's Daepodong.

357
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Not Nam Po-dong, the actor?

358
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,550
Not Nam Po-dong! It's Daepodong!

359
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,010
I found you, Daepodong

360
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,550
Don't come after me!

361
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,690
-Calm down and open the door.
-I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

362
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,600
Holy crap!

363
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,810
Don't you know Daepodong Number One?

364
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,440
I can't believe he's only 32 years old.

365
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,530
This guy is Daepodong Number One?

366
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,150
I've never seen him before!

367
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,110
So you've never met the warehouse owner,
and they've been out of business?

368
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,240
No, I have no idea.

369
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,080
-Go, Commissioner!
-Go, Commissioner!

370
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,330
-Go, Commissioner!
-You're so strong, sir!

371
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,460
Have you heard anything
about the Russian mafia around here?

372
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,590
Who are you guys?

373
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,970
Just a second.

374
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,600
I swear I'm not in that business anymore.
I live an honest life!

375
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,850
Okay, fine.

376
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,180
Do you know this person?

377
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,770
No, I don't.

378
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,810
I'd remember him if I had seen that face.

379
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,820
MAN-SIK, JEONG-A, JAE-GYEONG

380
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,750
If you die,

381
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,630
things will only get difficult for me.

382
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,590
Or do you want to tell me

383
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,130
where I can find that bitch?

384
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
What do you say?

385
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,020
If I tell you…

386
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,400
it'll make things difficult for me.

387
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,980
Make the goods, and I'll tell you then.

388
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,450
You really are a bad boy.

389
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,620
Here's your vitamin.

390
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,380
About the lady from the noodle place…

391
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,630
I wonder how she survived.

392
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,510
By all accounts, she should've died.

393
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,850
Can I get you something?

394
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,150
Damn it.

395
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,960
RECENT CALLS

396
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,300
DONG-JU

397
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,280
Don't do that.

398
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,490
People might think
I'm a gang boss or something.

399
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,370
Yes, sir.

400
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,200
Will you be heading home?

401
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,540
No, I want to buy some fruit.

402
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,880
WANTED: JANG CHUNG-GI (DAEPODONG)

403
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,470
Find anything?

404
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,600
Man, I'm exhausted.

405
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,640
Oh, dear.

406
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,350
Everyone looks exhausted.

407
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Here, try it.

408
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,320
On your shoulders like this.

409
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,370
-Hey, that feels good.
-Good.

410
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,290
They're starting to loosen up.

411
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,460
Your shoulders will feel better.

412
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,710
LEE JONG-HUN

413
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,170
Hey, what is it?

414
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,260
Hey!

415
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,260
What the hell are you doing here?

416
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,390
Stop it.

417
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,850
What a rude way to greet a visitor.

418
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,110
She's badly injured.

419
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,650
I guess she can't have these.

420
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,280
The two of you should enjoy them instead.

421
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,240
Are you kidding me?

422
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,410
I brought them as a gesture of goodwill.

423
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,370
You shot a person,
and you speak of goodwill?

424
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,330
You need another beating?

425
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,540
There you go again.

426
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,210
Accusing me without evidence or witnesses.

427
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't you agree?

428
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Or maybe…

429
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,760
that lady saw me.

430
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,010
I see you're injured.

431
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,930
It happens
when you hold a handgun incorrectly.

432
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,520
Especially for someone inexperienced,
just like yourself.

433
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,110
You got me.

434
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,860
But does this count as evidence?

435
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,740
If she wakes, tell her this.

436
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,660
Although it's unlikely
that she saw her shooter,

437
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,830
even if she did,

438
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,450
she should stay quiet.

439
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,660
If not, who knows what might happen?

440
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,250
Do whatever you want.

441
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,050
I'm going to have you locked up,
no matter what.

442
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,130
You scumbag asshole.

443
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,470
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

444
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,680
Don't even dream about it.

445
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,520
The law, rules, fair play…

446
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,770
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

447
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,980
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

448
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Don't you get it?

449
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,240
You bastard.

450
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,870
I said stop it.

451
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,240
You should stop as well and go.

452
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,080
When you have time, please teach me…

453
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,040
how to shoot a gun.

454
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,220
I'd like to make sure
to hit my mark next time.

455
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,060
Goddammit!

456
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,070
Excuse me.

457
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,730
You forgot to take this.

458
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,700
What a shame.

459
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,370
It looks like nobody saw that.

460
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,880
Here. Get your vitamins in.

461
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,210
It'll help with your recovery.

462
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,680
What is it?

463
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,720
I just like you.

464
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,100
-What do you mean?
-How can I not like someone so cool?

465
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,940
It's your fault.

466
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,860
Stop staring.

467
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,240
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju?

468
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,320
Can I have a word with you?

469
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,960
If you keep this up,
the bones won't heal properly,

470
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,460
and it'll leave your hand stuck like this.

471
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,670
Would you be able to use it properly then?

472
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,760
Why would you say that, Doctor?

473
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,340
I'm telling the truth.

474
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,970
You're not one to listen, are you?

475
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,850
Since you're here, let's do an MRI scan.

476
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,940
A head MRI.

477
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,740
What did the doctor say?

478
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,490
What?

479
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,660
Oh, nothing.

480
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,750
He said my hand
could end up looking like this,

481
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,670
so I should be careful.

482
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,130
What?

483
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,760
Seriously?

484
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,800
That was it?

485
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,140
I know, right?

486
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,470
He's a funny guy.

487
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,690
There he is. It's Daepodong.

488
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,900
You should go to Cheongpo-dong.

489
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,950
From what I've heard,
he shows up there often.

490
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,570
-Daepodong?
-Yes?

491
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,540
Oh, no!

492
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,210
Where are you going?

493
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,510
What are you doing? What's wrong?

494
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,550
It's nothing. Let's go.

495
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,360
Captain, I found them.

496
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,690
Even the records of people
who called Min Ju-yeong's burner phone.

497
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,610
You know Min Ju-yeong,
the customs officer, right?

498
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,530
I can't say.

499
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,990
I don't really know any civil servants.

500
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,660
And what kind of a civil servant in Korea

501
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,830
uses a burner phone?

502
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,330
There's a bastard who does.

503
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,330
Let's get your wheels turning.

504
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,960
Okay, then.

505
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,010
Who did you sell those burner phones to?

506
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,380
If I tell you, I'll die.

507
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,470
Oh, I see.

508
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,720
And who'd come after you?

509
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,600
Okay, I'll tell you!

510
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,230
Just calm down.

511
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,810
Every week,

512
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,150
some Korean Chinese guys
come and buy them in bulk.

513
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,610
-Korean Chinese?
-Yes.

514
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,360
Have you heard of Baek?

515
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,030
Call him up. I want to see him.

516
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,080
You want me to call?

517
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,120
Yeah.

518
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,500
They're really scary people.

519
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,000
You're just going to see his face, right?

520
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,250
Worry about yourself.

521
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
What the heck? Let me go!

522
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,740
Our Father, who art in heaven,

523
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,660
Hallowed be thy name.

524
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,780
Thy kingdom come,

525
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,700
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.

526
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,910
I'm sorry, sir!

527
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,750
I didn't mean to snitch,

528
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,500
but I had to because of the cops.

529
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,670
If I'd known it was connected to you,
I wouldn't have said anything.

530
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,050
I'll stay out of sight and live quietly.

531
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,720
And lead us not into temptation,

532
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,680
but deliver us from evil.

533
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,690
Through the blood of the cross,
grant us forgiveness.

534
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,620
It's been abandoned for a while.

535
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,160
Will we find any traces of them?

536
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,920
If we don't find anything here,

537
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,380
we'll search the port warehouse
in Gyosa-dong.

538
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,960
-Let's go.
-Okay.

539
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,140
You're driving?

540
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,850
Yes. Why?

541
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,850
Hold on a second.

542
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,600
Is it that car?

543
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,250
This is Senior Officer Shin Jae-hong
of the SCIT.

544
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,290
Please run the plate number 25J 8405.

545
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,710
Thank you.

546
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,380
It's unregistered.

547
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,140
Step on it.

548
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,810
I think they're on to us. Who are they?

549
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,770
We'll know when we catch them.
Hold on tight.

550
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,840
He has a gun!

551
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,050
Duck!

552
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,640
He shot at us!

553
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,350
Are you okay?

554
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,190
Those bastards.

555
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,620
Look at this.

556
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

557
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,250
He's coming this way.

558
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,850
He united Korean Chinese gangs
from the three Northeastern Provinces

559
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,310
to form the Northeastern Syndicate

560
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,940
and took over Chinatown,
which used to be Golden Bunny's territory.

561
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,520
Introducing…

562
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,360
Baek Seok-chun, also known as Baek.

563
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,240
My brother will kill you.

564
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,070
Open wide. It'll be over soon.

565
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,160
The rental warehouse was run by the mafia
operating in the Russian Far East

566
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,870
including Sakhalin and Khabarovsk.

567
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,130
It looks like they came to Korea
on a ship recently.

568
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,460
We have no intel
on the boss's description or identity.

569
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,180
My mother's homeland.

570
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,260
The one who controls the drug supply
across Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia

571
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,600
is Drug Monster, also known as Drugmon.

572
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,810
She came to Korea
under the false identity of Kim Yeon-ha,

573
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,980
and she's wanted by Interpol
and the police agency.

574
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,780
Then there's Oh Jong-gu,
the CEO of J9 Security.

575
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,240
And the person at the center of it all

576
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,000
is the Grade 7 customs officer,

577
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,370
Min Ju-yeong.

578
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,210
They're all expanding their profits
through smuggling.

579
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,840
Gangs, drugs, smuggling, and mafias.

580
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,680
It's a cartel of evil.

581
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,470
This is what we've figured out so far.

582
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,890
If we look into the suborganizations,

583
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,970
we'll likely find
most of the criminal groups in Insung.

584
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,850
This is intense.

585
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,940
Can we handle this case?

586
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,230
We'll need at least
a few months to investigate.

587
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,110
Will our team still be around by then?

588
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,780
He probably has the commissioner
in his pocket too.

589
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,570
We can't exactly investigate openly.

590
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,990
Cops shouldn't be worried about authority
when catching bad guys.

591
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,950
Bad guys need to get arrested.

592
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,410
-Hello, Commissioner!
-Hello, sir!

593
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,410
-Were you on night duty?
-Jae-hong!

594
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,010
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir.

595
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,970
What were you doing?

596
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,810
We were reflecting on
our poor behavior, sir.

597
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,720
That's what we've been doing, right?

598
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,060
I was working out, sir.

599
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,040
You sure do look like a troublemaker.

600
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,870
You never do as you're told, do you?

601
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,710
-Landscape mode.
-Portrait is the trend, sir.

602
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,090
He's been looking for a way to recover
his dropping social media views.

603
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,340
By the way, it appears that the SCIT

604
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,060
will be dissolved within a week.

605
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,480
He'll be helping out
instead of Golden Bunny from now on.

606
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,570
Introduce yourselves.

607
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,240
Yes, sir.

608
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
I'm Oh Jong-gu.

609
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,780
I run a small security firm
and a logistics company.

610
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,370
And I was…

611
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,410
a heavyweight boxing champion.

612
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
Take a seat.

613
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,750
Yes, sir.

614
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,010
By the way,

615
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,720
did you find the bastards
who stole my Candy precursors?

616
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,810
There were more than just a couple.

617
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,770
The mayor's son got hooked on Candy
and crossed the line.

618
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,730
The remaining precursors
will be collected soon.

619
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,320
Hey, Mr. Min.

620
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,280
Why is everything a mess?

621
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,860
The bunny bastard is in jail,

622
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,320
and the bribed mayor's son
is making a shitshow.

623
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,490
And the cops are swarming in like flies
because of that shitshow.

624
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,160
At this rate,
this place may be left unfinished as is.

625
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,620
That won't happen.

626
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,170
This is our starting point.

627
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,840
It can't fall apart already.

628
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
Can you swear to God on that?

629
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,640
I want my trust in partners
to be bulletproof.

630
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,640
My mother told me
not to trust others so easily.

631
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,520
I swear.

632
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,060
Is this good enough?

633
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,980
You…

634
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,320
shouldn't trust me.

635
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,870
Don't trust me. Trust money.

636
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,660
Trust the unimaginable amount of money
that will fall into your laps.

637
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,090
"Though thy beginning was small…

638
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,420
yet thy latter end
should greatly increase."

639
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,890
-Captain, can I--
-Go home.

640
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,190
So do we…

641
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,200
just sit back and do nothing?

642
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,410
I wish we could do something.

643
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,750
What's going to happen now?

644
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,960
Say something!

645
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,580
Do you even need to ask?

646
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,750
This is it for us.

647
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,490
The team will get dissolved.

648
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,740
We'll all face disciplinary action.

649
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,200
Then we'll return
to our respective positions.

650
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,460
We will now begin the disciplinary hearing

651
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,790
regarding the dismissal
of Officer Yoon Dong-ju.

652
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,090
Anything to say before we begin?

653
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,470
Dung-ju's disciplinary hearing
probably started.

654
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,220
I hope he's doing okay in there.

655
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,970
He'll be lucky if he only gets suspended.

656
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,570
Officer Yoon Dong-ju?

657
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,450
That's how it'll end.

658
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:19,580
The bad guys will go on living
without a care,

659
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,120
while the dead are left with injustice.

660
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,540
Are you going to
fight for justice or something?

661
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,000
Don't even dream about it.

662
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,960
The law, rules, fair play…

663
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,010
All that crap
is only relevant in your boxing ring.

664
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,220
That kind of bullshit
doesn't fly in my streets.

665
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,270
On behalf of all the athletes,

666
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,690
I hereby pledge

667
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,230
to compete with honor
and a true spirit of sportsmanship,

668
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,950
respecting and abiding by the rules.

669
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,950
Athletes' representative, Yoon Dong-ju.

670
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,000
Officer Yoon Dong-ju, please sit--

671
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,620
Officer Yoon!

672
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,880
What?

673
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,970
Then where the heck is he right now?

674
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,200
How can I--

675
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,740
We need to talk.

676
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,090
His last visit to the hospital
was three days ago.

677
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:57,550
If he's not in the on-call room
or at the hospital, then where is he?

678
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,510
We haven't been able to reach him
for two days now.

679
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,680
Are you sure Dong-ju
last met with Oh Jong-gu?

680
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,180
Yes, I checked with the female bookkeeper.

681
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,390
We can't reach Oh Jong-gu either.

682
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,600
She says he's on a business trip,
but she doesn't know where he is.

683
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,360
Do you think…

684
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,940
Dung-ju got himself into big trouble?

685
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,740
I don't know, damn it!

686
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,490
What about Min Ju-yeong?

687
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,290
He took a sick leave and went on vacation
after getting discharged,

688
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,950
but we can't locate him.

689
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,750
Where the hell is Dung-ju holed up?

690
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,670
I'll go and check out

691
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,710
a gym in Dongho-dong
where Dung-ju used to go.

692
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,880
In any case, once we locate
Oh Jong-gu and Min Ju-yeong…

693
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,130
-What the heck?
-What is it?

694
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,260
It's moving.

695
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,310
You scared me, you little bastard!

696
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,520
What are you doing there? Come out!

697
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,230
For crying out loud, you idiot!

698
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,200
What happened to your face? Let me see.

699
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,490
Let me see.

700
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,750
You got into trouble again, didn't you?

701
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:16,170
I spent the weekend
going around looking for you!

702
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,420
I didn't get into trouble.

703
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,920
I just thought I should do something.

704
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,640
So you went to Oh Jong-gu
to settle things once and for all?

705
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,680
To get a confession from him?

706
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,520
I can't believe you, Dung-ju.

707
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:34,520
You little brat!

708
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,320
You couldn't help yourself
and had to get into a fight, didn't you?

709
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,820
Why can't you see
that this accomplishes nothing?

710
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,530
Man, this is frustrating!

711
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,840
Why are you following me?

712
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,760
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

713
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,430
Here.

714
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,650
I don't have anywhere to go.

715
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,110
Can I stay with you?

716
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,990
Are you always like this?

717
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,070
What?

718
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,740
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

719
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,660
You think it's okay to ignore the problem
and laugh things off, right?

720
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,960
Just go.

721
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,800
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

722
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,290
RICE PORRIDGE

723
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,040
This pitiful act doesn't suit you.

724
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,460
Where on earth are you staying, you punk?

725
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,680
Dung-ju looked pretty bad.

726
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,640
Do you think the other person
got hurt badly too?

727
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,950
What do you mean?

728
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,660
The commissioner decided
to put the SCIT's dissolution on hold.

729
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,290
Your team won't face
disciplinary action either.

730
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,670
Wait a minute.

731
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,720
He was so set on dissolving the SCIT.
What changed his mind?

732
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,380
-Didn't Yoon Dong-ju tell you?
-Tell me what?

733
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:11,840
It seems that

734
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,220
he met with Min Ju-yeong
and settled things.

735
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,980
Settle what?

736
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,650
This is interesting.

737
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,570
So you're willing to take
as many hits as you've given

738
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,780
as long as I leave the SCIT alone?

739
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
That's right.

740
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,530
Just get rid of me.

741
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,790
A man shouldn't be so petty
and drag other people into things.

742
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,580
Our problem should be resolved between us.

743
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,290
You're here to apologize,
yet you seem so brazen.

744
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:51,880
All right.

745
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,140
We're friends. A friend can do that much.

746
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,430
But we're in different weight classes,

747
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,810
so we should balance the scales.

748
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,810
If you're still standing
after getting beaten up…

749
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,940
I'll think about what to do.

750
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,570
Who does he think he is, Jesus?

751
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,990
Why take on all the burden?

752
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,330
Are you always like this?

753
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,420
I guess I somewhat knew,
but you're beyond help.

754
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,170
Just go.

755
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,380
I was an idiot to think you were decent.

756
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,220
He hasn't come
to the on-call room in days.

757
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,800
Where in the world is he?

758
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,890
Where's the gym Dong-ju used to go to?

759
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:44,060
It's called Victory Gym in Dongho-dong.

760
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,520
-Thank you.
-But…

761
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,230
It's Victory Gym in Dongho-dong!

762
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,690
VICTORY GYM

763
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,870
Excuse me, is Yoon Dong-ju here?

764
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:58,950
I don't know.

765
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,000
STEAMED BUN

766
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:12,150
DUNG-JU

767
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,740
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME,
BUT ANSWER YOUR PHONE

768
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:24,870
IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE DEAD

769
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,170
TEXT FROM STEAMED BUN
MISSED CALL FROM STEAMED BUN

770
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,890
VICTORY GYM

771
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,320
Have you experienced
any discomfort lately?

772
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,740
Anything like hand tremors
or blurry vision?

773
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,530
Maybe sudden moments of dizziness?

774
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,330
Why do you ask?

775
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,330
The repeated impacts sustained
during your athletic career

776
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,120
may have caused brain damage.

777
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,330
They call it becoming punch-drunk.

778
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,380
You might be okay right now,

779
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,170
but the symptoms can get worse.

780
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,590
I recommend an in-depth examination.

781
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,220
Just getting home?

782
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,020
-I don't see him around at all.
-Excuse me?

783
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,400
The guy who followed you around
like a mutt.

784
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,570
Did you two fight?

785
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,650
What's wrong with him?

786
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,240
They say he has a cold.

787
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,700
He got a shot this afternoon,
but he's still listless.

788
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,290
My goodness, why is this mutt
making me worry so much?

789
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,750
He won't eat either.

790
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,960
-Can I?
-Yeah.

791
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,630
Go ahead.

792
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,510
Dung-ju, have some sausage.

793
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,680
Goodness, he's eating it.

794
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,390
He's eating.

795
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,600
Are you eating it
because the sweet lady gave it to you?

796
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,020
Goodness.

797
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,230
Do you feel better now?

798
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,240
STEAMED BUN

799
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,870
DUNG-JU

800
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,830
WHERE ARE YOU? DID YOU EAT? ARE YOU SICK?

801
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,750
I'M GOING TO STOP TALKING TO YOU

802
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,090
CONTACT ME OR YOU'LL REALLY REGRET IT

803
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,260
Still can't get in touch with Dong-ju?

804
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:31,770
No.

805
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,980
The little punk
is driving me absolutely crazy.

806
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,080
DUNG-JU

807
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,710
What kind of champion gets beaten up?

808
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:45,960
How humiliating.

809
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,390
I couldn't think of a way
to beat Min Ju-yeong,

810
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,850
no matter how hard I racked my brains.

811
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,390
I don't have anything or any influence.

812
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,020
But then I thought it over and realized…

813
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,770
I know how to take hits.

814
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,020
I'm really good at taking hits.

815
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,410
So I thought that was the only way…

816
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,500
I could protect us.

817
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,750
That's why I did it. I'm sorry.

818
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,250
I'll leave now.

819
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,550
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

820
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,310
Good job.

821
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,980
So is that it?

822
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,730
Is that what you want to do?

823
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,070
Do you want to give up now?

824
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,150
So?

825
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,740
Should we stop?

826
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
No.

827
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,290
No.

828
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,380
I won't give up.

829
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,340
Why would I?

830
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,350
Lying on the floor

831
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,600
isn't humiliating.

832
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,730
That's just how life is.

833
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,740
You push through it,

834
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,410
enduring it with gritted teeth.

835
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,780
If you can hold on and stay down
without getting turned over,

836
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,330
you can get back up and fight again.

837
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,720
It doesn't matter
how many times you fall…

838
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,350
as long as you get back up.

839
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,020
The fight isn't over.

840
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,070
There are still more rounds to go.

841
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,770
-They say everything has its purpose.
-What are you doing? Stop being gross.

842
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,770
Why are you leaving
that little mutt of a cop alone?

843
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,690
-Where are the rest of the precursors?
-He only heard that there was a delay

844
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,400
due to customs clearance procedures.

845
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,860
This one's a bit too much.

846
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,700
It is, isn't it?

847
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,030
-If there are red fire ants…
-This is our chance.

848
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,040
You can stay at my place.

849
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,580
Breath. Tremors. Wind.

850
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,290
You take everything into account.

851
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,630
Let's begin.

852
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,920
There are days…

853
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,140
that feel like a stray bullet.
