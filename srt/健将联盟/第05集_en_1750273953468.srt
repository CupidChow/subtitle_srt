1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,098
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,266
Pass the ball!

4
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,655
Left foot.

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,667
Time seemed to slow to a stop.

6
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,254
Everything was vivid and sharp.

7
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,602
I could see every puff of breath
and every bead of sweat on the glove.

8
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,229
However…

9
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,440
I couldn't avoid that punch.

10
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,111
The sudden blow came
when I was unprepared.

11
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,199
By the time I saw it,

12
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,451
it was already too late.

13
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,246
Hey, Yun Dong-ju. Are you okay?

14
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:01,872
Yun Dong-ju.

15
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,415
Some things can't be avoided.

16
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,542
Are you okay?

17
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,675
My body goes limp,

18
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,969
and I can't lift a single finger.

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,974
Everything seems hazy and far away

20
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,395
as if I were drunk.

21
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
Yun Dong-ju.

22
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,982
Yun Dong-ju!

23
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,904
Of course.

24
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,448
I'm fine.

25
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,414
That's when love

26
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,416
finds you.

27
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,257
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

28
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,186
Why is that bastard just looking around?

29
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,146
You punk.

30
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,981
Stop grumbling.

31
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,983
Why won't you do as I say
and return to the hospital?

32
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,484
Instead, you're here grumbling.

33
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,412
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

34
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,749
At around 2:10 a.m. on the 13th,

35
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,918
Mr. Lee Jin-su
was on his way home after work

36
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,420
when he was killed
in a hit-and-run accident.

37
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,178
A week later,
at around 3 a.m. on the 20th,

38
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,181
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il, who stepped forward
as the hit-and-run driver…

39
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,515
I'M SORRY
I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,017
…committed suicide
in the detention center.

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,188
Five days later,
at around 5:30 a.m. on the 25th,

42
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,275
vehicle smuggler Kim Deok-chul
of the Monkey Gang was murdered.

43
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,281
What do these cases have to do with me?

44
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,532
That bastard.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,619
As for Kim Deok-chul of the Monkey Gang,

46
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,330
he smuggled vehicles,
illegal weapons, and drugs

47
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,832
through Russia and the Philippines.

48
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,252
He even forged documents
to get the goods through customs.

49
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,632
But it's nearly impossible to do this
without help from an insider.

50
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,134
You're aware of this, right?
Yes.

51
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,347
The person who handled these duties
was Mr. Lee Jin-su.

52
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,683
And the person who handled them before…

53
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,102
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

54
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,020
…was you, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

55
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,159
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

56
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,541
We found the car that hit Mr. Lee Jin-su,

57
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,376
and it's being processed as evidence
by the NFS.

58
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,838
Don't you wonder whose DNA
they will be recovered from it?

59
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,972
Let's wait and see…

60
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,393
what evidence they find.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,655
I guess you weren't hurt badly,

62
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,365
seeing how you haven't been admitted.

63
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,868
I stuck around to see you get locked up.

64
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,623
I'll get a detailed medical certificate,
so be prepared.

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,834
It's over for you.

66
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,004
Judging by how you bulldozed your way
to make the arrest,

67
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,464
you don't take your job seriously.

68
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,590
Who, me?

69
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,008
I'll have you know

70
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,136
that I risk my life doing what I do.

71
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,810
You got it wrong.

72
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,022
Your life will be on the line
from this moment onward.

73
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,943
Starting now.

74
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,712
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

75
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,590
Why do you keep checking the time?

76
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,927
It's a habit.

77
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,971
I need to monitor
arrival and departure times for work.

78
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,811
You must be expecting a shipment today.

79
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,093
That bastard is going to stall
until it blows over.

80
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,387
He won't say a word.
Right.

81
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,098
At this rate,
we won't have enough to request a warrant.

82
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,475
No, we still have time.

83
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,102
Aren't the NFS results out?

84
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,603
I'll check again, sir.

85
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,230
We just need to beat him up!

86
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,899
We can't reason with him.
Right.

87
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:23,068
Why do you keep saying "right"?

88
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,322
Excuse me.

89
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,038
Who are those guys?

90
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,626
Why are you taking that bastard?
Calm down, Dong-ju!

91
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,919
What's the reason?
Stop!

92
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,754
Will you stay still?
You keep overreacting.

93
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,798
Are you serious? I can't stay still!

94
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,009
Stop it!
It doesn't make any sense!

95
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,719
I'll only let you go if you stop.

96
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,308
Just don't, okay?

97
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,312
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,941
Mr. Min is facing smuggling charges,

99
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,986
so Insung Customs handed the case
over to the prosecution.

100
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,363
As you probably know,
the Customs Act gives us the precedence.

101
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,199
Here's the official note.

102
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,410
I'm too old to read the fine print.

103
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,413
Hey.

104
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,169
What is it?

105
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,629
What do you want to say?

106
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,341
A busy prosecutor like you wouldn't have
come all the way here for a mere criminal.

107
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,425
At dawn, no less?

108
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,844
Seok-hyeon, I know you don't like me.

109
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,180
But this isn't right.
Hey.

110
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,141
I have better things to do.
Do you think I want to be here?

111
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,769
Civil servants have no choice
but to follow orders.

112
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,729
I've already had enough as is.
Don't pile on.

113
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,818
Sir, the senior superintendent
would like to see you.

114
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,570
Yes, of course.

115
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,283
Move.

116
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,834
Just a moment, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

117
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,091
I just have one question.

118
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,683
Where did you get that watch?

119
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,976
It was a gift.

120
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,060
From whom?

121
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,980
Why do you ask?

122
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:23,981
As far as I know,

123
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,441
that watch isn't sold in Korea.

124
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
Is that so?

125
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,655
I suppose that's possible

126
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,740
since I got it from a Russian friend.

127
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,034
His name is…

128
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,538
It's been so long
that I don't remember it.

129
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,375
It just so happens

130
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,712
those alleged to be in collusion with you,
such as Golden Bunny Gang's Lee Sang-gon

131
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,756
and Mr. Oh Jong-gu of J9 Security,
both wear the same watch.

132
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,802
And the same watch was found
at the scene of Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's death.

133
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,846
Maybe we have similar tastes.

134
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,431
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

135
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,348
You think so?

136
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,976
I don't think it's a coincidence.

137
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,858
That female cop…

138
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,944
You were on TV often.

139
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,155
The famous national team shooter.

140
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,408
I didn't expect to meet
the Shooting Fairy here.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,786
May I ask what your name is?

142
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,539
Senior Officer Ji Han-na.

143
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,792
You seem quite interested in watches,
Senior Officer Ji.

144
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,712
Do you want to see for yourself…

145
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,093
if it's the same one?

146
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,355
What are you doing? Take him away already.

147
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,072
I'd like an autograph
the next time we meet.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,244
What are you doing?

149
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,665
Don't go near him.

150
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,092
Hey!
Let go of me!

151
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,760
I said let go, damn it!

152
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,346
Hey, you punk!
Will you beat up a prosecutor too?

153
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,139
I can't just sit back and watch, can I?

154
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,933
Who the hell cares if he's a prosecutor?

155
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,559
Damn it, stop making a scene.
Hey!

156
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,772
Hey, I swear I'll throw your ass in jail!

157
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,732
Try and run if you can!

158
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,275
I'll chase you to the ends of…

159
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,821
Hey.

160
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:37,656
What's wrong?

161
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,248
What's going on?

162
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,057
You said the same thing before,
but I didn't get a chance to respond.

163
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,521
Do whatever you can. I look forward to it.

164
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,606
You bastard.

165
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,407
Are you okay?

166
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,579
You should take care of your health first.
I suggest you go see a doctor.

167
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,290
Don't get too worked up.

168
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,000
Damn you.

169
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,087
That's enough. Hey, give me a hand.

170
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,344
Let's go.
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,815
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,400
I just escorted him out.

173
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,319
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,575
This is so beneath me.

175
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,328
I can't believe
I'm escorting a petty criminal.

176
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,454
Hey.

177
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,083
Who the hell are you?

178
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,378
Why is the departmental chief prosecutor
stepping in like this?

179
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,546
Are you related to him?

180
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,589
No.

181
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,758
A friend from school?

182
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,676
No.

183
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,761
Then who are you?

184
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,679
A civil servant…

185
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,099
just like you.

186
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,040
I said I'm fine.

187
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,252
I hope you learned your lesson
for leaving without permission.

188
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,837
I'm sorry, Doctor.

189
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,922
All right, then.

190
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,509
Don't worry too much.
He just has a slight concussion.

191
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,678
We'll need to run some more tests,

192
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,555
but he'll be okay
after a few days of rest.

193
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,681
Who's the next patient?

194
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,724
I'll take you to the examination room.

195
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,686
You idiot.
You never listen and cause trouble.

196
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,020
Now look at you.

197
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,148
Stay right here and rest up
until you recover.

198
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,400
What about that bastard?

199
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,194
How will you catch him without me?
Easily.

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,613
Stop talking and go get examined.

201
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,324
Let's get you to the examination room.

202
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,331
Let's go.

203
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,209
Shouldn't we contact his family?

204
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,422
He doesn't have any family.
He's all alone.

205
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,010
AN DAE-YONG

206
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,764
Are you calling to irritate me again?

207
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,141
What is it?

208
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,643
Okay, got it.

209
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,980
I need to get back to the agency.

210
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,773
Something happened.

211
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:02,152
Senior Officer Ji, take care of Dong-ju.

212
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,570
Me?

213
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,696
Yeah.

214
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,199
He doesn't listen to others,
but he listens to you.

215
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,784
Please watch him.
Thanks.

216
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,785
No worries.

217
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,963
What is it? What's going on?

218
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,423
Out with it.

219
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,592
Understood.

220
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,635
Captain.

221
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,637
The NFS just called.

222
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,680
The prosecution took
all the related records,

223
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,515
including the car we seized.

224
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,228
Now that I'm in your shoes,
I understand how you must've felt.

225
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,482
What's the matter with you?
Don't be weird.

226
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,943
The prosecution took everything.

227
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,781
All the cases
remotely connected to that civil servant.

228
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,700
Lee Jin-su's hit-and-run,
Golden Bunny, Monkey, and everything.

229
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,579
Who the hell is that bastard,
Min Ju-yeong?

230
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,126
That's what I'd like to know.

231
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,255
May I ask what your name is?

232
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,549
Senior Officer Ji Han-na.

233
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,821
BANG

234
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,703
Make sure we have enough
for all the athletes.

235
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,287
POWER UP WITH A BANG STEAMED BUN!

236
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,206
If the quantity checks out,
bring some boxes out.

237
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,290
Yes, sir.

238
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,674
She's up.
You've got this!

239
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,217
Let's go, Ji Han-na!
Good luck!

240
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,387
Over here, Ms. Ji.
Please look over here.

241
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,888
What the hell are they doing?

242
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,932
Good luck, Ji Han-na!
You've got this!

243
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,767
I'm going to lose it.

244
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,644
Look over here, please!

245
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,605
Over here, please.

246
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,107
I plan on eating well as usual

247
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,317
and keeping my condition in check
during training.

248
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,028
How are you preparing for São Paulo?

249
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,364
Are you confident
in winning the gold this time too?

250
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,829
Achoo.

251
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,497
It's so cold.

252
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,792
Is anyone there?

253
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,008
Bang Steamed Buns
are the best winter snack.

254
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:30,925
Make sure to have one!

255
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,762
Gosh, look who's a star now.

256
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,806
We have to train late at night
for her to film those lame commercials.

257
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,974
Bang bang.

258
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
What can we do?

259
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,645
The National Fairy doesn't have time.
That's Ji Han-na for you.

260
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,355
It's all about her.

261
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,857
By the way, have you heard?

262
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,276
Ji Han-na and Kim Jong-hyeon broke up.

263
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,070
Why?
Do you have to ask? Isn't it obvious?

264
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,364
Who would want to
put up with her attitude?

265
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,118
Bang bang!
Stop it. It's so corny.

266
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,038
Why would they throw these away?

267
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,998
Steamed Bun will be sad if she sees this.

268
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,458
You guys are so mean.

269
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,604
The steamed bun is so good.
Thanks, Han-na!

270
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,897
I'm so hungry.

271
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,609
They're just jealous.

272
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,238
Winning one gold medal is hard enough,
but you make it look really easy.

273
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,531
That got under their skin.

274
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,116
How should I say this?

275
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,160
It's the burden all geniuses must bear,

276
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,287
being surrounded
by the envious and the jealous.

277
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,040
Yeah, that's it.
I know the feeling well too.

278
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,544
By the way, I'm taking all of this.

279
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,379
Judo athlete Min-cheol said

280
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,923
he won the qualifiers
after finding a gold medal sticker,

281
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,883
so I want that good luck too.

282
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,636
You lost again, didn't you?

283
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,806
Stop believing in such nonsense.
No wonder you're not improving.

284
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,934
Hey, I'm the Asia boxing champion.

285
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,311
I've just been unlucky lately.

286
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,691
Your haters are nothing

287
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,402
compared to the huge crowd of people
who support you!

288
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,574
I like you too!

289
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,469
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU, MS. JI
FROM TASTY STEAMED BUN

290
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,014
BANG STEAMED BUN

291
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,917
GOLD MEDALIST HAN-NA
BANG

292
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,130
BOXER YUN LOSES
IN TODAY'S SÃO PAOLO QUALIFIER

293
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,214
NEXT WEEK'S FINAL QUALIFIER
IS HIS LAST CHANCE

294
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,040
Why did he stick this here?

295
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,418
Give it to me.
No. You gave it to me, so it's mine.

296
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,796
Give it back.
No, you can't just take it back.

297
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,798
Give it to me.
It's become a rare item too.

298
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,591
Give it to me!
No, I don't want to!

299
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,496
Get up, please.

300
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,292
Return to your bed, please.

301
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,630
Darn it, it tore a bit.

302
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,054
Lie down, please.

303
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,033
You're here.
Hey.

304
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,285
This will sting a bit.
Hold on a second!

305
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,455
Just a little sting.
No, please wait.

306
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,873
Yun Dong-ju seems to be okay now.

307
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,545
I'm here to tell you something, Han-na.

308
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,261
Thanks.

309
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,184
So…

310
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,020
About earlier today…

311
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:38,900
It's okay.

312
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,029
The thing is…

313
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,158
I think Min Ju-yeong's people
have been watching you

314
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,577
and got your information from the agency.

315
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,995
Within the agency?

316
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,371
Yeah.

317
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,501
I have a feeling they think you read
Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

318
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,379
Do you remember what they were about?

319
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,888
They're just keeping an eye on you for now
because they don't know how much you know.

320
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,517
But we don't know how they'll react
when we get closer to the truth.

321
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,685
Since this could get dangerous,

322
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,063
you should consider
taking on a different case.

323
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,565
So…

324
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,195
Jong-hyeon.

325
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,656
Is this why you joined the team?

326
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,912
Don't try to make me hide behind you.

327
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,123
We broke up, remember?

328
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,585
I don't want to do that.

329
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,549
Also…

330
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,385
isn't that for the better?

331
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,096
What do you mean?

332
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,640
I can be the bait.

333
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,726
Hello, sir.
Hello.

334
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,443
I brought the civil servant
from the police agency.

335
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,695
What should I do with him?

336
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,870
Yes, Mayor.

337
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,087
Yes, noted.

338
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,301
Mr. Jang, let this bastard go.

339
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,021
You're free to go.

340
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,951
Would you look at this bastard?

341
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,453
The police agency,
the prosecutors' office…

342
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,872
He acts like he owns these places.

343
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,374
Apparently, the prosecution acknowledges
his charge of aiding in smuggling

344
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,377
but considers it trivial,
so he was suspended from indictment.

345
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,923
Insung Customs only gave him

346
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,634
a reappointment order
and a three-month pay reduction.

347
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,553
Who exactly is this bastard?

348
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,349
Comb through Min Ju-yeong's records
we have gathered so far.

349
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,975
Look into his family, his hometown,

350
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,186
his alma maters,
and anyone related to his job.

351
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,688
Go as far as finding out
the underwear he wears.

352
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,274
There's definitely someone backing him.

353
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,026
SURVEILLANCE DIVISION
CUSTOMS OFFICER MIN JU-YEONG

354
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,326
He's a Grade 7 customs officer
at Insung Customs' Surveillance Division.

355
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,744
I see he attended Hanguk University.

356
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,038
Yes. He got in on a scholarship,

357
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,457
but he dropped out after a semester.
Why?

358
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,293
He took time off before applying
for a customs officer position,

359
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,795
so it was likely due to tuition.

360
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,423
He doesn't keep in touch
with any former classmates,

361
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,093
and while he is well-reputed
at his workplace,

362
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,429
he doesn't have a close colleague
for some reason.

363
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:58,516
Ms. Kim Yu-na from the same division
is something of his acquaintance,

364
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,017
and that's about it.

365
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,690
He's from Insung.

366
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,525
He lost his family to an accident
when he was a child

367
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,277
and was raised by his uncle.

368
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,029
This means he has no friends
or close relatives.

369
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:12,947
Any assets?

370
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,991
He has a house
with a 120 million won deposit,

371
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,826
56 million won in the bank,

372
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,661
and a compact car. That's all.

373
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:21,247
INSUNG CITY GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY
CONSTRUCTION SITE

374
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,679
He has monitored this company
since joining the Korea Customs Service.

375
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,806
Some of the vehicles
smuggled by the Monkey Gang

376
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,391
haven't been located.

377
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,270
When compared to their ledger,
about 30 vehicles are missing.

378
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,522
And all of them are foreign luxury cars.

379
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,007
Daddy, cheer up

380
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,593
We're here for you

381
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,159
I'm getting unwanted attention.

382
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,914
Please tell our Russian guest
to take care of our client.

383
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,637
There's buzzing in the ears.

384
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,723
Some dizziness and nausea too.

385
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,100
Open wide.

386
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,727
Is medication being taken?

387
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,231
Maybe some painkillers?

388
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,690
What kind of painkillers?

389
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:13,776
I don't know.

390
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,321
What did it say when I looked it up?

391
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,574
I think it was called Ménière's disease.

392
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,952
Who are you talking about?

393
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,375
My colleague, cutie Steamed Bun.

394
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,253
Tell me about your condition, Officer.

395
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,672
I'm totally fine.
It doesn't hurt?

396
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,048
No.
It must be painful.

397
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,717
Come on, this is nothing.

398
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,303
Doctor, I used to be a champion boxer.

399
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,348
Gold medalist Energizer Yun Dong-ju.

400
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:45,933
Right.

401
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,018
Let's schedule a head examination.

402
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,565
Let's run more tests.
I see some signs of nutritional imbalance.

403
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,608
LUXURY SPORTS CAR
CAUSES 3-VEHICLE COLLISION

404
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,861
You need to eat well
for your bones to heal quickly.

405
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,529
Don't just eat eggs.

406
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,991
We have many tests to run,
so I'll monitor your progress…

407
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,243
Mr. Yun Dong-ju?

408
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,415
A luxury sports car races down a road.

409
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,585
Its speed clocked by the camera
exceeds 200 km per hour.

410
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,503
That red sports car…
Ignoring all signals,

411
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,755
its driver drove recklessly,

412
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,842
causing another car
to crash into a roadside tree.

413
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,052
It's one of the missing cars
from the list.

414
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,847
It's time for your injection, Mr. Yun.

415
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,059
Damn it.

416
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,077
Unbelievable.

417
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,750
You keep breaking the law
like it's nothing, but you're still here.

418
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,293
You sure are something.

419
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,713
Okay, I'll give you that much.

420
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,220
You need to eat a balanced diet
to stay fit and keep playing mischief.

421
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,231
Why are you eating alone?

422
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,774
You have no friends, right?

423
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,443
Two-faced people like you

424
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,529
trigger an alarm in people's hearts.

425
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,448
It warns them to stay away.

426
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,913
How old are you?

427
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,165
I'm 1,000,032 years old. Why do you ask?

428
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,375
You look young for your age.

429
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,504
Then you can become my friend.

430
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,263
Let me tell you something
you might not be aware of.

431
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,646
When a traffic accident occurs,
you face criminal and civil liability.

432
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,691
Most reach a settlement
to resolve things peacefully.

433
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,278
But I'm never going to do that.

434
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,365
I don't know what connections you have,

435
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,993
but if I don't agree to settle,
you'll get prison time.

436
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,748
If I have these
so-called powerful connections,

437
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,168
do you think that'll be possible?

438
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,133
Have you heard of Ali?

439
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,218
Muhammad Ali.

440
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,178
He said,

441
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:33,309
"Impossible is nothing."

442
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,734
I don't know all the shady things
you've been doing here in Insung.

443
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,278
But now that I'm here,

444
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,781
you can't avoid me in the ring.

445
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:56,373
Think of it as me giving you some time
because of my injury.

446
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,001
Let's see each other often.

447
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,921
And don't be a picky eater.

448
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,073
I see some signs of nutritional imbalance.

449
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,574
You need to eat well

450
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,951
for your bones to heal quickly.

451
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:33,994
Don't just eat eggs.

452
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,165
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

453
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,210
Right. I need to eat well
to catch that bastard.

454
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,256
SENIOR OFFICER SHIN JAE-HONG

455
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,386
It's so odd how he keeps
taking that sneaky jerk's side lately.

456
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,023
Hey!

457
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,697
Didn't I tell you to stay in the hospital?

458
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,824
What are you doing in the office?

459
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,326
What's the point of lying in bed
when I'm perfectly fine?

460
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,911
I'll just rack up more hospital bills.

461
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,789
What's that? Is it for me?

462
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,417
Don't be ridiculous.
I got it on a shopping channel.

463
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
It was buy one, get one free.

464
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,295
Thank you. I appreciate it.

465
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,552
Jeez, look at this smoke.

466
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,595
This is a BBQ restaurant, not a--

467
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,599
One, two.

468
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,187
This is so good.

469
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,481
We don't have any peppers.

470
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,737
This is insanely good.

471
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,126
Good morning.

472
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,296
You came to work. How are you feeling?

473
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,339
As you can see, I'm fine.

474
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,425
Did you…

475
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,802
Good morning.

476
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,769
Yun Dong-ju, did you use my desk--
Oh, right.

477
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,687
What's on the menu this morning?

478
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,814
Clean it up.
We should clean up together.

479
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,366
Take this with you!

480
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,951
Sorry, Jae-hong.

481
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,919
What's up with the smell here?

482
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,468
What a nice scent.

483
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:56,804
Isn't it better now?

484
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,445
Darn it.

485
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,537
Jeez.

486
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,916
I wonder who I was trying to rescue
that my arm ended up this injured.

487
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,835
I need to eat well for my bones to heal.

488
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,436
Here you go.

489
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,646
Eat up.

490
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,878
I have a feeling they think you read
Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

491
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,589
Do you remember what they were about?

492
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,802
Hey, eat mine too.

493
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,220
Eat a lot, okay?

494
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,818
Now that Dong-ju's back,
let's plan our next steps.

495
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,362
Is Han-na not back yet?

496
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,407
Right. Where's Senior Officer Ji?

497
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,451
She left with you.

498
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,289
Isn't that for the better?

499
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,916
I can be the bait.

500
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,589
I looked everywhere for you.

501
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,774
Sometimes, I can't see the target
during a competition.

502
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,986
It's unclear where it is
or how far away it is.

503
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,446
I can't even take a guess

504
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,491
though it's right in front of me.

505
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,745
Everything looks blurry.

506
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,209
When that happens, I take a deep breath

507
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,420
and hone in on a single spot.

508
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,132
Eventually, it becomes clear.

509
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,384
OH JONG-GU (J9 SECURITY)

510
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,386
It becomes sharp and vivid.

511
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,013
The spot that I'm aiming for, that is.

512
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,599
My target.

513
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,316
It's a gift.

514
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,119
Why didn't you tell me
those bastards were tailing Han-na?

515
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,622
It wouldn't have made a difference
even if I'd told you.

516
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,293
Han-na.

517
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,880
Stop overreacting.

518
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,302
Did you meet with Min Ju-yeong?

519
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:29,307
Yeah.

520
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,642
Holy cow.

521
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,228
What did you do?

522
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:45,282
I saw a blue circle
on Mr. Lee Jin-su's documents.

523
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,199
It was this.

524
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,492
EVIDENCE ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

525
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,537
"Cheong" as in blue, and "Il" as in sun.

526
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,330
Cheongil Shipping.

527
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,458
It was established in 1972,

528
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:58,170
and it declared bankruptcy in 2009
and was absorbed through a merger.

529
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,255
Min Ju-yeong monitored it
for a long time in his post.

530
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,715
CHEONGIL SHIPPING

531
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,550
They're connected to him.

532
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,552
Good work.

533
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,762
Thank you.

534
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,930
We only found out about this,
thanks to Han-na.

535
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,140
Great job, Han-na.

536
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,602
But it's dangerous going alone,

537
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,104
so take me with you next time, okay?

538
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,692
I thought you'd be feeling down.

539
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,195
Did you discover something interesting?

540
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,244
Run away as best as you can. Good luck.

541
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,497
This fairy is quite adorable, isn't she?

542
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:44,007
My boss and the Russian guest
will go straight to the port.

543
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,258
I heard.

544
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,553
And our guest from the Philippines?

545
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,347
I went to the airport for the pickup,

546
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,432
but they vanished
with the phone and the car.

547
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,439
BONDED WAREHOUSE 201:
DISPOSED DUE TO LOSS OF VALUE

548
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,108
FILIPINO AIR CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 4:10 A.M.

549
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,609
RUSSIAN SEA CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 5 A.M.

550
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,784
Stay still.

551
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,621
BONDED WAREHOUSE 201:
DISPOSED DUE TO LOSS OF VALUE

552
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,640
FILIPINO AIR CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 4:10 A.M.

553
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,411
My mother's homeland.

554
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,999
RUSSIAN SEA CARGO ETA:
NEXT DAY AT 5:00 A.M.

555
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,960
I told you
to come straight from the airport.

556
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,005
The situation isn't good here.

557
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,464
Where are you right now?

558
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,300
Collaboration?

559
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,260
Between the RIU and us?
Yes.

560
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,888
With what? The prosecution
took all the investigation records.

561
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,598
There's one thing left.

562
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,978
Here.

563
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,356
This is a synthetic drug called Candy.

564
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,860
It's a high-quality new narcotic
with extremely high purity.

565
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,237
It's only been distributed
in parts of Eastern Europe so far,

566
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,448
but I think it made its way
into Korea recently.

567
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,325
This showed up
in Monkey's stolen goods too.

568
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,785
If we pursue the drug's import route,

569
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,662
we'll eventually catch Min Ju-yeong.

570
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,456
We can't just sit back.

571
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,168
The police agency's reputation
is on the line.

572
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:45,795
Tell me this though.

573
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,505
Why are you offering to help us?

574
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,677
That's a valid point.
Why is it? To take advantage of us again?

575
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,055
What is there to take advantage of?

576
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,806
Are you saying no? Is that it?

577
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,185
Forget it then. I'll just take this over
to the Narcotics Unit.

578
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,394
Before anything,

579
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,689
let's hear more
about the information you have.

580
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:07,901
Right. Take a seat and explain it to us.

581
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,278
We need to know more
before we can make a decision.

582
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,196
Sit down.

583
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,322
Okay, then.

584
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,914
The manufacturer of Candy is Drug Demon,

585
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,209
or Drugmon for short.

586
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,921
Other than the fact that
Drugmon is a man who's 190 cm tall,

587
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,383
nothing has been confirmed
about his nationality, name, or age.

588
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,302
Some junkies say
he's a defected North Korean spy,

589
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,263
a Japanese Yakuza member,
or a Filipino gang member.

590
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,056
There are lots of rumors,

591
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,934
but the only thing they agree on is this.

592
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,481
If you see Drugmon's face…

593
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,192
you're a dead man.

594
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,303
Who the heck are you?

595
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,400
Who said you could make my Candy
without my permission?

596
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,452
Wait, are you…

597
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,620
Are you really Drugmon?

598
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:44,414
I'm sorry.

599
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,000
I only did as I was told. I swear.

600
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,260
Is that real Candy?

601
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,345
Yeah.

602
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,638
Want to try it?

603
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,278
How crude.

604
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,322
This is so irritating.

605
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:21,701
Is it good?

606
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,207
It's okay.

607
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,518
Goddammit.

608
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,864
Damn it. This is a limited edition.

609
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,463
I don't know
if the rumors are true or not,

610
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:18,925
but nobody has ever seen Drugmon's face.

611
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,182
This is Park Jae-jin of the RIU.

612
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:29,018
I'm in Gihyeon District 7.

613
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,026
When will they get here?

614
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,779
I told you
to come straight from the airport.

615
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,240
The situation isn't good here.

616
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,075
Where are you right now?
Me?

617
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,827
I'm on my way to hunt down some rats.

618
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,830
Some bastards
have been circulating fake Candy.

619
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,208
I can't let some knockoffs run wild.

620
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,127
I'll get rid of them first.

621
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,175
And to celebrate my return,

622
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,720
I'll take care of all the cops
causing you trouble.

623
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,266
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

624
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,226
Hey, this is a joint operation!
I know!

625
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,478
We go together!
I know!

626
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,318
Okay.

627
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,652
They're right on time.

628
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,740
This will do.

629
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,293
TIMER

630
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,022
RIU, this way!
Yes, sir.

631
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:08,826
Oops.

632
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,123
Hey.

633
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,042
Damn it.

634
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,093
Damn it. This didn't occur to me.

635
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,484
Get up.

636
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,028
You little…

637
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,162
Fuck…

638
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:56,916
Please save me!

639
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,668
Please save me!

640
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,128
Please save me!

641
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,088
Damn, that hurts.

642
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,383
Are you okay?

643
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,345
Yes.
Are you hurt?

644
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:30,950
It's gasoline.

645
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,703
Take cover!

646
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,954
Yun Dong-ju!

647
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:38,291
Run!

648
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,388
Dong-ju!
Hey!

649
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:57,769
Where's Dong-ju?

650
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:02,899
Hold on tight!

651
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,028
Hey, Dung-ju!
Hey!

652
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,200
Hey!
Dong-ju!

653
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,701
Just let go of her!
He's right there.

654
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,036
No, don't let go!

655
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,188
Everyone's safe, right?

656
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,524
What about Dong-ju? Did he get there okay?

657
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,027
Yes, sir. He received treatment
and went to the agency.

658
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,154
I don't think we'll find any evidence.

659
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:53,574
Based on the neck wound on the corpse,
it looks like a scalpel was used.

660
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,326
The same weapon was used
on the other body.

661
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,871
Three other corpses in the Philippines
had the same mark.

662
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,039
The murder suspect

663
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:01,708
was Drugmon.

664
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,751
Do you think Drugmon is in Korea?

665
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,545
There's no way to tell.

666
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,296
Drugmon?
It could be a copycat killer.

667
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,464
What's in that room?

668
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,384
It seems they manufactured drugs

669
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,677
and held kidnapped women here

670
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,679
before drugging
and trafficking them overseas.

671
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,682
There's only one survivor.

672
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,448
Leo!

673
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,702
You used to leech off me, you bastard.
Why are you starting shit on my turf?

674
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,372
Hello there.

675
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:44,167
I'll blow a hole in your head!

676
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:59,348
Leo, please spare me.

677
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,434
I had no choice if I wanted to stay alive.

678
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,144
You understand, right?

679
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:06,105
You can take over
the whole operation here,

680
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,815
including port operations
and distribution.

681
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,317
You can have everything.

682
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,194
Please spare my life, Leo.

683
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,528
But that's a given.

684
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,572
Those were my father's to begin with.

685
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,575
Traitor.

686
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:21,788
Yes.

687
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,041
The hands that killed the brothers.

688
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:31,005
The feet that trampled on the sisters.

689
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,343
The mouth…

690
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,803
I said "mouth."

691
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:37,887
Open wide.

692
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,099
Go on. Open up.

693
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,521
The mouth that deceived the mother.

694
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,819
And the heart that betrayed the father.

695
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,715
Don't come near me!

696
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,176
I'll shoot! Stay away!

697
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,386
I said stay away!

698
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:20,555
How old are you?

699
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,854
I'm 17.

700
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,274
Look at me.

701
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,526
Look at me.

702
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,405
Choose something that's right for you.

703
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,951
Don't make the same mistake I did.

704
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,619
Understand?

705
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,750
Need me to kill him?

706
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,925
Let me know if you find something
that might belong to a man

707
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:58,926
about 190 cm tall.

708
00:52:59,010 --> 00:52:59,844
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

709
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,013
Let's check it.
Okay.

710
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,852
Can you tell me your name?

711
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,189
Do you remember anything

712
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,901
like your parents'
or friends' phone numbers?

713
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,195
I don't know.

714
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,743
I don't remember anything.
Oh, dear.

715
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,872
Do you remember what you saw back there?

716
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,248
Can you tell us about it?

717
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:32,668
There was…

718
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,589
There was a tall man.

719
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,259
He was about 190 cm tall.

720
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,429
The men were fighting with each other.

721
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:45,973
I heard loud noises from outside.

722
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,643
Then he grabbed my neck…

723
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,605
I'm so sorry.
It's okay. You're in shock.

724
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,279
Let's give her time to calm down
before we continue.

725
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,364
Okay.

726
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,242
Please save me!

727
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,744
Please save me!

728
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:08,871
Please save me!

729
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,249
You can change into these.

730
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,919
Please put your clothes in here
so we can keep them as evidence.

731
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,838
I see.

732
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,507
Thank you.

733
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,306
Come out once you're done changing.
Okay.

734
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,350
She's the only person who saw Drugmon.

735
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,560
Her safety and security
are our top priority.

736
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,605
We'll keep her with us
until she regains her memory.

737
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,150
What if we request personal protection
and move her to a safe house?

738
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,736
Any internal information can be leaked.

739
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,865
I think it's best that we keep this
between us and the RIU.

740
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,703
But we can't keep her here forever.

741
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,913
You don't have to worry about me.

742
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,374
I'll find a place to stay.

743
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,045
I'll contact you immediately
if anything happens.

744
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:01,382
No, this is a dangerous situation,
so we'll provide personal protection.

745
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,427
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
will take care of--

746
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,143
What…

747
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,520
I'll stay with her.

748
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,527
It'll make you feel safer
than being alone.

749
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,116
Please get some rest.

750
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,410
I'll be outside,
so let me know if you need anything.

751
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,472
I'm trapped in here.

752
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:05,821
Aren't you leaving?

753
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:06,947
How can I leave?

754
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,409
She needs a reliable cop
by her side to feel safe.

755
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,661
Who are you calling reliable?
Didn't you see her earlier?

756
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,372
She clung to me for protection
like a little kid.

757
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,042
She instinctively knew I was reliable.

758
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,296
Besides, the captain said
to stay with her around the clock.

759
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,215
From this point on…

760
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,384
we're partners.

761
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,139
Since when do you ever listen to anyone?

762
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,604
The coffee tastes great.

763
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,065
The vibes are great.

764
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,318
And you're great too.

765
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,707
Are you okay?

766
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,673
Hold on tight!

767
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,057
All done.

768
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:26,235
This is kimchi jjigae made by
a former national team athlete.

769
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:30,823
Gosh, this looks good.

770
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,700
Han-na first.

771
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,704
You're making a fuss.
We can just eat boxed meals.

772
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,123
It's better with a bowl of hot stew.

773
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,291
Hurry up and try it.

774
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:46,505
What do you think?

775
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,507
It's good, right?

776
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,759
It's all right.

777
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,137
This might look simple on the surface,

778
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,014
but it's infused
with a boxer's joy and sorrow.

779
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:56,974
Try the tofu and kimchi together.

780
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,143
And the meat.

781
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,155
Here we go.

782
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,450
This is yours.

783
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,661
Here you go.

784
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,044
What is it?

785
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,921
Does it taste weird?
No.

786
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,715
It tastes like something
I haven't had for a long time.

787
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,471
You cooked dinner
even though your arm is injured.

788
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,681
Thank you.

789
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,559
It's not a big deal.
I can do this with one hand.

790
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:43,437
You've been through a lot,
so you need a hearty meal to feel better.

791
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,481
Just relax and sleep easy tonight.

792
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:49,318
I'll be keeping watch,
so everything will be fine.

793
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,946
Okay, thank you.

794
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,967
Thank you.
Not at all. Enjoy.

795
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,220
By the way, how did you injure your arm?

796
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,305
Oh, this?

797
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:22,017
I was catching a bad guy
and rescuing a certain someone.

798
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:25,062
I'm not sure if she appreciates it though.

799
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,481
So?

800
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:30,025
Shut it and eat.

801
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:34,947
I heard you were a boxer
on the national team.

802
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,658
I heard you won a gold medal too.

803
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:39,118
That's right.

804
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,995
That's amazing.

805
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,579
Do you know who Ali is?

806
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,164
Ali?

807
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,375
The person who said,
"Impossible is nothing"?

808
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,960
That's right! "Impossible is nothing."

809
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,044
That's the guy.

810
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,046
No way.
How do you know him?

811
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,798
Of course I know who he is.

812
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,676
That's so cool.
Most people think of Ali the singer.

813
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,726
Holy crap.

814
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:05,936
This is a nice house.

815
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,315
Why do you live in a studio apartment
instead of here?

816
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,235
It's too big for one person,

817
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,029
and it's too far from the police agency.

818
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,196
I see.

819
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,868
I did assign Dong-ju to her
as you suggested,

820
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,870
but would they be safe?

821
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,331
Min Ju-yeong will be targeting
Senior Officer Ji and the witness.

822
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:29,960
It's safer for those two to be together,
and officers will be patrolling the area.

823
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:35,549
And we know a mutt is the best
when it comes to protecting people.

824
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,800
So when it comes to Han-na…

825
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:42,389
we won't have to worry about her safety.

826
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,520
So much for protection.

827
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,370
Car accident victims
might seem fine at first,

828
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:08,290
but they'll unwind in a few days
and experience muscle pain and body aches.

829
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,959
Please tell his family
to keep an eye out for him.

830
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,046
Okay.

831
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,839
All right, then.

832
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:11,854
How heartwarming.

833
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,050
Damn it.

834
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,599
Thank you.

835
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,562
What's this?

836
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:03,989
CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE

837
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:07,409
Isn't this a luxury brand?

838
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,327
Is it real?

839
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,828
Yes, it is.

840
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:11,997
Captain.

841
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,250
The senior superintendent
says to get ready.

842
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:17,544
Jeez, who cares about an event
we hold every year?

843
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:18,879
It's impossible to get work done.

844
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,380
Let's go.

845
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,673
Let's go.

846
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,183
Hey.

847
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,227
Come out already. We're late.

848
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,561
Okay, just a second.

849
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,690
Oh, no!

850
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,150
What do I do?
What are you doing?

851
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,486
Hey!
Oh, no!

852
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:46,198
Are you okay?
Yeah.

853
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:47,574
Get up.

854
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:53,705
Thank you.

855
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,837
Why are you blushing?

856
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:01,964
What are you on about?

857
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,924
Is your heart pounding?
You want a beating?

858
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,801
Did that give you butterflies?
Do you want to die?

859
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:13,892
Hurry up and come out!

860
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,936
At least turn on the water for me!

861
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,063
Steamed Bun, I can't see anything!

862
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:19,982
You look good together.

863
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,734
Are you two dating?
Not at all.

864
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,988
Why? You two make a great couple.

865
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,575
Officer Yun seems to like you,

866
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,952
and you seem interested in him as well.

867
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,496
Me? Interested in him?

868
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:39,084
Or do you just not realize it?
I'd have to be out of my mind.

869
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,212
It's not like that.
I'm pretty sure it is.

870
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,844
But if it's not, then that's good.

871
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,433
Officer Yun is amazing, isn't he?

872
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,311
In this day and age,

873
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:01,106
how often do you see a man
willing to sacrifice himself

874
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,566
for the woman he loves?

875
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:10,949
We have to stop by the agency.

876
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,077
The RIU will keep an eye on you
while we're out.

877
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,748
I don't mind being by myself.

878
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,084
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

879
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,712
Consider it a form of protection
and monitoring.

880
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:27,132
You're both a witness and a suspect
as you were at the scene.

881
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,260
The weather is beautiful today.

882
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,428
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
42ND ANNIVERSARY

883
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,306
The Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,

884
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,643
now celebrating its 42nd anniversary,

885
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,937
has built strong trust with the citizens…

886
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,981
Jeez, it's hotter sitting in this chair.

887
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:45,692
It's sweltering.
Couldn't he have booked an auditorium?

888
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,903
Why are we out here in the scorching sun?

889
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,322
He said the sun
makes us look better on camera.

890
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,115
Look good on camera, my ass.

891
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,827
So? Did the commissioner not complain
after the prosecution made such a scene?

892
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:59,206
I don't know what's going on,

893
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,625
but it seems he's also in a bind.

894
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,793
Min Ju-yeong

895
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,711
is no ordinary guy.

896
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,713
Is he the president's son or something?

897
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,966
That guy would survive
making the man the butt of a crude joke.

898
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,719
Jeez, my butt is on fire right now.

899
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,222
We are able to celebrate

900
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,809
the agency's 42nd anniversary
without any obstacles

901
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,312
thanks to the tireless efforts
of our police officers

902
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:26,316
who dedicate themselves day and night

903
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,988
to protect the lives and property
of our dear citizens.

904
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:35,617
I would like to commend

905
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,954
the dedication of our police officers

906
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:43,041
and extend my heartfelt gratitude to you,

907
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,418
my dear police family.

908
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:48,672
While I, Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol,

909
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:53,719
will not be in office for much longer…

910
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,151
And who knows?

911
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,155
Maybe you'll fall for my charms
and like me back.

912
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,158
Just so you know,
there's no chance that I'll like you.

913
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,326
I don't like you.

914
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,661
Call me if you get scared.

915
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,581
Officer Yun seems to like you,

916
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,918
and you seem interested in him as well.

917
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,047
Or do you just not realize it?

918
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:37,804
Han-na!

919
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,766
I'm sorry for making you wait.

920
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,269
I don't know why the commissioner
has so much to say.

921
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,437
Your legs must be aching.

922
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,273
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I brought one of everything.

923
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,108
What do you want to drink?

924
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,158
I don't know if I'm drunk on the heat…

925
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,665
or something even stronger.

926
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:16,718
Or maybe…

927
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:22,057
I'm just losing my mind.

928
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:55,966
A total of 56 wins and 5 losses
out of 61 matches.

929
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,928
The legendary boxer
who left behind a great legacy

930
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,764
and brought everyone to their knees.

931
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:05,642
The fearless Muhammad Ali.

932
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:22,826
Then in June 2016,

933
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,079
after a long battle
against Parkinson's disease,

934
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,749
the legendary Muhammad Ali…

935
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,336
passed away.

936
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,799
I'll handle it without any problems,
so don't worry.

937
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,092
Counterpunch!

938
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:23,345
Have you kept in touch
with my mom this whole time?

939
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,679
Her statement was true.

940
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:27,724
This might be the largest bust
in the country's history.

941
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,393
The truth is out. Let's go arrest them.
Let's round them all up.

942
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:32,312
It's not that easy.

943
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,147
How dare you
get us dragged into this mess?

944
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,775
Oh, now I remember.
Me?

945
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:40,236
What should we do?

946
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,030
I have a friend.

947
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,200
The daughter of the SCIT captain.

948
