Don't treat me like this.

Who are you crying for?

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Smile.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,390
You can't treat me like this.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,120
Forget it.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,400
Take these photos

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
as my amulet.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,510
If you run away,

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,760
or if your Grandpa

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,430
demolishes the Wei Shop,

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,920
I'll send them all out.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,770
I want to see,

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,200
how you can get along in Jade Street.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,710
Do you really have to be so cruel?

(Pictures and Videos)

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,310
Is all the love we had before

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,430
a lie?

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Do you really

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,510
have no attachment to me?

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,260
(File Transfer)

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
I, Gu Dan,

34
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,280
will never run away.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,430
I'll do whatever

36
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,640
you want me to do.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
Even if my Grandpa comes,

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,640
I'll surely protect you.

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,870
I won't let you

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,120
get hurt.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,230
Now you're doing a good job.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,790
You rascal!

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
You finally woke up.

44
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,840
I thought
you were going to sleep forever.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
This familiar feeling.

46
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,280
Did you

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,400
get your memory back?

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,430
Changyin,

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,120
can you do something for me?

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,590
What do you need?

51
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,520
Send a letter to all the families saying

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,950
that the entrance to Ever Realm
will be opened tomorrow,

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,350
and anyone who wants to enter

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,000
can come and challenge me.

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,910
But you haven't...

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,430
Trust me,

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,120
I can definitely do it.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,240
Chief, have you recovered your memory?

59
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,360
Do you remember how to enter Ever Realm?

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
Is that something you should ask?

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,430
Don't ask questions you shouldn't ask.

62
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,960
- Get out of here!
- Ouch...

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,870
I'll go out and guard for you.

64
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,870
No one can come in

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,030
until you come out.

66
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,280
By the way, Sister Wan'er,

67
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,870
please help me

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
put the violet jadeite I bought

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
from the Su family here.

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,310
I'm finally back.

71
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,150
Senior.

72
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,310
Senior!

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
Keep your voice down.

74
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,120
I can't even nap peacefully.

75
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,680
Didn't you say

76
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,000
you don't take naps?

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,680
Did you learn that from your Grandpa?

78
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,120
Getting cheeky, aren't you?

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
I wouldn't dare...

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
By the way,

81
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,960
I promised to bring you

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
some top-grade jade stones.

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,710
I've prepared a piece

84
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,430
of violet jadeite
worth 500 million yuan for you.

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Where is it?

86
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,590
In the basement.

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,870
You can feel it.

88
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,430
How is it, Senior?

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,500
Will this be enough for me
to advance two more Realms?

90
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,710
No way.

91
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,840
You've only been in the third realm
for a few days.

92
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,530
Such a rapid advancement

93
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,760
will lead to an early demise.

94
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm willing to pay any price

95
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,840
for Sister Lili and Qing'er.

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
If you want to become stronger,

97
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,310
there's more than
just raising your Realm.

98
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,680
There's no need
to undermine your foundation.

99
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,600
Senior, do you mean

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,830
there are other ways?

101
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,120
To become stronger,

102
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,600
you must first know why you are strong.

103
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,830
Isn't it because of your help

104
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,600
that I've become strong?

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Partly.

106
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,870
I should say that I gave you the energy,

107
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,430
which helped you
activate your inherent abilities.

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,310
My inherent abilities?

109
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,830
Your Wei family members are strange.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,510
You have both the Jade Buddha Hand
and the Jade Mysterious Hand.

111
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,750
As long as you absorb my energy,

112
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,310
you'll keep getting stronger.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,310
Are you saying

114
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,240
that the reason our Wei family
has the Jade Buddha Hand

115
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,390
is not because of you,

116
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,830
but because we can absorb energy

117
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,510
from you

118
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,870
and use it to enhance our own abilities?

119
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
Do you know

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
why I haven't recovered
from my injuries?

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,950
It's because your rascal Grandpa

122
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,390
touches me every day.

123
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,270
I have to rely on energy
to recover my cultivation.

124
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,560
Well, my Grandpa is
indeed a bit excessive.

125
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,700
So what I'm trying to say is

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,190
that not only can you absorb my energy,

127
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,270
but you can also absorb other people's.

128
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,270
Other people's?

129
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,870
For example,
that person in the fifth realm.

130
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Fifth realm...

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,870
Then how do I absorb his?

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
You absorb him

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,600
how you absorb me.

134
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,920
You mean you want me
to put my hand on his head?

135
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,720
But with his strength,

136
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,190
I can't even get close to him.

137
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,630
In this regard, I'm not worried
about your Wei family members.

138
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,310
As long as you succeed,

139
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,000
you can kill him in seconds.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,070
Kill him in seconds?

141
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,310
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Do you know

143
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
why your Grandpa is so strong now?

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,750
My energy is not enough

145
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,630
for him to break through the Realm

146
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,950
and enter the Spiritual Realm.

147
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,630
There's the Spiritual Realm
above the Realm?

148
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,760
Grandpa is no longer
just in the ninth realm?

149
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,310
Take your time to comprehend it.

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,430
I'm going to hibernate.

151
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,190
Senior...

152
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Senior?

153
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,120
Why do I feel like I've been fooled?

154
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Forget it.

155
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,720
How do I get out?

156
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,030
Senior.

157
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,230
Senior!

158
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,560
Senior,

159
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,510
how do I get out?

160
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,120
Lili,

161
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,510
you're such a good counselor to me.

162
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,870
Young Master Chase,
do you have something to be happy about?

163
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,270
After sending the antidote

164
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,630
as you suggested,

165
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,830
Wei Jianhao

166
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,040
really opened the entrance
to Ever Realm.

167
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,870
(Jianhao has regained his memory?)

168
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,190
Wei Jianhao

169
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,390
truly doesn't know what's good for him.

170
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,770
He actually dares

171
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,200
to take the initiative
to send the message,

172
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
asking anyone who wants
to enter Ever Realm

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
to challenge him.

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,480
This is called courting death.

175
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,070
It seems he doesn't know

176
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,430
what the fifth realm

177
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,510
is all about.

178
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,390
Mr. Gu,

179
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,360
since he can't recognize
his own strength today,

180
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
you'll have to fight a quick battle

181
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,270
and destroy Wei Jianhao.

182
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,800
The Ever Realm will belong
to our Chase Rodford family.

183
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,510
Young Master Chase, don't worry.

184
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,310
I won't hold back.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,920
(Wei Jianhao,)

186
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
(what exactly are you doing?)

187
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,270
What?

188
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,160
Are you worried about him?

189
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,120
How could I be?

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,870
I'm just surprised

191
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,480
Wei Jianhao

192
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
is so overconfident

193
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,120
as to challenge so many noble families.

194
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Why on earth would he do that?

195
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,360
Is there

196
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,070
any conspiracy behind all this?

197
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you really not know why?

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,510
It's just for you.

199
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,910
For me?

200
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,630
He opened the Ever Realm

201
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
and lured us to Jade Street

202
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,240
to solve all the problems in one battle.

203
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,160
Then all the major families

204
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,720
will submit to him
as the Master of Ever Realm.

205
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,750
Our Chase Rodford family

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
will have no place

207
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,630
in Chongjiang

208
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,510
or even in Jinling.

209
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,910
And you, Su Lili,

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,870
will no longer be under my control

211
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,240
or obey me.

212
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
Young Master Chase,

213
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,840
why would he

214
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
make such a fuss over me?

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,390
It's probably what you Huaxia people

216
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,510
call "Rage for a Beauty".

217
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,240
I'll take you to the battle later.

218
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
It's a pity

219
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,960
that you won't see him

220
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,510
fighting bravely,

221
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,030
but you'll find him

222
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,440
turned into a defeated loser
who could never get up again.

223
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,510
(I wonder how Brother is doing.)

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,510
So clumsy.

225
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,510
You're about to marry
the new head of the Su family

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
and you can't even handle
such small tasks.

227
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,670
How will you
serve that fool in the future?

228
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,440
Qing'er's marriage to the Su family

229
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,030
is a sacrifice for the Ye family.

230
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,350
From now on,

231
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
she'll be Madam Su.

232
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,680
You should all

233
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,600
treat her with respect.

234
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
Yes, Grandpa.

235
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Grandpa,

236
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,030
the entrance to Ever Realm is open.

237
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,790
Finally, there is news
about the Ever Realm.

238
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
(Has Brother regained his memory?)

239
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,670
Wei Jianhao, that fool,

240
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,790
has told

241
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,390
those who want to enter the Ever Realm

242
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,720
to challenge him.

243
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,150
Challenge all the families?

244
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,910
I wouldn't dare to say that.

245
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
I didn't expect

246
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,600
him to be so ambitious.

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Grandpa,

248
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
he's so arrogant,

249
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,670
why do you praise him for his ambition?

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
Isn't it good

251
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,440
to be arrogant?

252
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,390
If he dares to say so,

253
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,720
it means

254
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,080
he has the ability

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,390
and courage to be arrogant.

256
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,510
Jianren,

257
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,030
you're the same age as Jianhao.

258
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
Why can't I see

259
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
his wild ambition

260
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,240
in you?

261
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,670
The Ye family

262
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
has no choice

263
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,590
but to seek refuge
with the Chase Rodford family

264
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,120
and even marry my granddaughter

265
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,910
to a fool.

266
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,040
However,

267
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,440
our Ye family will not be subordinate.

268
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,440
To be strong

269
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,790
and become

270
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
one of

271
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,390
the five great families,

272
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,910
we must have the ambition

273
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,600
and the will to dominate.

274
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,720
Unfortunately,

275
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,080
none of our descendants

276
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
from the Ye family

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,630
has the guts

278
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,510
of Jianhao.

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,630
(Chongjiang Jade Street)
The Chase Rodford family

280
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,840
has power all over the world,

281
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,870
with various experts.

282
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,720
If they take over the Ever Realm today,

283
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,990
I really don't know to what extent

284
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,240
the Chase Rodford family will

285
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,550
be terrorized in the future.

286
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,120
This time
when the Ever Realm is open,

287
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,900
although many families
from Chongjiang have arrived,

288
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,270
who dares to come out and challenge

289
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,270
the Chase Rodford family?

290
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,440
Even the Su family lost.

291
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,600
Did you see it? I heard

292
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,080
that the Su family

293
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,600
was given away by Mrs. Su.

294
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,750
Such a lackey.

295
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,660
Shame on her!

296
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,670
Looking at her like this,

297
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,480
she didn't gain any benefits, did she?

298
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,600
Indeed.

299
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,870
Don't you see the Su family's Miss Lili

300
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,150
following Young Master Chase?

301
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,120
Enough. I heard

302
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,000
she's already been
with Young Master Chase.

303
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
No way.

304
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,550
The Su family is really unfortunate.

305
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,630
The Ever Realm is already
in the Chase Rodford family's pocket.

306
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,340
Mr. Ye, you're here.

307
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,440
The Ever Realm is about to change hands,

308
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,120
and you, Young Master Chase,
are the new Master of Ever Realm.

309
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,390
The Ye family is here
to witness this moment.

310
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,940
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

311
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,200
Why hasn't Wei Jianhao come out yet?

312
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,440
Is he hiding inside like a tortoise?

313
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,910
With such a big scene,

314
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,320
I think he's too scared

315
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,510
to come out.

316
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
(Can Brother protect the Ever Realm?)

317
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,270
(Jianhao has already
opened the Ever Realm.)

318
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,790
(I don't know
if his cultivation has improved.)

319
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,270
(Unless he can defeat everyone,)

320
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,790
(the experts from these families
will know what to do.)

321
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,560
(That way no one will)

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,630
(dare to covet Ever Realm
in the future.)

323
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,080
You just know how to eat.

324
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
You eat so much,

325
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,870
and none of you work.

326
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,370
Mom!

327
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,350
Mom.

328
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,340
Come on.

329
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

330
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,790
Wei Jianhao,

331
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,630
get out!

332
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,480
Wei Jianhao, get out!

333
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Wei Jianhao,

334
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
get out!

335
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Coward Wei,

336
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,720
get out!

337
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Coward Wei,

338
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,030
get out!

339
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Coward Wei,

340
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,790
get out!

341
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Coward Wei,

342
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,550
get out!

343
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,910
Coward Wei,

344
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,120
get out!

345
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,600
Coward Wei,

346
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,790
get out!

347
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,390
Coward Wei,

348
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,600
get out!

349
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Coward Wei...

350
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,790
So noisy!

351
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,390
He said it was today,
but he didn't say what time.

352
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,720
What's so noisy about it?

353
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,270
Sister, you're back.

354
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,080
Did Young Master Chase bully you?

355
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,510
How could that be,

356
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,350
Wan'er?

357
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,030
I didn't force her.

358
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you want

359
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,790
to join us?

360
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,150
It would be more interesting

361
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,080
to have you both.

362
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,320
You rascal!

363
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,510
Sister, come back here!

364
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,700
When he comes out,

365
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,080
he'll beat you up and drive you out

366
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
of Chongjiang.

367
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,800
Really?

368
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,630
Then let him come out.

369
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,670
I'm waiting for him to beat me up.

370
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,910
Don't be like a tortoise
hiding in its shell.

371
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,240
Tortoises are strong too, you know.
