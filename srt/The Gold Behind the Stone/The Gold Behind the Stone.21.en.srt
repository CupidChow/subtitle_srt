Wei,

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,120
you can't kill people.

32
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,840
What do you want to do?

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,230
I'm from

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,400
the Chase Rodford family.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
How dare you touch me?

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,790
I don't care
what kind of family you are.

37
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,680
Sister Wan'er doesn't want to marry you,

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,620
so you're not allowed
to pester her again in the Su family,

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,870
remember?

40
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,470
None of your business!

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,310
That's right.

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,120
Young Master Chase, are you alright?

43
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,840
You'll know

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,800
what kind of person
you've offended today!

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
I haven't finished
releasing the five poisons

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,630
to detonate them yet.

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,120
Young Master Chase, you...

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
Sister Wan'er!

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Sister Wan'er.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,500
Quickly send Mr. Su
and the others to the hospital,

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,820
and get Sister Wan'er checked out.

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,710
It's you again, the pauper!

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,080
Time and again, you've ruined my plans!

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,030
Mom, stop it.

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,870
Mrs. Su,

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm here

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
for Sister Wan'er and Sister Lili.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,680
I hope you won't let them

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,520
marry someone they don't like.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Do you think they'll

61
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,800
marry you just because of that?

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,810
- I'm telling you
- I...

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,870
to give up.

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,840
Whether it's Wan'er or Lili,

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,160
I won't promise them to marry you.

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Let go!

67
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,520
Wan'er, let's go.

68
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,540
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

69
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,300
(Wei Shop)

70
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,710
Qing'er,

71
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,160
I've brought you something delicious.

72
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
Oh my gosh!

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,290
I've been looking forward
to his return day and night.

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Husband, when will you return?

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,520
When will you...?

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
Xia Changyin!

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,070
Husband?

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Why do you dress up

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,310
like a ghost?

80
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm looking after the house for you.

81
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm scared that you've left me alone
in the basement

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
for so long.

83
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,360
Stop being so dramatic.

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,430
I've only been gone for one day!

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
One day?

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Really?

87
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,310
I feel like it's been a long time.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,120
It must be because I miss you so much.

89
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,350
Hug me.

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Brother.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
Qing'er.

92
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,110
Qing'er,

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,980
look, I bought you

94
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,260
your favorite baked sweet potato.

95
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,190
Eat it while it's hot.

96
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,040
Thank you, Brother.

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,120
It'll be better

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
if you don't say thank you

99
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,510
to me anymore.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,630
I forgot to take it.

101
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,330
It's okay,
I'll go back and get it for you.

102
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,240
No need, Brother. I can do without it.

103
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,630
It'll be quick.

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,920
What's wrong, Brother?

105
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,160
What was I about to do just now?

106
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,070
Forgot again?

107
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,480
Did you hit your head?

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,510
Why are you so forgetful
all of a sudden?

109
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,000
Am I poisoned?

110
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,310
I don't feel anything.

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
No feeling?

112
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,510
You'll feel it in a minute.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Could it be that the Aquaman's poison
is starting to take effect?

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,420
Brother, you've been poisoned?

115
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,270
What poison?

116
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,510
Let's go to the hospital.

117
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,440
Let's go.

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,040
This poison isn't contagious, right?

119
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,710
The poison he has

120
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,760
is called Forgetfulness.

121
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,720
Just say it.

122
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,000
Who am I?

123
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
Sister Wan'er, what's wrong with you?

124
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,800
What about me?

125
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,090
It's better if I don't remember you.

126
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,120
How dare you forget me so soon?

127
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,270
Sister Lili.

128
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,600
What's wrong with Sister Wan'er?

129
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,070
Wan'er was poisoned

130
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,510
by Max Poison.

131
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,510
It can drive people
to madness and death.

132
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,800
Fortunately, she was cleaned up
within 12 hours.

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,830
The doctor said

134
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,600
there's no impact on her health,

135
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,040
but her brain is not clean,

136
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,070
so she's now

137
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,750
a rebellious girl.

138
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,830
What about Master Su and Butler Su?

139
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,000
Grandpa and Butler Su
have been poisoned.

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,390
They've been sent back to Jinling

141
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,920
where there's a better medical team.

142
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,390
But Grandpa said

143
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,160
he wants us to stay

144
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,510
and make sure to guard Jade Street.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,460
Sister-in-law Lili,

146
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,680
did you just say that

147
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,270
Brother was poisoned with

148
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,440
so-called Forgetfulness?

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
It's the poison

150
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,270
of the Deep Sea Poison King.

151
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,560
After being poisoned by this,

152
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,430
one will immediately lose memory,

153
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,290
thus forgetting martial arts skills,

154
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
and losing combat ability.

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,550
Fortunately,
due to his high cultivation level,

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
he didn't lose his memory right away,

157
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
but it looks like

158
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,830
he won't be able to hold on for long.

159
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,950
(If Young Master Ye
really lost his memory,)

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
(he wouldn't remember
that I broke off the engagement,)

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,000
(so the sisters and I would be)

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,830
(on the same starting line.)

163
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,270
Jianhao,

164
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,120
I'll go and cook for you.

165
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
So,

166
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,190
I'll forget Qing'er too?

167
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,480
When you completely lose your memory,

168
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,510
you'll become a fool.

169
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,360
My fourth uncle was poisoned

170
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,440
by this poison back then.

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,240
That's why he became foolish.

172
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,390
Is it useful to go to the hospital

173
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,670
to cleanse the brain?

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
No, it won't.

175
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Young Master Chase,

176
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm sorry

177
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
for what happened yesterday.

178
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,720
Master Su is old

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,870
and confused.

180
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,510
Please don't take it to heart.

181
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,920
So,

182
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,790
about your marriage to Wan'er,

183
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,960
is it...?

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,960
I think

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
you don't have as much influence

186
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,630
in the Su family

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,270
as Mr. Su.

188
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,030
You can't even decide

189
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,510
on your own daughter's marriage.

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,030
We don't have anything

191
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,270
to talk about now.

192
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,630
Young Master Chase,
please give me a little more time.

193
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,480
I'll find a way

194
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,270
to make the marriage work.

195
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,720
Don't you Huaxia people often say,

196
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,440
"One sight makes
a man's life miserable"?

197
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Actually,

198
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,840
I really like Wan'er.

199
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,440
I had no choice

200
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,030
but to poison her.

201
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,480
- Yes...
- In my heart,

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
you've long been my mother-in-law.

203
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
Young Master Chase,

204
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,480
it's a pity that Wan'er and her Grandpa

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,750
don't know you.

206
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,120
It's just that Mr. Su

207
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,150
is too old and dim

208
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
to be

209
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,510
as insightful

210
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,630
as you are.

211
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,600
Haven't you ever thought

212
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
that the Su family

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,790
should have a new head?

214
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,510
What do you mean by that?

215
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,670
I mean you can be

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the head of the family yourself.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Me?

218
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,030
Mr. Su has been poisoned

219
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,790
by the Deep Sea Poison King

220
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,600
and can't take care of himself.

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
It's the right time for you

222
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,910
to take over the Su family's business.

223
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,720
To be honest,

224
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,360
it's not like
I haven't thought about it.

225
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,600
Over the years,

226
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,020
I've been secretly

227
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,720
supporting my maternal family,

228
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,030
the Bai family.

229
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,520
Our Bai family is involved

230
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,670
in all the Su family's business.

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,790
With the Bai family's help,

232
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
it's not impossible

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,120
to take over the Su family's business.

234
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,440
If you say so,

235
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
I'm willing

236
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,080
to support you
with our family's financial support.

237
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,960
After you take over the Su family,

238
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,000
we'll be not only in-laws,

239
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,720
but also business partners.

240
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
That's great!

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
I'll go back to the Bai family

242
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,270
and talk to my elder brother now.

243
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,270
Don't worry about Wan'er.

244
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,510
I'll help you convince her.

245
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,080
That's wonderful.

246
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,910
As expected,

247
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,320
greedy people are easier to manipulate.

248
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,510
Tell our family to begin

249
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,720
to seize the Su family's properties.

250
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,920
Also,

251
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,030
tell those who are lurking
in Chongjiang to show up

252
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,750
and help me take down

253
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,080
Jade Street.

254
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,080
Yes, I will.

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Jianhao,

256
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,870
you wouldn't even know
which pajamas to wear,

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,030
would you?

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,030
Isn't this mine?

259
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
Jianhao,

260
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,870
why are you wearing my pajamas?

261
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,510
Whose pajamas is he wearing?

262
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,270
Don't wear it.

263
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,910
Take it off!

264
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,920
Don't wear her pajamas.

265
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
It looks good. Don't take it off.

266
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,920
- Don't take off my clothes.
- Take it off!

267
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,590
- Itchy.
- Take off!

268
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,140
Take it off!

269
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,170
Take it off...

270
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,630
This one should be mine.

271
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,320
