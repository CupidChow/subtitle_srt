13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,020
(Jade Exhibition)

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,240
Brother Wei,
I have complete confidence in you.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,000
Wei Jianhao,

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,430
you really dared to come, huh?

17
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,070
No need for you to worry.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,640
You brat.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
Can't you see
that my sister is worried about you?

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,920
No...

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,710
Just don't let Sister Wan'er

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,280
cause trouble for me again.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,510
What are you up to now?

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,920
Keep it up.

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,680
Wei Jianhao,

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,870
let me repeat.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,430
If you lose today,

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,070
you must cripple one hand
and leave Chongjiang.

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,230
I also remind you,

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
if I win,

31
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,840
Ye Sijie is about to kneel
and apologize to my sister.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
His eyes are always covered
with black satin.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
Could he really be a blind person?

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,590
Impossible.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,860
How can a blind person appraise stones?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,520
Wei Jianhao won
against Master Song last time.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,030
I wonder if it was just luck
or real skill.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,280
Who are you betting on to win?

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,080
Of course, Magic Eye will win.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,520
Isn't this President Mo
of the Jade Association?

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
Master.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,470
Mr. Mo,

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,310
why did you come in person?

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
I've been asked

45
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,520
to witness today's bet.

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
who has such great influence,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,680
but with Mr. Mo as a witness today,

49
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,310
I believe some people

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,590
won't dare to bully others
by relying on their power.

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,310
This is the one
who defeated my disciple Song Ye,

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,360
Wei Jianhao,

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,470
right?

54
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,850
It's me, Mr. Mo.

55
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,280
Your disciple Song Ye lost the bet.

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,230
Then he shouldn't

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
appear on Jade Street again.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,950
Wei Jianhao, you're talking nonsense.

59
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,310
I'm here today

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,910
- Remember, don't use your right hand.
- to see how you lost

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,000
What did you say?

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,990
to the Magic Eye

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
with my own eyes!

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Master!

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,260
(Jade Exhibition)

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,520
Today, let me witness

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,120
the competition
between the two jade experts.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,680
Please, both of you.

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,680
How will it be conducted?

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
It's very simple.

71
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,840
Check the jade flesh
on the blind material,

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,870
determine the location
and size of the flesh,

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
and whoever is more accurate

74
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,710
will win.

75
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,470
Agreed.

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,840
It's not easy to tell
if there's any jade flesh

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,400
in a blind material,

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,870
but you have to tell where it is
and how big it is.

79
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,160
It really was worth coming here.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
This is truly a battle between masters.

81
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,240
He really is a blind person!

82
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,600
He can't even see

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
what the stone looks like, can he?

84
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,270
Most people in this world

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,510
are like those who have eyes
but can't see.

86
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,390
They can only see what their eyes
allow them to see,

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,430
believing that seeing is believing,

88
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,430
but in reality, they are narrow-minded
and ignorant.

89
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,350
So you can see

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,310
what the eyes can't see.

91
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,310
Why not give it a try and find out?

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,360
What a fine piece of Moxisha material.

93
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
He can't see it.

94
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,310
But he knows it's from Moxisha.

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,510
(White Eye Stone Appraisal?)

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,830
(Magic Eye, one of the three demons)

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,190
(of the Ye family is truly amazing.)

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,160
(Ye Jianren is really
sparing no effort to win.)

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Wei Jianhao,

100
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,000
I want to see

101
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,190
how much longer you bumpkin can pretend.

102
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,040
Until your left hand is fully trained,

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,240
you can't use your right hand
in front of others.

104
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,840
(If I don't use the Jade Buddha Hand,

105
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,950
(I can't avenge my sister's suffering.)

106
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,510
(Why doesn't Mr. Mo)

107
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,390
(let me use my right hand?)

108
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,040
(Does he know
about the Jade Buddha Hand?)

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,920
(Logically speaking, if I use it,)

110
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,430
(ordinary people can't see it at all,)

111
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,920
(unless my Jade Buddha Hand
has been exposed.)

112
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,160
That's strange.

113
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Why doesn't Brother Wei use his hands
to touch the stone?

114
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,920
(Why does today's atmosphere
feel so strange?)

115
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,720
Cut from the right three centimeters,

116
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,430
two centimeters inward
you can see the jade.

117
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,390
And it's the longest 15 centimeters,

118
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,040
the widest 12 centimeters,

119
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,040
8 centimeters thick,

120
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,190
and weighs 10 jin.

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,040
Explained so clearly.

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,830
Can this blind man see through things?

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,430
We'll have to cut it open

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
to find out if it's accurate.

125
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,150
Wei Jianhao,

126
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,920
stop pretending

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,360
and admit defeat if you can't identify.

128
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,830
Don't waste our time.

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Exactly.

130
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,430
Everyone's time is so precious.

131
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,780
With so many people watching today,

132
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,950
it's impossible
to deceive anyone, right?

133
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,680
The truth will be revealed soon.

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,920
Yes, just admit defeat.

135
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,390
(This can't go on.)

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,600
(Judging from his results,)

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,430
(I'm sure to lose if this goes on.)

138
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,600
Wei Jianhao,

139
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,190
let me repeat.

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
If you lose today,

141
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,160
you must cripple one hand
and leave Chongjiang.

142
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
(If I lose,)

143
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,360
(I'll lose my right hand as well,)

144
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
(so let's fight it out.)

145
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Alright,

146
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,910
Brother Wei has finally made his move.

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,610
Watch out.

148
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
(It is really the Jade Buddha Hand.)

149
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,110
Be quick!

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Wei Jianhao, don't compete anymore.

151
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Hurry to the hospital.

152
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,200
You're bleeding a lot.

153
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,100
In this way, I can't avenge my sister.

154
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,300
If you wait any longer,
your right hand will be useless.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,600
So much blood.

156
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,320
You can give up.

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
Mr. Mo,

158
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,390
maybe you should
pause the competition first.

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,240
Such a thing has happened.

160
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
The match is paused!

161
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,240
President Mo,

162
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
although you're in charge

163
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,240
of the jade industry,

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,840
it's not right for you
to be so biased, right?

165
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,680
What's wrong with
suspending the competition

166
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,150
when a contestant is

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
being assassinated?

168
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Who knows if Wei Jianhao,

169
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,390
knowing he's outmatched,

170
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,550
has deliberately
arranged a bitter trick, huh?

171
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,600
That's right.

172
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,390
I told you, it's a joke for a beggar

173
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,360
to compete with a master

174
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,200
of the Ye family.

175
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,550
What's the big deal

176
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,600
if a person like him

177
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,390
loses a hand?

178
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,550
Don't you know who set up today's game,

179
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,390
Young Master Ye?

180
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,030
Any idea?

181
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,240
Of course, I don't know.

182
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Do you all know?

183
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,870
No.

184
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,710
No, we don't.

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,600
So the competition must continue.

186
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,840
Since Young Master Ye
dares to be so arrogant,

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,360
it seems to be
under the orders of Master Ye.

188
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,910
I'll have to ask him.

189
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,750
Give me my phone!

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Master,

191
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,270
I think this is Wei Jianhao
trying to play tricks.

192
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Bring it here!

193
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,510
Wei Jianhao,

194
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,030
since Mr. Mo is
openly protecting you like this,

195
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,550
there's nothing I can do.

196
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,100
I'll have to let you off the hook today.

197
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,150
Wei Jianhao,

198
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,000
weren't you arrogant?

199
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,630
Why are you acting cowardly now?

200
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,030
Try talking?

201
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,120
But this time you broke a hand,

202
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,200
it's much easier to go begging.

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,390
You win by this way,

204
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,600
Why are you so afraid of losing to me?

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I, Ye Jianren, have never lost.

206
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Brother, look at him.

207
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,840
He really looks like a stray dog.

208
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,840
You're a homeless dog,

209
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,250
and you want me to kneel down
and apologize to your sister?

210
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,630
Let me tell you,

211
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,200
when I return to the Ye family,

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,030
I will make her pay double

213
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,960
for your disrespect.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
You dare?

215
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
What wouldn't I dare?

216
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,360
In your current state,

217
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,480
you still want to stand up
for your despicable sister?

218
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,240
Mind your own business.

219
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,960
The competition is not over yet.

220
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,320
I want to compete one more time.

221
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,000
Wei Jianhao, are you crazy?

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
You want to die?

223
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,910
One of your hands is already useless.

224
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,550
What qualifications do you have
to bet with me?

225
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,600
I still have my left hand.

226
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
If I lose again,

227
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,030
you can disable my other hand as well.

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,550
Aren't you happy?

229
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,750
Make me happy?

230
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,840
You think too highly of yourself.

231
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,320
But I promise you,

232
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
tomorrow, Magic Eye will
win your other hand.

233
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
Tomorrow?

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,550
His hand won't be healed yet.

235
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,030
I don't have time
to waste on this loser.

236
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,720
If you can't, you don't have to play.

237
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,550
Tomorrow it is.

238
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,150
Wei Jianhao,

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,550
calm down.

240
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,390
Tang Lili,

241
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,790
have you forgotten your position?

242
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,440
Young Master Jianren,

243
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,030
let's have a chat.

244
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,140
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

245
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,550
Is my Jade Buddha Hand

246
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,240
really ruined?

247
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,790
What is this fool doing?

248
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,750
Holding a stone in the rain?

249
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,840
Is he crazy?

250
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,250
- Who wouldn't agree?
- Exactly.

251
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,190
Don't be angry with lunatic.

252
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,850
(It turns out that
without the Jade Buddha Hand,)

253
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,720
(I'm nothing.)

254
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,120
What's wrong with him?

255
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,390
He doesn't even have an umbrella.

256
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,390
Let's go.

257
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,490
You've been with me for so many years.

258
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,910
I'm not used to being without you.

259
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,150
Hello, Grandpa.

260
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,240
You finally decided to call me.

261
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,000
Did you not listen to me

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,530
and use your right hand
to appraise the stone?

263
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,150
Grandpa,

264
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,790
you already know.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,030
The Ye family has already
taken action against you.

266
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,690
If you didn't use the Jade Buddha Hand,

267
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,360
would they come all the way
to target you?

268
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
That's because they went
after my sister first.

269
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,260
Even if they don't come looking for me,

270
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,600
I'll find them.

271
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,750
Qing'er.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,150
How is your right hand?

273
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
It seems like

274
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,110
it's useless.

275
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm sorry for your troubles.

276
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,550
Someone will come to assist you shortly.

277
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,360
Assist me?

278
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,030
Some things can't be discussed
over the phone.

279
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,600
So he will tell you some information.

280
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,960
If you feel something,

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,550
don't tell anyone,

282
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,630
even the people you trust the most.

283
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,840
