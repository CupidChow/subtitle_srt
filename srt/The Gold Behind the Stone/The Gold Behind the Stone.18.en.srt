12

=Episode 18=

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,510
I've always wanted
to make a top quality set

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,880
of imperial green jewelry.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,560
How come I cracked it?

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,110
Why didn't you remind me earlier?

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,240
Aunt, I've already warned you,

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
but you couldn't listen.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,430
How dare this poor kid

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,680
make fun of me?

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,950
He's insulting me

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,510
for not knowing what true value is.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
Aunt,

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm already the prospective heir
of the Bai family.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,680
My father asked me
to come to the election

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,560
in the hope that you can
facilitate a marriage

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,350
between me and Lili.

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,480
If you want to become the head
of the Bai family,

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,560
you must have the support
of the Su family.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,710
Su Lili is now

31
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,400
Master Su's favorite,

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,690
and all the Su family's business

33
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,320
will be handed over
to her in the future.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,870
If she becomes the daughter-in-law
of the Bai family,

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,310
it will be good for our Bai family,

36
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,760
but it's just too much
of a burden for you.

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,070
Aunt, you know,

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
marriage is only one aspect.

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,150
I like women

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,790
like Lili

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,710
who are hard to tame.

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Aunt Bai,

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,646
what do you want to talk about?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Sit here.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,310
I'm worried

46
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,750
about Wan'er's marriage,

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,870
but I also want
to find a good marriage for you.

48
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,000
My nephew, Bai Ge,

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,280
is a young man of great talent,

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
calm and reliable.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,360
Not only is he the prospective heir
of the Bai family,

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
but he is also

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,710
an expert who has already reached
the second realm.

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,150
I think the two of you

55
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,710
are a good match in terms

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,080
of appearance,
family background and ability.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
It's true that

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,710
Young Master Bai is a standout
among the gentlemen of noble families.

59
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,280
However, I don't need

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,910
someone else
to arrange my marriage for me.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Aunt Bai,

62
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,560
if you have nothing else to do,

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,710
I'll leave first.

64
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
Wait a moment!

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Lili,

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,150
do you look down on our Bai family?

67
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,190
You're not

68
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,960
interested in me, Su Lili,

69
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,735
but in my status as Miss Su
of the Su family,

70
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,630
right?

71
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,710
No.

72
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,560
Ge, you go out first.

73
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,590
You ungrateful wretch!

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,630
I raised you like my own daughter,

75
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,750
and you dare to contradict me?

76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,000
Like your own daughter?

77
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,720
Aunt Bai, have you forgotten

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,680
how you've been punishing me
since I was a child?

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,320
And now you want
to control the rest of my life?

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,310
I was disciplining you
on behalf of your mother,

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,800
who died young.

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Don't talk about my mom like that.

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,910
How dare you talk to me like that?

84
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,560
Aunt Bai,

85
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,360
I respect you as an elder,

86
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,400
so I'll put up with it this time.

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,120
But if you ever lay a hand on me again,

88
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,150
don't blame me for being rude.

89
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't think that I can't do anything

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,840
about you now that you have power.

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,970
I've been desperately working

92
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,040
for the Su family's benefit
for so many years,

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,120
striving to establish my position
in the Su family,

94
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,560
just to let you know

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,150
that I'm not afraid of you anymore.

96
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,160
Don't think you can threaten me again.

97
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,950
You've already disregarded me
as your stepmother

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
on the basis

99
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,070
that Master Su likes you.

100
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,390
We are supposed

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,560
to mind our own business

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
in this house,

103
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,600
so I don't need you

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,160
to bother about my personal affairs.

105
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Fine,

106
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,560
I can leave you alone

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
if you don't marry into the Bai family.

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,950
But you must

109
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,600
drive that poor guy out

110
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,390
of the Su family for me,

111
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,450
and keep him as far away from Wan'er
as possible.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,630
He is a guest invited by Grandpa.

113
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,070
Don't use him to pressure me.

114
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,560
Then go and tell Grandpa yourself.

115
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,710
You...

116
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,230
Fine.

117
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,510
Since you don't take me seriously,

118
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,950
don't blame me for being rude.

119
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,150
Aunt,

120
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,480
why did Lili leave?

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,270
What about...?

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
What's the hurry?

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,950
Can't you see

124
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,190
she's protecting

125
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,390
that poor guy?

126
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,800
You mean

127
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Lili refuses to marry me

128
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,800
because of that poor guy?

129
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,360
Find a chance

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,870
to deal with

131
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,800
that guy

132
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,560
and expel him from the Su family.

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
By that time,

134
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,360
Su Lili

135
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
will be yours.

136
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,620
Here's a small stone appraisal meeting.

137
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,870
You can go and have some fun.

138
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,120
Wan'er will come to you later.

139
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,600
I have some guests to entertain today,

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,920
so I won't accompany you.

141
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Okay.

142
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,160
You go ahead, Sister Lili.

143
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,880
Young Master.

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello, Mr. Mo.

145
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,480
Why did you give me a stone

146
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,310
worth 100 million yuan?

147
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,160
Did you think that one was too cheap?

148
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
I didn't consider it thoroughly.

149
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,870
No...

150
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,870
It's just that the stone was broken,

151
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,390
and it hurt me so much

152
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,600
that I shouldn't have taken it out
if I'd known.

153
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
It's nothing.

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,680
Young Master, where are you?

155
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,800
I... I'm...

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,190
I see you.

157
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,350
Mr. Mo,

158
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
why are you here too?

159
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,360
I heard that the Su family today

160
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,270
has some stone collections
for a charity sale.

161
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,510
So I came.

162
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,680
Those are some rare

163
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,040
and superb stones.

164
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,070
I certainly can't miss

165
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,600
such a good opportunity.

166
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
Young Master, let's go in.

167
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Forget it.

168
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't have any money.

169
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,360
I can't afford it.

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,160
I brought money.

171
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
Isn't this inappropriate?

172
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,680
After all, it's your money.

173
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,510
Besides, I still don't know

174
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,520
how to repay

175
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,040
the 100 million yuan stone you gave me.

176
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,120
Young Master, you don't need to repay.

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
Do you still want it?

178
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,650
I'll get you a few more pieces

179
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,540
for your mother-in-law.

180
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,710
Mr. Mo,

181
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,920
are you that rich?

182
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
I feel so pressurized

183
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,640
to be your

184
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,720
Young Master.

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Young Master, you must be joking.

186
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,920
I've heard that Mr. Su has taken out

187
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,560
three rare treasures

188
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
he's been collecting for years

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,360
to mix with the exhibition area

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,600
for today's charity sale.

191
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,830
Would you like

192
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,360
to go and look for them yourself?

193
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,600
(The stones Grandpa collected
in the basement)

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,240
(are all extremely rare stones
that are tens of millions of yuan or more.)

195
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,990
(These stones
in the Su family's exhibition hall)

196
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,360
(are quite suitable for exchanging energy
with Black Tortoise.)

197
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,600
Alright,

198
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
let's go in and take a look.

199
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Come on.

200
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,720
President Mo!

201
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,600
President Mo.

202
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,180
The Su family is organizing
this charity auction

203
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,750
to observe

204
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,830
- the financial strength
- President Mo.

205
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,400
and stone appraisal skills of young men.

206
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
President Mo.

207
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,920
Young Master, you can focus
on appraising stones

208
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,120
and shoot whichever one you like.

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,480
I've prepared 300 million for you.

210
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,480
If it's not enough,

211
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,680
we can add more.

212
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,750
300 million?

213
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,070
Isn't that too much,

214
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,910
Mr. Mo?

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Young Master,

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,870
you don't seem
to understand your position.

217
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,360
In the jade industry,
who can beat the Wei family

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
in terms of boldness?

219
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,390
Is our Wei family that arrogant?

220
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,590
Of course.

221
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,080
It's because Mr. Wei

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
keeps such a low profile

223
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,550
that these families don't know

224
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,120
what they're doing

225
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,390
in front of Wei Changming.

226
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,750
That's what I said about Grandpa.

227
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,480
He only left me 500 yuan

228
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,320
on his trip.

229
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,910
Isn't this the poor guy looking
to live off someone else?

230
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,750
How much money did you cheat
to buy stones?

231
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,870
Young Master Bai,

232
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,390
please mind your words.

233
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
President Mo,

234
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
why are you hanging out

235
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
with this brat?

236
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
So you're looking for trouble?

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,600
What are you saying?

238
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,910
Today is Aunt's betrothal banquet.

239
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,200
How could I make trouble
in my own family?

240
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,470
Young Master.

241
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Young Master,

242
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,870
you're just too kind.

243
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
I learned that from Grandpa.

244
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,960
Do you have

245
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
some misunderstanding about him?

246
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,480
Didn't he always keep a low profile?

247
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,550
When he was your age,

248
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,750
he was quite dominant
in the jade industry.

249
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Whenever he met

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,670
someone he didn't like,

251
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
he'd make them lose all their money

252
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,510
and beg for forgiveness.

253
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
He...

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,550
Don't tell him I said that.

255
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,750
Just let you know.

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
Don't take it seriously.

257
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
Let's move on, okay?

258
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,870
Young Master,

259
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,000
take a look at this flat cut material.

260
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,480
It's a natural yellow jadeite stone,

261
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,510
bright and even in color,

262
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,150
with a smooth and delicate texture.

263
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,990
The production of yellow jadeite stone
is extremely rare,

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,080
so it holds a high collection value.

265
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,550
As expected of the Su family,

266
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,720
a random piece

267
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,840
is a rare treasure that most collectors

268
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
have never seen before.

269
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,120
What do you think?

270
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,840
It only weighs six jin,

271
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
but if it's fully loaded,

272
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,390
the market value could be
over 50 million yuan.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,750
Do you think it's fully loaded?

274
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,550
Are you really that persistent?

275
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,120
Don't flatter yourself.

276
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,480
You're not the only one

277
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,720
who can check

278
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,750
these stones.

279
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,250
This piece is priced at 20 million yuan.

280
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,150
I'll take it.

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Don't we have
to be first come, first served?

282
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
Alright!

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
You were here first,

284
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,510
but can you afford it?

285
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,350
Mr. Mo,

286
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,390
- buy it.
- Alright.

287
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
I can't believe that

288
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,750
you actually make President Mo

289
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
of Chongjiang Jade Association
so willing to serve you.

290
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
How dare you!

291
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,680
Wan'er,

292
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,320
how could you help an outsider

293
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,550
to attack your cousin?

294
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,390
One should support

295
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,120
who's reasonable rather
than who's closer.

296
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,960
How did you

297
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
manage to fool

298
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,150
so many people?

299
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
Are you envious?

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,860
Thanks, Sister Wan'er.

301
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,200
You're relying on a rich family

302
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,300
to live off someone else

303
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,670
and still proclaiming it
so unscrupulously.

304
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,870
I really don't know

305
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,080
what to say about you,

306
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,270
a cheeky and shameless person.

307
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,590
Mrs. Su,

308
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,630
you remind me of someone

309
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,790
called Zhang Ying.

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,030
Is it true that in your opinion,

311
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,600
as long as a person has no money
or family background,

312
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,750
whatever he does is his fault?

313
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,680
It's good that you know.

314
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Don't you daydream

315
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,320
about marrying a rich girl.

316
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Then how can you be so sure

317
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,910
that I have neither of these?

318
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
You mean

319
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,080
you're both wealthy
and have a noble family background?

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,320
Everyone,

321
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,480
do you believe this young man comes

322
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,790
from a noble family

323
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,270
and has endless money?

324
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,800
Sister Wan'er,

325
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,870
I was hesitant to intervene,

326
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,390
but from now on,

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm in charge

328
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
of your marriage.

329
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,840
I'll only marry you.

330
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,720
I... I didn't mean that. I was just...

331
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
So this is how you deceive my daughter.

332
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,200
Fine,

333
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,630
I'll reveal your true colors

334
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,080
in front of my daughter today.

335
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,360
Don't you want to be a rich man?

336
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Today, our Su family has displayed

337
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
three collectible stones.

338
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,750
If you can afford one of them,

339
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll let you pursue Wan'er.

340
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,320
Who can afford those three pieces?

341
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,670
Indeed.

342
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,320
What kind of rich family

343
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
would be able to afford that?

344
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,870
Wouldn't that guy be a joke if he went?

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Bragging too much
will eventually backfire.

346
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,350
So what?

347
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,630
Now you don't dare?

348
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,120
He's lucky to get in the door.

349
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,360
How can he afford to buy stones?

350
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,350
Okay.

351
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,910
