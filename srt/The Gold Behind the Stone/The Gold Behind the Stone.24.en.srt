13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,120
Tang Wan'er,

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,320
come out!

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Aunt Bai.

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,350
Mom, what are you doing here?

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,640
Is she your mom?

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,920
Hello, Aunt.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,280
Call me Mrs. Su.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,680
Who are you to get close to me?

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
That's it.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,790
You don't remember me?

23
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,590
The only one I can remember now

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
is Sister Wan'er.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
Only Wan'er?

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,790
You've lost your memory,

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,200
why do you still remember her?

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,790
Look at you,

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,430
you're even worse than before.

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
What right

31
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,950
do you have

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
to be with our Wan'er?

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,200
Mom, he's the one I like,

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
can you stop being so snobbish
towards him?

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,310
Am I wrong?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
He was poor

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,350
and unsophisticated before.

38
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,790
Now it's even worse,

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,310
and he doesn't even have a memory.

40
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,350
What's the difference
between him and a fool?

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
Don't talk about him like that!

42
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,910
Sister Wan'er,

43
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,910
don't argue with your mom because of me.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,910
Truly, a grown daughter
can't be kept at home.

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,800
He hasn't said
he'll be responsible for you yet,

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,030
are you so anxious to protect him?

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
Without the antidote,

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,710
he'll never get his memory back.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,080
Do you want to live with such a fool
for the rest of your life?

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Mom,

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,080
can you get the antidote for him?

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
Why should I help him?

53
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,800
I've already made a deal
with Young Master Chase.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,310
He's willing to forgive
your previous mischief,

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
and

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
he's also willing to engage with you.

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
I don't want to marry him!

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,250
Is it that marrying
Young Master Chase will...?

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,080
Sister!

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
Aunt Bai,

61
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,400
why did Wan'er come to Chongjiang?

62
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,470
Why did she run away
from home for two years?

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,400
It's because

64
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,400
you had to force her

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
to marry someone she didn't want to.

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
So don't threaten Wan'er with this.

67
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
She won't go back with you.

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,310
You're not welcome here.

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,630
Please leave.

70
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,150
Alright.

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,310
If Wan'er doesn't want
to go back with me today,

72
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,030
I won't force her.

73
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,400
But please recognize the situation.

74
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,800
The great families of Chongjiang,
led by the Ye family,

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,740
have already sided
with the Chase Rodford family.

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,310
Do you still want to rely on this fool?

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,310
He can't protect himself anymore.

78
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,820
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

79
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,510
Even if you go back now,

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,870
Young Master Chase is so cunning.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,660
You might not be able
to get the antidote.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,870
What to do then?

83
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,310
Who... who let you in? Get out!

84
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,680
I have important information.

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,080
Excuse me.

86
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,160
From what I've seen,

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,270
as soon as Gu Dan returned,

88
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,460
not only was he overly concerned
about Jianhao's poisoning,

89
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,360
but Qing'er

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,430
was also missing.

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,190
Based on what I know of him,

92
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,120
he's got a problem.

93
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,510
After Qing'er's disappearance,
I sent someone to look for her.

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
Why don't you suspect

95
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,270
that Gu Dan likes Qing'er?

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Impossible.

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,430
I'm quite familiar with his tastes.

98
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,270
(Gu Dan not only knows
about the basement,)

99
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
(he also knows about the Wei bloodline.)

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
(He's definitely coming
for the Ever Realm.)

101
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,000
(But how did he know about it?)

102
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,070
(Could it be that
the Chase Rodford family sent him?)

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
According to my speculation,

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,920
he's an undercover agent
sent by someone else.

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,510
He's ostensibly being nice to Qing'er,

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,680
but he's actually
prying for information.

107
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,720
Dare to play undercover in front of us?

108
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,710
I...

109
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm going to kill him.

110
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,670
Stay calm.

111
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,800
With Gu Dan's intelligence,

112
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
why don't we
play an infernal game with him?

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
You're not on the same side?

114
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,480
Of course not.

115
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,810
Previously,

116
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,070
I was deceived by his rhetoric.

117
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,920
Moreover, as the sister-in-law,

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,670
how can I just watch him

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,430
take away Qing'er?

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm the former sister-in-law.

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,920
Is there a problem?

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,040
He's

123
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,720
mine now.

124
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,120
(The Chase Rodford family
has made their move.)

125
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,870
(It's too dangerous for Jianhao now.)

126
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,830
(I won't let anything happen to you.)

127
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
Alright.

128
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,670
Young Master Chase

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,010
is underestimating us

130
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,510
by placing an undercover agent

131
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,680
beside us.

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
It's a hard time.

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Let's put aside

134
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,430
our personal feelings

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
and be united to fight.

136
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,920
I hereby announce

137
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
that the Traitor Elimination Plan

138
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,000
has officially begun.

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,510
Let's call ourselves,

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,940
the Sister-in-laws' Alliance.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,050
What are you doing?

142
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,300
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

143
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,480
(Why do I remember)

144
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,310
(there is something important)

145
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,480
(to me here?)

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,310
(What is it?)

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
It looks much more comfortable this way.

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,510
(That Xia Changyin is really...)

149
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,070
(Why are there so many stones here?)

150
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,950
(What exactly is)

151
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,510
(the Ever Realm they mentioned?)

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
Ever Realm,

153
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,950
where are you?

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,520
Can you

155
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,870
sense me?

156
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,830
Help.

157
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,310
Help!

158
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,720
Say it.

159
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,120
Who sent you to be an undercover?

160
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Ladies,

161
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,200
what undercover?

162
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,030
Qing'er is missing.

163
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,510
Where did you take her?

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Also,

165
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,120
why are you investigating
the entrance to the basement

166
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,360
and the Wei bloodline?

167
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,910
How do I know

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,030
where she is?

169
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,490
All I know is
that the Chase Rodford family

170
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,790
is sending a master of the fifth realm.

171
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,170
Hasn't Chief lost his memory?

172
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,600
I was afraid
he wouldn't be able to fight,

173
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
so I asked a few more questions.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,510
Is it really necessary to tie me up?

175
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,960
How did you know the Chase Rodford family
was sending someone?

176
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,240
When did you collude with them?

177
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
I...

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,870
Collude with them?

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,840
Still pretending to be confused, huh?

180
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,990
Wan'er.

181
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
Pretty boy,

182
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,000
if you lie,

183
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll scratch your face.

184
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,440
Don't...

185
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
This face is all I have left.

186
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,630
Let's talk this over.

187
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,670
Please don't make a move.

188
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm sick of your face.

189
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,240
Wan'er, slice him.

190
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,840
Xia Changyin,

191
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,200
you wicked woman!

192
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,390
How ruthless you are.

193
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,200
Didn't we just break up?

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,080
You don't have to retaliate
against me like this, do you?

195
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,480
Stop morally blackmailing me.

196
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,510
You want the top

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,000
or the bottom?

198
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,670
Choose one.

199
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,270
I want both.

200
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,000
Then tell me,

201
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,600
who ordered you to come here?

202
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
I think you'd better confess.

203
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,230
Who is it?

204
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,720
Grandpa...

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Is Brother Wei here?

206
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
Grandpa, save me!

207
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,390
Why has Mr. Gu come?

208
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,600
Take him to the basement.

209
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Okay.

210
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Brother Wei.

211
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,240
Mr. Gu, why are you here
all of a sudden?

212
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,800
I heard from Gu Dan

213
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,150
that Brother Wei had been poisoned.

214
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,240
I came to see him.

215
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,120
What a coincidence.

216
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,480
He just went to the hospital.

217
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,630
He's not here?

218
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,840
A rat

219
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
was just caught.

220
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,600
It seems I've come at a bad time.

221
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,030
I'll come back later.

222
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
Take care.

223
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,080
Wei Jianhao died of poisoning?

224
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,350
You rascal.

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,030
You rascal,

226
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,870
why are you like this again?

227
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,270
Weren't you already better?

228
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,910
Wake up.

229
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,670
Don't make me a young widow!

230
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Stop wailing!

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,720
You'll kill him if he doesn't die.

232
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,790
There's a heartbeat.
He's passed out again.

233
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
We'll cultivate together.

234
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,200
There are so many people here.

235
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,790
How did you get down?

236
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,440
If you want to buy a stone,
please look upstairs.

237
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,720
I don't buy stones.

238
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,790
I'm looking for someone.

239
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,030
Who are you looking for?

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,270
I'm looking for someone
who can open the entrance to Ever Realm.

241
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
(Why does that voice sound so familiar?)

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
There's no one here you're looking for.

243
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,120
You're so pretty,

244
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,510
and you're lying.

245
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,870
You'll get beaten for lying.

246
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,390
Being unreasonable
is the only way to get beaten up.

247
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,000
If you don't want to be thrown out,

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,080
leave now.

249
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,480
Want to fight?

250
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,720
You'd better not.

251
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,920
If you're afraid,

252
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,280
then get out.

253
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm afraid I'll hit you too hard later

254
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
and cripple you all.

255
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,270
Then I'll cripple you.

256
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,790
(Wan'er is already in the first realm,)

257
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,270
(yet she can't even touch)

258
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,200
(this mysterious man.)

259
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,750
(Could this person be
in the third realm?)

260
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,440
The pressure

261
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,750
of the fifth realm?

262
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
The person I want to find

263
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,790
has already been found.

264
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,440
I won't play with you anymore.

265
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,510
