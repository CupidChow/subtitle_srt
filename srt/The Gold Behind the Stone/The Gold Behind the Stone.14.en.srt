13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm back.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,350
Recovered?

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
(Try my Realm.)

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
(Will it be too noisy for them?)

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,270
(Forget it.)

18
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,950
So this is really the entrance
to the Ever Realm.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,400
I mustn't let anyone
know about this place,

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,510
or else everyone will be in danger.

21
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,310
(Some other day,
I'll add more good stones,)

22
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,310
(and go to Black Tortoise
to exchange for energy.)

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
(I really want to mend it for you.)

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Qing'er,

25
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,630
it's me

26
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,400
who didn't do a good job
as an elder brother,

27
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll make up for what I owe you

28
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,240
all these years.

29
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,900
(Wei Shop)

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,430
Wei Jianhao?

31
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,510
Have you recovered?

32
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Sister Lili,

33
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,310
where's Mr. Mo?

34
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,240
He said he's gone

35
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,390
after he cured you.

36
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,600
How come I didn't know

37
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,830
that Mr. Mo's medical skills
are so brilliant?

38
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
You healed so quickly

39
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,390
from such a serious injury.

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
Yes,

41
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,390
I didn't expect it either.

42
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Not only is he good at jade,

43
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
he's also a miracle healer.

44
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,920
Do you have any pajamas at home?

45
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,680
I gave my pajamas to Qing'er.

46
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,630
I can't

47
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,270
wear this dress to bed.

48
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, I have.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
They're on the drying rack

50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,070
on our balcony.

51
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
Take your pick.

52
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,240
Wei Jianhao, come here.

53
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,630
What kind of lousy pajamas are these?

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
We men usually sleep in vests.

55
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,630
There're no other pajamas.

56
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,240
Why don't you
wear Xia Changyin's clothes?

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,630
Are her pajamas for normal people?

58
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Well...

59
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,400
Forget it.

60
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,950
I'll just take this for one night.

61
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,790
Okay.

62
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Sister Lili.

63
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,350
Since Wan'er

64
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,870
has left,

65
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,600
it's not very convenient for you here.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Why don't you

67
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,720
go back to Tang Clan and enjoy yourself?

68
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
You go bring Wan'er back

69
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,870
for me tomorrow.

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,870
Why should it be me?

71
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,830
I didn't make her angry.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If it weren't for you,

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
could we siblings

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,190
have gotten into such a mess?

75
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,600
How could you...? Ouch.

76
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,600
Let me tell you,

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,950
- Listen to me first.
- now you're

78
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,560
an irresponsible man.

79
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
Listen to me first!

80
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,310
Let go!

81
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,040
Still dare to look?

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm not...

83
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I didn't.

84
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Still looking?

85
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,870
I... I didn't.

86
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
You...

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,310
Sister Wan'er...

88
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,150
Wan'er!

89
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,000
Wan'er, listen to me.

90
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,790
Wan'er.

91
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,040
Wan'er, it's not...

92
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,240
Here we go again?

93
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
Tang Lili, can you stop?

94
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,910
Chief.

95
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
You have recovered?

96
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,190
Mr. Mo did it?

97
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
It's amazing.

98
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,800
Mr. Mo is indeed a miracle healer.

99
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,000
What are you two doing in my room?

100
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,670
Qing'er was sleeping in my room.

101
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,120
The two of us had no place to sleep.

102
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,080
So we've come here
to share with you, Chief.

103
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,270
I told you,

104
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,150
you two can leave the shop

105
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,270
and go back to your own home.

106
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,440
You're so cruel.

107
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,630
I knew men are all the same.

108
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,990
When they have a new love,
they forget the old one.

109
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
Don't be ridiculous.

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
What new love? What old one?

111
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Then why was I kicked out

112
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
and not Tang Lili?

113
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,510
Her sister has already left.

114
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,670
Why is she still here?

115
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,390
Yes, why not kick her out?

116
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,390
I understand now.

117
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,390
You just can't let her go.

118
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,480
I knew it!

119
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,280
I...

120
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,240
Chief can't bear to let her go, so what?

121
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,390
Why are you jealous?

122
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,390
I...

123
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm not jealous at all.

124
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,670
I just think

125
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,510
it's inappropriate
for the two sisters...

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,200
Just inappropriate.

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,870
It's Chief's good fortune

128
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,200
to have them together.

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,670
Alright...

130
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,240
You two, shut up.

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,240
Do whatever you want.

132
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
He told you to shut up, did you hear?

133
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,840
Take your hand away.

134
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,390
Your hand...

135
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,910
Every time I was humiliated by them,

136
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,790
I fantasized
that my brother would show up

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
and protect me,

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
but what about you?

139
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,240
Not once did you come.

140
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,510
(I'm such an irresponsible brother.)

141
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,240
Now you're

142
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,240
an irresponsible man.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
(Why am I)

144
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,790
(an irresponsible man?)

145
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,510
Why didn't I notice before

146
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,080
that Wei Jianhao is rustic but handsome?

147
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,250
He's also the Young Master
of the Ye family,

148
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,000
and a bossy president.

149
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,120
Oh my.

150
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,050
Xia Changyin, you...

151
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,550
- Dressed like this on my bed!
- Don't shout.

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,510
What are you doing?

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Keep your voice down.

154
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,630
He'll find out we're having an affair.

155
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,670
Who's having an affair with you?

156
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,230
You two,

157
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
get up now.

158
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,060
- Get out.
- I'm not going out.

159
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,890
Get out.

160
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,750
Well, Chief.

161
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
Can we sleep in the basement?

162
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Go wherever you want.

163
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,390
- Alright.
- Okay.

164
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
Hurry up, go.

165
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,990
Let's go.

166
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,080
Good night.

167
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,200
Remember to close the door.

168
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,910
- What's wrong?
- Chief,

169
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,670
We can't get in without the key.

170
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,440
It's in the cotton shoe by the door.

171
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,630
So careless.

172
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,910
Is it really that careless?

173
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
Let's go.

174
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,270
