=Episode 12=

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
I'm leaving.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,940
Wait a moment.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,150
Are you going

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,390
to pick up your sister?

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,240
I'll help you and explain to Wan'er

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,030
after I get my sister back.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,430
You won't be able to see her.

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,430
No one can stop me
from picking up my sister.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,510
You can't leave.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,070
Why?

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
You want to stop me too?

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,400
The Magic Eye has rendered
your right hand useless.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,030
The Ye family has
two other demons as well.

26
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,040
Do you want to be completely crippled?

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,310
Even if I become crippled,

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,710
I'll still go to bring back my sister.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
Move aside.

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,350
Stop using these little tricks
to block me.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,480
I've had a bowl of tea,

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
I'm dizzy

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
and my legs are numb.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Then I'll help you

35
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,790
when I get my sister back.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,710
Brother!

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,230
Mom!

38
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,020
Don't leave me.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
Brother!

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,710
Qing'er?

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,030
It's really you.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,920
Qing'er.

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,840
I miss you so much.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
You said you missed me,

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,310
but why haven't you come

46
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,800
to see me once in all these years?

47
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,710
Qing'er,

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,590
I...

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,300
I've always wanted
to go to the Ye family to find you.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,430
But Grandpa said
I'd only bring you trouble.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
I...

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,030
You left me at the Ye family.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
Do you know

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,870
how I was bullied all these years?

55
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,630
Every time I was humiliated by them,

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,630
I fantasized
that my brother would show up

57
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,840
and protect me,

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
but what about you?

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Not once did you come.

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,470
I'm sorry, Qing'er.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
It's my fault for being useless.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,520
I've let you down.

63
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,280
Do you two siblings want to talk inside?

64
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,910
It's raining outside.

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,190
Yes, Qing'er.

66
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,060
Let's go inside first.

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,870
I'll never leave you again.

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
I'll protect you.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,630
Your Brother isn't ignoring you.

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,890
His right hand is crippled

71
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,430
for you.

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's go inside and talk.

73
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,270
Let's go.

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
Qing'er.

75
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,680
How did you manage to escape?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
Did the Ye family

77
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,040
give you a hard time?

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,830
Didn't you ask Butler Su to save me?

79
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,910
Butler Su?

80
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,390
Alright, why do you ask
so many questions?

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
It was hard to get out.

82
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,720
- Qing'er, are you tired?
- Yes.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,790
Here you are, Qing'er.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,430
You can rest assured and stay here.

85
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,430
Believe me,

86
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,480
I'll never let you go back
to the Ye family again.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Miss,

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
now that Ye Qing'er
has left the Ye family,

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,830
whatever we do

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,160
to the Ye family,

91
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,470
Wei Jianhao

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
should definitely not take action.

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,000
Thanks to your thorough consideration.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,070
Mr. Ye would never know

95
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,870
that the only person
who can save the Ye family now

96
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,240
is Wei Jianhao, who had been abandoned

97
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
by the Ye family.

98
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,430
Tell those old guys
to immediately strike

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
and exterminate the Ye family's forces

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,270
in Chongjiang.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Make sure to seize the Jade Street

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,480
before the entrance
to Ever Realm appears.

103
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,430
Don't worry, Miss.

104
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,510
The Ye family will soon
give up the Jade Street.

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
The most difficult person
to deal with now

106
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,070
should be Wei Jianhao.

107
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,320
The person who can deal with him

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,390
has already arrived.

109
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,630
This is Iron-faced Judge
from the Southwest Jiang family.

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,480
Magic Eye was defeated by him.

111
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,830
So disgraceful.

112
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,240
You go to Jade Street immediately

113
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,630
and injure Wei Jianhao

114
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,680
to force him to enter Ever Realm again.

115
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay.

116
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Of course,

117
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
remember

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,070
to frame the Ye family.

119
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,640
Young Master.

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Mr. Mo, you called me here,

121
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,310
is there any news from Grandpa?

122
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,680
Mr. Wei asked you

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,910
to ensure

124
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,830
the protection of Jade Street.

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Protect Jade Street?

126
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,070
Something's going on here?

127
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,390
Someone has leaked news
about Ever Realm.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,270
Those old monsters
from the hidden families

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
have sneaked into Chongjiang.

130
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,160
Although the Ye family

131
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,070
is guarding Chongjiang,

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm afraid

133
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,390
they won't be able to hold out for long.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,300
If even the three demons
of the Ye family

135
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,310
can't handle them,

136
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,600
how can I defend Jade Street?

137
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,000
Your current strength

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
should have already
broken through the Martial Artist

139
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,480
and reached the first realm.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,270
But you're still unable to deal with

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,430
those old monsters.

142
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,190
First realm?

143
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,110
Yes,

144
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,430
above the Martial Artist

145
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,680
is the Realm.

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
But the Realm

147
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,030
is divided into nine levels.

148
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,560
The highest known

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,750
reclusive masters

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,680
have reached

151
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,240
the third realm.

152
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,240
What level is my Grandpa at now?

153
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,070
He's long been unpredictable.

154
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,830
Before he returns,

155
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,070
you must enter Ever Realm
as soon as possible

156
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,310
to cultivate

157
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,240
in order to defend Jade Street.

158
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,950
But I haven't even found the entrance

159
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,240
to Ever Realm yet.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
By the way,

161
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,630
did you go somewhere
before your final match

162
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,800
with Magic Eye?

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,000
That day I remember
when I was in the basement,

164
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
I saw a hole in the wall

165
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,480
and reached out to touch it.

166
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,390
Then I fainted.

167
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,600
But when I woke up,

168
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
my left hand had gained an ability.

169
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,910
That makes sense.

170
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
The place you entered

171
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,870
while you were unconscious

172
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
should be the Ever Realm.

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,630
The entrance to Ever Realm

174
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,300
can only be opened by the bloodline

175
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,510
of the Jade Buddha Hand's heir.

176
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,270
Ye Jianren said

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,120
my mother was killed

178
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,840
because of the Jade Buddha Hand.

179
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,670
Was it also because of the Ever Realm?

180
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,670
All I know is that

181
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,480
back then, all forces fought

182
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,840
for the Jade Buddha Hand

183
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,440
at all costs

184
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,910
to open the entrance to Ever Realm.

185
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,600
Your mother nullified
her own Jade Buddha Hand

186
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,870
to stop a bloodbath.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,910
I won't let my mother die in vain.

188
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,460
(Wei Shop)

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
What do these people want?

190
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,550
Where's Chief Wei?

191
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,670
He can't be away in this situation.

192
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,780
(Wei Shop)

193
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,790
Miss Qing'er,

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,720
come here.

195
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,670
I'm here to take you back.

196
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,870
Did the Ye family send you?

197
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,910
I'm not going back.

198
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,870
Domain!

199
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
(This invisible barrier)

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,480
(was formed by Wei Jianhao.)

201
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,920
(No wonder Magic Eye)

202
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,600
(can't see through things then.)

203
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,660
(Wei Shop)

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,390
You can't take Qing'er away.

205
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,010
(Chongjiang Jade Street)
One stationary, one active.

206
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,200
Able to defend while attacking.

207
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,030
Very skillful moves.

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
It's just a pity

209
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,000
that it's not as strong
as it should be.

210
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Who are you?

211
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,200
Iron-faced

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Judge!

213
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,800
Domain!

214
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,110
Seal!

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
My domain

216
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
was broken by him.

217
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,360
Young Master, be careful.

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
He's at least in the second realm
or above.

219
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,030
I don't care what he is.

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
If you want to take Qing'er,

221
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,150
you have to go through me first.

222
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,080
I don't want to talk to you.

223
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Control!

224
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,670
I'll cripple you first.

225
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,750
Young Master!

226
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,910
- Brother!
- Young Master!

227
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,550
It's over, Chief can't beat him.

228
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Nonsense!

229
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,740
- Young Master.
- Brother,

230
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,030
how are you doing?

231
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,720
Qing'er, don't cry.

232
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
I'm fine.

233
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,560
Brother, don't fight with them.

234
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,100
I'll go back to the Ye family with them.

235
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,910
Every time you were bullied before,

236
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,630
I didn't show up,

237
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
but this time

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,270
I'll protect you.

239
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,230
Young Master,

240
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,200
you take Miss Qing'er away

241
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,600
and leave this place to me.

242
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,320
The old monsters are here.

243
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,870
How can you actually stand up?

244
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,870
But your left hand is already broken,

245
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,120
how can you still fight with me?

246
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,630
Even if the God of Heaven comes today,

247
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
he won't be able
to take Qing'er away from here.

248
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,320
