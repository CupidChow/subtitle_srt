=Episode 5=

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,600
Wei Jianhao,

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
if you dare to touch her even once,

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,920
I'll beat you up.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,030
That's what you've done

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,470
to my sister all these years?

18
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,480
After all these years,

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,310
your family is still

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
as stupid and arrogant as ever,

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,510
bullying people.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,640
He's a devil

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,510
like his mother.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,920
How dare you?

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,510
Wei Jianhao, are you crazy?

26
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,710
What kind of madness is this?

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,030
I knew you were in cahoots
with the Ye family.

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,280
You don't even have the right to see me.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,680
If you dare to speak arrogantly
in front of Young Master Ye,

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,120
I'll have Wan'er smash your mouth.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,630
Lili,

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,720
there's no need to waste time
with this kind of person.

33
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,630
Just throw him out.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,150
Young Master Ye,

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
he is really the best

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,800
stone appraiser I've ever seen.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
Please give him another chance.

38
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,680
What's so special
about a stone appraiser?

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,430
The stone appraisers of the Ye family

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,630
can be of any kind we want.

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,990
A bunch of trash from the Ye family

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,590
also dare to compare themselves to me?

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,080
- You...
- Little brat,

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,310
you're arrogant.

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,870
If you have any objections,

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,310
feel free to compete with me.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,310
Who are you?

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Are you worthy?

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,520
The Magic Eye, Li Kuo.

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,680
He's the Magic Eye?

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
One of the three leaders
of the Ye family,

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,030
right?

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,190
The Magic Eye?

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Is he very powerful?

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Whether he's powerful or not,
you'll know after a match.

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
But if you lose,

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,910
you must cripple one of your hands

58
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,000
and leave Chongjiang.

59
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,030
What if I win?

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,870
If you win,

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I'll have my sister apologize to you.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
I don't need her apology.

63
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,680
If I win,

64
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,120
she must apologize to Qing'er.

65
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,920
Kneel in front of Qing'er,

66
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,240
kowtow and admit your mistake.

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,840
What are you saying?

68
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,910
I, the Fourth Miss of the Ye family,

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,630
have to apologize to a servant?

70
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,470
Stop dreaming.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,870
Rest assured.

72
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,520
He can't defeat the Magic Eye.

73
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,680
Wei Jianhao,

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't care
what your sister has suffered.

75
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,800
You'd better endure it.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Do you know who this Magic Eye is?

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,190
No matter who he is.

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,680
I agreed.

79
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,710
You...

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,470
Okay,

81
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,310
since you are like this,

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,120
our Tang Clan
will definitely not help you.

83
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,960
Without money, I wonder
how you can fight against them.

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Our Gu family

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,190
can sponsor Brother Wei.

86
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,150
What is Mr. Gu doing?

87
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,870
Yes, has he gone crazy?

88
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,630
What is he doing?

89
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,240
Your Gu family

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
don't want the Ye family's
support anymore?

91
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,830
Since the Ye family has already

92
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,300
secretly backed Tang Clan
to take over 60% of the market,

93
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,240
it won't be long
before they take over all of it.

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,600
I don't want to be left
to the mercy of others,

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
so I'd rather place my bets

96
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,270
on this Brother Wei.

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,600
Good.

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,800
Since we've all made up our minds,

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
we'll see you

100
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,480
tomorrow morning.

101
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,190
Brother.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,060
Does he really think this kid

103
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,190
can compare to the Magic Eye?

104
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,680
Brother Wei, am I impressive?

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,070
What are you thinking?

106
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,900
Aren't you afraid
of playing yourself to death?

107
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,680
The Gu family relies on you.

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,750
Brother, we can't let him return
to the Ye family

109
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,630
to see Grandpa.

110
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,630
Don't worry.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,940
Isn't Grandpa interested
in his jade Buddha hand?

112
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,720
Just cripple him tomorrow.

113
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,560
My grandson, Gu Dan,

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,120
has offended you in some way before.

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,510
Please don't take it out
on the Gu family.

116
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,190
I have already expelled him
from the family.

117
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
It's indeed a wise decision.

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,630
First, let me take you
to find your beloved grandson.

119
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,120
Young Master Ye, Miss Ye,

120
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,390
let's take our seats first.

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Brother Wei, you mean

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,310
that my useless grandson is

123
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,510
in this Xia Shop?

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
This is the Wei Shop, after all.

125
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
My stone!

126
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,830
What do you mean by "your stone"?

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,720
This basement belongs to our Xia Shop.

128
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
No...

129
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,480
Bumpkin, you dare to come back?

130
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
- You...
- You brat!

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,270
Grandpa?

132
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,160
This is that piece of top-quality green,

133
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,720
with at least 20 centimeters
of jade flesh,

134
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,390
worth 15 million.

135
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,120
Now that you've cut it like this,

136
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
it's

137
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,800
completely ruined.

138
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,630
Get out!

139
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Grandpa.

140
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,360
What are you doing here?

141
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

142
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,720
How dare you talk
to Brother Wei like that?

143
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,190
Are you trying to ruin the Gu family?

144
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,600
Brother Wei?

145
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,270
- Grandpa, you...
- Shut up!

146
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,430
Do you know what I saw?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,350
Those two guys were actually
using a hammer to break stones.

148
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,510
One, two, three,

149
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,310
four,

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,240
five,

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
six,

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
seven, eight, nine.

153
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,040
- You two...
- Chief Wei.

154
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,950
If you have any needs in the future,

155
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,790
feel free to ask me.

156
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,190
Brother Wei,

157
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,190
it was

158
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,240
my grandson's fault.

159
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,120
However,

160
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,630
I've already taught him a lesson,

161
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,830
please be magnanimous
and forgive him.

162
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,190
And allow him to make amends.

163
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,950
From now on, he'll be your assistant,

164
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,870
attending to your needs diligently.

165
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,630
No...

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Brother Dan,

167
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,750
don't be so lowly

168
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
to a bumpkin.

169
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,660
Who are you calling a bumpkin?

170
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,870
He is my chief,

171
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
and he's your chief too.

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
You'd better show some respect
from now on.

173
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,920
Don't call me chief.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,000
You two are not allowed

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,070
to go down this basement again.

176
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,720
Alright, no problem.

177
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
No problem.

178
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,430
Besides,

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,070
you two should leave this shop.

180
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,560
Consider these emeralds on you

181
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,070
as ransom for your shop.

182
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,480
No...

183
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,320
I have to stay in the store
to serve you.

184
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,630
Are you hungry?

185
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Come on, Changyin.

186
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
Let's go for...

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,870
Chief is unacceptable.

188
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,240
Then...

189
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,790
This is my brother.

190
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,120
Grandpa...

191
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,120
Grandpa Wei, please wait a moment.

192
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,030
The food will be served shortly.

193
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
Come here.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,120
Brother Wei,

195
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,000
be careful in tomorrow's competition.

196
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,480
I've heard that the strength
of the Magic Eye

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,670
is terrifying,

198
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
different from the stone appraisers

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,910
you've fought before.

200
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,910
(It seems he also has
extraordinary abilities.)

201
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,390
(No matter what,)

202
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,480
(I'll make Ye Sijie kneel down)

203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,550
(and apologize to Qing'er.)

204
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Closing down now.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,030
Brother Dan,

206
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,840
do we really have
to work for that bumpkin?

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,990
Grandpa's been possessed,

208
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,570
and we can't go back to the Gu family,

209
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
so why don't we just
follow Grandpa's wishes,

210
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,230
stay here,

211
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,320
stabilize Wei first,

212
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,510
and then find a chance

213
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
to ship out the stones?

214
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
Brother Dan, you're indeed farsighted.

215
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
If this stone is cut

216
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,910
two centimeters to the left
of the center line,

217
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
the jade flesh is visible.

218
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,180
It is of good quality,

219
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,890
and is a piece
of transparent bright green.

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,790
It's eight centimeters long,

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,870
five centimeters thick,

222
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,390
and weighs about three jin.

223
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,600
But unfortunately,

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,320
there are spots of cloud
and fine cracks,

225
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,510
and as it continues,

226
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,630
it starts to change color.

227
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Impossible!

228
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,510
This stone hasn't been opened yet.

229
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,960
How can you, a blind man,

230
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,840
see the cloud and cracks?

231
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,670
I've spent three million

232
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,440
on this stone,

233
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,870
it must be first-class.

234
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Miss Ye,

235
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,320
I've spent a third of my mind

236
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,460
just so you don't have

237
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,390
to worry about losing
until you're on your knees tomorrow.

238
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,440
Since the outcome
has already been discussed,

239
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll leave you alone

240
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,480
and go back to rest.

241
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,440
Who gave you permission to leave?

242
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,280
You...

243
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,080
Sijie,

244
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,630
don't worry.

245
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,240
After checking the stone,

246
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,080
won't we know whether he's right or not?

247
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll tell Grandpa

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
to get rid of this servant

249
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,030
who doesn't know
how to respect his master.

250
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,480
Alright,

251
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,320
don't upset Grandpa.

252
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,830
Young Master Ye,

253
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,270
there's green two centimeters
to the left of the center line.

254
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,120
It's eight centimeters long

255
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,510
and five centimeters thick,

256
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,910
but there're clouds and cracks.

257
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,910
What?

258
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,670
He's right about everything?

259
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,840
Isn't he blind?

260
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,600
How can he see this?

261
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,220
Although the Magic Eye
appears to be blind,

262
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,440
but he can see through all things
within three meters.

263
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
It's an unobstructed vision.

264
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
But using it is particularly
mentally exhausting,

265
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,720
that's why he usually covers his eyes
with black satin.

266
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,510
Doesn't that make him invincible?

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That beggar will be crying tomorrow.

268
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,510
Still want me to apologize?

269
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:13,630
Brother,

270
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,390
do you think Wei Jianhao

271
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,120
could really be the Jade Buddha Hand?

272
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,080
Shadow Ninja,

273
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,810
if it's proven that Wei

274
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,320
is using the jade Buddha hand tomorrow,

275
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,790
you can take him down.

276
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,390
Grandpa only wants us to take him home.

277
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,030
With his jade Buddha hand gone,

278
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,870
he's no longer a threat.
