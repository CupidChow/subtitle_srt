=Episode 3=

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,920
Master Song is indeed impressive.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,960
As expected of Master Song.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
The first two pieces
have decent quality.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
But this one is not good.

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,680
Although it's glassy jadeite

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
and green,

19
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,150
it's almost entirely cracked inside.

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,150
I'm afraid

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,190
you won't get our money back
for 10 million.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,560
Shut your mouth!

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
You lack the capability,

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,070
so you're trying to curse our Gu family
with your words?

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,120
Just wait to kneel and kowtow.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,600
How amusing!

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,120
This is a stone that I, Song Ye,
have examined.

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,710
How could you understand it?

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,070
You can directly see

30
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,310
the flesh of this piece.

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,590
If there were cracks,
wouldn't I be able to see them?

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,920
Master Song,

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,780
don't talk to someone
who buys worthless materials

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,310
with women's money.

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,680
Exactly.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
We have a master
of stone appraisal here.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,180
In the master's presence,

38
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,620
do you think it's your turn to speak?

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,820
Take your worthless materials

40
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,920
and go wait on the side.

41
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,680
Master Song, don't be angry.

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,710
Don't be angry.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Green appears.

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,430
- Please.
- You first.

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,180
The cutting line given by Master Song
is really precise.

46
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,030
Sure enough, it's green.

47
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,570
Although this part of the jade

48
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,750
is not large,

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,240
it has a very pure color.

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,280
It's a pity that it's a bit small.

51
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,140
It's not a problem
to make a couple of rings.

52
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
This two-million-material

53
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,470
has just tripled in value.

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
Master Song,

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,560
impressive.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
Master Song,

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,840
I admire you so much.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
It's nothing.

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,310
It's nothing!

60
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,120
Very pure icy jade.

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,870
The base is very clean.

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
This piece is amazing.

63
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
Cut along the grain.

64
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,310
Four icy jade bracelets
will be no problem.

65
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,750
Master Song,

66
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,080
it's truly miraculous.

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
This...

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
This should earn
at least five million, right?

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,520
Thanks to Master Song.

70
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,710
That's amazing.

71
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,000
Master Song truly lives up
to his reputation.

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,900
Indeed.

73
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,280
These two pieces are so impressive.

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,470
If the last piece is revealed,

75
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,130
the Gu family will
come out on top, right?

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Master Song,

77
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,430
how do you plan to cut this piece?

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
In half.

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
Ms. Tang,

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
take a look.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
Who is winning now?

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,180
(Gu family Profit and Loss 8.6 million,
Wei Jianhao 0)

83
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,360
Didn't I give you money?

84
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,870
Why did you only buy one?

85
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,470
This one piece is enough.

86
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,680
Is Sister Wan'er okay?

87
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,590
It's nothing.

88
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,680
Just three broken ribs.

89
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,560
So you'd better make a profitable cut.

90
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,280
Otherwise, you might end up
breaking six ribs.

91
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,430
How many ribs would break
in a profitable cut?

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,760
It depends on how much it rises.

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,560
One million.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
Just to buy that one stone.

95
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
I'm afraid it might not

96
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,750
even yield a single bracelet.

97
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,280
You really want to kneel
and kowtow to me, don't you?

98
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,470
Master Song,

99
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,360
you don't think

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,150
the larger the stone,
the higher the price, do you?

101
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,960
There are many mountains in Mian.

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Why don't you let the Gu family

103
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,960
buy them all for you, how about that?

104
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,920
Ms. Tang, you really love to joke.

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,270
Go open your stone.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
Ms. Tang, you're really reckless.

107
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
Then don't blame me for...

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,480
You, Song Ye, dare to threaten me?

109
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,720
That's not quite the case.

110
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,270
But from now on,

111
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,750
I will help the Gu family
win first place

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,120
and make this little brat

113
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,560
kneel and kowtow to me.

114
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Tang Lili,

115
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,240
you have offended Master Song,

116
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,680
which is equivalent
to dooming your Tang Clan.

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,680
Can you bear the consequences?

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
He's not as formidable as you say.

119
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,350
You don't know anything.

120
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,190
Our Master Song

121
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,830
get a boost

122
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,510
from each one of them.

123
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,070
Don't speak too soon.

124
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,070
It will fall apart soon.

125
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,000
You're still stubborn.

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,390
You can't get away

127
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,720
with kowtowing today.

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,110
In five more seconds,

129
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,430
you'll know who can't get away.

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
You...

131
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,910
What a pity.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
It's all cracked.

133
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,070
The only complete piece

134
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,270
was destroyed by the cut.

135
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,070
It's not going to be of any value.

136
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,910
What did you say?

137
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,030
This...

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
How is this possible?

139
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,510
How is this possible?

140
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,720
How can this be full of cracks?

141
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,830
How is this possible?

142
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,720
- This...
- Song!

143
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,800
It's a material bought for 10 million.

144
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
I examined it very carefully.

145
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,240
But I couldn't find it.

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,950
How did you know?

147
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,830
If you want to bury Tang Clan

148
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,560
with this kind of skill,

149
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,270
why don't you prepare
to kneel and kowtow now?

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,310
I want to see

151
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,270
what kind of good stone you can choose!

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,630
Master Song,
could you help me take a look?

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Will this stone be profitable?

154
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,680
It's Muna yellow sand material,

155
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,720
with thick skin,

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
delicate texture,

157
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,690
lots of internal cracks,

158
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,920
and no python bands,

159
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,310
no bulges.

160
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,360
What kind of green can it produce?

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,870
This is just a piece
of worthless material.

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,510
Sir, polish the skin.

163
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,390
Polishing the skin takes the most time.

164
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,120
Why are you polishing
a piece of worthless material?

165
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,870
You're wasting everyone's time.

166
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
I've never seen anyone
as pompous as you.

167
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,400
Bumpkin,

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
don't be so smug.

169
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,950
This piece of trash

170
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
will only cause the Tang Clan
to lose more, right?

171
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,720
I bought this stone for one million.

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
Even if it fails,

173
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,730
(Gu -1.4, Tang -0.35, Wei -0.65)
it's your Gu family that loses.

174
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
This is imperial green.

175
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
It really is.

176
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,270
Chongjiang hasn't discovered imperial green
for three years, right?

177
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,830
Today, we actually saw it here.

178
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,510
It's just unbelievable.

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,100
Originally, I thought Master Song

180
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,190
was impressive enough.

181
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,040
Now it seems

182
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,750
this young man has a better eye.

183
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,670
This is impossible!

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,270
Keep cutting down.

185
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,870
There must be brick material underneath.

186
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes,

187
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,950
I only saw one side.

188
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,680
There's definitely no green on the back.

189
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,480
This material is just a layer of green.

190
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,430
Yes, go ahead and cut again if you dare.

191
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Along the surface.

192
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,160
All done by polishing.

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

194
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,360
It's already increased tenfold.

195
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
That's enough.

196
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Trust me.

197
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,270
This side is also green.

198
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,590
This...

199
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,160
It's green again.

200
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
It...

201
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,560
It's really a whole piece.

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
Indeed.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
He really predicted it correctly.

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,070
Fully green.

205
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,820
Imperial green,
it's imperial green again!

206
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,060
I haven't seen such good one in years.

207
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,560
It must be worth over 30 million.

208
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,830
Where did this person come from?

209
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,310
It's unbelievable.

210
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,310
What Master Song?

211
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,460
He just mistook imperial green
for worthless material.

212
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,430
With this level of skill,

213
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,310
it's embarrassing for Master Mo.

214
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,040
You are truly amazing.

215
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
It really turned out to
be imperial green.

216
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,120
Master Song,

217
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,680
I am truly grateful to you.

218
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,470
Mr. Gu,

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
are your eyes failing you?

220
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
This...

221
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,510
What's going on here?

222
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,110
Grandpa,

223
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,720
losing once is not a big deal.

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,630
Young brother,

225
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,510
I remember you saying

226
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,510
that you are not their stone appraiser.

227
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,870
How about this?

228
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,840
You sell the stone to me.

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,750
Let's become friends.

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,870
Sorry,

231
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
not for sale.

232
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
Tang Lili,

233
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
put away your harsh attitude.

234
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,870
This stone belongs
to this young brother.

235
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,840
Whether to sell it or not is up to him.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,870
I take a 50% share of this stone.

237
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
Young brother,

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,870
how about selling

239
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,240
the other 50% to me?

240
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,910
You're not in the competition anyway.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,280
How much money are they offering?

242
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,910
I'll double it. No,

243
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,320
I'll offer you ten times.

244
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
You old rascal,

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,630
you really have the nerve to ask.

246
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,750
This stone has already
increased 30 times.

247
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
You really have the face
to take advantage of this, huh?

248
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,110
Tang Lili,

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm not even talking to you.

250
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

251
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,510
I'm also here to participate
in the competition.

252
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,320
Moreover, people from your Gu family

253
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,890
said that this stone is

254
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,120
a worthless material.

255
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,910
Then why do you want that?

256
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,960
What's the point?

257
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,550
Master Song,

258
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
kneel, kowtow and admit your mistake.

259
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Young brother.

260
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,910
My name is Wei Jianhao.

261
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,440
Wei,

262
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,840
the previous wager was just a joke.

263
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm a disciple of President Mo
of the Jade Association.

264
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,150
Are you trying to back out?

265
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
We are both stone appraisers,

266
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,630
so why bother?

267
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
It was you who said before

268
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
that I'm a lowly stone appraiser.

269
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm not worthy of being here.

270
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,030
Based on your current performance,

271
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,270
are you noble or lowly?

272
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,120
Don't push me too far.

273
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,800
Could it be

274
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,270
that you really want me
to kneel before you?

275
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,910
If I lose,

276
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,360
would you make me kneel and kowtow?

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,910
Kneel down!

278
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Kneel down!

279
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,440
Kneel down quickly.

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
Kneel down!

281
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,390
When you lose, you have to admit it.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
Kneel down!

283
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
- Kneel down.
- Don't dawdle.

284
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,750
Kneel down.

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Kneel down!

286
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
I'll have my master teach you a lesson.

287
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,450
- Just wait!
- Bring him back.

288
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,600
How did he manage to escape?

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
- Forget it.
- Can't afford to lose.

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,910
It's just to teach him a lesson.

291
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,000
Let him remember.

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,510
But you just said,

293
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,080
if you were the one who lost,

294
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,840
he would definitely make you kneel down
and humiliate you.

295
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,510
So I'm different from him.

296
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,660
(Jade Exhibition, Gu -1.4 million,
Tang 15, Wei 15)

297
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,870
You scoundrel!

298
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,870
Grandpa, I don't know either.

299
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,270
How did that kid get so lucky?

300
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,520
If it weren't for Song Ye's failure,

301
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
I...

302
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Haven't you noticed

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,670
that Wei Jianhao is quite extraordinary?

304
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,150
Don't think that I don't know.

305
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,750
It was very obvious just now.

306
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,910
It's because of you

307
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,870
and your girlfriend

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,910
that he won't sell the stone to us.

309
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,150
The Tang Clan

310
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,550
has made 15 million profit,

311
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,000
the Gu family is still

312
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,720
short 16.4 million.

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,630
Tell me how to win.

314
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,720
Do you know?

315
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,720
If we lose this Jade Exhibition,

316
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,240
the Gu family will be forced by them

317
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,720
to leave Jade Street.

318
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,630
What else does the Gu family have

319
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,270
to survive in Chongjiang?

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,510
Grandpa, this isn't my fault,

321
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
it's all her fault.

322
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,550
She was the one

323
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,030
who offended that Wei Jianhao.

324
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,320
Since you two forced him out,

325
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,790
don't get involved
in the Gu family's business.

326
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,840
- This...
- From now on,

327
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,230
you don't have to go to the company.

328
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,920
Grandpa!

329
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,030
Brother Dan.

330
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
You louse,

331
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,000
you've screwed me over.

332
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,550
I've already helped

333
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,910
Tang Clan raise 15 million.

334
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,750
Don't come after me anymore, okay?

335
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Wan'er has a total of three broken ribs.

336
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,910
Just now, only one was set.

337
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
So you have to help me two more times.

338
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
I...

339
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,510
I'm sorry.

340
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,360
Jianhao!

341
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,630
What do you want to do now?

342
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Jianhao,

343
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,000
I know you're still mad at me

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,840
for cheating on you.

345
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,870
I'm not angry.

346
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,600
Not even angry when being cheated.

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,120
Are you still a man?

348
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,910
If I were you, I would...

349
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,910
I originally came
to break off...

350
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
Why am I telling you this?

351
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,960
Stop being stubborn.

352
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,910
I know you must hate me very much.

353
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,080
But you can't blame me completely.

354
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,270
It was Gu Dan who made me do this.

355
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,120
I dare not disobey his words.

356
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Understood.

357
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,960
A fly won't bite an unbroken egg.

358
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,530
Gu Dan is just a rotten, stinky egg.

359
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,690
You are a fly that specializes
in stinging rotten eggs.

360
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,750
Such a perfect match.

361
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
Sister Lili,

362
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,670
earlier,

363
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,790
I accidentally offended you.

364
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,030
It's my fault.

365
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,270
You can slap me if you want.

366
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,080
But please don't humiliate me like this.

367
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,670
I'm from a small family.

368
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,750
As a girl with no background,

369
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,210
it's so hard for me in the Gu family.

370
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,200
Gu Dan asked me
to buy imperial green from you.

371
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,270
- Control it.
- I refused.

372
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,440
He was about to beat me to death.

373
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
No way.

374
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,820
Jianhao!

375
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,270
We are engaged.

376
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,720
We haven't seen each other for years.

377
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
I miss you so much.

378
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,840
Don't be like this, let's talk it out.

379
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,750
Just talk.

380
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,590
Talk now.

381
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
I have a lot to tell you.

382
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,910
Help me out.

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,390
Sister Lili, please help me.

384
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,870
It's normal for a man.

385
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,720
I can't stand it anymore.

386
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Don't forget,

387
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,360
you still need to help me
two more times.

388
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,750
No, Sister Lili,

389
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,750
Lili!

390
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,030
We already broke off the engagement.

391
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,120
Can you stop clinging to me?

392
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,320
Even if we have broken off
the engagement,

393
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,320
I still care about you.

394
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,080
If you really offend the Gu family,

395
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,550
the Ye family behind them
will take action.

396
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,870
Ye family?

397
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,930
Ye family is the largest family

398
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,030
in Chongjiang.

399
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,870
If you offend the Ye family,

400
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,510
there really will be no way out.

401
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,080
- Mom!
- Mom!

402
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,390
- Mom!
- Mom!

403
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,910
- Mom...

404
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,510
Jianhao,

405
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,080
if you leave with this woman,

406
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,080
you're no longer a member
of the Ye family.

407
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,920
Jianhao,

408
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
remember,

409
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,480
you're never allowed

410
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,150
to return to the Ye family
in the future.

411
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,440
Stay as far away from the Ye family
as possible.

412
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,240
Mom,

413
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,740
don't leave me.

414
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,200
Brother!

415
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,860
Mom!

416
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,700
Brother!

417
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,670
Mom!

418
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,550
Don't leave me!

419
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,550
The Ye family can still affect

420
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,270
Chongjiang Jade Street?

421
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,270
The Ye family's influence extends
to the whole country.

422
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
The entire Chongjiang Jade Street

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
belongs to the Ye family.

424
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,030
If you offend the Ye family,

425
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,080
you won't be able
to enter the Jade Street again.
