=Episode 8=

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,670
How did I end up in this place again?

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Why are there so many stones missing?

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,350
This...

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,510
Those two guys!

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,310
We're rich...

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,040
- Got rich.
- Put it in.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Chief?

20
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,870
How did you get out so quickly?

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,920
Didn't you always

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,590
stay inside for a long time?

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,310
- Quickly?
- I'm not done yet.

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,150
Done with what?

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,350
- Stealing stones?
- No...

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
No...

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,680
How could that be?

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,960
No!

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
Jade!

30
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,910
Jade...

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Domain?

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,430
(Is it possible that my left hand)

33
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,910
(has mastered the kind of domain
mentioned in the novel?)

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,400
Brother Dan.

35
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,710
Brother Dan.

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,630
How did he become so powerful?

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,960
What if he finds out?

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,030
I still want to try again.

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
Break!

40
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,120
What just happened?

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,520
My left hand suddenly became stronger.

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,910
Chief,

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
so this is what you like.

44
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,680
No wonder you're not interested in me.

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,270
That's not fair.

46
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,750
I've been completely exposed.

47
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,680
Since you dared to steal the stone,

48
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,120
do you want to dress like this

49
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,310
and parade around in public?

50
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,720
I didn't steal the stone.

51
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,990
Isn't it because
the household expenses are too high?

52
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,480
I wanted to sell a few stones

53
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,630
to supplement the household income.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,900
In fact,

55
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,920
all the ingredients I bought
for you were imported.

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,720
Put all these stones back.

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,760
Then get lost.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Otherwise...

59
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,350
Remember,

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,950
when I come back,

61
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,240
don't let me see you again.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
(So scary.)

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,800
(So crazy.)

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
(So handsome.)

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,000
(But)

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,040
(why doesn't he like women?)

67
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,380
(Jade Exhibition)

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,720
I hope Brother Wei doesn't come,

69
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,270
but at the same time, I wish he would.

70
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,360
If he really doesn't come,

71
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,630
our Gu family

72
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,430
will have no choice
but to move away from Jade Street.

73
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,360
(If you're smart,)

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,870
(stay far away from here.)

75
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,920
(If you lose your other hand,)

76
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,430
(who's going to feed you?)

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
He...

78
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,480
He'll be here.

79
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,510
(I don't know if Young Master)

80
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
(has found the entrance to Ever Realm.)

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
Tang Lili,

82
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,520
now you know the words you said
to me last night

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
are so ridiculous, right?

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,310
In Chongjiang,

85
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,720
who really dares
to oppose our Ye family?

86
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,780
No matter
how pretentious Wei Jianhao was,

87
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,680
he slipped away like a lost dog.

88
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
You're not convinced?

89
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,870
I'm not convinced by you

90
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,720
or the whole Ye family.

91
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,870
How dare you!

92
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,710
Tang Lili,

93
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,830
what do you think you are?

94
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
With your attitude,

95
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
you dare...

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,830
Watch your words.

97
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,320
You can't pretend to be anything

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
in front of anyone.

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,630
How dare you hit me?

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,070
I'm a member of the Ye family.

101
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,190
My dad has never dared to hit me
since I was a child.

102
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,120
You... I'll kill you.

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Enough!

104
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,360
I said that's enough!

105
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,800
Tang Lili, you really don't know
what's good for you.

106
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
From now on,

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,070
Tang Clan and Gu family

108
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,430
are out of Jade Street.

109
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,720
Tang Clan and Gu family

110
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,620
have violated the rules
of the Jade Exhibition,

111
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,630
so I've decided

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,430
to nullify the results of them,

113
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,700
and the Ye family will take back

114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,120
all their shops on Jade Street.

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,270
You should move out today.

116
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,920
You're the dignified Young Master
of the Ye family.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,100
How dare you change the traditions

118
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,720
left by the ancestors?

119
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,360
You're so pompous and arrogant.

120
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,630
Does Mr. Ye know?

121
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,260
Don't use my Grandfather to pressure me.

122
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,280
I, Ye Jianren,

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,550
am in charge of Chongjiang Jade Street.

124
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Young Master Ye,

125
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,750
although Jade Street

126
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,270
belongs to your Ye family,

127
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,270
the jade trade

128
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,470
has always been

129
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,870
supervised and managed

130
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,310
by the Chongjiang Jade Association.

131
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,720
Therefore, shouldn't your decision be

132
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,940
discussed with

133
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,510
our Jade Association?

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,460
Mr. Mo,

135
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,270
this matter really has nothing
to do with you,

136
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,800
so don't try to force me by your way.

137
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm taking back the Ye family's shop.

138
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,450
Does your Jade Association
have the authority over this?

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
You...

140
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Young Master Ye.

141
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
Young Master Ye,

142
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,320
Gu family can move out of Jade Street.

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
Can you

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
give me three months

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,970
- to make the transition smoothly?
- Three months?

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,510
Now you know to come and discuss?

147
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,510
Didn't you think that by befriending
that fool Wei Jianhao,

148
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,080
you could turn the Gu family around?

149
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,550
Go discuss it with him.

150
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,600
For me,

151
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,710
one day

152
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
is already a big favor to you.

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
One day?

154
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,320
You want me

155
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
to sleep on the street?

156
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,360
That's what happens

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,720
when you go against our Ye family.

158
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,030
You'll all end up like that beggar.

159
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
Tang Lili,

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,150
if your people don't stop,

161
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,320
don't blame me for being ruthless.

162
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Ruthless?

163
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,960
Like yesterday,

164
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,470
when you threw a dart from the shadows
and slit someone's wrist?

165
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
Alright,

166
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,910
I'd like to see that.

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,030
Tang Lili,

168
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,550
you asked for it.

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,560
Shadow Ninja!

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Where did he come from?

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,270
Now everyone knows

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
how Wei Jianhao was injured

173
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,100
and withdrew
from the competition yesterday.

174
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,840
So this is the Ye family's expert.

175
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,670
The Ye family really cheated

176
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,080
in yesterday's match.

177
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,000
So it's him.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,910
The Ye family cheated.

179
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,360
It's you, the villain.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Are you all right?

181
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,030
Sneaky and treacherous.

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm exhausted.

183
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,550
Kill her for me.

184
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,720
Wan'er, be careful.

185
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,720
You still came.

186
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
Young Master.

187
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,910
It's only been one night.

188
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,480
What a strong aura.

189
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,770
(Could it be that Young Master
has entered Ever Realm?)

190
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,240
