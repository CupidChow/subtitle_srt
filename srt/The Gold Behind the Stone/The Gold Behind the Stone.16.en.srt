=Episode 16=

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,750
Beauty, what's your name?

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,030
Can I have your contact way?

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,640
I told you it wouldn't work.

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,590
I'm

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,590
back.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,550
Sister Wan'er,

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
are you okay?

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,190
Wan'er,

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,510
how did you get yourself into this look?

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,680
My dear,

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
do I look good?

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,430
You look very good.

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,200
If you like it,

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,790
I... I like it too.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,480
Qing'er,

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,790
did you sleep well last night?

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,520
It's been long since I slept so well.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Who is she?

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,480
That's his sister.

32
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,870
You're the sister

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,480
he's trying to protect?

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Sister-in-law,

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,550
no, Sister Lili,

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
who is she?

37
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,070
Sister-in-law?

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
She's your sister-in-law.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,230
I'm your sister-in-law too.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,510
Almost.

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,280
Go away.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,360
Why do you always come along?

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,310
It's the truth.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,310
We're engaged.

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,960
No, it's not...

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,400
it's not what you think.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,030
Then which one of them

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
is the real sister-in-law?

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Chief,

50
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,000
you're so lucky.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,190
Qing'er, are you hungry?

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,630
I'll take you out for a stroll.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,310
Wait... wait a moment.

54
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,120
I need to ask you a favor.

55
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
What?

56
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,190
You want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend?

57
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
Is your mom

58
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,190
really going

59
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,360
to marry you off that playboy?

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,010
Mom

61
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,040
wants me to marry into their family.

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,150
But

63
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,910
Grandpa said

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,800
I can take you to the family banquet.

65
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,120
If he's satisfied,

66
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,190
he can make the decision for me.

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,430
According to you,

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,280
whoever gets Wei Jianhao

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,190
will get the Ever Realm?

70
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,590
Yes, Grandpa.

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,190
If Wei Jianhao is really capable,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
we can consider

73
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,310
making him
our Su family's grandson-in-law.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,400
You must help Wan'er with this.

75
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,240
That young man
from the Chase Rodford family

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,430
is a notorious playboy.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,460
Many noble ladies
from prestigious families

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,670
have been spoiled by him.

79
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,840
If Wan'er really marries him,

80
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
the rest of her life

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
will be ruined.

82
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,400
Is it that serious?

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
But

84
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,240
why me?

85
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,470
Because

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,190
I told Grandpa

87
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,510
I... I like you.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,780
(Su Villa)
Today is the Su family's betrothal banquet.

89
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,170
I heard
that the Su sisters are both here.

90
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,180
Brother,

91
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,120
if you can hook up
with one of the Su sisters,

92
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,160
Grandpa can propose marriage
to the Su family

93
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
to ease the pressure on our Ye family.

94
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,360
The Su family is about

95
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,190
to steal 90% of the shops
on Jade Street.

96
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,920
The only way to get the shops back

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,040
is to marry the Su family's lady.

98
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,190
How can we get close to them?

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,420
The cars of today's guests

100
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,720
are all parked outside the villa,

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,270
only the Su family's cars can drive in.

102
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,510
We'll stay here

103
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,920
and wait for the Su sisters.

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
They're here.

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,630
Filthy beggar,

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
why are you here?

107
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,310
Why are you two here?

108
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,870
Is this place for you?

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,220
You can't even afford a suit,

110
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,190
yet you come to a high-end place
to make a fool of yourself.

111
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,070
If you can come,

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,190
why can't I?

113
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,070
You rented this car?

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,310
Sister Lili sent it to pick me up.

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,830
Tang Lili?

116
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,040
Even our Ye family's car

117
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,470
can't get into the Su family banquet.

118
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,830
What gives her the right?

119
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,830
Su family?

120
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Isn't it Tang Clan?

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,830
What on earth are you here for?

122
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,430
To attend the banquet.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,700
Today's banquet

124
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,930
is for the respectable families

125
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,000
of the jade industry.

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,070
What is your identity?

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,970
What qualifications
do you have to attend?

128
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,430
I don't know.

129
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,740
Sister Wan'er invited me,

130
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,600
so I came.

131
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,870
You two are standing here.

132
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,190
Were you not invited?

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
You...

134
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,800
That door can't even let us in,

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
you can't possibly get in.

136
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,670
You're waiting to humiliate yourself.

137
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,270
Mr. Wei.

138
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,750
You two, please stop.

139
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,170
We're both members of the Ye family,

140
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,800
why can he get in and we can't?

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
That gentleman's surname is Wei,

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,020
and he's an honored guest

143
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,480
invited by Miss Su.

144
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Miss Su invited Wei Jianhao?

145
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,190
Why?

146
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,600
It must be because of Ye Qing'er.

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,920
Ye Qing'er is now the wife
of the Su family's fool.

148
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,600
She married into the Su family

149
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,070
and wants her brother
to be Su family's son-in-law.

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,270
We can't let them succeed.

151
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,720
I'm going in to expose them.

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,960
Please stop.

153
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
We have

154
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,510
the same taste

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,830
in shoes.

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,630
The man we like is also the same.

157
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
This pair of shoes suits you better,

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,510
you'll look better in them.

159
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,240
You like them too,

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,870
why do you let me have them?

161
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,040
Because you're my sister.

162
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,830
But you lied to me.

163
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,040
When did I lie to you?

164
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
You said

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
you stayed in the shop

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
to help me pursue him,

167
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,830
but it's actually for Ever Realm.

168
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,480
You already know it.

169
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Did Grandpa tell you that?

170
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,800
You approached him
with an impure purpose

171
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
from the beginning.

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,320
That's right.

173
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,720
I first met him on Jade Street

174
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,720
and approached him

175
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,790
for his Jade Buddha Hand.

176
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,440
And you didn't mean it

177
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,150
when you said you liked him?

178
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,720
Of course not.

179
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,840
I was in his room at that time

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,510
to look for the entrance to Ever Realm.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
He suddenly woke up.

182
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,270
I panicked

183
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,790
and said I liked him.

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,030
Then you proposed to Grandpa

185
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,790
to make him
the Su family's son-in-law...

186
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,960
That's because

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,630
he's already been recognized
as the domain master

188
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,480
of Ever Realm.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,200
No one but him can enter Ever Realm.

190
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,240
So today's betrothal banquet

191
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,030
is for Wei Jianhao.

192
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't care about Ever Realm.

193
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,390
I just want him.

194
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,240
I know you like him,

195
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
but I must warn you,

196
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,440
if you can't get him to agree
to be engaged to you,

197
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll still try to get close to him.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
Sister,

199
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,750
are you going to steal him from me?

200
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,030
Not stealing.

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,270
No matter which one of us

202
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,720
he chooses,

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,440
he must become the son-in-law
of the Su family.

204
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,960
Just because of the Su family?

205
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
That's right.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,720
Then you never

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,790
really liked him?

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
Why would the Su family hold

209
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,660
their betrothal banquet in a small place
like Chongjiang?

210
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,240
If it were in Jinling,
it would be so grand.

211
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,510
It's a betrothal banquet,

212
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,120
but they haven't even announced
who the son-in-law will be.

213
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,270
That's why

214
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,030
the gentlemen
from all prominent families

215
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,600
are coming to the banquet.

216
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Mr. Su is publicly choosing a son-in-law

217
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,440
for the Su sisters.

218
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,200
(Didn't Sister Wan'er say
it was the Tang Clan's family banquet?)

219
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,470
(What does it have to do
with the Su sisters choosing a son-in-law?)

220
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,510
How can you be
the son-in-law of the Su family?

221
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,270
Don't even think about it.

222
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
You...

223
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Song Ye?

224
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Wei?

225
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,270
From now on, treat him with respect.

226
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,790
Don't offend him again.

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
I forgot,

228
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,110
Young Master.

229
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,150
Why are you pushing me?

230
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,670
I... I just came to say hello.

231
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,910
Master Song,

232
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,080
why are you

233
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
talking to this bumpkin?

234
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
I forgot to introduce you.

235
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,320
This is Miss Xu.

236
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,390
And this is

237
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,240
the best stone appraiser in Chongjiang,

238
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Wei Jianhao, Mr. Wei.

239
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,910
I'm not as good as you say.

240
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,320
Hello, Miss Xu.

241
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,840
(You can't tell
even if I'm flattering you.)

242
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,960
The best stone appraiser,

243
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,030
and he's so shabby?

244
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,240
You're in a small place,

245
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,600
but you can't fool people

246
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,270
like this.

247
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720
What's wrong with the culture nowadays?

248
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,750
What?

249
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,390
Do you have a problem with that?

250
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,710
No comment.

251
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,390
I just want to stay away
from negative people.

252
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,240
Goodbye.

253
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,230
How dare you talk to me like that?

254
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,390
You are looking for death!

255
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,910
I'm here to attend the banquet today.

256
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,910
I don't want any trouble.

257
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,120
You're dead.

258
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,550
- How dare you offend me!
- Miss!

259
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,630
I can't defeat him.

260
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,870
Please bear with it for a while.

261
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
Useless!

262
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,360
Aren't you becoming

263
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,960
a master of the first realm?

264
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't even defeat such a hick?

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm incompetent.

266
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,160
But Miss,

267
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,750
you can teach him a lesson when you

268
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,750
see Miss Wan'er later.

269
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,390
Wan'er is my best friend.

270
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,840
It's easy to kill him

271
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,750
in Su family.

272
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,840
Miss Xu,

273
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,240
Wei Jianhao is so bossy and arrogant

274
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,790
in Chongjiang,

275
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,600
please don't take it personally.

276
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
Chongjiang is nothing.

277
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,630
He dares to mess with me.

278
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,670
I'll have Wan'er kill him today

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,910
for making me look bad in public.

280
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,040
What are you looking at?

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Haven't you ever seen a beauty before?

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,030
Isn't that Bai Ge,
the Young Master of the Bai family?

283
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,840
I didn't expect him
to come to the Su family banquet.

284
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,870
Bai Ge was a genius,

285
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,750
not only was he the most capable

286
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,000
of the Bai family's children,

287
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,600
he had even reached

288
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,440
the second realm at a young age.

289
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
The second realm?

290
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,510
There are very few people
in the younger generation

291
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,870
who can reach the first realm.

292
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,910
For him to reach

293
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,360
the second realm at such a young age,

294
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,720
he deserves

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,080
to be a genius.

296
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,150
He's too excellent.

297
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,200
It's an honor to have

298
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,480
Young Master Bai bring us in.

299
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,710
Brother,

300
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,870
he's my classmate from college.

301
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,150
We were

302
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,600
once in love.

303
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
Isn't he my brother-in-law?

304
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,390
Don't call me that.

305
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,360
I didn't agree to be with her.

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,510
I'm here for Miss Su today.

307
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,200
Don't talk about our past.

308
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,150
Sister,

309
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,600
how could you be with such a person?

310
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,440
If I didn't know him,

311
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,510
would you have come in?

312
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,440
Brother, if you are jealous,

313
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,200
you'd better get to know a Miss Su

314
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,510
and make me proud.

315
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,630
Please have a taste.

316
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,480
Who made our Miss Xu

317
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,150
so angry?

318
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,910
How dare he, a poor rustic appraiser,

319
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,510
make a move on me?

320
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,150
So arrogant?

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Who doesn't know

322
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,510
you're Miss Su Wan'er's best friend,

323
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
and he dares
to make trouble in Su family?

324
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
It pissed me off.

325
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
I must let him die!

326
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,720
Young Master Bai,

327
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,750
I've heard that you've long
since reached the second realm.

328
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,240
You must find an opportunity to help me

329
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
teach that guy

330
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,440
a hard lesson,

331
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,150
so that he knows

332
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
that my killing him

333
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,910
is no different

334
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,120
than crushing an ant.

335
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,550
Miss Xu, you really

336
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,960
don't treat me as an outsider.

337
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,000
You like Su Lili,

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,390
and I'm her sister's best friend.

339
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,510
Of course, we are friends.

340
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,430
You're an expert
who's about to reach the first realm.

341
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,800
Since

342
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,510
Miss Bai was bullied,

343
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,960
didn't you teach him a lesson?

344
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,910
I fought with him,

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,100
but I was no match for him.

346
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,960
He should have reached the first realm.

347
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,030
A first realm appraiser?

348
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm here in the lounge.

349
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,200
It's that hick.
