=Episode 4=

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,470
The Ye family can still affect

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,110
Chongjiang Jade Street?

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,110
The Ye family's influence
extends to the whole country.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,070
The entire Chongjiang Jade Street
belongs to the Ye family.

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,110
If you offend the Ye family,

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,950
you won't be able
to enter the Jade Street again.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
I think

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,920
they don't have that capability.

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,660
(Jade Buddha Hand)

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,300
(The Gold Behind the Stone)

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,200
Master,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,070
we've been looking for Young Master Jianhao
for so many years.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,430
That old man Wei Changming

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,680
finally couldn't hide anymore.

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,000
Young Master Jianhao has already
returned to Chongjiang.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,070
Do you want to see him?

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,710
After all, this heir
of the Jade Buddha Hand

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,920
is still a member of our Ye family.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,870
Naturally, he should return here.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,470
Young Master Jianhao has already mastered
the jade Buddha hand.

33
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,400
He can help you to alleviate your worries
and difficulties.

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm getting old.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,520
The current scale and pressure
of the Ye family's development

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,960
already requires the younger generation

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
to shoulder together.

38
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,310
Your intention is

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,470
to have Young Master Jianhao

40
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,870
take over the Ye family, right?

41
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,680
First, let's test his current level.

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,520
See how he has grown.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,800
Grandpa, you called me?

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Jianren,

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,280
go to the Jade Exhibition
and bring Jianhao back.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,910
It's been 15 years.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
He should come home now.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes, Grandpa.

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,310
I can return the shop to you.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Jianhao!

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,470
Don't ignore me.

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,310
Keep your word?

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,710
I just want you to know.

54
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,200
I didn't make this engagement with you

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,710
to cheat your family's betrothal gifts.

56
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,860
If you don't believe me,

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,950
you can come with me to the shop

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,010
and get the real estate license.

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,590
(Should I believe her)

60
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,870
(or not?)

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,120
(But the shop must be taken back.)

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,150
Wait for me a moment.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,120
I'll go find the real estate license
right now.

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't worry.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,150
I won't let you make a loss
in this deal.

66
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,400
As we agreed before,

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,520
I'll redeem the shop with 10 million.

68
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,310
10 million?

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,750
You sold that piece

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,520
of imperial green for 15 million.

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
No...

72
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,360
What do you mean?

73
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,630
What she means is what I mean.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
And what I mean is

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
that you give the 15 million

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,910
to our Gu family.

77
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,120
No, wasn't it agreed...?

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,080
It's not easy

79
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
to get this turd here.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
It exhausted me.

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm so sorry.

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,510
If it wasn't for you,

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
I wouldn't have jumped

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
on his dirty body.

85
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,870
Tonight, I'll definitely
make it up to you.

86
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,460
Stop.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Grandpa was right.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
A woman's mouth is full of lies.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,310
Wei Jianhao,

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,410
my grandpa said he wants

91
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,600
to buy your piece of imperial green.

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,870
How dare you say no?

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,430
You really did this the hard way,

94
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,360
so don't blame me for being ruthless.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,510
What do you want from me?

96
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,510
(Resale Agreement)
Sign this agreement now,

97
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,560
or you'll never get out of here today.

98
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,160
Are you being reasonable?

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Of course not!

100
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,320
I...

101
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Go catch him!

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,050
Oh no!

103
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,120
There's a hole in here?

104
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,800
I've lived here for years,

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
and I didn't even know that there's
a basement underneath the statue.

106
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,120
Wei Jianhao?

107
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,120
Wei Jianhao!

108
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,800
Why are you calling me?

109
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,720
You coward,

110
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,000
come out!

111
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,560
If you have the guts, come down!

112
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,710
You all,

113
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,910
go down.

114
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
Go down.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Go down now!

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
I can't, Young Master Gu.

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,870
He locked the floor.

118
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,560
So many jade stones.

119
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,680
How can I get them out?

120
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,000
Is this an exit?

121
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,950
Stretched the tendons!

122
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Choke you...

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
Choke you to death!

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,510
I don't believe you can stay down.

125
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,800
Keep adding!

126
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,510
Brother Dan,

127
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,560
I can't stand it anymore.

128
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,350
Keep adding.

129
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,720
Don't stop until he comes out!

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Continue adding!

131
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,120
You really have no morals, don't you?

132
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,920
Such a mean trick.

133
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,870
Aren't you not coming out?

134
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,450
If you have the guts, stay down there.

135
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,350
Come down, you.

136
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
Brother Dan,

137
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,480
wait for me to save you!

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
You dare to insult me

139
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,040
and want me to apologize to you?

140
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,630
I'll beat you to death.

141
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,290
Why don't you take a break
and let me do it?

142
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,130
No need.

143
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,510
It's such an enjoyable thing.

144
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,350
You...

145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,070
I'll do it myself.

146
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,830
You two rascals!

147
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
Why don't you let him go up?

148
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,000
Brother Dan, please wait a moment.

149
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,680
Press this fingerprint.

150
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,260
Half of the stone will belong
to the Gu family.

151
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,310
And I can return to the Gu family!

152
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,160
You don't make any sense!

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Sister Wan'er?

154
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,720
It's you again!

155
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,680
You... deserve it.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,480
Have your ribs healed, Sister Wan'er?

157
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Come with me.

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
Don't let him escape.

159
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,750
Take this!

160
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,990
You can't go down.

161
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
Move aside.

162
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,270
- Come out!
- Let go!

163
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,870
Sister Wan'er!

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,480
- Go.
- Sister Wan'er,

165
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,000
weld the door before leaving!

166
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,870
Brother Dan, are you okay?

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,270
Why are there so many stones?

168
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,790
This piece looks like Damakan material.

169
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,030
Sister Wan'er!

170
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,080
Let me go back first.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
- Someone...
- They can't stay there!

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,510
Someone wants to see you.

173
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,990
Why are they here? What's going on?

174
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,850
So many people.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,580
- What's this nonsense?
- Why him again?

176
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,790
Can someone like him come here?

177
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Who wants to see me?

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,510
A big figure.

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,110
I won't see him.

180
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,120
If you dare to leave,
I'll break your legs.

181
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,910
Welcome, Young Master Ye,

182
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,120
Miss Ye.

183
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Young Master Ye.

184
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,350
Sister.

185
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,510
(No wonder Tang Clan)

186
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,270
(can account for 60% of the business
on Jade Street.)

187
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,450
(It turned out that they had defected
to the Ye family.)

188
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,670
(It seems the Gu family is out of favor)

189
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,200
(with the Ye family.)

190
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,110
Ye family?

191
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,750
What kind of beggar is he?

192
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
How did he get in here?

193
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,910
Get him out of here.

194
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,750
Wait a minute!

195
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,720
Young Master Ye, Miss Ye,

196
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,840
he's the very skilled

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
stone appraiser I mentioned.

198
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,090
Wei Jianhao, why don't you

199
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,150
apologize to Miss Ye?

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
Apologize?

201
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,790
Just because they are
from the Ye family?

202
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
Wei?

203
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,390
This family name really suits you.

204
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,510
Isn't this that person?

205
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,600
How did you end up like this?

206
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,300
Didn't you have a lot of backbone

207
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,550
when you left?

208
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,080
What happened? It's tough out there,

209
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,910
so you've become a beggar?

210
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,360
Do you know each other?

211
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,510
No,

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
I don't know anyone

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
from the Ye family.

214
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
You'd better not have anything to do
with the Ye family,

215
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,550
and remember to stay as far away from us
as possible.

216
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,150
Mom! Brother!

217
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,390
Don't leave me!

218
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,150
This is my sister's jade bracelet.

219
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,480
It was left to her by my mom.

220
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
Why do you have it?

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
You mean this?

222
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,750
When she was cleaning,

223
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
she got dirt on my shoes

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,100
and couldn't afford to pay for it,

225
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,150
so she gave me this bracelet.

226
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,960
You're bullying her?

227
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,720
Bullying?

228
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,030
She didn't go begging with you.

229
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,840
She's had food and shelter for years.

230
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,870
Being a servant

231
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,720
is the greatest kindness to her.

232
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Give me

233
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,590
the bracelet back.

234
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,510
It's just a piece of junk.

235
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,080
You want it so badly?

236
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,550
I slipped.

237
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,910
- How dare you...?
- Why don't you pick up the pieces

238
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,670
and give them to your sister,

239
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,270
who cries for help every day?

240
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

241
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,320
Who gives you two the right
to stare at me like that?

242
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,510
If you stare at me,

243
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,390
I'll put your sister

244
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,600
in the dark room.

245
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
Wei Jianhao,

246
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,600
if you dare to touch her even once,

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,080
I'll beat you up.

248
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,270
That's what you've done

249
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,390
to my sister all these years?

250
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,510
After all these years,

251
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,360
your family is still

252
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,270
as stupid and arrogant as ever,

253
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,510
