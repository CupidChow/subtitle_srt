Grandpa,

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,310
if I had known you were so capable,

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,970
why did you send me here
as an undercover?

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,800
Don't move.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,510

Mr. Gu,

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,950
I didn't expect you'd hidden it so well.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,310
Same to you.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,710
Grandpa, save me.

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,920
Tang Lili,

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,280
let him go.

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,550
Otherwise,

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
I'll take the lives of everyone here

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,310
with him.

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,520
You're not going to let us go anyway,

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,710
so why don't I

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,710
take a Gu family member down with us?

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,630
Do you think I'd give up

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,680
the Ever Realm that is about
to be mine for him?

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,990
Grandpa,

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,750
I'm the only heir of the Gu family.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,080
Do you want the Gu family
to have no descendants?

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,920
Shut up!

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,150
The descendants of the Gu family

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,910
must have some guts.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
Isn't it Ever Realm that you want?

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,960
In two days,

49
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,680
the Ever Realm will be yours.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
What do you mean?

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,310
No one knows

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,310
where the Ever Realm is

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,890
and how to open its entrance,

54
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,870
except Wei Jianhao.

55
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,150
He's in a coma.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Even if you kill us all,

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,910
you won't know how to get in.

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,360
That Poison King

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,030
is spoiling my plan.

60
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,150
Why don't you come back
until he wakes up?

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,430
I just want

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,870
to make sure my sister is alive.

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,550
That's fine.

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,680
I've been in Jade Street
for so many years,

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
that it's okay
to wait for two more days.

66
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,870
The entrance to Ever Realm
won't disappear,

67
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,630
and neither will Wei Jianhao.

68
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,310
Wan'er!

69
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,270
Wan'er.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
Wan'er?

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
It's all your fault.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
It's all your fault!

73
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,310
Are you okay?

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,870
Will Wei Jianhao be able to wake up?

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,140
(Wei Shop)

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,560

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,880
You're awake.

78
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
Does it hurt?

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,440
Sister.

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,040
Wei Jianhao is fine.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
Don't worry.

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
He's in his room.

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,680
Sister...

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm fine too.

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
It's my fault

86
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,160
for not protecting you.

87
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,520
You've always

88
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,680
protected me,

89
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,240

90
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,630

91
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,360

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,270
Wan'er, you've protected us all.

93
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,950
Lie down and don't move.

94
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,310
Are you going to find Jianhao?

95
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,720

96
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560

97

to Wei Jianhao.)

103
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,560
Wake up.

104

that the fifth realm expert

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,080
arrogant

190
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,120
and wild?

191
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,140
If he's capable,

192
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,720
he should fight that fifth realm expert.

193
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
What's the noise?

194
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,910
What's going on?

195
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,510
Why didn't Jianhao come back with you?

196
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,990
Grandpa,

197
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,550
please save Brother.

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,870
The Chase Rodford family's
fifth realm expert has already come.

199
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,600
I heard Brother has been in a coma.

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,320
His situation is really dangerous.

201
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,080
Grandpa, please help him.

202
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,220
When you're faced with something
you can't solve,

203
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,990
you try to go back
to the Ye family for help.

204
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,360
What do you take the Ye family for?

205
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,870
If he had given

206
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,790
the Ever Realm

207
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,510
to the Ye family earlier,

208
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,390
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

209
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,240
Get up.

210
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Grandpa,

211
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm willing to be a servant
in the Ye family for a lifetime.

212
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,750
As long as you need me,

213
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll do anything.

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,500
I beg you, Grandpa,

215
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,990
please ask Young Master Chase to stop.

216
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,510
You still want Grandpa
to plead with Young Master Chase?

217
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't dream of it!

218
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,240
Take Qing'er away

219
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,690
and lock her up in the room.

220
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,670
Don't let her leave the Ye family!

221
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,510
- Yes.
- Grandpa...

222
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,320
- Let's go.
- Grandpa, I beg you,

223
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,510
please save Brother.

224
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Grandpa.

225
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,750
Grandpa!

226
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,480
(Wei bloodline?)

227
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,590
Grandpa!

228
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,840
(Wei Changming,)

229
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,910
(I've mastered Jianhao's weakness.)

230
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,120
(When our Ye family
gets the Ever Realm,)

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,840
(what are you, Wei Changming?)

232
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,080
(And what's)

233
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,360
(the Chase Rodford family?)

234
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,390
Su Lili?

235
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,390
What are you here for?

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm here to beg for peace.

237
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
If you'd listened to me

238
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
and married Bai Ge,

239
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,840
you wouldn't be in this mess.

240
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,360
Aunt Bai, you're right.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,320
I was too ignorant before,

242
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
thinking I could rely on myself.

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,150
In fact, as long as a woman

244
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,240
finds the right man,

245
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,080
she will be truly happy.

246
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,200
So you've figured it out

247
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,000
and are willing to marry Ge?

248
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,150
I do want to marry someone,

249
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,080
but I want to marry Young Master Chase

250
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
instead of Bai Ge.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,840
Young Master Chase?

252
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,080
You shameless woman!

253
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,150
He wants to marry our Wan'er.

254
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,150
You want to marry him?

255
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,200
No way!

256
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,510
So there's really

257
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,630
no chance at all?

258
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,920
Let go.

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
How can you

260
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,510
be so disrespectful to Miss Su?

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,920
Young Master Chase,

262
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,360
you don't really

263
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,670
want to marry her, do you?

264
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,750
Didn't we agree

265
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
that I would help you
merge the Su family's properties,

266
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,960
and you would marry Wan'er
for an alliance?

267
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,910
I don't remember saying that.

268
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
How can you go back on your word?

269
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,080
Young Master Chase,

270
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,490
I know that most
of the Su family's properties

271
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,910
have been acquired by you.

272
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,270
But in terms
of the most suitable manager,

273
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,910
there should be no one
more suitable than me, right?

274
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,240
After all,

275
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,550
I was the real manager
of the Su family before.

276
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,390
You...

277
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,350
Young Master Chase,

278
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,080
don't believe her.

279
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,270
An ambitious woman like her

280
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,250
won't follow you to the end.

281
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,270
Young Master Chase,

282
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,630
I'm sure

283
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,910
you won't like

284
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,320
a silly woman
who only does what she's told.

285
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,750
- You...
- That's right,

286
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,510
I like a woman like Lili

287
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,120
who's smart, decisive

288
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,510
and ambitious.

289
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,680
Young Master Chase,

290
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480
if she's going
to take over the Su family,

291
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
what about me?

292
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,750
You?

293
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,840
You've worked hard enough.

294
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,750
Just take a good rest.

295
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,590
Young Master Chase,

296
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,270
she's really noisy.

297
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,200
I'd like to talk

298
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,030
to you for a while.

299
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,270
Ask Mrs. Su to leave.

300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,390
Young Master Chase,
you can't just leave me.

301
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,870
You can't do this to me.

302
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,030
I'm your future mother-in-law!
