=Episode 10=

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,300
(The Gold Behind the Stone)

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,960
I told you to bring him back.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,560
Who told you to cripple his right hand?

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,070
Grandpa, Wei Jianhao...

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,350
Don't think that I'm old

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,880
and don't know
what you have really done.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,380
Wei Jianhao has no intention at all
to return to the Ye family.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,590
The Jade Buddha Hand

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
is a scourge sooner or later.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,310
The things you have done

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,150
have truly harmed the entire Ye family.

24
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,760
Is his right hand really
completely crippled?

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,850
Is there any hope left?

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,090
The Shadow Ninja severed the meridians
in his right hand.

27
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,150
Unless a miracle happens,

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,350
it's absolutely impossible.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,280
When you were appraising the jade,

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,510
did he use his right hand again?

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
No.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,120
It's true that he couldn't
use his right hand.

33
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,760
I was defeated by his left hand.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
Master,

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,280
the Jinling Su family has arrived.

36
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,220
- Jinling Su family?
- Jinling Su family?

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,120
You all may leave first.

38
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,710
Finally, they're here.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,750
Then do we have to find

40
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,360
Young Master Jianhao to come back again?

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,310
Only the Jade Buddha Hand

42
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,080
can find Ever Realm.

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,120
Now the Jade Buddha Hand
is already useless.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,470
Like his mother,

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,750
he's no longer of any use

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,910
to the Ye family.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
The most important thing now is

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,560
to find Wei Changming.

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,960
Can we use him

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,120
to force Wei Changming to show up?

51
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,430
The Jinling Su family

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,080
is the top of the Five Great Families.

53
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,680
Why did they suddenly
come to Chongjiang?

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,470
Is the Su family

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,470
also after the Jade Buddha Hand?

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Mr. Ye,

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,590
Master Su ordered me
to come to Chongjiang

58
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,030
to bring you a few things.

59
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,710
The Ye family owns dozens
of jade streets

60
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,240
across the country.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,470
One third of the country's jade streets

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,310
are now owned by the Su family.

63
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,840
These are acquisition contracts.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,540
(Acquisition Contract)

65
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,750
Your Su family

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,630
has already dominated Jinling,

67
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,910
and you want to annex our Ye family?

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Mr. Ye, you overstate the matter.

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,080
Master Su wants

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,150
to return all the jade streets
to the Ye family

71
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,590
in exchange for one jade street.

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
What do you want?

73
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,430
Chongjiang Jade Street.

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
Butler Su,

75
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,870
go back and tell your master

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,240
that Chongjiang Jade Street

77
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,710
is a place of prosperity
for the Ye family.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
We will never transfer it.

79
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,270
Mr. Ye,

80
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,470
would you like to reconsider?

81
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,750
Compared to one third
of the Ye family's assets,

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,030
a single jade street is nothing.

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
Butler Su,

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,640
I'm not

85
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,070
feeling well,

86
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,040
so I won't see you off.

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,830
Master Su said

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
that whether you agree or not,

89
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,430
Chongjiang Jade Street
will be the Su family's sooner or later.

90
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,160
The Su family

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
seems to be aimed at Ever Realm as well.

92
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,430
They just can't stand the Ye family
monopolizing Ever Realm.

93
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,870
The Ye family has guarded Jade Street
for hundreds of years

94
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,360
just to wait for the appearance
of Ever Realm.

95
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,870
For this reason, we went out of our way
to marry the Wei Changming family.

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
However,

97
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,160
Wei Ruyi refused to comply,

98
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,630
and Wei Jianhao

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
also lost the Jade Buddha Hand.

100
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,950
The power of the Su family

101
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,750
is far greater than our Ye family.

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm afraid...

103
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,680
They won't try

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,430
to take away everything
the Ye family has worked so hard for.

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
We must quickly use Wei Jianhao

106
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,870
to force out Wei Changming.

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Master,

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,510
Miss Qing'er is still in the Ye family.

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,160
Should we...?

110
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,160
Miss.

111
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
No one noticed you

112
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,480
on the way here, did they?

113
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,750
Don't worry, Miss.

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
How is the matter with the Ye family?

115
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Mr. Ye still refuses to hand over
the title deed of Jade Street.

116
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,120
Grandpa guessed right.

117
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,430
The entrance to Ever Realm
is indeed on Jade Street.

118
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,480
Did you discover something?

119
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,720
I have been lurking on Jade Street
for so many years.

120
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,920
I've finally waited
for the Jade Buddha Hand to appear.

121
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
Legend has it

122
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,560
that only the Jade Buddha Hand's heir
knows the entrance to Ever Realm.

123
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,160
The first time I saw Wei Jianhao

124
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,920
touching the stone with his right hand
on Jade Street,

125
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,310
I suspected him
to be the Jade Buddha Hand.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,310
Then Ye Jianren also chased him
to Jade Street.

127
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,870
You'll know after a match.

128
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,720
But if you lose,

129
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,560
you must cripple one of your hands.

130
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,680
Ye Jianren bent on disabling
his right hand.

131
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
I was more than sure.

132
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,720
Later, he fought with the Magic Eye.

133
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,160
His right hand was crippled.

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,000
But overnight he seemed
to be transformed,

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
and his left hand became
even more powerful.

136
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,070
If I'm not mistaken,

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,560
he's already entered
Ever Realm to cultivate.

138
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
In that case,

139
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,680
this man is the key

140
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,750
to find the entrance to Ever Realm.

141
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,120
Spread the news.

142
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,120
Say that Ever Realm
has already appeared.

143
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,560
It's time for the old monsters
of the major hidden families

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,160
to come out.

145
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Yes, Miss.

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,750
I'll do it right away.

147
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,590
By the way,

148
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,830
don't let Miss Wan'er

149
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,630
know about this.

150
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,920
She seems

151
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,390
to have fallen in love with Wei Jianhao.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,750
Is he so special?

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
It's the first time

154
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,360
she's fallen for someone

155
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,630
other than you.

156
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,270
Wan'er,

157
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
still angry with me?

158
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,310
I'm

159
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
upset.

160
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Then tell me,

161
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,950
why do you like Wei Jianhao?

162
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,710
He...

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,950
He's kind to his sister,

164
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,920
just like you.

165
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,270
Is it the reason why

166
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,720
you like him so much?

167
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,640
He can

168
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,680
beat me.

169
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,110
So handsome.

170
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,920
There's really nothing
I can do about you.

171
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,910
Alright.

172
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,750
Since you like him so much,

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,390
I'll help you win him over.

174
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,870
Really?

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,120
When have I ever lied to you?

176
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,150
Let's go to his house now.

177
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,420
(Wei Shop)

178
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,150
Jianhao, you're finally back.

179
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,720
Didn't I tell you to leave?

180
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,990
Gu Dan...

181
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,550
Gu Dan kicked me out.

182
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,160
You deserve.

183
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,080
How can you say that?

184
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm doing this for you.

185
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,440
What does your lovers' quarrel have
to do with me?

186
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,320
Gu Dan said I like you,

187
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,720
but you like him.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,960
My relationship with him
is no longer pure.

189
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,270
What a messy and chaotic relationship.

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,120
How can your thoughts be so...

191
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,750
incomprehensible?

192
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,390
Where is Gu Dan?

193
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Inside?

194
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
Gu Dan.

195
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,910
What do you want to do?

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Chief Wei,

197
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm supposed to do

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,050
whatever you want me to do,

199
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,270
but you're forcing me to do
this kind of thing.

200
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,160
I really

201
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,870
only like women.

202
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,750
What are you saying?

203
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,960
I don't understand.

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Did I do something

205
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,390
that you misunderstood?

206
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,120
Don't try to hide it.

207
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,030
Why did you

208
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,670
just shred my clothes last night

209
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,960
and not hers?

210
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,030
I... This...

211
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,320
I live out of my house,

212
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
and this piece of clothing
is my favorite.

213
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,670
Now you have left me barely clothed.

214
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,120
Turn around!

215
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,120
Didn't I give you guys

216
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,960
all the jade you broke earlier?

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Those are worth so much money.

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,910
Can't you buy another one yourself?

219
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,200
You make it sound
like you're keeping me.

220
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,390
No...

221
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,380
I must clear my name for this.

222
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,960
I didn't spend any
of the money you gave me.

223
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,750
It was all taken by this stinky woman.

224
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,590
I...

225
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,470
I saved it

226
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,910
for us, okay?

227
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I thought if you couldn't
return to the Gu family,

228
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,960
I could use this money
for us to get married.

229
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Forget it!

230
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,550
Get married?

231
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,240
Don't think I don't know

232
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,970
that you're already in love with...

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,840
Chief.

234
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,870
You think you'll dump me one day

235
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,320
when you're with him, don't you?

236
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,270
How can you think of me like that?

237
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,720
When you looked at him yesterday,

238
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,720
don't think I didn't notice.

239
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,360
Your heart was already with him.

240
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
So what if it is?

241
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,360
He is just more handsome than you,

242
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,670
wilder than you,

243
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,960
and more manly than you.

244
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,240
You fool.

245
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,550
I'm done pretending.

246
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,440
Tonight, I'm breaking up with you!

247
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,550
- I've fallen for him.
- Alright.

248
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,390
So what?

249
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,790
I agree

250
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,550
that you two continue to live here.

251
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,670
So hardworking.

252
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
Aren't you tired?

253
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,560
Thank you, Chief.

254
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Thank you, Chief Wei.

255
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,480
Gu Dan, what's wrong?

256
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,360
What's wrong with you?

257
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,750
You're bleeding.

258
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,840
- Where?
- Here!

259
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,230
I...

260
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,670
Am I going to die?

261
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,480
If you dare to die,

262
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,030
I'll marry Chief Wei instead.

263
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,080
I told you, you weren't acting just now.

264
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,480
So realistic.

265
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,960
It couldn't possibly be acting.

266
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Here we go again.

267
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
I... How can you say that?

268
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,550
What are you doing?

269
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,030
Can't you see?

270
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,960
We've moved all our belongings here.

271
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,030
From today, we're going to live here.

272
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,240
Why?

273
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,960
How dare you ask why?

274
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,670
Don't you know

275
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,720
what you've done to Wan'er?

276
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,480
I... What did I do?

277
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,800
You seduced my sister

278
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,120
and cheated her out of her heart.

279
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,960
I seduced...

280
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Why don't I know I've seduced again?

281
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Again?

282
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,960
Who else did you seduce?

283
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,240
Don't use these two losers as a shield.

284
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,870
It's too fake.

285
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,870
Wei Jianhao, I'm telling you,

286
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,910
Wan'er has already told me.

287
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,750
I really didn't do anything.

288
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,200
Sister Wan'er,

289
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
what exactly is going on here?

290
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,630
Sister Wan'er, say something!

291
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,630
- Wan'er...
- What are you pretending to be?

292
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,840
Can't you see that Wan'er likes you?

293
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,000
Like...?

294
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,750
- Chief!
- Chief!

295
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Chief,

296
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,510
are you okay?

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,840
Tang Lili,

298
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,120
is it your sister who wants to move in,

299
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
or is it you?

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,080
That's right.

301
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,260
It's not like she's pregnant

302
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,100
or something.

303
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,140
Staying at someone else's house?

304
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,960
So malicious.

305
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,150
Brother Dan.

306
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,480
If you two

307
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,270
dare to say another word,

308
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,960
I'll have Wan'er throw you out
on the street.

309
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,800
No...

310
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
Throw you out.

311
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,590
Anyway,

312
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,840
Wei Jianhao,

313
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,080
you must be responsible for Wan'er,

314
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
or I won't be polite to you.

315
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,160
No...

316
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,550
Let's go, Wan'er.

317
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,840
I'll show you the rooms.

318
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,960
Pick a room?

319
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,600
