=The Gold Behind the Stone=

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,940
=Episode 1=

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,120
It's icy saturated bright green.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,510
According to its size,
there are 18 bracelet positions.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,640
Each bracelet has a market price

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,350
of over 1.5 million yuan.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
The rest can be made into pendants.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,200
So this piece is worth 30 million yuan.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,150
Grandpa actually saved
so much for me.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Jianhao,

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,350
since you don't like
the Xia family's girl,

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,790
go to Jade Street

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,700
and redeem the Wei family's shop

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,800
that was used as a betrothal gift.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,130
- Grandpa!
- Then cancel the engagement.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,040
I have to go to sea.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,950
Grandpa!

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,790
Wait, hasn't the shop already been sent?

29
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,710
Wouldn't it be inappropriate
to ask for it back?

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,230
Go check the basement
of the shop yourself.

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,310
Those are all left for you.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,310
What a grandpa.

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,430
Why did he arrange a childhood engagement
for me for no reason?

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,520
Well done, Grandpa.

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,520
He hid so much jade
under the betrothal gift.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,630
I...

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,800
Don't be in such a hurry.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,710
I have something to tell you.

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,250
Let's talk after everything is done.

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,120
So impatient.

41
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,560
I don't care.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,800
When are you going to marry me?

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,710
How did I hear

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
that you were engaged to someone before?

45
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,520
That doesn't count anymore.

46
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,720
He was just a poor neighbor
from childhood.

47
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,680
How could I be interested in him?

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,660
I just want to get some betrothal gifts.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,030
Xia Changyin?

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,520
Who are you?

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,190
You don't know me?

52
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,720
This shop is a betrothal gift

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,750
my Grandpa gave you.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,990
You remember that, right?

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Wei Jianhao?

56
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,430
Your childhood betrothed
has come knocking.

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,470
No wonder you don't like him.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,750
He really does look shabby.

59
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,430
I already said that.

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,720
You're the only one in my heart.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,300
I haven't broken off
the engagement yet.

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,770
You two are acting like this
in front of me.

63
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,470
Isn't it too disrespectful?

64
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,360
Respect?

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
Do you think a dragon

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,000
needs to respect an ant's thoughts?

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,150
Get lost now!

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,400
(Xia Shop)

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,940
How could Grandpa let me get engaged
with a person like that?

70
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,710
No way.

71
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,910
I must

72
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,240
take my family's shop back.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,260
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

74
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,860
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

75
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,600
Tang Lili,

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,000
don't think
you can challenge the Gu family

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,750
just because business has picked up
a bit this year.

78
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,180
You're still inexperienced.

79
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,830
Mr. Gu,

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,600
stop fooling yourself.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,510
Starting today,

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
Chongjiang Jade Street

83
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,310
will undergo a transformation.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
See you at the Jade Exhibition.

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,270
See you at the Jade Exhibition.

86
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,030
Boss,

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
what happened there?

88
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,600
This year,

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,870
all the shops on Jade Street

90
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,360
will be rearranged.

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Originally, the Gu family wanted
to take the lead.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,510
Unexpectedly, the Tang Clan stepped in.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,510
This time, it's going to be a good show.

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,630
How is the redistribution
going to happen?

95
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,940
It's like a competition
at the Jade Exhibition

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,440
to see who makes more money
by buying stones,

97
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,970
so whoever earns more gets more shops.

98
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,190
Anyway, it's just a game

99
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,430
for those rich people.

100
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,950
(As long as I win)

101
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,190
(at the Jade Exhibition,)

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,750
(I'll be able
to get the shop back, right?)

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Thank you, Sir.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
You're welcome.

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,870
Please show your invitation.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,310
What invitation?

107
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,700
The invitation
from the Jade Association.

108
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,020
(Jade Exhibition)
Without it,

109
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
you need to have a million in reserves.

110
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,560
Are the tickets really that expensive?

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,920
I'm talking about the reserve fund.

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,390
The stones inside are worth millions.

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,430
Why come if you don't have the money?

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Just go away.

115
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,070
Hello, Grandpa.

116
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,000
Where did you leave the money?

117
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,160
I only have 500 yuan with me.

118
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,040
I spent it all on buying stones.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,310
- Can I...?
- No, you can't.

120
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,390
The stones at home are all mine.

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,190
All of yours are stored
in the shop's basement.

122
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,430
Have you redeemed the shop?

123
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,670
Not yet.

124
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,800
Xia Changyin mortgaged the shop
to the Gu family.

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,720
Gu family?

126
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,390
What a small family.

127
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,870
You handle it yourself.

128
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,430
So you agree
that I can use my right hand?

129
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,310
No, I don't.

130
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,800
Until your left hand is fully trained,

131
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,800
you can't use your right hand
in front of others.

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,660
No.

133
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,010
You won't let me use my right hand,

134
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,000
so how should I...?

135
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,500
Grandpa?

136
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
Hello?

137
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,000
Always like this.

138
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,750
Take a look at this of mine.

139
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Young man,

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,190
don't be so downcast.

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,870
Come and cut a raw stone
to try your luck.

142
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,710
Come over here.

143
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,800
He won't let me buy stones
with my right hand.

144
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,630
How can I win back the shop?

145
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
What if the stones in the basement

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,190
are discovered by those two people?

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,360
Won't that benefit those two snobs?

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
No way!

149
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,190
Boss, I have 500 yuan.

150
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
What can I buy with that?

151
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,640
500?

152
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
You can't buy anything.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe you can buy
that pile of opened waste.

154
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,360
Will you sell it all for 500 yuan?

155
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,830
Do you really want it?

156
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,120
Let's make it clear.

157
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,900
If you want it,
you have to take it all away.

158
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,220
So I won't have to hire others to clean.

159
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll all in.

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
Such a lunatic,
throwing around 500 like a rich person.

161
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,630
Dude, these are stones
that others have already cut.

162
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,190
Do you think others are fools?

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,100
He actually dares to try his luck
on Tang Clan's pile of scrap stones.

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Does he think Tang Clan doesn't know
how to cut stones?

165
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,830
Sir, cut along the line.

166
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,360
Don't deviate even a little.

167
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,120
Don't deviate even a little?

168
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
You dare to come here and cause trouble.

169
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you a lackey of the Gu family?

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,860
Miss Lili.

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,390
I have already given the money.

172
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,510
A deal is a deal.

173
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,360
Doesn't Tang Clan follow the rules?

174
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
Miss Lili,

175
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,720
he hasn't given us the 200 yuan
for cutting yet.

176
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,310
We can refuse to cut for him.

177
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,950
I already gave you all my money.

178
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,800
You cut as I told you.

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,860
The cutting fee is covered.

180
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,510
- This is getting something for nothing.
- Yes, indeed.

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,870
Are you giving me a bad check?

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Do you think I'm as foolish as you?

183
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,320
Miss Lili, this is...?

184
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,870
Help him open it.

185
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
I want to see

186
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,270
if he can play a trick

187
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,550
on our Tang Clan territory.

188
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,960
This piece also needs to be cut
along the line.

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,750
There's an icy bright green cabochon
inside.

190
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,150
Still showing off.

191
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,870
Yes, how dare he mess with Tang Clan!

192
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
Green appears.

193
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,500
- Really?
- Take a look.

194
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,860
Green can really appear from waste?

195
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,480
Miss Lili, this is worth 50,000.

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
That must be...

197
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,550
a dumb luck.

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,030
Isn't he going to open it again?

199
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,510
Continue.

200
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,290
If one fails,

201
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,530
send him to feed the Tibetan Mastiff.

202
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,670
He's just lucky.

203
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,390
Does he really think he's special?

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,360
Showing off.

205
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,750
He'll end up being fed
the Tang Clan's Tibetan Mastiff.

206
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a piece of glassy jadeite
worth 100,000.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
100,000?

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,550
That's impossible, right?

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,750
Could it be a mistake?

210
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,910
Miss Lili,

211
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,240
look,

212
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,150
he's already earned 650,000.

213
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
- 650,000?
- Did I hear that right?

214
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,080
How does this guy cut every stone right?

215
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,270
(Who exactly is this person?)

216
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,190
(Even the chief stone appraiser of Tang Clan
is not as good as him.)

217
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,150
This is just too amazing!

218
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,080
If I had known earlier,
I would have bought this.

219
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Boss, I really can't identify anymore.

220
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,550
Consider this piece as a cleaning fee.

221
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,360
You can find someone else
to clean it, okay?

222
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,630
Miss Lili, I made a mistake.

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,150
You only have a small stall.

224
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,720
One mistake can cost 650,000.

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,550
Our Tang Clan has
so many stores and shops,

226
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,270
we will lose tens of millions
every year.

227
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,640
Boss, don't underestimate
this small stone.

228
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,550
It can cover your cleaning expenses
for a month.

229
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,840
If you don't agree...

230
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,750
- I want it!
- I'll take it!

231
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,910
Boss, give it to me!

232
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,120
Don't touch.

233
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
Wait, Boss.

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
You haven't given me the money yet.

235
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,840
Here's 20,000 for you first.

236
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
I'll transfer you the rest later.

237
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
Alright, that works.

238
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
Don't touch!

239
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,480
Boss, don't forget to wire it to me.

240
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
I need to cut them again.

241
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,670
Don't touch.

242
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,550
Nobody moves.

243
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,040
What do you mean?

244
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,390
Without your 200,

245
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,150
I really can't make that much money.

246
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,870
You're not sent by the Gu family?

247
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,670
I've earned the Tang Clan's money.

248
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,320
I still need
to win the Gu family's shop quickly.

249
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,080
In that case,

250
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,320
we're kindred spirits, right?

251
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,270
What's your name?

252
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,670
You don't need to know my name.

253
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,080
Just don't take me

254
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,480
to feed your Tibetan Mastiff.

255
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,050
I did that to give you
a sense of pressure

256
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,150
and to test your composure.

257
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,910
Then I should thank you
for the pressure.

258
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,320
I don't need the money.

259
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
If you really want to thank me,

260
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
why not

261
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,720
become a stone appraiser for Tang Clan?

262
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,600
I don't have time
to beat about the bush.

263
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,840
I've got to cut

264
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
another 350,000 yuan worth of stone.

265
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,390
Why does it have to be 350,000?

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,970
I want to go to the Jade Exhibition.

267
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,980
Need to collect a million.

268
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,150
That's not necessary.

269
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,020
I'll take you there.

270
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,080
Do you have an invitation?

271
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,670
I don't need it.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,910
Come with me.

273
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Mr. Gu,

274
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,150
this year, the Ye family

275
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,910
rearranged the shops on Jade Street.

276
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,550
Our Qin family wants
to acquire some more shops.

277
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,360
Currently,
40% of the shops on Jade Street

278
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,080
belong to the Tang Clan.

279
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,360
For this year's Jade Exhibition,

280
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,630
we have to unite.

281
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,360
Otherwise,
no one will have an easy time.

282
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,750
That's right.

283
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,320
We can't let the Tang Clan dominate.

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,720
The Tang Clan has a 40% monopoly.

285
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,720
Indeed, it hinders the development
of our jade industry.

286
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
How much she can be persuaded to give up

287
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,750
depends on how much everyone

288
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
cooperates with our Gu family.

289
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,600
We're looking to the Gu family
for guidance.

290
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,510
I was just a little late.

291
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,440
The family heads

292
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,840
were already sharpening the knives

293
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,120
and thinking about
how to take down our Tang Clan.
