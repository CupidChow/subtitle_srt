=Episode 22=

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,790
Why are you in the bathroom?

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,560
Didn't you see
I was about to take a shower?

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Why did you come in?

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm here to take a shower.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,920
Didn't you just take a shower?

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,350
Did I?

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,430
Look,

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,150
your hair is still wet.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,510
It really is.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
How come I don't remember at all?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You don't forget
how to take a bath, do you?

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,550
Sister Lili,

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,640
do you think I might become

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,150
as foolish as your fourth uncle?

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
It's okay.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,790
I'll take care of you if you're a fool.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Sister Lili.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,120
You go inside.

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,710
I'll help you take a bath.

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,000
Isn't that inappropriate?

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,630
It's not like you're naked.

34
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,790
I'll help you scrub your back.

35
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,240
Take off your clothes.

36
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,030
Sister Lili,

37
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,590
you're so good to me.

38
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,520
You're even nicer to me.

39
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
Will you forget me?

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,030
Let's come here every day,

41
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,590
so I'll never forget you.

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,630
Tang Lili, have you finished?

43
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,590
I haven't showered yet.

44
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,990
Wait.

45
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,470
Jianhao,

46
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,190
we can't let your memory fade away.

47
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,040
Do you still remember the Ever Realm?

48
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,480
Ever Realm?

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,270
I have a slight impression.

50
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,510
You should have entered
from the basement before.

51
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,870
Do you remember how to enter Ever Realm?

52
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,870
How did I get in?

53
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,590
I...

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
What's wrong?

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,630
What's wrong with you?

56
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,720
The harder I think about it,

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
the more intense the headache gets.

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,630
Alright...

59
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,560
Don't think about it.

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,680
Let's not think about it.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
We don't have to think about it.

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
Don't think about it.

63
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,830
Grandpa, are you looking for me?

64
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,120
Wei Jianhao is back.

65
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,630
You should return to Wei Shop.

66
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,950
But I just got back.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
You want me to work for

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,520
Wei Jianhao again?

69
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,510
Do you know

70
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,830
why I want you to stay with Wei Jianhao?

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Word has it

72
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
that the Chase Rodford family

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,510
has sent a fifth realm expert,

74
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,350
Wu Chen,

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,870
to Jade Street.

76
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,510
Fifth realm?

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
Didn't they say the best in the world

78
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,480
is the third realm?

79
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,000
That's only the most powerful

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,390
in a small place like Chongjiang.

81
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,630
There's always someone more powerful.

82
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,190
Although the fifth realm

83
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,870
only exists in legends,

84
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,240
there are people in the world

85
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,310
who can achieve it,

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,430
not to mention

87
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,480
the talents

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,070
of a consortium

89
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,120
like the Chase Rodford family.

90
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,600
The Chase Rodford family

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,630
is one of the world's top
financial consortiums.

92
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,120
Why would they be interested

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,430
in Chongjiang Jade Street?

94
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,000
They don't want Jade Street,

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
but the Ever Realm.

96
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,720
The legendary Ever Realm
that various families

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,630
have been searching for years?

98
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,920
The Ever Realm contains

99
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,430
the ultimate mystery of cultivation.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,270
Anyone who reaches

101
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,630
the first realm

102
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,600
is already a master.

103
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,920
Only a few can

104
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
reach the third realm.

105
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,560
Those who reach the fifth realm

106
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
are already

107
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,720
as powerful as gods.

108
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,800
But if someone can

109
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,240
enter the Ever Realm

110
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,750
and become the Master of Ever Realm,

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,040
he may reach

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,070
the fifth realm

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,390
and become

114
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,630
a true

115
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,160
Martial World Sovereign.

116
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,240
That's why all the great families

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,270
are so concerned about the Ever Realm.

118
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,270
But what does the Ever Realm

119
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,750
have to do with Wei Jianhao?

120
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,120
From the very beginning,

121
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,390
I've noticed
that he has a peculiar ability,

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,510
and the Jade Buddha Hand is rumored

123
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,000
to be the key
to the entrance of Ever Realm.

124
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
How can Wei Jianhao

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,920
be so powerful?

126
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,900
But hasn't

127
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,290
his Jade Buddha Hand been destroyed?

128
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,870
After his Jade Buddha Hand
was destroyed,

129
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,950
the power of his left hand

130
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,040
suddenly became stronger.

131
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,950
He must have

132
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,120
opened the entrance

133
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,720
to Ever Realm.

134
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,870
This indicates

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,560
that the Jade Buddha Hand

136
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,630
may not be the key
to opening Ever Realm,

137
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,030
but

138
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,200
the Wei bloodline is.

139
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,790
The Wei bloodline?

140
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,960
Therefore,

141
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,360
I've arranged for you

142
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,480
to stay with Wei Jianhao

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,600
to find the Ever Realm

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,790
and the chance to open its entrance.

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,840
If our Gu family

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,870
can become the Master of Ever Realm,

147
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,120
in the future,

148
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,270
all the major families

149
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,480
will submit to us.

150
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,000
But I've been by his side for so long,

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
and I've found nothing.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,630
Go back and tell Wei Jianhao

153
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,630
that an expert of the fifth realm

154
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,440
has sneaked into Jade Street.

155
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,600
He'll definitely
enter the Ever Realm to cultivate.

156
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
At that time,

157
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,870
keep an eye on him

158
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,670
and see

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,030
how he enters the Ever Realm.

160
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Alright.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
Grandpa, rest assured.

162
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,840
(No wonder Wei Jianhao
is so popular with women.)

163
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,120
(If I become the Master of Ever Realm,)

164
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,670
(all the beauties in Chongjiang)

165
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,600
(will be all over me.)

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
Grandpa,

167
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,270
I'm going now.

168
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,340
You guys, come quickly!

169
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,960
What's going on?

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
What are you doing?

171
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,670
I... I didn't do anything.

172
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm just looking.

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,180
- Are you okay?
- Jianhao, are you okay?

174
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,110
What happened?

175
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,630
Who are you?

176
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
He...

177
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,270
He doesn't even remember me.

178
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
He looks

179
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
like a fool.

180
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,390
The poison of the Aquaman

181
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,630
really did work overnight.

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
Brother...

183
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,510
Brother won't become a fool.

184
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
Jianhao,

185
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,030
didn't you just promise me

186
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,630
that you wouldn't forget me?

187
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,910
Why are you four
looking at me like that?

188
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,600
Do we know each other?

189
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,440
Young Master, where are you?

190
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,560
Young Master!

191
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
It seems like

192
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm late.

193
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,350
I didn't expect

194
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,000
that I'd lose him first.

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,280
Young Master,

196
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,150
how could you not wait for me?

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,270
Who told you to cry and mourn,

198
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,720
you jinx?

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Why are you crying?

200
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,870
What exactly happened to Hao?

201
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,910
Tell me what's going on.

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
Alright.

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Let me take a look.

204
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,530
Grandpa?

205
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,470
Young Master...

206
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,720
Young Master is not dead!

207
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,790
Let the sensible people
in the room talk to me

208
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,720
about Hao's situation.

209
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,600
Who is he?

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,080
Young Master's Grandpa,

211
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Wei Changming,

212
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,160
Mr. Wei.

213
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Grandpa.

214
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,030
That outstanding

215
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,910
Wei Changming?

216
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Yes.

217
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,620
(Mr. Wei)

218
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,350
Mr. Wei,

219
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,030
he was poisoned

220
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,750
- trying to save...
- Little girl,

221
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,200
you have a beautiful voice.

222
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,270
But Mo has already told me

223
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,320
about the poison.

224
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,270
All you have to do

225
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,790
is tell me how sick he is.

226
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,110
I'll do it...

227
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
Grandpa,

228
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,030
(Mr. Wei)
I'm Changyin, Xia Changyin.

229
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,170
Do you still remember

230
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,720
the engagement you arranged for us?

231
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,790
- The point!
- The point!

232
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,200
He doesn't

233
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,440
remember anyone,

234
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,720
and he has become foolish.

235
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,270
Has he spat blood?

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
Not yet.

237
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,790
That's good.

238
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,230
Qing'er.

239
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,910
Qing'er, don't cry. Don't worry.

240
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,510
I'll find a way.

241
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
All of you, be quiet.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,860
Listen to Mr. Wei!

243
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,480
To solve the problem,
we need to find the origin.

244
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,790
Only the Deep Sea Poison King

245
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,440
can cure his poison.

246
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,910
But it's too late to find him now.

247
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,200
Who else here

248
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,670
is poisoned by him?

249
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,120
And my sister.

250
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,320
She was poisoned by Max Poison.

251
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,630
I...

252
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,670
I'm okay now.

253
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,510
It's my temper...

254
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,870
Let them cultivate together.

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Spitting up blood

256
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,910
means the poison is eating away
at Hao's organs.

257
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,200
Now the only way
to fight poison is to use

258
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,720
the Poison King's own poison.

259
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Otherwise,

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Jianhao won't survive tonight.

261
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,750
Mr. Wei,

262
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,630
is this

263
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,440
enough?

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,960
(Mr. Wei)
There was a couple who were poisoned

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
by the Deep Sea Poison King,

266
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,550
but they came back to life.

267
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,240
And one of them improved

268
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,080
after they cultivated together.

269
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,030
In the case of you two now,

270
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,080
we can only try to suppress the poison

271
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,840
and keep Jianhao alive.

272
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,000
But how much of his memory
can be retained

273
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,440
is unknown.

274
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
If...

275
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,240
If I can save him,

276
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,910
I will.

277
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Wan'er.

278
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,000
I already like him

279
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,270
and I want to be with him.

280
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,270
Then I'll entrust Jianhao to you.

281
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
Mo,

282
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
give them

283
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,880
that Cultivation Skill.

284
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,240
Let's go.

285
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,340
