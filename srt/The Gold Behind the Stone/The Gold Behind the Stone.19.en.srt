=Episode 19=

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,320
(300 million?)

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,590
What?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
You're scared to death of the price?

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,920
That friend of yours, Mr. Mo, must have

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
run away in fear.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,120
I... I'll cover you,

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
so you can escape.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
It's not that bad, Sister Wan'er.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
(His right hand has recovered?)

22
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,230
You're so pretentious.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,120
If you can't afford it,
you'd better admit it.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
(Although the skin of this stone
looks ordinary,)

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,590
(there are hidden signs of blackness.)

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,950
(The flat reveals old texture)

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,230
(and good transparency.)

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,070
(It's a rare piece of imperial green.)

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,790
(It's worth it.)

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,550
(It's truly worth it.)

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,870
(It's just that Mr. Mo is not here.)

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,070
Don't hold on to it.

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,640
You don't have the face for it.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,560
Unless this piece is full green,

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
it's not worth 300 million.

36
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,310
It's too risky.

37
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,150
I won't bet on it.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,520
If you can't afford it,
you have to admit it.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,470
Do you have the nerve

40
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,560
to blame the stone?

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Don't you want

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,870
to show off your wealth?

43
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,360
What's that got to do with
the quality of the stone?

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,710
Exactly.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,430
That's the lesson I want to teach you.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,310
You gentlemen,

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,560
even if you're rich,
you can't buy indiscriminately.

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,310
Otherwise, you'll be treated

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,310
like a sucker

50
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,750
and a big fool.

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Nonsense.

52
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,360
Keep pretending.

53
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,270
So speechless.

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,080
(This is a very rare violet jadeite)

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,120
(from the Pakan field in Mian.)

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
(The flat shows a deep purple color.)

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
(Not bad.)

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
(It weighs...)

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
(It weighs about 18 jin.)

60
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,840
(Purple is also called "Chun"
in the jade industry.)

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,150
(It should be)

62
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,470
(a pinkish purple color in this stone.)

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,310
(The price tag is...)

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,180
(500 million)

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,120
(The price tag is 500 million?)

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,240
Are you going to buy it or not?

67
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,350
- No money, no time-wasting!
- Exactly.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,710
(This stone is so big.)

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
(If I buy it,)

70
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,630
(I should make more than 500 million.)

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
(But...)

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,870
(But where's Mr. Mo?)

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
(I don't have any money with me!)

74
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,870
What?

75
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,680
Are you going to lose money

76
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
even if you buy this one?

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Why don't you give up all three pieces?

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Just say you don't have any money!

79
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,120
Wan'er,

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
I really don't understand.

81
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
How could you fall for

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,870
such a liar and pauper?

83
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,190
I really doubt...

84
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,150
I also doubt

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,750
whether I'm your biological child
or not.

86
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,600
You...

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
Anyway,

88
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,430
if he says it's no good,

89
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,520
it's just not good.

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
I trust him.

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Sister Wan'er,

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,240
buying this piece can be profitable.

93
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,130
- It's just...
- It's just that he has no money!

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,820
He finally admitted it.

95
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,350
Why pretend to be rich when you're not?

96
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,800
He doesn't even look at himself.

97
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,510
- Yes, indeed.
- Why pretend?

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Young Master,

99
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
I've just finished buying that piece.

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Here's your card.

101
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,350
Mr. Mo,

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,190
what did you

103
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,190
just call him?

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Mrs. Su,

105
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,430
I forgot to introduce you.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,160
This is our Young Master.

107
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,750
Mr. Mo's Young Master?

108
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Wei Jianhao,

109
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,720
since your backup has arrived,

110
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,310
with your current wealth,

111
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
you should be able to afford it.

112
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
Mr. Mo,

113
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,230
this piece is marked
at 500 million yuan.

114
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,390
Your centurion card
has no spending limit.

115
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,310
Buy it.

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
My dear,

117
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,920
don't buy it

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
if you'll lose money.

119
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
It's worth it.

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
This one's different from that one.

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,950
This one can make a lot of money.

122
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,430
Don't have to check the rest.

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Go on.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Keep pretending.

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,430
I'll see how you'll end up.

126
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,160
My dear,

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,510
why don't you check that piece
before deciding?

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
What if you lose money?

129
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,510
I mean, I won't buy the other one.

130
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Come on!

131
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,160
I really find it meaningless

132
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,040
to compare

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,630
who's the richest like this.

134
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,310
I feel like

135
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,040
a rich douchebag.

136
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,070
I really don't understand

137
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,360
why you rich kids

138
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
have to develop such a habit.

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Mrs. Su,

140
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,160
I suddenly feel that I don't need
to prove to you

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,830
whether I have money or status.

142
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,750
The reason
why I am willing to buy this stone

143
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,630
is because this is a charity sale

144
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,270
run by Mr. Su.

145
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,270
As for what you think of me,

146
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,270
it really doesn't matter
to me and Wan'er.

147
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,670
Mr. Mo,

148
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,030
buy it.

149
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,830
Yes, Young Master.

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Wei Jianhao,

151
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,040
don't act like it's real.

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,960
Your money is

153
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,070
from your lovers, right?

154
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,750
What do you mean?

155
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,360
I just asked around,

156
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,820
and it turns out you're the grandson
of the Ye family.

157
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,120
I knew that

158
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,430
no good can come

159
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,750
from a bad family.

160
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,870
You're just like your sister Ye Sijie.

161
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,480
Even though you're rich,

162
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,120
you're worthless.

163
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,350
By the way,

164
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,920
I also heard from Ye Sijie

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,510
that you gave your own sister

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
to the Su family's fool

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,310
in order to get in touch with them.

168
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,270
The money you're holding now

169
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,310
is your sister's usual charity, right?

170
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,680
You're quite amusing,

171
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,920
taking the Su family's money

172
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,310
and acting like a lord.

173
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,150
Young Master Bai,

174
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,870
you're disrespecting
the Su family's guest.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
You're just the president
of Chongjiang Jade Association.

176
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,060
If I'm polite to you,

177
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,140
you've forgotten your own status.

178
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,990
You...

179
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
Mr. Mo!

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
How dare you touch my people?

181
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Today, you'll meet your end here.

182
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
- My dear!
- Wan'er!

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Mom!

184
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,190
It looks like you want
to burn me to death.

185
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Burn him.

186
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Burn him!

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
Molten Flame!

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Domain!

189
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,430
How dare you resist

190
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
my second realm's blazing flame
with only an air shield?

191
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,680
I've never seen this before,

192
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,270
so I'm letting you
run around a little longer.

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Control.

194
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,560
How can you control my fire?

195
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
Impossible!

196
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,680
What kind of mysterious skill is this?

197
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,510
I learned a lot of skills
the other day,

198
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,830
but I've never used them.

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,630
Would you like to experience them?

200
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,710
Explode!

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Where did it explode?

202
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Where's my fireball?

203
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,840
Useless.

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,920
Bluffing...

205
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,270
Don't make the domain so large.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
The smaller it is,
the more explosive it is.

207
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,550
(So that's how it works.)

208
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,550
(But why is there a delay?)

209
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,750
Oh my.

210
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,710
What's going on?

211
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,790
Isn't he already in the second realm?

212
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
How could it be...?

213
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
Am I blinking?

214
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,840
Is it possible that this person

215
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
has already reached the third realm?

216
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
Nonsense!

217
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Only the heads of major families

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,120
can really reach the third realm.

219
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,390
How could
such a young lad possibly do it?

220
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,270
But he used just one finger

221
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,790
to defeat someone in the second realm.

222
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,440
You are not in the second realm.

223
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

224
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,040
Although I don't have much affection

225
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,120
for the Ye family, I don't want to see

226
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,790
something people like you

227
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,360
insult it at will.

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Also,

229
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,320
you shouldn't have mentioned my sister.

230
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,630
So...

231
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,750
Is he going to kill with his finger?

232
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,790
Stop it!

233
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,750
Wan'er, tell him to stop!

234
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,080
My dear, you can't kill him.

235
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
How dare you!

236
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm the Young Master Bai.

237
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,960
I told you to stop the nonsense.

238
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,080
Hurry and go to the hospital!

239
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,720
Be quick!

240
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,910
Take him to the hospital!

241
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,750
Hurry up.

242
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,790
Aunt,

243
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,750
he hit me.

244
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,390
- He tried to kill me!
- Go to the hospital.

245
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,230
Go...

246
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,720
He was still struggling when he fought

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,790
the Judge before,

248
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
but now it seems

249
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,030
that the Ever Realm
not only healed his injuries

250
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,910
but also allowed him to level up.

251
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,270
If he truly is the domain master
of Ever Realm,

252
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,120
his real abilities are far beyond this.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,870
It seems like it's time

254
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,910
to meet with him.

255
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,060
How dare you injure someone
from the Bai family!

256
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,680
Mrs. Su,

257
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
can't you see that he started it?

258
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,870
So what?

259
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
How can someone

260
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,030
like you disrespect the Bai family?

261
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,910
So, Mrs. Su, you mean

262
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,840
I should have just stood there

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,510
and let him beat me to death?

264
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,120
It's disrespectful to strike back

265
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
at a man of honor?

266
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,360
You beat Ge like this.

267
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,960
The Bai family won't let you go.

268
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,390
We, the Su family,

269
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,960
won't let you go either.

270
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
My dear,

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
don't be afraid,
I will bear it with you.

272
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
Mrs. Su, I think

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,510
Bai Ge was right.

274
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,260
People with money
aren't necessarily worth it.

275
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,550
That should be you, Mrs. Su.

276
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,000
Sister Wan'er, rest assured.

277
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll still help you,

278
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,270
but I can't stay

279
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,360
in this place any longer.

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
Are you

281
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,200
my real mother?

282
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,790
You're siding with this brat

283
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,270
to bully your mother!

284
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,790
Are you really my daughter?

285
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,550
I hope

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,030
I'm not.

287
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,720
What are you doing?

288
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,110
Today, you have to

289
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,720
get engaged to Chase Rodford family.

290
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
From now on,

291
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,910
you're not allowed
to see that rascal again!

292
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,720
Wan'er, are you okay?

293
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,440
Where is Wei Jianhao?

294
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,510
I told him to get lost.

295
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,350
What now?

296
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,000
Aunt Bai,

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
I told you,

298
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,120
he's an honored guest
invited by Grandpa.

299
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,000
Grandpa already knows about the mess

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,270
you two made just now,

301
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,240
so you have
to give an explanation today.

302
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,110
Alright.

303
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,790
I happen to want to ask Master Su,

304
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,840
why he allows a brat

305
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,550
to bully our Bai family.

306
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
Wan'er, are you alright?

307
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Dad,

308
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,550
do you know what you've done?

309
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Are you questioning

310
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,270
why I kicked that poor guy out?

311
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,510
He severely injured Bai Ge.

312
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,030
And instead of stopping him,

313
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,270
you came to question me.

314
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,910
How dare he beat up someone
from our Bai family?

315
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,910
Not to mention in the Su family.

316
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Don't you think

317
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,120
that those people outside

318
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,510
will think that
Su family is easy to bully

319
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,080
and even a brat

320
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,510
can mess with us?

321
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,790
Do you know

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,480
why I had to come to Chongjiang

323
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,910
to hold this betrothal banquet

324
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,270
instead of in Jinling?

325
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,000
Because of that brat?

326
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,870
He has no family background
or connections.

327
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,870
Ge is countless times better than him.

328
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,750
He can marry the Su family,

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,510
but our Bai family can't.

330
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,870
What a joke.

331
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,390
Use your brain

332
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,750
and think it over carefully.

333
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,080
If he's really just

334
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,870
a poor kid with nothing to lose,

335
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,390
why would President Mo
of Jade Association

336
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,240
call him Young Master

337
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,240
and why would Mr. Mo give him
500 million to buy stones?

338
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,120
That's because

339
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
his Grandpa is Wei Changming.
