=Episode 2=

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,240
The family heads

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,200
were already sharpening the knives

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
and thinking about
how to take down our Tang Clan.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
You can't say it like that.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,790
We are all here

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,840
for the long-term development
of Jade Street.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
Didn't you say you'd take me
to buy stones?

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,480
How come you...?

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,040
Over the past three years,

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
our Tang Clan has made 60%

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,070
of the Jade Street's

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,150
market revenue

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,860
with only 40% of the shops.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,230
And now you want me

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,870
to hand over the shops?

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,230
That won't work.

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,550
This year,

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,790
we're going to redistribute
the shops, right?

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,510
Let's see who's stronger.

32
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,430
It's really lively today.

33
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,600
The Gu family invited Master Song here
this year.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,740
He is the top disciple of President Mo
from the Jade Association.

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,760
Master Song.

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,960
Mr. Gu.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Master Song,

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
you've had a long journey.

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,230
Mr. Gu, you're too kind.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,280
This time,
when I returned to Chongjiang,

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,070
I shouldn't have interfered
in the affairs of Jade Street.

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,950
However, since the Gu family needs me,

43
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,310
I will certainly do my utmost.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,710
With Master Song here,

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,200
Tang Clan is bound to lose.

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Indeed.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,150
Wei Jianhao, you're quite annoying.

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,120
Isn't it over yet?

49
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,680
(Wei Jianhao?)
You're really shameless.

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,760
How dare to follow me here!

51
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,080
I really don't have time to follow you.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm here to attend the Jade Exhibition

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,910
to win back the shop.

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,870
Jade Exhibition?

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,920
You?

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,480
This really is the funniest joke

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,520
I've heard today.

58
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,470
Why can't I attend?

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,150
You should take a look at everyone here.

60
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,800
What kind of status do they have?

61
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,820
Even I got in

62
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,000
thanks to Brother Dan.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,630
You bumpkin,

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,360
do you have the qualifications
to walk in?

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Be honest,

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,430
how did you sneak in?

67
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,080
He is a distinguished guest I invited.

68
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,150
Tang Lili,

69
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,800
are you kidding me?

70
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,910
How can such a loser

71
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,710
be distinguished?

72
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,840
He is a stone appraiser of our Tang Clan.

73
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,190
This identity is

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
qualified enough, right?

75
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,030
That must be a joke.

76
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,240
When have I ever...?

77
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Shut up!

78
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,630
Master Tang,

79
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,310
are you telling a joke?

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,200
He is a poor boy
who has never seen the world.

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
Even he can become a stone appraiser
for your Tang Clan?

82
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,310
Who do you think you are?

83
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,990
How dare you comment
on the affairs of Tang Clan?

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,310
Brother Dan.

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,590
Tang Lili,

86
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,710
are you intentionally losing to us?

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,570
That's why you invited this kind of person
to help you appraise stones?

88
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
Alright.

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Let's go.

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Tang Lili,

91
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,870
don't blame me for not warning you.

92
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,030
This time, the allocation ratio
of Jade Street shops

93
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
will be determined by the profits

94
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,840
each family makes

95
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,800
from stone gambling

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,430
during the three-day Jade Exhibition.

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,360
So the stone appraiser
each family hires

98
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,590
will determine each family's fate.

99
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,870
Are you sure

100
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,680
that the fate of your Tang Clan

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,910
rests on this kid?

102
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,590
Mr. Gu,

103
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
I don't need to be told

104
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,870
what to do.

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Wei Jianhao, right?

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,080
Since you're the representative
of the Tang Clan,

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,080
would you dare to compete with me
in public?

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
- We'll go to...
- No, no.

109
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,630
Don't listen to Tang Lili's nonsense.

110
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm here to win the shop.

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,310
I have nothing to do with the Tang Clan.

112
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,040
The bumpkin was scared away
by Master Song.

113
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,040
Such a scamp.

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
How could he compare with Mr. Song?

115
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,070
Let alone compete with Mr. Song.

116
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,720
This stone is quite nice.

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,240
(I'm determined)

118
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,790
(to get the Wei family's shop back.)

119
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,620
(Jade Exhibition)

120
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,040
Do you have anything...?

121
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,430
What are you going to do?

122
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,710
Since you don't appreciate the courtesy
shown to you,

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,680
you can only be

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
a runner and casual worker for us.

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,160
Whether a runner

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,190
or a stone appraiser,

127
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,120
I won't do it.

128
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,510
I want to work independently.

129
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,710
Wan'er,

130
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,800
hang him upside down

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,070
and take him outside to sunbathe.

132
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,510
No, no...

133
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,670
Put me down.

134
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,080
Let's negotiate some terms.

135
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,000
You should have listened to me earlier.

136
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,920
Wan'er, be gentle when you put him down.

137
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,630
What bad luck I have

138
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,680
to encounter these two
unreasonable women.

139
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,830
Luckily, it's not broken.

140
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,870
You better be careful.

141
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,800
The stones here

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,390
are worth millions.

143
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,540
Even if you go bankrupt,
you can't afford to pay for them.

144
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,340
Isn't that Wei, the Tang Clan's
renowned stone appraiser?

145
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,430
I've made it clear.

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,340
I'm not a stone appraiser
for the Tang Clan.

147
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,270
You don't work for the Tang Clan?

148
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,160
- Then what are you doing here?
- Right.

149
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,510
Why don't you hurry up and leave?

150
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,830
You two have nothing to do?

151
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,240
Can you stop bothering me?

152
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
I just can't stand you.

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
I can't stand poor people like you

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,480
hanging around this high-end place.

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
So what?

156
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,950
I just don't understand.

157
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,720
Everyone here is buying stones,

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
how can you tell

159
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,270
if they're high-end or not?

160
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Kid,

161
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,990
I can tell at first glance

162
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,480
that you don't understand the field.

163
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
These stones, like people,

164
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,870
are categorized into high and low,
noble and humble.

165
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,960
Just like those cheap stones

166
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,600
from the stalls out there,

167
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,190
they won't get into the VIP section,

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,270
and neither will you.

169
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,040
Do you understand?

170
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,630
So tell me,

171
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,000
how can a stone appraiser

172
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,870
be distinguish
between valuable and worthless?

173
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
Of course,

174
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,680
it's by the rise and fall
of stone appraisal

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,510
to judge the level of ability.

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,870
Those who can make money
are considered valuable,

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,000
otherwise,
they are considered worthless.

178
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,660
- My teacher is from...
- Deal.

179
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,270
Then let's see who's superior.

180
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,070
Did I hear that right?

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,120
Compete with me?

182
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,510
Are you qualified?

183
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,360
You can go to ask...

184
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
You don't dare?

185
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,310
Provocation technique.

186
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,560
Fine, if you want to compete, we can.

187
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,250
But if you lose,

188
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,270
you must kowtow to me
three times in public,

189
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,870
then crawl out of Jade Street,

190
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,720
and never set foot here again.

191
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,430
What if you lose?

192
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,720
If I can't even beat someone like you,

193
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,360
then I, Song Ye,

194
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,240
will leave the jade industry forever

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,480
and never touch a stone again.

196
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,070
You must also kowtow to me three times.

197
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,000
What an ignorant young man.

198
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,240
Let's see

199
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,870
whoever chooses the stone

200
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,800
will make the most money.

201
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,070
You can choose any stone here.

202
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,040
No limit.

203
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,750
Actually, I think this is good.

204
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,310
Once the competition ends,

205
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,510
we won't have to see that bumpkin

206
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,720
on Chongjiang Jade Street anymore.

207
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,540
See,

208
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,390
I told you,

209
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,240
this poor guy doesn't have money,

210
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,440
so he can only stay
in the blind material area,

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,120
buying materials with a low yield.

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Master Song,

213
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
please come this way.

214
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,020
The materials over there
are more expensive,

215
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,770
with a higher chance
of producing high-quality goods.

216
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,270
Let's take advantage of the money first.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Honey,

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,910
keep an eye on that bumpkin for me.

219
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,390
This kind of pauper

220
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,840
is prone to dirty tricks.

221
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,690
Got it.

222
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,720
Come here, Master Song, this way.

223
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,670
Could it really be true?

224
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,860
(I must buy this piece.)

225
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,820
(Jadeite Rough Stone)

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,270
One million.

227
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,300
You still want

228
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,270
to challenge Master Song?

229
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,930
You can't even afford

230
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,390
to pay for such a small stone, right?

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,330
Why not just go to Master Song

232
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,390
and apologize by kowtowing,

233
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,000
and then get out of Jade Street

234
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,630
to save everyone's time?

235
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,840
Can you stop buzzing around

236
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,200
like a fly?

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,390
Is there a problem with what I said?

238
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,080
This stone alone should be worth

239
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,720
one million.

240
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,080
Can you afford this money?

241
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,600
He can afford any amount of money.

242
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,560
You two

243
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
come here again!

244
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,600
The Tang Clan will cover
this million for you.

245
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,110
Ms. Tang,

246
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
don't be fooled by this pauper.

247
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,790
He was my neighbor when I was a child.

248
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,870
I know him well.

249
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,000
He doesn't know anything about stones.

250
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,910
Don't let him fool you.

251
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,750
Take that!

252
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,030
You deserve to be fooled.

253
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,270
Not enough money, right?

254
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
So miserable.

255
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,270
Do you want me to help you?

256
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
No need.

257
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
I can afford this stone myself.

258
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,240
You're not good people either.

259
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,630
Don't you

260
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,600
only have 650,500?

261
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,670
You calculated against me?

262
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,510
I really did calculate against you.

263
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,350
So what?

264
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,510
Then what about the 350,000?

265
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
Do you want it or not?

266
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,510
I...

267
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,270
How about this?

268
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,510
This 350,000 is my investment.

269
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,670
I won't take advantage of you.

270
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,480
Let' split the money averagely

271
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,670
that we make from the stone.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
What?

273
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,910
You call this not taking advantage?

274
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
This is a robbery!

275
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,350
Robbery? So what?

276
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,680
I... This...

277
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,910
He doesn't seem afraid of you.

278
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,230
No, what are you going to do again?

279
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
You, put me down.

280
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,030
Put me down!

281
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,420
(Cleaning and maintenance,
temporarily out of use)

282
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
If you don't agree,

283
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,620
I'll stab you through the hand.

284
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,120
Why does your Tang Clan
always like to fight?

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,510
Can't we just talk nicely?

286
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,150
Until your left hand is fully trained,

287
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,000
you can't...

288
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,270
You're not finished, are you?

289
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,440
What are you doing?

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,840
Where is Wan'er?

291
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,720
I've agreed to your terms.

292
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,790
That's right, little brother.

293
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,840
Don't feel like you're at a loss.

294
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,910
I'll make it up to you.

295
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,390
That... that's not necessary.

296
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,720
As long as you don't ask me

297
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,270
for Sister Wan'er's medical expenses.

298
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Medical expenses?

299
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
What did you do to Wan'er?

300
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,350
In...

301
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,480
In the bathroom.

302
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,910
Go see for yourself.

303
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,240
Made the right choice.

304
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,910
It's easy to get good material out
of this kind of desiccated skin.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Not to mention such a big piece.

306
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,390
Master Song is indeed impressive.

307
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,600
As expected of Master Song.

308
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,510
The first two pieces
have decent quality.

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,790
But this one is not good.

310
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,390
Although it's glassy jadeite

311
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,230
and green,

312
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,840
it's almost entirely cracked inside.

313
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,910
I'm afraid

314
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,700
you won't get our money back
for 10 million.
