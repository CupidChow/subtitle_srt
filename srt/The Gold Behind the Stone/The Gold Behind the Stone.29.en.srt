Jianhao.

in Jinling.

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,750
Mr. Ye,

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
go for it.

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,870
Wei Jianhao, what do you want to do?

57
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Don't act recklessly.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,030
Don't!

59
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,910
If you hurt me,

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,520
our family won't let you go.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
What have you done to me?

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470
I can't stand up now.

63
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,080
I broke your dantian with my punch.

64
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,480
Now you're just paralyzed and weak
in the lower half of your body.

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,840
If I go down a bit more,

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
you'll be unable to have descendants.

67
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,840
Aren't you afraid

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,840
of offending our Chase Rodford family?

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
Aunt Su,

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Su Lili!

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,960
Tell him

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,560
how powerful our family really is.

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
You deserve it!

74
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,310
Even if it's powerful,

75
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,840
it doesn't seem to be
as powerful as our Jianhao.

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,680
What do you want?

77
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,430
I want your Chase Rodford family

78
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,520
to never set foot in Jinling again.

79
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Impossible.

80
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,680
No one can stop

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,710

82
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,400
of our Chase Rodford family.

83
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,870
Fine.

84
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,280
I'll kill you first,

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,000
and then I'll destroy
the Chase Rodford family.

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,680
No!

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
Back or not?

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Back, I'll back off.

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,310
I promise you

90
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,080
that our family

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
will never set foot

92
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,680
in Jinling again in your lifetime.

93
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,030
Get out of Jade Street.

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,310
Get out of Huaxia!

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,150
Get out!

96
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,220
He drove Young Master Chase away.

97
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,190
We don't have to depend
on the Chase Rodford family anymore.

98
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
No more fighting.

99
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,870
He's gone.

100
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,310
Finally drove him away.

101
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,550
Jianhao.

102
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
Sister Lili.

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
- Qing'er.
- Brother!

104
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Our Su family

105
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,030
is finally saved.

106
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,080
My dear,

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
I knew you'd win.

108
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,870
That's great, Brother.

109
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,480
You've protected us all.

110
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,120
(Luckily, you were there.)

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,270
(Thank you)

112
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,870
for rescuing the Su family

113
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
and saving me.

114
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,310
It's great that I've defended

115
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,630
the Ever Realm and you're all

116
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,510
safe and sound.

117
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,390
Young Master, you're awesome.

118
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll have to tell Mr. Wei.

119
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,710
Jianhao,

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,190
thank you.

121
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,680
It's thanks to you

122
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,510
that you saved our Su family
from a crisis this time.

123
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Aunt Su,

124
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,390
you don't have to thank me.

125
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,630
I hope you can consider things

126
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,480
from Sister Wan'er's perspective

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,270
and think of her happiness more often.

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
It's my fault.

129
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,920
What are you doing here?

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,880
Wan'er,

131
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,390
I was wrong.

132
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,600
I didn't know

133
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,830
what to do before.

134
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,720
I didn't expect

135
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,600
you to have such a good boyfriend.

136
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,870
You have good taste.

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,870
So you agree?

138
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,600
Yes, of course.

139
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,310
Then I'll try my best to get him.

140
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,040
Alright.

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,390
Aunt, in fact, Wan'er and I...

142
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,510
- Grandpa!
- have already...

143
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Grandpa.

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Grandpa,

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,080
are you okay?

146
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
Brother Wei,

147
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,040
thank you

148
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,000
for not destroying me.

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Mr. Gu,

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
now that the Chase Rodford family
has left,

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,480
what will you do now?

152
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,600
I've been guarding the Ever Realm

153
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,750
for ten years.

154
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,510
It's time

155
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,070
for me to leave.

156
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,430
Where are you going?

157
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,270
To my hometown.

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,120
I haven't been back in ten years.

159
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,870
I don't even recognize my wife.

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,120
From now on,

161
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
there will be

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,630
no more Gu family

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,630
in Jade Street.

164
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Chief,

165
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,120
thanks for sparing the Gu family.

166
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,040
You'll always be my Chief.

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
Wei Jianhao has obtained

168
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,270
Black Tortoise Body.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,830
He's driven the overseas forces

170
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,630
from Chongjiang Jade Street

171
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,150
to defeat

172
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,630
the fifth realm expert.

173
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,800
That's great.

174
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,640
That's great!

175
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,330
He drove out the Chase Rodford family

176
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,070
and protected our families.

177
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,860
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

178
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,600
You rascal...

179
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,510
You're finally back alive.

180
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,240
I saw there were so many of them.

181
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,310
I was worried about you.

182
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,770
You...

183
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,510
You hid yourself quite well.

184
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,720
No one found you.

185
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,130
Shh...

186
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Jianhao,

187
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,630
it's so good

188
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,270
to see you awake.

189
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,160
Sister,

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,520
don't take

191
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
any more risks by yourself again.

192
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
Sister Lili,

193
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,360
- this time...
- Jianhao.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,840
Wan'er,

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,960
I'll go with you to the hospital
for a checkup.

196
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,350
This...

197
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,390
It's going to rain.

198
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,230
I...

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,270
I'll bring in the clothes.

200
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,630
Are you hurt?

201
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,040
Grandpa.

202
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,790
I can't believe

203
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,510
we're meeting again

204
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,720
after 15 years.

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Unexpectedly,

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
it's such a scene.

207
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Jianhao,

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
ever since

209
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,320
I found out
you'd returned to Chongjiang,

210
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,510
I've been looking forward
to your return.

211
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Today,

212
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,150
I've finally found you.

213
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,750
Come home with me.

214
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,630
The Chase Rodford family
has already left.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,900
Doesn't your Ye family

216
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,440
want to do business overseas with them?

217
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
Jianhao,

218
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,720
you've misunderstood me.

219
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,600
I was forced to seek refuge

220
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
with the Chase Rodford family.

221
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,910
It wasn't my intention.

222
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,030
And it wasn't your intention

223
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,270
to allow Qing'er
to grow up being bullied

224
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,480
in the Ye family?

225
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,000
Of course not.

226
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,870
Qing'er is also my granddaughter.

227
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,670
You two,

228
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,700
kneel down and apologize to Qing'er.

229
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,560
- Grandpa,
- Grandpa!

230
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,790
- why should we?
- Kneel down!

231
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,710
Apologize!

232
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,160
Sister

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Qing'er,

234
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm sorry.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Grandpa,

237
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
I accept their apology.

238
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,680
Why don't you

239
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
let them get up first?

240
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,750
No need.

241
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,390
Let them kneel like this.

242
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,080
It's their own fault.

243
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
Grandpa,

244
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,320
the apology has been received.

245
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,270
We are now even.

246
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,720
As for after that,

247
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
I won't go back to the Ye family.

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
Jianhao,

249
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,720
as long as you're willing
to return to the Ye family

250
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
and use your identity
as the Master of Ever Realm

251
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,390
to help the Ye family,

252
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
the Ye family

253
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
will become the top family in Jinling

254
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,080
in a matter of minutes.

255
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Of course,

256
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,030
you'll also benefit from it.

257
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,320
So that's how Mom

258
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
was used by you, right?

259
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,280
Grandpa,

260
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,720
in your opinion,

261
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,750
people are just the key

262
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,000
to unlock power and desire,

263
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,350
right?

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,320
Brother,

265
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,630
what did you say?

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
Grandpa,

267
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,720
didn't you tell me

268
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
that Mom died of illness?

269
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,390
I'm not to blame

270
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,120
for what happened to Wei Ruyi.

271
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,110
At that time,

272
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,440
the Ye family's business

273
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
could have grown rapidly,

274
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,600
but your father, that unfilial son,

275
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,240
was ungrateful and disloyal,

276
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,230
and he didn't

277
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,200
agree with me.

278
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,510
He cooperated with Wei Changming

279
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,440
and refused

280
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,240
to give the Ye family the Ever Realm.

281
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,690
Wei Changming's daughter
was married to the Ye family,

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,030
and that old rascal

283
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,870
still maintained

284
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,320
an arrogant demeanor.

285
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
That's why the Ye family pressed hard.

286
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,790
Mom had no choice

287
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,680
but to destroy

288
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,600
her Jade Buddha Hand, right?

289
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Jianhao,

290
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,390
what's the point

291
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,870
of pursuing the past?

292
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,360
Those are just

293
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,080
old grudges between Wei Changming

294
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,600
and me.

295
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Besides,

296
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,390
everything I did

297
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,000
was for the Ye family.

298
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,630
The most

299
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,120
important thing now is you.

300
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
As long as you're willing
to return to the Ye family,

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,440
you can

302
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
kick out Jianren

303
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,030
and Sijie.

304
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,510
I'll leave the Ye family

305
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,960
completely

306
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,260
in your hands.

307
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,250
Grandpa,

308
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,670
the reason I still call you Grandpa

309
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,150
is because the unfilial son
you mentioned

310
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,120
is my father.

311
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,840
You and I are related by blood.

312
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,550
But I hope you'll never

313
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,670
think of me
as a member of the Ye family again.

314
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,030
As for the Ye family,

315
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,030
there's no way I'm going back.

316
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,440
I don't believe

317
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,720
you don't have ambition.

318
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,910
The Ye family isn't a big family,

319
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,320
but it's a solid one.

320
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,080
With such a family

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,910
as your springboard,

322
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,270
what's not to like?

323
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,630
There are many ways
to realize my ambition.

324
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,520
The one you're talking about

325
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
is the one I hate the most.

326
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,200
If you truly

327
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,720
don't want to stay,

328
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,680
then Qing'er must come with me.

329
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,270
Mr. Ye!

330
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,600
I know you've been trying

331
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,000
to make up

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,320
for what you've owed Qing'er
all these years.

333
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,600
But there's still a long way to go.

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,770
Can you protect her
for the rest of her life?

335
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,910
I don't mean

336
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,870
anything by it.

337
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,030
On the contrary,

338
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,630
if she wants to,

339
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,630
I'll make her

340
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,510
the successor of the Ye family.

341
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,320
Qing'er will never go back

342
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,240
to the Ye family.

343
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,480
You haven't even asked Qing'er,

344
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,390
how do you know what she thinks?

345
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,720
Sister, look.

346
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,960
The doctor just said

347
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm really fine.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,080
You don't have to worry.

349
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,910
Our Wan'er is the best.

350
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,020
(Wei Shop)

351
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,870
Sister,

352
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
do you think

353
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,630
he will really go back to the Ye family

354
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,390
with his Grandpa?

355
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,440
Not before,

356
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,510
and even more unlikely now.

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,870
What about you, Sister?

358
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,390
Why don't we go back

359
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,240
to Tang Clan together?

360
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
Grandpa's health is not good,

361
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,000
and the Su family
has been through so much.

362
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,720
Someone needs to go back
and take responsibility.

363
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,510
Although our time at Tang Clan
was very happy,

364
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,630
Tang Clan was set up

365
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,510
to find Ever Realm.

366
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,670
Now everything has settled.

367
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,560
It's time

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,630
for Tang Clan
to return to the Su family.

369
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,740
(Wei Shop)

370
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,590
Wan'er,

371
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,440
you've been by my side since childhood.

372
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,790
More than anyone,

373
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,240
I hope you can be yourself.

374
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,520
If you don't want to go back
to the Su family, that's fine.

375
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,670
I'll take care

376
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
of Aunt Bai for you.

377
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,240
I want to follow him.

378
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,600
I'll go

379
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
wherever he goes.

380
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,920
Wei Jianhao!
