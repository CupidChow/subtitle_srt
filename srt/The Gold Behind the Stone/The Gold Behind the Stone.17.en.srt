=Episode 17=

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,390
It's that hick.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,670
Okay, I'll wait for you here.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Filthy beggar.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,670
Don't call me a beggar.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,070
I have a name.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,790
You're just a filthy beggar.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,070
You don't deserve to be here.

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,190
There you go again.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,650
It's really more annoying
than Xia Changyin.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,350
Didn't the guard stop you two

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,190
from coming in?

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,640
What are you proud of?

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Didn't you get in because your sister is

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,150
the wife of that fool

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,310
from the Su family?

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,680
What fool's wife?

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,680
Don't insult my sister.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,870
Don't you know?

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
Butler Su came to Ye family
to take her in person.

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,590
How did you manage to escape?

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,230
Didn't you ask Butler Su to save me?

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
(Is the man Qing'er is talking about)

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,230
(really Butler Su?)

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,640
You don't even know

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,230
that your sister is married to a fool,

38
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,070
yet you say you want to avenge her.

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
You are truly hypocritical.

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,480
Didn't your Ye family
stop the engagement?

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,230
Grandpa didn't either?

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,590
For that shrew Ye Qing'er,

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,710
it's already a blessing for her

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
to be married into the Su family.

45
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,640
If her fiance wasn't a fool,

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,870
would she have married
into the Su family?

47
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,480
So you go home after losing

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,870
and instead of apologizing,

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
you humiliate her in this way?

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,710
Are you crazy?

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,030
Let go of me!

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,280
How dare you attack us?

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,030
This... this is the Su family.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Bai Ge,

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,080
help me.

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,870
Brother-in-law,

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,750
I've heard for a long time
that you've already reached

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,150
the second realm at a young age,

59
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,990
awesome.

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,030
I knew you wouldn't let me go.

61
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,630
What a handsome rescue.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
You're only in the first realm,

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,870
and you're so arrogant.

64
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,800
You should be taught a lesson.

65
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,060
How dare you!

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,840
(He's not in the first realm,)

67
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,630
(but the second realm.)

68
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,800
(This young man is in the second realm,)

69
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,400
(but why can't I feel the pressure?)

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Stop it.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,560
They're Su sisters.

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,120
Who dares to use force in the Su family?

73
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,310
Tang Lili,

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
is this your place to talk?

75
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,280
This is the Su family.

76
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,470
How did you get in?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,910
You're not with some rich guy, are you?

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,520
Brother Bai,

79
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,680
why are you...?

80
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Get off of me. Go away!

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,310
How can you

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
insult Miss Su?

83
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,400
Miss Su?

84
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,150
Tang Lili and Tang Wan'er
are the Su sisters.

85
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,910
She's been with me for over two years

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,000
and I didn't even realize it.

87
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,270
It's over.

88
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,270
Grandpa said you should marry Miss Su.

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Miss Lili,

90
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,070
I really didn't know

91
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,360
that you were Miss Su.

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,270
But I've always

93
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,830
admired you in my heart.

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,480
If I remember correctly,

95
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,830
your Ye family

96
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,070
wasn't invited

97
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,240
to the banquet, right?

98
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,040
Yes, but...

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Go away!

100
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,240
Get lost.

101
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,510
So much nonsense.

102
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,910
Cousins,

103
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
long time no see.

104
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Who's your cousin?

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
Lili,

106
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,630
don't always turn me down.

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,800
You know,

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
I adored you

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
when I first met you as a child.

110
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,350
Today,

111
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,510
I've come to the Su family's
betrothal banquet

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
to show my sincerity.

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,360
Bai Ge, aren't you done yet?

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,390
For so many years,

115
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,800
if it weren't for your status
as Wan'er's cousin,

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
I would have...

117
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,070
Don't take my politeness as a blessing

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,480
and say things
like you adored me as a child.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Are you a bit too precocious?

120
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,670
My fault,

121
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,890
I was impulsive in showing my love
in a high profile

122
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
in public.

123
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,670
But Lili,

124
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
don't let that destroy

125
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,070
your feelings for me.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll tell you what.

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's have

128
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
a private chat later,

129
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,110
okay?

130
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
(What is this kid's)

131
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,830
(identity and origin?)

132
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,150
Wan'er!

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,840
Wan'er.

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,070
What took you so long?

135
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,800
I've been bullied to death.

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,830
Who... who dares?

137
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
It's him.

138
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,830
He hit me.

139
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
You're

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
doomed.

141
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,390
It's this poor hick.

142
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,360
He dared to make trouble
at the Su family banquet.

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,070
I told him I'm your best friend,

144
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
but he said

145
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,120
he doesn't take the Su family seriously.

146
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,310
Wan'er, you must beat him up for me.

147
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,190
Otherwise, I won't be done
with him today.

148
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,240
Are you mistaken?

149
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,630
Wan'er, what's wrong with you?

150
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
You used

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,750
to help me
teach others a lesson directly.

152
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,160
Are you still my best friend?

153
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,160
Did you lie to me?

154
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,630
It was the same as before.

155
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,240
You don't trust me?

156
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,110
Song Ye.

157
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,800
This is Song Ye, the most reputable

158
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
stone appraiser in Chongjiang.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Song Ye,

160
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,750
come and tell her

161
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,680
how he bullied me.

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,630
Okay, Miss.

163
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,000
This person is...

164
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,270
Isn't this Master Song?

165
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,950
How come you're working

166
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,120
for Hedong Xu family?

167
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,310
I didn't realize

168
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,830
you two were the ladies
of the Su family.

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,190
It was my oversight.

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,630
Miss Xu,

171
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
it's fine that you're making things up,

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
but if you're using this kind of person
to help you lie,

173
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,510
won't it

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
be worse?

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm not making things up.

176
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,070
Wan'er, everything I said is true.

177
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,910
Go on.

178
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,290
It's a shame that Wan'er has treated you

179
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,800
as her best friend for so many years.

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Have you been

181
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
treating me

182
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,040
as your bullying tool

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,560
all these years?

184
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,800
Wan'er, what's wrong with you today?

185
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,430
Why are you suddenly like this?

186
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,430
Because he is

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,310
not like that.

188
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
You...

189
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,630
You know each other?

190
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,480
So what?

191
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,480
Is our relationship for so many years
still no better

192
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,270
than a bumpkin like him?

193
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,920
Don't talk about him like that.

194
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,600
I'll break up with you.

195
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,070
Don't, Wan'er.

196
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,930
We've been together for so many years,

197
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,830
how can you just say that?

198
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,110
Wan'er,

199
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,240
have you been deceived by him?

200
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,670
Men like him

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
are always sweet-talking

202
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,050
and specialize in scamming young ladies
from wealthy families.

203
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,720
You have to be sober.

204
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,950
He's my boyfriend.

205
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't allow you to say that to him.

206
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,870
What?

207
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,900
Su Wan'er,

208
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
are you crazy or am I crazy?

209
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,200
If you find such a man
as your boyfriend,

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
people will look down on you.

211
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,240
You're looking down
because you're blind.

212
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,990
Go back to Xu family and let a doctor

213
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,000
check your eyes.

214
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
You made Wan'er unhappy today,

215
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,150
please get out of here

216
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,510
and don't spoil her fun.

217
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,840
So you're disrespecting the Xu family?

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,720
Xu family?

219
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,360
Go back and ask Master Xu

220
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,630
if he dares to offend me.

221
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,910
I didn't realize

222
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,200
that he'd be the son-in-law

223
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
of the Su family.

224
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,480
Son-in-law?

225
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,070
At first glance, he's a man
to live off a woman.

226
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,570
You brat,

227
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,030
don't think that if you are with Wan'er,

228
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,270
you'll be able to live a rich man's life
in the future.

229
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,840
Everyone knows

230
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,960
that Master Su's favorite is

231
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
Miss Su Lili,

232
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,400
and all the Su family's business

233
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,080
will be handed over
to her in the future.

234
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
(That's why)

235
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,440
(Su Lili is mine.)

236
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,870
He is Wan'er's boyfriend,

237
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,910
and also a friend of mine.

238
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,910
If any of you dare to speak rudely
to him again,

239
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,510
you'll all be thrown out.

240
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,710
Let's go.

241
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
Go.

242
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,270
Miss Xu...

243
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,440
Why is it that all the luck is

244
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,670
with this Ye family outcast?

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
It pissed me off.

246
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,080
So you're the Su sisters.

247
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,280
I...

248
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,720
I've been meaning

249
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,870
to tell you.

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,750
Why did you lie to me before?

251
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,630
I...

252
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,870
What's the difference?

253
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,510
It's not too late to tell you now.

254
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,790
How can it be the same?

255
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,510
We've known each other for so long.

256
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,360
But I don't even know who you are.

257
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,720
Stop being so stubborn.

258
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,910
Does it hurt you to know

259
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,390
that we're from the Su family?

260
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
You're the one who asked the Su family

261
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,080
to pick up Qing'er, right?

262
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,230
Thanks.

263
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
It's okay.

264
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,440
You're

265
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,510
Wan'er's boyfriend today,

266
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,790
so behave yourself
when you meet the elders,

267
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,320
and don't let her lose face.

268
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,030
Let's go. I'll take you to my mom.

269
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,630
Mom.

270
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,590
Aunt Bai.

271
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,750
Hello, Aunt. I'm Wei Jianhao.

272
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,870
Wan'er, come here.

273
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,030
Mom, let me introduce you, this...

274
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,200
Wan'er, what did I tell you?

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,120
Today's banquet is very important.

276
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,750
Don't let any outsiders in.

277
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
He... he's not an outsider.

278
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
He's my boyfriend.

279
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
Wan'er, don't be ridiculous.

280
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,550
You're already engaged
to the Young Master

281
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,030
of the Chase Rodford family.

282
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,750
I don't want to marry him.

283
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,630
Wan'er,

284
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,750
I'm doing this for your own good.

285
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
Do you know how many people want

286
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,910
to get close to our Su family now,

287
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,600
and go to great lengths

288
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,270
to become our Su family's son-in-law?

289
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
A poor man like this

290
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,120
is the best
at fooling little girls like you.

291
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Aunt Bai,

292
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,670
Jianhao is not that kind of person.

293
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,910
Don't think of him like that.

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Besides, it's Wan'er
who's looking for a boyfriend,

295
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,870
so let her choose the one she likes.

296
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Lili,

297
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,030
although you're not my daughter,

298
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,360
you and Wan'er are sisters

299
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,430
of the same father.

300
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,440
Even though your father has passed away,

301
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,250
you have to take care of your sister.

302
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,490
How can you bear

303
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,890
to see her jump into the fire?

304
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,910
It's none of Sister's business!

305
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,600
(It turns out they are half-sisters.)

306
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Aunt Bai,

307
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,320
by marrying Wan'er

308
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,270
to that playboy
from Chase Rodford family,

309
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
aren't you letting her
jump into the fire?

310
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,630
The Chase Rodford family

311
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,720
is the world's top consortium.

312
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
Even the Su family is nothing

313
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,270
compared to them.

314
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,390
You're comparing him

315
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,510
to the Chase Rodford family?

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,560
What a joke.

317
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,680
I don't care,

318
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,630
and I'm not afraid.

319
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,080
Don't think

320
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,170
I don't know what you're up to

321
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,480
with this betrothal banquet.

322
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,870
Let me tell you,

323
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I've already decided
on Wan'er's marriage.

324
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,190
None of you

325
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,840
can ruin it for me.

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And you,

327
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,150
if you hadn't secretly

328
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,670
urged Wan'er in the past two years

329
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,550
and taken the liberty
of bringing her to Chongjiang,

330
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,120
she would have finished

331
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,790
her engagement
with the Chase Rodford family long ago.

332
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,870
Aunt Bai,

333
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,480
Wan'er is also my sister.

334
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,240
I hope she can be happy.

335
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,870
Is it possible to be happy
with a poor boy?

336
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,910
Look at him.

337
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,160
He's meeting the elders
for the first time,

338
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,270
and he's empty-handed.

339
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,840
How can he be polite?

340
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
Aunt, I've brought a gift.

341
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,360
(Luckily, I asked Mr. Mo
to prepare a gift in advance.)

342
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
(This stone looks
like a superb piece of stone.)

343
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,200
(Mr. Mo is very thoughtful.)

344
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,030
In all my years in the Su family,

345
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,790
I've never seen

346
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,550
anything so cheap.

347
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
A gift?

348
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,320
That's what you're trying
to fool me with?

349
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,480
Aunt,

350
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
this stone may be small,

351
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,160
but its market value isn't low.

352
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
Why don't you take another look?

353
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,990
Are you saying I don't know
what I'm talking about?

354
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,080
That's not what I meant.

355
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,270
- He...
- Aunt,

356
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,910
what kind of stuff?

357
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,550
Let me have a look.

358
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,720
Ge, you're here.

359
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,200
It's just a piece of junk,

360
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
nothing to see.

361
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,510
Wait.

362
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,870
(This is the top stone
that recently sold)

363
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,080
(for over 100 million yuan
at Sotheby's.)

364
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,320
(How come this kid has it?)

365
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,110
Aunt,

366
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
since he's here to give you a gift,

367
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,940
take it whether it's good or bad,

368
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,120
and show him mercy.

369
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,270
Ge, why do you speak for outsiders too?

370
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,670
Are you still a member
of the Bai family?

371
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,510
I...

372
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
Young man,

373
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,390
don't you understand what I'm saying?

374
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,270
I'm telling you,

375
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,150
don't bother my daughter again!

376
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,510
No, Aunt.

377
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,470
In the Su family,

378
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,360
there's nothing I can't do.

379
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,380
(Such a good stone.)

380
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,510
(Mr. Mo, you're too generous.)

381
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,240
(I should have left it to Black Tortoise
to exchange for energy.)

382
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,510
Mom, you've gone too far!

383
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,110
Aunt Bai,

384
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,240
it's a token of his appreciation.

385
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,550
Aren't you going too far?

386
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,360
How dare you accuse me

387
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,910
of something so trivial?

388
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,750
Aunt,

389
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,080
this is a top-grade
imperial green jade stone

390
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,150
that is auctioned off
for 100 million yuan!

391
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,750
You're giving someone

392
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,910
a gift worth 100 million?
