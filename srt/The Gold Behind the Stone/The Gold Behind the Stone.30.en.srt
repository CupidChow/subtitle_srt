=Episode 30=

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
Brother.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Qing'er,

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
are you still awake this late?

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm hungry.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
Want to eat?

18
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,950
I remember when I was little,

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,460
Mom used to take us

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,540
and roast sweet potatoes
in the Ye family's backyard.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,120
I remember once,

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,870
we even burned the lawn.

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,550
Yes, indeed.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
At that time,

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
you were so scared
that hid in Mom's arms,

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,640
crying loudly

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,000
and clutching her jade bracelet.

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,710
She had no choice,

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,280
so she searched through

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,230
the pile of sweet potatoes

31
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,680
and coaxed you

32
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,040
to find you the sweetest one

33
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,150
in the world.

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,950
It was really sweet.

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,280
Honestly,

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,710
I haven't eaten

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,310
such a sweet one since that time.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Qing'er,

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,510
I really regret

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,430
that I didn't come to you earlier

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,560
and take you away

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,950
from the Ye family.

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,920
It doesn't matter.

44
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,480
From the moment I heard

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,310
you'd returned to Chongjiang,

46
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,840
I knew you'd come back for me.

47
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,870
Brother.

48
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,870
I've decided

49
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,960
to go back to the Ye family.

50
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,870
Why?

51
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,630
You know,

52
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,640
Grandpa only cares
about the Ye family's interests.

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,870
If it weren't for

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,310
the Wei bloodline of both of us,

55
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,560
he would never

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
have shown up at this place today.

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,870
I have no intention of believing him.

58
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,520
I just don't want

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
to be weak like I was before

60
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,870
and let people bully me.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,470
Moreover, Grandpa is right.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,870
You can't,

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,560
and I don't want you
to protect me forever.

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
Since he gave me

65
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,750
this chance,

66
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,310
he can't take it back.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,310
Maybe one day,

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,150
I'll be the next head

69
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,520
of the Ye family.

70
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,630
Have you made up your mind?

71
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,030
Okay.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,910
I'll support you

73
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,430
in whatever you decide.

74
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,310
However,

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,120
if you have any problems,

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,910
come to me.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
I know.

78
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,300
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

79
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,630
I thought this time,

80
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,430
we'd be together forever.

81
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,310
Who wants to be with you all the time?

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,630
If the three sisters-in-law
get into a fight,

83
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,240
I won't know who to help first.

84
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,150
Brother,

85
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,470
I've figured it out.

86
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,630
It's better to take the initiative

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
to fight for what you want.

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,430
I hope you'll do the same, Brother.

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,310
By the way,

90
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,560
when I came here just now,

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,630
I saw Sister-in-law Lili
go to your room.

92
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,190
She should be preparing

93
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,640
to say something to you.

94
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,260
(Chongjiang Jade Street)

95
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,860
(Wei Shop)

96
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,600
- Have you got the chopsticks?
- Here...

97
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,560
Here you are.

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,260
Here.

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,720
- Coming.
- Just some, don't drink too much.

100
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,030
Everyone, please sit down.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
Finally, I'm not cooking today.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,070
Since you guys moved in,

103
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,360
I've had to cook
for several people every day.

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm almost a nanny.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,880
Changyin,

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,190
why don't you go home?

107
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,420
I've already taken back the shop.

108
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,510
Do you still want to stay here?

109
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,720
I have nowhere else to go.

110
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,160
I don't have a home

111
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,880
other than this shop.

112
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,480
Sister-in-law, what about your family?

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm an orphan.

114
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,120
My parents died a long time ago.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Didn't Uncle and Aunt Xia go abroad?

116
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,680
They went

117
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,680
to Mian with Grandpa Wei

118
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
and had

119
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,120
an accident there.

120
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,070
Grandpa Wei wanted to make it up to me,

121
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,240
so he engaged me

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,270
to Jianhao.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,950
So that's why Grandpa

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
got us engaged

125
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,040
and gave you such an important shop

126
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,510
as a betrothal gift.

127
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,800
Then I'd better

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
leave this shop to you.

129
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,350
Really?

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,750
Everyone heard it.

131
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,950
Don't go back on your word.

132
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,190
Is what you just said

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,950
all true?

134
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,160
Alright, let's not talk
about these sad things.

135
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's eat first.

136
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,120
The food is getting cold.

137
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,120
Let me mention

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,120
that today is actually
a farewell dinner.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,660
Qing'er is returning
to the Ye family tomorrow.

140
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,430
Let's have a toast.

141
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
Alright.

142
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,400
- Come on.
- Come on.

143
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,270

144
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,560

if you miss me,

149
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,990
remember to visit me
at the Ye family anytime.

150
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,560
But this time,

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,680
don't make me wait another 15 years.

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
After you return to the Ye family,

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
if those two siblings

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
dare to bully you again...

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll beat them up for you.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
They won't.

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Now they all know

158
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,720
I have such a powerful Brother

159
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,750
and so many

160

They'll definitely run away
when they see me now.

162
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,160
That's right.

163
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,560
When Qing'er becomes
the head of the Ye family,

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I, as...

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,120
I'll be able to benefit a bit.

166

Do I have the right
to come over for dinner?

You're late, drink first.

you can't leave.

- No.
- Drink up!

Drink more.

190
