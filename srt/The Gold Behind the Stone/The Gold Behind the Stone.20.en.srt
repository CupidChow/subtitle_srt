13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,600
He's actually the heir
to the Jade Buddha Hand?

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,230
Dad,

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,710
why didn't you tell me earlier?

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,710
If I had told you earlier,

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
wouldn't you have kicked him out

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,350
for the Bai family?

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,070
You think I don't know

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,200
what you're planning?

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,520
Dad,

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,400
I want the Su family
and the Bai family to get married,

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,590
so that we can strengthen our ties.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,590
But I'm not just doing it
for the Bai family,

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,230
it's also for the good of the Su family.

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,680
For the Su family?

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Do you know why I had

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,950
to bring Wei Jianhao here,

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,840
and why I had to get Ever Realm?

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Over the years,

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,200
overseas forces

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,870
have continued to encroach
on the major families of Jinling.

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,680
The Chase Rodford family,

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,790
as a top overseas family,

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,430
has always been coveting the Su family.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,920
Recently, we found out

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,930
that the few major families that were
originally dependent on the Su family

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,640
have also become
rebellious and defective.

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,000
Now if our Su family can't get help

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,870
from the Wei family

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,590
and the Ever Realm,

42
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,280
it won't be far from collapsing.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,480
Dad, it won't happen.

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,350
Don't worry.

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,790
Young Master Chase has already agreed
to get engaged to Wan'er,

46
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,470
so Chase Rodford family and Su family
will become in-laws.

47
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,430
How could he possibly
go against his in-laws?

48
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,470
Moreover,

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
my brother is
the head of the Bai family.

50
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,520
Even if all the other families
have defected,

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,590
it's absolutely impossible
for our Bai family.

52
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Impossible?

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,150
Then why didn't any
of the three heads of families

54
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,030
come to the betrothal banquet today?

55
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,750
Instead, only those juniors outside

56
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,910
were there to make trouble.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Do you think

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,750
they still regard the Su family
with any respect now?

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,870
How could this happen?

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Dad.

61
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,030
So,

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,590
you should trust my words even more.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,770
You can hasten to promise the Su family
and the Bai family another marriage.

64
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,190
If you ally with the Bai family,

65
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,190
the other families

66
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,730
will definitely return
to support our Su family.

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,400
In the years
since you joined the Su family,

68
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,590
you've worked
for the Bai family's benefit,

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,960
taken care of their mess,

70
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,280
treated Lili harshly,

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,280
and acted as a bully everywhere.

72
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm not completely

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,030
unaware of these things.

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,280
Because you are a member
of the Bai family,

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,000
many times as long as
you don't go too far,

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,310
I just turn a blind eye.

77
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,840
But I didn't expect

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
to let you become
even more stupid and ignorant.

79
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,520
You're harming the Su family!

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,240
Dad, how could I harm the Su family?

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,900
By messing with
the Chase Rodford family,

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,390
you're inviting trouble into our home.

83
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,470
By indulging the Bai family to profit,

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,150
you're raising a tiger
to court disaster.

85
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,750
By driving away Wei Jianhao,

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,590
you're destroying
the Su family's last lifeline.

87
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,750
Impossible!

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,560
Young Master Chase is a nobleman
of such a big family,

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,570
so it's impossible for him
to go back on his word.

90
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,470
Besides,

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,620
my brother

92
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,120
wouldn't treat me like this either.

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,710
You still believe them even now?

94
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,080
When you come to your senses,

95
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,910
you'll regret

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
what you did

97
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,910
to Wei Jianhao today.

98
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,080
What kind of person is that Wei?

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Dad,

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,840
you're the one who's wrong.

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,430
When I become
Young Master Chase's mother-in-law,

102
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,520
you'll thank me

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,840
for making the right choice
for the Su family.

104
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,090
Master,

105
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,800
the Chase Rodford family is here.

106
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,790
Young Master Chase.

107
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,480
Third realm?

108
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,230
Mr. Su.

109
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,240
Young Master Chase,

110
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,750
is there something you need?

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,160
Mr. Su, you're joking.

112
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,040
I should be the star of Miss Wan'er's

113
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,830
betrothal banquet today.

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,950
Dad, I told you,

115
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,240
Young Master Chase truly wants

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,390
to marry our Su family.

117
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,830
Is the real purpose
of your Chase Rodford family

118
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,830
to join hands with the Su family,

119
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,630
or do you have other intentions?

120
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,720
What makes you think that?

121
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I truly want to marry Miss Wan'er.

122
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,190
If I have other plans,

123
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,190
then I hope

124
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,600
that after we marry,

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
we can work together

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,630
for a great cause.

127
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,750
Pursuing a great cause

128
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,000
or aiming for Ever Realm?

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,160
If we marry,

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,430
we will be one family.

131
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,100
Shared resources

132
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,430
will make us

133
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,120
stronger together.

134
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,310
Do you understand?

135
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,070
Dad, it's true.

136
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,680
As long as
Young Master Chase marries Wan'er,

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
we will become one family.

138
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,990
With the influence
of the Chase Rodford family,

139
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,560
they will surely help our Su family

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,950
rise to the next level.

141
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,190
Young Master Chase,
you can't go back on your words.

142
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,750
No need to say more.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
I won't agree.

144
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,070
I already have a suitable candidate

145
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,120
for Wan'er's engagement.

146
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,470
Dad,

147
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,040
I won't agree

148
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,830
with that poor boy you're talking about.

149
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,830
Mr. Su,

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,070
do you disdain

151
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,040
our Chase Rodford family?

152
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,920
How could we dare?

153
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,630
It's just that our Su family

154
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,630
is no match for your family.

155
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
Therefore,

156
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,320
Butler...

157
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,390
You've invited me here,

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
and you want to send me away

159
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
with a no.

160
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
How can you do that?

161
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,560
Mrs. Su,

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
do you agree?

163
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,240
You're right.

164
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,590
Dad,

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Wan'er is my daughter.

166
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,480
I'll decide on her marriage.

167
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,190
You're not in charge of the Su family!

168
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,240
Ask them to leave!

169
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,590
Poison King.

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,070
How dare you show off in the Su family?

171
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,920
You've just entered the third realm,

172
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,360
yet you're looking for death?

173
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,510
Crane Roar in the Sky!

174
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
What's going on?

175
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,830
Where is my power of the Realm?

176
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,110
You...

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,390
Did you do it a long time ago?

178
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,430
After being poisoned
by my Silver-ringed Sea Snake,

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm afraid no one

180
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,430
in the world
can still mobilize their power.

181
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,240
You're

182
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,240
the Deep Sea Poison King.

183
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,560
If you try to mobilize your power
to cure the poison,

184
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,270
it will only make the poison

185
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,720
spread faster throughout your body.

186
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,720
Just now, I was just playing around,

187
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,350
but this is

188
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,030
the real fight.

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,720
I can feel the pressure.

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,320
You're at the peak of the third realm?

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,630
I'm almost invincible at the same level.

192
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,440
Do you really intend

193
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
to make a move

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,480
in our Su family?

195
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Mr. Su,

196
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,720
it's just a bit of sparring

197
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,270
among subordinates.

198
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,670
No need to make a fuss.

199
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,600
However,

200
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,480
after all, it's still my men

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,550
who didn't strike lightly,

202
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,480
so I apologize in advance.

203
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,710
You...

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,270
You poisoned

205
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,000
me too?

206
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,670
Dad!

207
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,600
What's wrong with you?

208
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
You...

209
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,200
It was an accident.

210
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Mr. Su,

211
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,550
how could I hurt my own family?

212
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,870
If you agree to the marriage now,

213
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
I'll hand over the antidote

214
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,550
right away.

215
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,030
Don't even think about it!

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,670
Our Huaxia industry

217
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,790
won't fall into the hands

218
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,840
of your foreign forces.

219
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
That would truly be

220
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
a great pity.

221
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,570
It seems that even Butler Su
is no match for him,

222
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,200
it's too reckless for you
to rush over like this.

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Even if we can't win, we must fight.

224
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
How dare they poison Grandpa!

225
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,770
The only one
who can save the Su family now

226
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,630
is Wei Jianhao.

227
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,670
He shouldn't be far away.

228
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,240
You go find him. I'll buy some time.

229
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
Mom invited them here.

230
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Leave this to me.

231
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
Go!

232
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,590
Wan'er!

233
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,530
Mr. Mo, you can go home first.

234
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
I have other things to do.

235
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,870
Young Master, when I get home,
I'll think of a way

236
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,790
to help you

237
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,920
deal with your mother-in-law.

238
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,030
At worst, we can give her
a few more stones.

239
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
No need.

240
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,510
Anyway, I'm not going back.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
What about the Su sisters?

242
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,790
You're not thinking about them either?

243
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,510
I don't think

244
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,960
I'm a good match for them.

245
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,660
I came here

246
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,960
to pretend to be her boyfriend,

247
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
but her mom doesn't like me,

248
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
and now I've offended them.

249
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,840
If I stay,

250
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,270
I'll only be causing more trouble.

251
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Young Master,

252
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,070
you should learn

253
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,670
from your Grandpa.

254
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,270
He has a way of charming girls.

255
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,650
Not to mention the sisters,

256
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,120
even when faced with a group of girls,

257
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,080
he can handle them with ease.

258
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,140
Every woman

259
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,270
loves him passionately.

260
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,120
My Grandpa is indeed
an expert in romance?

261
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,270
Don't say I said that.

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Not me, okay?

263
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,670
Mr. Mo...

264
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,890
Is there anything
I don't know about my Grandpa?

265
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,910
Take your time.

266
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,390
Grandpa is really something.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
He's always acting...

268
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
Wei Jianhao!

269
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,440
Sister Lili, why did you come out?

270
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,510
Come back with me!

271
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm not going back.

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,630
Those ladies and gentlemen inside
are all snobs.

273
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,020
I can't help it
if I stay a minute longer.

274
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,030
- Come over here!
- I won't.

275
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
Don't force me.

276
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,360
I won't go back even if I die.

277
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,840
Anyone can be the son-in-law.

278
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,870
Wan'er is in danger!

279
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,670
What did you say?

280
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,120
The Chase Rodford family has brought

281
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,240
an expert in the third realm.

282
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,100
Grandpa has been poisoned.

283
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,510
Wan'er is simply no match for him.

284
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,390
Why don't you start with this sentence?

285
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,750
Don't touch him!

286
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,150
I'm covered in poison

287
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,670
and you dare to touch me?

288
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,030
Old guy,

289
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,630
I'll beat you to death.

290
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,750
Wan'er!

291
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Wan'er.

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Wan'er,

293
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
are you okay?

294
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
Young Master Chase!

295
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,960
Young Master Chase,
how could you do that to Wan'er?

296
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Aunt Su,

297
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,630
don't worry.

298
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,030
The Poison King has only
temporarily controlled Wan'er.

299
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,390
There won't be any problems.

300
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,230
Mr. Su,

301
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,240
can I marry Miss Wan'er now?

302
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,960
Don't dream of it!

303
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,420
You...

304
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
You're courting death.

305
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,200
Wei!

306
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
Sister Wan'er!

307
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,680
- Wan'er!
- Sister Wan'er.

308
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,670
Wan'er, are you okay?

309
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,780
Whether you're alright or not,

310
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,060
I'll help you get back

311
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,080
whoever hurt you.

312
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,150
Wan'er!

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
Don't touch Wan'er!

314
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,000
Wan'er, are you okay?

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
Wan'er.

316
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,220
He is the Deep Sea Poison King.

317
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,470
He's a poison master

318
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,720
at the peak of the third realm.

319
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,840
Be careful.

320
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,360
Go.

321
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,630
Stop dawdling?

322
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm just letting you,
the Aquaman, live a little longer.

323
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm the Deep Sea Poison King,

324
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
not the Aquaman.

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
What's the difference?

326
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,720
Aren't you just a more cunning Aquaman?

327
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,670
And with poison!

328
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,440
Forgetfulness Belcheri!

329
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,030
You've reached

330
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,870
the third realm at such a young age.

331
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,910
Explode!

332
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,540
Truly worthy of the peak
of the third realm.

333
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,440
Wei,

334
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,670
the toxins of the Deep Sea Poison King

335
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
can accumulate within your body.

336
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,240
Once all five toxins are gathered,

337
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,240
they will detonate inside your body,

338
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,000
killing you instantly.

339
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,000
So what if you know?

340
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,240
You can't hide from it.

341
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,550
Am I poisoned?

342
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't feel anything.

343
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,440
No feeling?

344
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,270
You'll feel it in a minute.

345
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,600
What kind of lousy skill is this?

346
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll just kill you now.

347
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,670
