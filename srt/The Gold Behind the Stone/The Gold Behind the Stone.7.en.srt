13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Some things can't be discussed
over the phone.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,560
So he will tell you some information.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
If you feel something,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
don't tell anyone,

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
even the people you trust the most.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,960
So secretive?

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,710
If you don't want to end up

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,310
like your mom,

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,950
just remember what I said.

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,510
Grandpa, what do you mean?

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,580
What does my mom's death

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,040
have to do with the Jade Buddha Hand?

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
Is it the Ye family...?

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,200
It's a feud of the past generation.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
You don't need to know.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm tied up with matters

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,430
and can't return immediately,

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
but you must promise me.

31
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,710
Did you hear that?

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
Okay.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,840
I got it.

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,550
Mom!

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,910
Jianhao.

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,710
- Jianhao...
- Mom!

37
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,430
Mom, what's wrong?

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Mom.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,920
Mom!

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,760
What's wrong with you?

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,430
Mom.

42
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,480
Mom!

43
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,350
Mom,

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,870
what's wrong?

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,970
It's all my fault.

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
I shouldn't have agreed

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,430
to let you meet them.

48
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,750
Dad,

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,680
this is my own decision.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,710
I just want

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Jianhao and Qing'er

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,560
to grow up safely and peacefully.

53
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,310
Mom.

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,590
Mom!

55
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,710
Mom!

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,830
Wei Jianhao,

57
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,150
you've had your day.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,190
With no power or influence,

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
you dare to be reckless on Jade Street?

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
You've finally eaten your own fruit,
haven't you?

61
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,470
Song Ye,

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,310
you lost the bet last time

63
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,310
and you haven't knelt
and kowtowed to me yet.

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
You're like this.

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
How dare you be arrogant!

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Young Master.

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
Mr. Mo,

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,150
did you mistake me for someone else?

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Young Master?

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,030
Teacher, what are you doing?

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,430
You lost the bet.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,680
Aren't you going to kneel and apologize?

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Teacher,

74
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,310
I don't understand.

75
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,870
Do you want to defect?

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
Got it.

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,470
- Teacher...
- Apologize to Young Master.

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,470
Go away.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
I...

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,960
Mr. Mo,

81
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,040
you must have mistaken me
for someone else.

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm not the Young Master you mentioned.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,430
It was your grandfather who sent me.

84
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,110
Grandpa?

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,310
So he sent you to remind me

86
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,360
not to use my right hand?

87
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes.

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
He knew

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
the Ye family would find someone
to test you

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,720
to see if you're the Jade Buddha Hand,

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,510
so he sent me to assist and protect you.

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,920
It's my fault for failing

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,870
to fulfill Mr. Wei's promise.

94
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,710
No...

95
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,270
Of course, it's not your fault.

96
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,120
It's me who didn't listen to your advice

97
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,430
and acted on my own.

98
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,510
Now that your right hand is crippled,

99
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,120
you can only use your left hand

100
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,750
to suppress the methods
of the Ye family.

101
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,560
Left hand?

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,920
I triggered it unconsciously before,

103
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,720
but it's uncontrollable.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,160
If I can't use it tomorrow...

105
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,510
Find the Ever Realm

106
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,480
and train your left hand.

107
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,720
What do you mean?

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,630
Ever Realm?

109
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,070
What kind of place is that?

110
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,070
All I know is

111
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,040
that the Jade Street used to be

112
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,120
a deserted mountainous area

113
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,070
where the Ever Realm was located.

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,870
Later, the Wei ancestors
turned this place

115
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,510
into the Jade Street.

116
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,720
The entrance to Ever Realm

117
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,120
is buried somewhere on the Jade Street.

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,040
I don't know

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,610
the rest.

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,310
That's all Mr. Wei told me.

121
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,270
He asked me to return to Chongjiang
and tell you.

122
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,870
Where can I find it?

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,430
What is this?

124
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,240
A share transfer agreement.

125
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,040
Now you own 40%

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,270
of our Tang Clan's shares,

127
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,390
which is really unfair

128
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,040
to us,

129
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,680
so I want to redeem those 40%.

130
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,110
Tang Lili,

131
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,630
how dare you talk to me like this?

132
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,680
It's because Wei Jianhao

133
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,240
that you dare
to talk to me now, isn't it?

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Sort of.

135
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
Then I really overestimated
your ambition.

136
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,360
You give up the support of our Ye family

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
for that pauper?

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,560
You didn't overestimate.

139
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,630
My ambition is greater than you think.

140
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,630
That's why I chose
to support Wei Jianhao.

141
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,630
Believe it or not,
I'll make your Tang Clan

142
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,720
have no place on Jade Street
within a month.

143
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,670
I believe.

144
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,040
But I'm not afraid.

145
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,040
Earlier, you secretly supported
our Tang Clan,

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,720
the real purpose is
to monopolize the business

147
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,920
of the whole Jade Street
through Tang Clan, right?

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,000
But what we signed before seems

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,510
to be an implicit contract.

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,950
If I take this contract

151
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,630
and show it to Mr. Ye,

152
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,720
what do you think he'll do

153
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
with your private account?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,920
Redeeming our shares is the best

155
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,600
I can do it for you.

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
You...

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Then we have a deal.

158
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,150
By the way,

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,830
let me remind you.

160
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,680
Don't try any more dirty tricks

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,430
on Wei Jianhao tomorrow,

162
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,000
or you won't even

163
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,510
get the ransom.

164
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,070
Do you really gamble

165
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,950
with the survival of Tang Clan
for Wei Jianhao?

166
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,390
I don't want to work with a guy like you

167
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,720
who only knows how to cheat people.

168
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,950
(I've been searching all night.)

169
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,920
(How can I find the entrance)

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,160
(to the Ever Realm
with such an inconspicuous hint?)

171
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,110
Chief,

172
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,320
it's already daylight,

173
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,510
why are you just back?

174
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,350
Come and have...

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
breakfast.

176
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,310
Have you changed your mind?

177
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,510
So attentive all of a sudden.

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
You stayed up all night

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
waiting for me to have breakfast?

180
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,670
Did you poison my food?

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,850
I worked on it all night.

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,240
I even cut my hand.

183
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
Look.

184
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,080
Take a look.

185
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,480
Try it quickly.

186
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,470
Here you are.

187
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,030
Don't move, let me do it.

188
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,310
Don't hide.

189
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,260
I saw everything.

190
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,670
Why are you still stealing stones
from the basement?

191
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,990
Where is Gu Dan?

192
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,510
He's gone for a drink.

193
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,910
He's not in the basement!

194
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,870
I'll cut out a passageway

195
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,550
so I can get the stones out.

196
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,240
(Why is it so hard in here?)

197
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,120
(Even the drill can't get through.)

198
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
Gu Dan is not here.

199
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
- He's not here!
- What are you doing?

200
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,750
Chief!

201
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,720
He's not here!

202
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,240
I...

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Chief,

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,150
do you find it particularly

205
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,320
poorly ventilated in here?

206
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
- It's really stuffy.
- Yes.

207
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,150
- I want to dig a hole overnight.
- Yes...

208
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,670
Let you get some fresh air.

209
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,960
Right.

210
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,670
No need.

211
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll say it again.

212
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,750
Don't come here in the future.

213
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,750
Okay.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,080
You stupid woman.

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,510
I told you not to take that.

216
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
- But you took so much.
- Don't say.

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,910
You just don't listen.

218
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,080
Good for nothing but ruining things.

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,960
Isn't this for the sake
of our life together?

220
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,120
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

221
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,270
Where is this place?

222
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,750
What kind of place is this?

223
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,910
So many stones.

224
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,270
Grandpa's stash?

225
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,320
Are they also invaluable jade stones?

226
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,630
(Now I can't tell
even if a piece of imperial green is)

227
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,840
(in front of me.)

228
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,230
Grandpa,

229
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,910
why do I have to touch these stones

230
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,320
with my right hand every day?

231
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,870
This is to let your right hand

232
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,360
absorb the energy of the stones

233
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,320
until you can discern the characteristics
inside the stones.

234
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,870
(The Jade Buddha Hand is trained
by touching stones,)

235
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,360
(maybe the left hand
can be trained too.)
