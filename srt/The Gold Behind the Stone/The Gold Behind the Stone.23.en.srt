that our cultivation together
will not only cure the poison,

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course, I remember.

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,030
In order to help me cure the poison,

77
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,250
you were willing
to cultivate together with me.

79
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,030
It's okay.

80
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,600

You...

95
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,890
It must be because he and Wan'er
were cultivating together,

96
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,440
so he barely remembered Wan'er.

97
