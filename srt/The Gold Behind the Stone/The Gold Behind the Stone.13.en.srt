13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,190
How is that possible?

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,110
You're only in the first realm.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
Brother.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,400
Chief!

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
Still want

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,680
to fight?

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,280
You can fight me

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,510
when you're stronger.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,040
Go back and tell Mr. Ye

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,350
that Qing'er will never return
to the Ye family.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,710
Young Master.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,920
They've gone.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,790
Why don't they show up?

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,120
- Wei Jianhao.
- Brother, how are you?

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,000
- Chief.
- Quick, go inside.

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,480
- Be careful.
- Slow down.

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,070
- Hurry, be careful.
- Slow down.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Hurry.

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,060
(Wei Shop)

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,710
Brother,

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
are you in pain?

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
It's just a small injury.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,640
It's nothing.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Don't worry,

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,150
it's almost healed.

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,240
You call this small injury?

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,470
Chief,

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
you're playing it cool with your life.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,750
I'm really worried.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,430
You're even coughing up blood.

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,470
Hurry and go to the hospital with me.

44
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,960
Why are you worried?

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,870
I'm just concerned.

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,540
Aren't you worried about him?

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,710
(How dare)

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,430
(the Judge hit him so hard!)

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Brother,

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,590
thank you.

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,310
I'm your brother.

52
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,940
What are you thanking me for?

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,840
I need to heal him,

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,100
it's not convenient to be seen.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,400
All of you

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
can go rest now.

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,470
I'll take care of this.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,310
Do you know how to heal?

59
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,240
My master is a miracle healer.

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Trust me.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,120
We don't know if you can heal him.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680
We want to watch.

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,400
Do you want to see him naked?

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Can you heal him?

65
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,470
Should we go to the hospital?

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,590
Trust me.

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Let's go.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,030
Let's go...

69
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,630
- Go!
- Don't push me.

70
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,750
Go on.

71
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,310
Mr. Mo.

72
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,850
- Take me to the basement.
- Okay.

73
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,270
Come.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,470
(There's a basement here.)

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
(Wei Jianhao is going)

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,120
(to the basement to heal his injuries.)

77
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
(The entrance to Ever Realm)

78
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,840
(should be down there.)

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Young Master,

80
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,710
I'll stand guard up there,

81
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,630
don't worry.

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,560
Why haven't I been sucked in yet?

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,510
Is it

84
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,630
because my Jade Buddha hand is crippled?

85
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
That's not right.

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,720
The last time I was crippled,
it was my right hand as well.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
The entrance to Ever Realm

88
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,260
can only be opened by the bloodline

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,480
of the Jade Buddha Hand's heir.

90
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,460
(Wei Shop)

91
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,720
Indeed, it's the aura of Ever Realm.

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Qing'er,

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,830
you came in a hurry.

94
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm sure you didn't bring anything.

95
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,310
You can wear this pajama for now.

96
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,080
Tomorrow,
I'll take you to buy a new one.

97
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,110
Thank you,

98
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,350
Sister-in-law.

99
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm not.

100
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,160
I just saw you always
protecting me in front.

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,510
You were more nervous than I was
when my brother was hurt.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,140
I thought you two were already...

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,910
Your brother hasn't
taken a liking to me yet.

104
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,910
Let's go.

105
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,430
I'll show you your room.

106
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
Brother Dan,

107
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,310
think about it.
The bumpkin and Ye Qing'er are siblings.

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Isn't he the Young Master
of the Ye family?

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,760
Then why do the Ye family's men
still dare to hurt him?

110
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,620
Now you know he's the Young Master
of the Ye family.

111
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,240
You regret calling off
the engagement, don't you?

112
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,250
I...

113
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,910
Not at all.

114
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
What kind of person do you think I am?

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,630
He was definitely kicked out
by the Ye family.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Otherwise, why wouldn't he
dare to go back?

117
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,830
You want to marry him
as the Ye family's Young Mistress?

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,800
Keep dreaming!

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
You...

120
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,830
So annoying.

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,830
Who wants to marry him?

122
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,120
(Even if he was kicked out,)

123
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,630
(he's still a member of the Ye family.)

124
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,390
(He's still better than Gu Dan.)

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
The Ye family won't let it go.

126
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,950
Wei Jianhao can beat them off this time,

127
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,970
but he may not be able
to do it next time.

128
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,480
We need to find a way
to get into the basement

129
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,870
and move all the stones out.

130
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,430
This room belongs to Qing'er now.

131
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,270
Get out.

132
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,310
Why should we give you the room?

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,720
We're already sharing one room.

134
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,750
Where else can we move to?

135
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,310
I don't care.

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,870
You two can go wherever you want.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
You...

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,720
Should we give up?

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
It's okay.

140
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,960
Alright.

141
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,270
It's up to you.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Let's go.

143
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,720
- No way.
- Let's go.

144
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,390
What are you doing?

145
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
No way!

146
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,680
What are you doing?

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,870
Why should we give it to them?

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,800
There's hope for us
to live in the basement.

149
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
That's not right.

150
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,000
Last time, I just touched it,

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
and the injuries healed when I went out.

152
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,350
Change one.

153
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,630
Why is there a tortoise here?

154
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,910
There is also a...

155
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,720
Who is the tortoise?

156
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,790
You are the tortoise,

157
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,030
you brat.

158
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,870
Who is it?

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,670
Why are you insulting me?

160
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,670
You called me a tortoise.

161
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,510
Is it wrong for me to call you a brat?

162
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,320
You're just a tortoise,

163
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,360
with a snake on the body.

164
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,510
It's called Black Tortoise.

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,120
Have you heard of Black Tortoise?

166
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,080
You are illiterate.

167
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,120
Black Tortoise?

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,150
Vermilion Bird's husband.

169
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,390
Black Tortoise?

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
Black Tortoise!

171
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Black...

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,440
Senior.

173
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,750
Senior?

174
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,840
Senior, are you still there?

175
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,120
Did I say something wrong again?

176
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,670
You really are

177
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,120
the grandson
of that rascal Wei Changming.

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,080
You piss me off to no end.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,510
You know my Grandpa?

180
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,840
I'd know him if he was a ghost.

181
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,870
Did he offend you?

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Can you not irritate me

183
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
with Vermilion Bird and your Grandpa?

184
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,320
It sounds like you have
some stories to tell.

185
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,150
Talking about them brings tears.

186
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,030
I don't have time to chat with you.

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
I can't say much,

188
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
and I have to be dormant again.

189
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,670
Senior, are you going to sleep now?

190
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,240
I have to go to recover from injuries,

191
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
you fool.

192
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,480
How come you and your Grandpa
have such different ways

193
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,750
of making people angry?

194
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,320
Senior, are you injured?

195
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,910
I've been recovering
on the Blue Planet for 100 years.

196
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
Tell me,

197
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,030
how do you want me to help you?

198
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,240
You can help me?

199
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,840
Then my injury...

200
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,670
If you touch

201
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
the snake head behind me,

202
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,200
I'll give you some energy.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
Then I'll recover?

204
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,150
How do you think
you recovered last time?

205
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,870
Last time,

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,750
I touched that stone,

207
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,720
not only did I recover from my injury,

208
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,750
but also my left hand
had its powers activated,

209
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,910
and I reached the first realm.

210
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,510
That's what I did with the stone.

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,870
It took a lot of effort.

212
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,550
Can't you just take a few more steps

213
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,440
and come over to touch this snake head?

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,870
Thank you, Senior.

215
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,510
I don't know how to repay you.

216
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,200
Then just collect more jade.

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Put them in the basement.

218
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,670
The better the jade,

219
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,030
the more energy I will give you
in the future.

220
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,630
Is that possible?

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
No wonder my Grandpa

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,910
put so many stones in the basement.

223
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Alright,

224
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm tired.

225
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,960
After you touch the snake head,
just leave.

226
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,030
Thank you, Senior.

227
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,870
I'll do my best.

228
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,550
You seem more sincere than your Grandpa.

229
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,080
I'll give you some extra energy
to help you break through.
