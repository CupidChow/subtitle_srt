♫  I still wonder why  ♫

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,400
​♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:14,270
♫  Why I don't want to let go of your memories?  ♫

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,460
 Uncle, you said you'd protect me until the very end. 

14
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,680
 You promised me! 

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,150
   

16
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,450
 Everything has its rules. 

17
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,050
 For example, only the ones chosen by the camera have a seal on them. 

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,690
 You brought a camera when you came here. 

19
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,310
 You really don't remember where you got it? 

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,660
 Didn't you see the owner of the camera? 

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,530
 I don't know. 

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,890
 Just once. Just this once. 

23
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,570
 I'll send her away and close. 

24
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,540
 Look over here. I'll take one. 

25
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,480
 One more time. 

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,530
 When the shutter closes for the second time, the dead either leave for the netherworld or... 

27
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,780
 The gate of the dead closed. 

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,520
 Why won't you leave? 

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,510
 Little kid. 

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,560
 Are you not dead, yet? 

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,200
 - Are you a living soul? 
 - What's a living soul? 

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,570
 Geez. What's this? 

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,840
 Is it okay if I don't go, if I am ? 

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,510
 How do you send a living soul away? 

35
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,950
 Hey. 

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,840
 You'd better put that down. 

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,570
 Little kid, how come you... 

38
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,870
 And rules always have their exceptions. 

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,580
 - Who are you? 
 - Me? 

40
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,150
 Jang Soo. 

41
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,100
 How about you? 

42
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,530
 Go ahead and accept. 

43
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,340
 For example, the irregular verbs I never thought I'd use. 

44
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,180
♫  The bright rays of sunshine are falling  ♫

45
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,330
Put a seal on it.

46
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,530
♫  They embrace me warmly  ♫

47
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,280
Make a copy.

♫  As if I'm dreaming  ♫

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,000
♫  It feels like that whenever I'm with you  ♫

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,100
♫  Just like going on a trip somewhere far away  ♫

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:04,030
♫  You make me feel endlessly excited  ♫

52

♫  Because it's so beautiful  ♫

54
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,580
See you tomorrow,

55
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,250
Mr. Seo.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,480
♫  Just like sweet ice cream  ♫

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,880
♫  My heart is beating  ♫

58

♫  Oh, I love you  ♫

59
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,500
♫  It's more precious than any gift, like a dream  ♫

60

♫  I feel like I can do anything on the days we meet  ♫

61
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,430
That woman...

62
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,980
What did she do...

63
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,280
just now?

64
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,350
   

65
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,640
I must be crazy. I must be out of my mind.

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,590
I should've gotten paid instead.

67
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,940
What was with my "See you tomorrow"? I'm seeing him right now.

68
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,250
Why did we have to live in the same building?

69
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,980
How could he be so clueless?

70
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,990
Seriously.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,820
Excuse me, Mr. Seo. Why don't you go home a little later?

72
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,780
Can't you see I'm walking fast because I'm embarrassed?

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,980
I see that you want to disappear quickly.

74
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,560
If you know, why can't you just—

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,330
I'd like to, but a ghost has been following you since earlier.

76
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,460
A ghost? Wh-Where?

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,630
- Where– 
 - Don't look back and keep walking.

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,220
This one looks worse than the last one who starved to death.

79
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,050
Okay.

80
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,330
By the way, you shouldn't be so far away if a ghost is following me—

81
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,210
You didn't have to come this close—

82
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,870
Don't get nervous.

83
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,300
The safe zone is active right now.

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,570
We have no choice since we have to activate the safe zone.

85
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,780
I won't be here after 84 days.

86
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,980
You remember that I signed a 100-day-long contract. Right?

87
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,030
 I won't be here for long. It'll be just a hundred days. 

88
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,530
 I want you to protect me for just a hundred days. 

89
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,590
 I'll return the rooftop unit to you after that. 

90
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,500
Pitcairn Islands. Why are you going there?

91
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Are you immigrating, by chance? Will you be gone for good?

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,950
- Are you going there to die or something? 
 - It's one of those.

93
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,170
So you rejected me because...

94
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,800
I mean, you're rejecting me again because of a plan for a distant future that's not even here yet?

95
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,450
There's no reason to waste time when the ending is predictable.

96
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,480
Is it for the same reason that you don't have any number saved on your phone?

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,380
Are you trying to put your past behind and leave comfortably?

98
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,520
I knew you were strange, but you were just a coward.

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,880
Maybe you won't want to leave when it's time because your feelings for me would weigh more. You never know.

100
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,580
I'm sure that won't happen.

101
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,730
Don't be so sure.

102
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,460
Life doesn't go as planned.

103
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:37,560
My life has never deviated from someone's plan.

104
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,850
So we won't be seeing each other soon.

105
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,120
Let's just focus on our duties...

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,330
without crossing the line.

107
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,550
Did I suggest living together or getting married?

108
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,010
Is it that hard for him to like me?

109
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,380
I won't cross that line out of spite.

110
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm so embarrassed. Seriously...

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,390
Am I really that bad?

112
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,050
- What? 
 - We kissed, too.

113
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,930
Just give up.

114
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,040
You said you got rejected twice.

115
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,560
What's the deal?

116
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,760
Right. I got rejected twice.

117
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,310
Do I look clingy?

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,040
Very.

119
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,810
Anyway, let's have this constructive talk over a drink later tonight.

120
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,330
I'm late. See you.

121
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,210
Oh, my phone.

122
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,970
Give me my phone. Thank you.

123
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,300
- Ji Won. 
 - Huh?

124
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,260
I'm so embarrassed.

125
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,710
Should we move?

126
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,680
Should I forget about work?

127
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,290
No, go, go, go. You need to go.

128
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,950
Don't stay out too late, pretty Ji Won.

129
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,630
Okay. How strange. Last time, their eyes said they were flirting.

130
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,530
So embarrassing!

131
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,980

133
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,650
Yes, this is the New Hope Counseling Center.

134
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,950
He doesn't like me either.

135
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,330
He said he wanted me to die.

136
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,450
I have no one left, sir.

137

 Ms. Hyeon Joo. 

138
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,520
You must've had another tough day today.

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,710
Did you get some sleep?

140
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,180
I want to quit now.

141
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,310
I can't go on because I'm exhausted.

142

Where are you right now?

145
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,550
Counselor, what's your name?

146
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,200
You know I can't tell you due to the policy. I'm sorry.

147
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
But this is my last time.

148
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,810
It's not the last time.

149
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,660
Ms. Hyeon Joo,

150
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,010
if you tell me where you are, I'll tell you my name. So—

151
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,650
 Thank you for listening to me all this time. 

152
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,470
I felt like dying because I had no one to talk to,

153
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,470
but I felt less lonely thanks to you.

154
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,620
Thank you.

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,600
♫  I can still feel your warmth so vividly  ♫

165
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,510
   

166
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,140
♫  I couldn't say the last word to you  ♫

167
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,700
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

168
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,570
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

169
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,470
♫  Tell me why  ♫

170
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,720
No!

171
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
What are you doing?

172
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
Let go of me. Let go!

173
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,090
I can't. You promised to pull yourself through.

174
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,030
C-Counselor? Are you the counselor?

175
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,600
- How did you find me— 
 - Ms. Na, it's dangerous there.

176
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
- Come here. 
 - I don't want to.

177
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,530
I hate living in Seoul, where I have no one to open up to.

178
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,260
I hate those who smile to my face just to talk behind my back.

179
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,980
He lied when he said he'd be on my side forever.

180
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,300
I feel like I'm going crazy.

181
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,190
- Why do I have to live? 
 - You promised me

182
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,260
to call me at 8:00 every Tuesday and Thursday.

183
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,100
You need to keep that promise.

184
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,530
Ms. Hyeon Joo, stay right there.

185
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,120
Ms. Hyeon Joo, hold my hand. Hurry.

186
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,130
It's okay.

187
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,880
Here.

188
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,560
You climb over first.

189
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,500
What's wrong, Ms. Hyeon Joo?

190
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
- It's me. Look at me, Ms. Hyeon Joo. 
 - Go away!

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,880
Ms. Hyeon Joo, come to your senses.

192
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,430
- Ms. Hyeon Joo. 
 - Go away!

193
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 Sign. 

194
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,600
   

195
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,590
   

196
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,080
   

197
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,120
 I knew you were strange, but you were just a coward. 

198
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,590
 Maybe you won't want to leave when it's time because your feelings for me would weigh more. You never know. 

199
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,200
What's the difference?

200
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Her name will be deleted soon anyway.

201
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,410
It will be deleted soon.

202
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,790
Don't worry.

203
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,660
I mean it. I mean it.

204
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,750
By the way, you found that woman pretty, too. Right?

205
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,760
   

206
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,460
- Yes. 
 - Are you home, Mr. Seo?

207
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,850
Is something going on? Is it a ghost again?

208
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,700
You'll receive a package for me at the studio.

209
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
Please collect it for me.

210
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,100
Why should I be collecting your package?

211
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,200
- Yes, please put it here. 
 - Okay.

212
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,710
Here you go.

213
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,600
   
 Please put it inside the photo studio. Don't forget. 

214
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,410
What's with her? Seriously.

215
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,740
Signature, please.

216
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,080
What signature?

217
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,150
The recipient needs to sign.

218
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,060
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

219
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Have a good day.

220
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,960
A desk and a file cabinet.

221
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,880
What's she planning to do, exactly?

222
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,330
Did you sign?

223
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,600
Wh-Why do I have to sign again?

224
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,510
It looks like you feel guilty after rejecting me cruelly.

225
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,200
By the way, what are all these?

226
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,270
Oh, these?

227
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,820
I've been thinking.

228
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,910
This will allow us to be as safe as possible.

229
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,500
So...

230
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,970
Ta-da. A shared office. 
    

231
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,360
Wh-What office?

232
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,840
I got many commissions since the Yoon So Myeong case. Big ones, even.

233
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,360
I need a space to work in, but going to Senior Kang's office

234
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,500
means ghosts could show up again anytime.

235
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,110
And you won't follow me everywhere and be my bodyguard.

236
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,640
So I decided to open my office right here.

237
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,130
I'll use it during the day, and you'll use it at night.

238
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,670
Do you mean you'll start a business at my business site?

239
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,860
Without the owner's permission?

240
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,220
Yes. You're using this space as a cover anyway.

241
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,710
Let's share the space since you have extra room.

242
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,940
I might not look it, but I'm the landlord.

243
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,900
Forget it. I never missed rent, so get out of my shop.

244
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,200
You can't do this when you're running an illegal business.

245
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,150
Did you register the ghost photo studio as a business?

246
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,900
This is why they say, "No good deed goes unpunished."

247
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,460
I shouldn't have cared whether you were eaten by a ghost or not.

248
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,810
Here. I kept it simple, so it's easy to understand.

249
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,600
    
 You understand everything. Right?

250
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,400
 "One. Seo Ki Joo and Han Bom are required to protect each other as each other's safe zones. 

251
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,900
 Two. Seo Ki Joo will do his best to fix Han Bom's eyes 

252
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,710
 and Han Bom will do her best to protect Seo Ki Joo from ghosts. 

253
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,570
 Three. It's recommended the two remain within a distance of 40 cm from each other for their safety. 

254
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,300
 Four. The last effective date is the day Seo Ki Joo leaves." 

255
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,200
Well... Do you have to go this far?

256
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

257
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,930
Because...

258
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:34,050
we're only safe if we're close to each other.

259
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,000
What are you doing? Sign.

260
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,440
Would you like a copy?

261
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,630
How much longer will you do this?

262
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,380
We're each doing our duties.

263
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,220
This close. Right? 40 cm.

264
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,900
Yes, that looks about right.

265
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,790
Don't get further away, Mr. Seo.

266
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,950
I'll try not to get any closer.

267
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,950
Let's promise not to cross the line.

268
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,330
Let's keep work and personal life separate.

269
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,500
Oh, right, Mr. Seo. Cash is the best business opening gift.

270
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,820
   

271
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,700
   

272
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,160
She's such a strange woman.

273
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,690
   

274
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,190
Good. I didn't look desperate.

275
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,210
I looked really cool.

276
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,330
   

277
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,300
Wow, this woman has been having a lot of fun.

278
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,040
How will she prepare for retirement?

279
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,430
Anyway, the kids these days—

280
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,100
- Hey, Intern. 
 - Yes.

281
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,600
Come.

282
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,640
You said you studied business at Hanseo University. Right?

283
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,130
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

284
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,850
Why don't you do this one thing for me?

285
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,010
    
 My son has no time to do homework since he's job hunting.

286
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,240
You do it. Okay?

287
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,630
Chief, I have to send the new products to the bloggers for tasting by tomorrow.

288
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,380
Yes, you can do it quickly in your free time.

289
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,660
He's telling you to burn the midnight oil instead of going home.

290
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,300
Here.

291
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,200
   

292
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,400
 Manager Go, you said you had the final interview with TK. Right? 

293
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,100
 My daughter is applying there, 
   

294
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,060
 but she's too young and clueless. 

295
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,560
 Should I look up some personal essay samples— 

296
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,820
 Don't make it complicated. Just write it for her, Deputy Go. 

297
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,280
 Pardon? 

298
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,890
 I said, "Deputy Go." 

299
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,000
 I misspoke. 

300
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,860
 Your performance evaluation for a promotion is up next month, right, Manager Go? 

301
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,780
 Yes. 

302
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,420
 There won't be an issue if the performance review is good. 

303
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,040
 You know who's giving you the review, right? 

304
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,120
   

305
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,950
You aren't going to do it. Right?

306
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,690
Chief.

307
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,380
What?

308
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm a master of doing assignments.

309
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,590
- I'll do it quickly. 
 - Nice.

310
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,030
That's the spirit, Intern!

311
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,820
What do you mean? Why would you do that?

312
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,550
Dad will take care of it. Don't worry about it.

313
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,330
Don't worry. Okay.

314
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,390
   

315
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,500
Goodness, what kind of prick asks someone else to do their homework?

316
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,110
The ones who used to copy others' homework and made someone else do the work

317
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,650
grow up to copy thesis papers and con people.

318
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,190
Huh? What?

319
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,710
It was his father who asked to do it?

320
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,580
You've got to be kidding me.

321
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,450
Does he want to ruin his child's life?

322
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,490
I'm sure he harasses his employees at work, too. Geez.

323
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,130
Someone like him should go off and die alone.

324
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Why won't ghosts take someone like him away?

325
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,900
What are you doing—

326
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,860
Gosh, I'm sorry.

327
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:59,770
Someone got caught copying homework at my granddaughter's kindergarten.

328
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,950
I don't know whose son he is, but he sounds like a lost cause, huh?

329
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,600
- Ahjumma! 
 - Goodness, what do I do?

330
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,230
It really stinks.

331
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,250
Gosh, it stinks.

332
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,700
What are you doing? What are you doing...

333
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,270
Which floor are you going to? Ahjumma!

334
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,230
 They have been having a hard time with drunk people. 

335
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,870
 But they're having a special visitor this time. 

336
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,130
 On the morning of the 20th, at the police station... 

337
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,690
You guys can eat this if I do this?

338
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,330
Yes.

339
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,290
- Like this? 
 - One more time.

340
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,280
One more time?

341
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,520
- One more time. 
 - One more time?

342
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,400
Wow, this is so neat.

343
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,520
Can ghosts taste things, too?

344
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,010
We're dead, but our senses are still alive.

345
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,390
We just don't have bodies.

346
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,800
Wait a minute.

347
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Sprite, please.

348
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,220
Who got food delivered here?

349
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,800
Don't you know I hate the smell of food in the studio?

350
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
You're here.

351
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,290
You came to work late.

352
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,310
- You haven't left yet? 
 - No.

353
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm having dinner with my neighbors.

354
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,110
It was Ms. Han's treat as a neighbor.

355
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,110
My goodness. Aren't you going to work?

356
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,540
Mr. Seo, Mr. Seo, Mr. Seo.

357
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,410
You should have a bite, too.

358
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,090
I know you haven't had dinner.

359
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,470
Take just a bite. Just a bite.

360
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,590
It's still 15 minutes until sunset.

361
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,090
Summer days are a bit long.

362
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,650
- Deputy Go. 
 - Yes?

363
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,600
I have a question.

364
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,000
How could you wait three years for a blind date when you can't remember her name or face?

365
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,420
My last memory right before I died was going out to meet her.

366
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,010
But I don't know why I pictured your face.

367
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,610
- I think I know. 
 - What is it?

368
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,550
She must've been very beautiful like me.

369
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,650
There's no doubt about that. Right.

370
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,790
Mr. Seo, why can't you look at Ms. Han in the eyes?

371
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,750
Huh? You're right.

372
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,490
Did something happen to you two, by any chance?

373
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,040
Why are you suddenly blushing?

374
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh? You're right.

375
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,190
What do you mean? I-It's just because of the safe zone.

376
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,000
Maintaining a safe distance. Don't you know?

377
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Eat quickly and come inside.

378
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,160
Don't be like that and have some. Here.

379
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,580
You always get beaten up by the evil spirits because you're so weak.

380
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,490
When did I ever get beaten up?

381
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,080
Whoa, whoa... sit further away from each other.

382
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,750
I-I feel unsafe right now.

383
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,130
Maintaining a safe distance. Don't you know?

384
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,610
Oh, sorry.

385
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,600
There. Better, right?

386
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,530
 Here's the next story. 

387
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,520
 Chief Prosecutor Lee Hyeon Oh of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office was nominated as the minister of justice. 

388
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,710
 This happened 58 days after Seok Mi Gyu, the former minister of justice, resigned. 

389
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,780
 Reporter Kim Jae Min is here to report. 

390
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,300
 President Han Seung Cheol stressed equality and justice 

391
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,480
 while nominating Lee Hyeon Oh. 

392
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,420
 With equal and just enforcement of law, I won't leave anyone behind... 

393
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,380
- They're all the same. 
  - and make sure no one is treated unjustly... 

394
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,840
 A man who tried to save a woman attempting suicide on a bridge 

395
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,190
 lost his life due to an unfortunate accident. 

396
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,910
 The man was in his 20s and volunteered at a suicide prevention center. 

397
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,950
 ONA's reporter Yoon Ha Yeong will explain the situation. 

398
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,610
 This is footage of a bridge at the Han River, in the late afternoon of the 10th. 

399
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,730
 A woman is standing on the edge of the railing. 

400
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,530
 A man hurried over to stop her. 

401
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,220
 She appears to be hesitating momentarily after talking to him. 

402
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,080
 She ends up pushing him into the river and runs away. 

403
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,950
How could she do that to someone who tried to save her?

404
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,610
I know. It couldn't have been easy for him to go and try to save her.

405
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,550
Hold on.

406
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,900
Doesn't she look kind of strange?

407
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
It's that pattern I'm thinking of, right, Mr. Seo?

408
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,820
So Myeong was killed by an evil spirit the same way.

409
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,520
I think it's worth investigating.

410
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,650
- It's almost time now. 
  - To determine the cause of his death... 

411
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,230
We should prepare to open.

412
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,470
 ...the police will be looking for the woman who ran away. 

413
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,350
 I'm ONA's Yoon Ha Yeong. 

414
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,870
Only authorized personnel are allowed in here.

415
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,000
Please don't cross the line.

416
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,440
Well, you might need the safe zone.

417
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,520
The studio itself is a safe zone.

418
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,350
That stupid line of his. I swear I'll cross that line someday.

419
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,570
Ever since I was a kid, I always had to cross the line my desk buddy created.

420
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,900
Mr. Seo, why are you so mean to her?

421
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Be honest with me. You did something wrong, didn't you?

422
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,860
She's the one who did something wrong. She kissed me out of the blue—

423
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,330
K-Ki- what?

424
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,170
- Ki... 
 - Ki?

425
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,690
She suddenly kicked me.

426
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,370
Geez. Why would Ms. Han kick you?

427
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,030
More like, she kissed him.

428
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,900
Cut the nonsense and prepare to welcome the customer.

429
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,340
You've never kissed, Mr. Seo?

430
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,620
I'm not happy with you today. Okay?

431
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,680
TV...

432
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,660
The man from the TV. Right?

433
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,950
Na Hyeon Joo.

434
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,580
I need to find Ms. Na Hyeon Joo.

435
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,800
It's peppermint tea.

436
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,450
It'd help you with your statement.

437
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,610
Thank you.

438
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,590
Ms. Na Hyeon Joo...

439
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,280
was the client I was assigned to...

440
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,150
six months ago.

441
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,920
   

442
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,360
 Yes, this is the New Hope Counseling Center. 

443
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,420
 I'm lonely. 

444
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,710
 I have no one. 

445
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,400
 I have no reason to go on, either. 

446
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,500
 I don't want to do anything. 

447
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,260
 It must've been very difficult. 

448
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,710
 Ms. Hyeon Joo. It's Ms. Hyeon Joo. Right? 

449
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,620
 Ms. Hyeon Joo, 

450
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,260
 I won't dare say I understand, 

451
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,640
 but I'd like to say cheer up. 

452
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,340
 Tomorrow will be better. 

453
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,820
 What if it isn't? 

454
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,450
 I've been waiting every day, hoping it will be better. 

455
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,370
 But no matter how long I waited, nothing has changed. 

456
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,070
 Every day is hell to me. 

457
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,850
 Give me a call tomorrow, then. 

458
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,450
 - Pardon? 
 - Once you start talking to someone, 

459
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,010
 tomorrow will become better than today. 

460
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,420
 Tomorrow at eight. 

461
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,690
 I'll be waiting. 

462
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,400
 Be sure to call me. 

463
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,270
   

464
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,850
8:00 in the evening on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

465
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,870
Exactly for 15 minutes.

466
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,520
That was the time to save Ms. Hyeon Joo.

467
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,960
It was the reason for her to wake up the next day.

468
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,760
That was...

469
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,090
the reason we met.

470
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,970
 Yes, this is the New Hope Counseling Center... 

471
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,840
 Ms. Hyeon Joo? 

472
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,040
   

473
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,590
   

474
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,110
 I followed the recipe from the YouTube video you sent me. It was so tasty. 

475
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,640
 Did you try it? 

476
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,980
 It's so good. Right? 

477
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,340
 You have to make the fried rice, too. 

478
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,880
 Now that I have eaten this, 

479
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,420
 I'll have to live another day to make it worthwhile. 

480
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,660
 I'm so glad that you tried it. 
   

481
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,770
 Counselor, I have a new boyfriend. 

482
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,050
 Amazing. Is that true, Ms. Hyeon Joo? 

483
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,780
 Wow, I'm so happy for you. 

484
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,150
 I'll try to live as diligently as I can. 

485
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,740
 I'm so happy. 

486
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,350
Ms. Hyeon Joo stopped calling me as often.

487
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,540
It made me really happy.

488
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,870
 Counselor... 

489
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,650
 my boyfriend wants to break up. 

490
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,430
 It must've been so tough. 

491
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,050
 He called me shameless and scary. 

492
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,540
 He won't even answer my calls. 

493
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,410
 He was everything to me. 

494
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,720
 But he wants me to die. 

495
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,210
 How could he say something like that? 

496
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,280
 You didn't do anything wrong. 

497
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,690
 Don't worry. You have me. 

498
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,110
 I'll be there to support you. 

499
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,270
I should've noticed it sooner.

500
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,490
She's been signaling for help all this time.

501
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,570
I'm not qualified as a counselor.

502
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,360
How is that your fault?

503
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,080
You sacrificed yourself to save a precious life.

504
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,710
You did your best, Mr. Choi.

505
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,190
I would've stuck around to take revenge on her.

506
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,900
Ask us anything. We'll help you with anything.

507
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,340
- Deputy Go. 
 - Yes?

508
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,570
What kind of memory do you want to bring with you?

509
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,570
My last...

510
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,120
counseling session with her.

511
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,400
I want to talk to Ms. Hyeon Joo for the last time.

512
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,330
I'm already dead, after all.

513
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,650
I want her to be happy since she's alive.

514
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,760
Before she makes the wrong decision, please...

515
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,160
please...

516
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,790
find her for me.

517
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,950
Gosh, he's so cool.

518
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,080
Seriously...

519
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,590
Quiet. Quiet.

520
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,820
   

521
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:22,570
He's been eating the food I left every night.

522
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,840
No human could've done that.

523
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,360
- It must've been a ghost. 
 - Goodness.

524
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,810
But no one cares that a cat died.

525
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:39,380
I hear you, ma'am. I'll call Misoo Police Station and look into it further.

526
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,690
Don't worry and go home for now. Okay?

527
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,820
You have high blood pressure, too.

528
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,900
Let's get up.

529
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,360
I don't trust the police,

530
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,020
but I trust you, officer.

531
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,270
Yes, okay.

532
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,470
- I'm counting on you. 
 - Yes, yes.

533
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,820
Don't worry. Come this way.

534
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,470
Careful. Careful.

535
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,140
Goodness, have you been taking complaints all night?

536
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,480
Because of you, people think this is a neighborhood substation, not the criminal division.

537
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,950
Hey, she lives alone. Someone has to talk to her.

538
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,280
This is the fifth one this month already.

539
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,710
Maybe the people who hated the cat caretaker killed them.

540
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,240
There were few cases like that.

541
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,150
Don't you think it's a bit different this time?

542
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,830
Maybe they were possessed.

543
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,720
Nabi.

544
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,390
Ahrong.

545
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,800
Pippi.

546
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,420
Oh, no! My goodness.

547
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,710
You killed my babies, didn't you?

548
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,750
Let me look at this sicko's face.

549
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,800
Since they're struggling financially,

550
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,750
I think they're burdened by the legal fee.

551
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,260
Hoon, if I could be of help,

552
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,790
I'd like to represent them pro bono.

553
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,480
Really? I'd appreciate that.

554
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,440
I had to say goodbye to so many of them.

555
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,010
What are you doing?

556
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,160
I didn't realize it because I was so happy.

558
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,100
Attorney Han agreed to defend

559
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,750
clients at our center who need legal help free of charge.

560
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,510
I'm sorry. I must've startled you.

561
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,010
Not at all, Hoon.

562
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,710
I'm honored to be of help.

563
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,330
I'll go and see my clients for the last time, then.

564
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,360
I think I can leave comfortably if I can see them from a distance.

565
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,020
Well, then.

566
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,540
Why didn't you tell me he was here?

567
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,190
I almost missed him.

568
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,950
Hoon?

569
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,230
Since when did you call him that?

570
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,310
And free legal service?

571
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,680
Didn't you say you'd charge me for everything?

572
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,030
He's handsome, nice, and has a strong sense of duty.

573
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,180
Of course, I won't charge someone like him.

574
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,370
How about me? You mean I'm not like that?

575
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,440
He's totally different from you.

576
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,810
Just look at him. He came all the way here to be responsible for his clients.

577
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,980
But you always get angry at the ghosts, kick them out, and have no sense of duty.

578
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,980
Gosh, you can't be more different from him.

579
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,450
I've treated the visitors the best way I can.

580
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,140
Then, what about my advances?

581
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,070
- Pardon? 
 - I want you to respond to...

582
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,200
my advances to the best of your ability.

583
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,510
Do it with a sense of duty.

584
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,800
Is anyone in there?

585
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,920
Is anyone in there?

586
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,060
Yes, Hye Jin. What are you up to?

587
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,820
Yes, yes. I'm free.

588
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,570
   

589
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,720
   

590
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,930
 What do you think of this? 

591
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,860
Why did she suddenly change her mind?

592
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,840
   

593
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,010
It didn't appear to be a water ghost.

594
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,220
Mr. Seo Ki Joo?

595
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,610
Sir, this is a crime scene. Come down.

596
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,360
Get out of there.

597
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,540
I'm sorry.

598
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,150
I was on a walk. Isn't it such a nice day?

599
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,330
Oh, yes. It is.

600
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,080
And?

601
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,410
I got to enjoy the scenery. I'll leave now.

602
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,750
By the way, you came this far for a walk?

603
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,840
I remember you lived in Yongmun District.

604
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,360
You need to walk to live long.

605
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,880
That's true.

606
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,670
By the way, did you locate the woman who ran away?

607
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,140
I hope you find her soon.

608
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,570
No, not yet.

609
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,440
But why are you curious about that?

610
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,110
No reason.

611
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,780
It's getting windy.

612
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,650
What's with him?

613
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,390
Possessing someone is...

614
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,750
They show it on TV a lot, but

615
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,600
it's not so easy to do.

616
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,220
- Yes, I'm sure— 
 - It requires...

617
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,490
a very high level of concentration.

618
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,870
Not everyone can do it.

619
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,820
You need at least three years of experience in this world.

620
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,150
Let me explain it in a simple way.

621
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,420
Choose a target.

622
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,120
Focus.

623
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,370
When you notice a crack, enter!

624
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,790
What are you doing? He'll be leaving soon.

625
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,400
Pardon?

626
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:08,150
Well, I was training him since he just died—

627
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,000
- Possession training. 
 - Yes.

628
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,410
Move. That's my spot.

629
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,970
Pardon?

630
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,440
Since when?

631
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,570
Starting now.

632
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,670
There are other seats.

633
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,730
Did you find Ms. Hyeon Joo?

634
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,060
By the way, why do you think she suddenly changed?

635
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,190
It looked like she was trying to hold your hand.

636
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,350
I find that very strange, too.

637
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,660
She pushed me as if she had become someone else.

638
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,210
Are you okay, Hoon?

639
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,950
Hoon.

640
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,590
M-My goodness. Are you okay, Visitor?

641
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,060
You must be in shock.

642
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,340
Breathe. Breathe.

643
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,360
Let's rest somewhere warm.

644
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,830
Can you get up?

645
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,920
This way.

646
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,380
Is Mr. Choi okay?

647
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,310
You must be worried about him a lot.

648
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,330
Because your pro bono client is sick.

649
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,300
Don't trust the ghosts too much.

650
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,470
Visitors who come here don't always tell the truth.

651
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,980
Mr. Seo, are you jealous by chance?

652
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,960
Jealous, my foot.

653
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm not like that.

654
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,000
I see. That's why you're leaving for the Pitcairn Islands.

655
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,600
Because you're sick of humans and ghosts.

656
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,250
But they have no convenience stores or delivery services.

657
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,570
I'm sure you'd get really, really bored.

658
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,320
You see the missing person's flyer. Right?

659
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,700
That's my uncle.

660
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,980
We promised to go there together.

661
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,330
   

662
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,220
But your uncle is—

663
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,230
He's been missing for 20 years.

664
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,560
And I'm still looking for him.

665
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,090
I'll go alone if I fail to find him.

666
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,360
I'm sure it's special since he wanted to go there.

667
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,850
   

668
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,560
 Hey! Hey, Intern! Come here! 

669
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,360
I said to do his homework. Not plagiarize!

670
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,550
My son is about to be on academic probation!

671
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,800
I didn't plagiarize. It's mine.

672
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,560
What are you talking about? I heard Happy Campus bought it.

673
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:45,380
Yes. It's my A+ essay I posted on Happy Campus.

674
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,140
Was it still up there?

675
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,560
You did this on purpose to screw me, huh?

676
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,180
My gosh, how could I dare do that?

677
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,800
Whatever! Redo it by the end of the day.

678
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,880
Redo it. Do it properly.

679
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,500
Chief, I told you I'll take the afternoon off today.

680
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,300
Take the afternoon off? Hey, who does that around here?

681
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:10,740
Is that important right now? Where do you think you're going after doing this?

682
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,430
I really need to go. I'm sorry.

683
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,560
I'll work double when I come back. I'm sorry!

684
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,140
Hey, catch her. Hey!

685
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,360
Where are you going during work hours?

686
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,130
   

687
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,340
Gosh, I'll be late.

688
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,190
Are you going on a date during work hours?

689
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,730
Man, okay.

690
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:45,510
   

691
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,210
She must be dating a doctor.

692
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,670
That's how she's been traveling overseas with her salary.

693
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,950
Geez, I don't like her.

694
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,010
- Ms. Kim Ji Won. 
 - Yes.

695
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,560
Huh?

696
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,670
He's much older than her.

697
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,710
   

698
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,890
It definitely reduced a lot.

699
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,650
We need to keep an eye on it to determine if it's temporary.

700
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,500
Since there hasn't been a case like this.

701
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,330
How about the new cancer treatment I mentioned before?

702
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,360
It'd be nice if you did it a few more times.

703
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,430
I wanted to live even by taking the new medicine that's not covered by insurance.

704
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:55,930
When I withdrew my installment savings for chemo, I thought this.

705
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:00,180
"I can only live another year even if I spend all this money.

706
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,640
I might as well have fun and use it to travel around the world."

707
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,610
I still feel the same way.

708
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,200
If this really is a miracle, I'll try hanging in there.

709
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,900
It's quite costly to sustain a miracle.

710
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,000
But, Doctor, I'm going through something worse than cancer right now.

711
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,600
You must know since you've been through it. The awful life as an intern.

712
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,660
You can't stress out. Don't overdo it.

713
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,150
You can relapse anytime.

714
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,200
The next date is next month. ight?

715
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,820
- Date? 
 - When I don't feel like coming to the hospital,

716
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,570
I think of it as a date, and I feel a bit better.

717
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,590
I'll see you on our next date.

718
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,250
What a foolish woman.

719
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,420
How dare she make me go up the mountain top?

720
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,900
I can't believe I'm bringing this for her here.

721
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,400
You came, Senior. Gosh.

722
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,900
Wait. Over here.

723
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,080
Gosh, you came, Attorney Kang.

724
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,080
Have a seat.

725
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,420
What kind of law firm is on a mountain?

726
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,750
Mountain, my foot. It's just a bit hilly.

727
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,230
I'll save my breath.

728
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,330
By the way, is this a law firm?

729
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,200
It looks like a photo studio.

730
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,030
It is a photo studio. It's a shared office.

731
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,410
A law firm next to a photo studio.

732
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,160
Are you struggling a lot lately?

733
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,340
Did you go crazy because Lee Hyeon Oh is becoming the Justice Minister?

734
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,340
Why are you bringing that up now?

735
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,240
Because I feel bad for you.

736
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,130
He'd become the president at this rate. What will you do?

737
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,600
- So, why did you ask me to come all the way here? 
 - Right.

738
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,110
   

739
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,950
Take on a few pro bono cases, Senior.

740
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,740
It's too much for me to do it alone.

741
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,580
   

742
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,870
- Pro bono? 
 - Yes.

743
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,030
- Pro bono? 
 - Sounds good. Right?

744
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,390
Pro bono, my foot!

745
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,170
Hey, Han Bom. You need to know your place.

746
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,460
It's really hard to make a living even doing paid defense work.

747
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,330
Senior, you know Choi Hoon. Right?

748
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,570
You know, the man who died trying to save a woman attempting suicide.

749
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:54,890
Yes, of course. He's a national hero right now.

750
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:57,240
These are his clients.

751
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,890
Please help me out.

752
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,810
Why suddenly work for a dead person?

753
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,100
Did you know him?

754
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,010
Well, no. It's not that...

755
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:12,180
I wanted to be helpful since everyone works so hard.

756
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,420
   

757
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,210
 I found out where Na Hyeon Joo is. 

758
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,470
 Hanyeoreum Student Apartments. 

759
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,760
By chance, are you Ms. Na Hyeon Joo...

760
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,720
Ms. Na Hyeon Joo.

761
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,450
Is it true that you found Hyeon Joo?

762
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,780
Have a seat for now.

763
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,590
Where is she?

764
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,440
Is Hyeon Joo okay?

765
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,960
Did she get injured at all?

766
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,900
Where was she all this time?

767
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:00,650
By the way, since when did you call her "Hyeon Joo"?

768
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,210
Didn't you say you saw her for the first time on the day you died?

769
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,610
Did I say that?

770
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,910
I was just so excited.

771
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,810
Where's Ms. Hyeon Joo right now?

772
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,730
Those shoes.

773
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,590
I knew they looked familiar.

774
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,450
   

775
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,790
I saw them at Ms. Hyeon Joo's place.

776
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,430
I found that so strange.

777
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,850
The place was a mess as if she had run away in a hurry,

778
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,920
but only those shoes were placed there neatly.

779
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,560
As if someone put them there after she left.

780
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,420
H.H.

781
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,010
They aren't Ms. Hyeon Joo's initials.

782
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:06,420
Choi Hoon. They aren't your initials, either.

783
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,350
Choi Hoon and Hyeon Joo.

784
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,690
Are they your combined initials?

785
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,930
 It's true. 

786
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,800
 I killed him. 

787
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,550
 Why did you do that? 

788
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,340
 Because that bastard was a stalker! 

789
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,900
 I reported him multiple times, asking for help. 

790
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,970
 I kept finding unfamiliar objects at home. 

791
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:42,130
 But they said I'm overreacting and making things up. 

792
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,610
 They didn't even listen to me. 

793
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,430
 Are you sure you weren't mistaken? 

794
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,610
 The shoes. 

795
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:04,120
 A woman who lives alone needs a pair of men's shoes at home. 

796
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,000
 I kept throwing them away, 

797
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,470
 but the same pairs were sent to me. 

798
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,490
 - Ms. Hyeon Joo. 
 - Don't come. 

799
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,090
 Go away! 

800
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,740
 No! 

801
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,540
 - Ms. Hyeon Joo. 
 - Don't come! 

802
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,810
 I wasn't trying to kill him. 

803
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,360
 I should've died that day instead. 

804
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,560
 I wish I didn't know at all. 

805
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,350
You've wanted...

806
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,900
Ms. Hyeon Joo to be happy.

807
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,990
You just need to disappear.

808
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,580
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

809
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,960
Get your photo taken...

810
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,270
while I'm asking you nicely.

811
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,120
Hyeon Joo needs to be with me to become happy.

812
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,100
Where's that woman?

813
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,180
Where's she?

814
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,210
Give me her address!

815
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,370
I won't bother saying "One, two, three" to you.

816
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,110
Mr. Seo, are you okay?

817
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,720
This is why they say not to trust anyone easily.

818
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,560
How could that visitor...

819
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,260
We have to catch him before the gate of the dead closes. 
    

820
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,100
You're right. We need to.

821
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,290
Or other people might be in danger, not only Hyeon Joo.

822
01:05:55,290 --> 01:06:00,540
He couldn't have gone far since he died less than three days ago.

823
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:09,250
Mr. Seo, who do you keep calling?

824
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:13,180
Ms. Han. She doesn't know what's happened yet.

825
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,600
Please pick up the phone. 
    

826
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,350
Bom, why didn't you answer? Do you know how worried I was?

827
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,200
 You were worried. 

828
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,040
Of course, I was. Why wouldn't I?

829
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,160
I'm glad you were worried about this woman.

830
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,650
Who are you?

831
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,420
When did you find out?

832
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,730
I thought I fooled you perfectly from the beginning.

833
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,160
Choi Hoon?

834
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,440
 You said it was a photo studio for visitors. 

835
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,380
 How dare you try to kill one? 

836
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,360
You'd better...

837
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,960
leave her body immediately.

838
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,840
What should I do with this woman?

839
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,990
Whether she'll live or die is up to you.

840
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,120
Hey, Choi Hoon!

841
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:17,730
Tell me where she is. Na Hyeon Joo.

842
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:44,030


843
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,300
♫  Because I couldn't figure out what I could do for you  ♫

844
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:57,970
♫  Because I feel too bad for you  ♫

845
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:07,750
♫  I picture you being with me in every moment  ♫

846
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,480
   

847
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,730
 See this woman die here or bring Na Hyeon Joo to me. Choose. 

848
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:18,120
 We might become evil spirits if we stay here for too long. 

849
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,920
 I'll make sure to achieve all of these before I go. 

850
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,890
 I could see why you were resentful and couldn't leave. 

851
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:24,980
 You should've come back to me, dummy... 

852
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:29,580
 If you really like someone, you make sure they don't become unhappy. 

853
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,670
 That's why you should protect me. 

854
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:37,450
 I don't protect or save just anyone, either.
