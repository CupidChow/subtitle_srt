14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,090
What? Mr. Seo called.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,290
- What's going on? 
 - Attorney Han!

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,600
Hoon, is something going on?

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,260
Well...

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,540
I was looking for Ms. Hyeon Joo.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,090
Where is she? Did you find her?

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,440
Well, yes.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,860
That's so great.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,670
I actually wanted to go somewhere with you.

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,310
Where?

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,400
Let's head over there first.

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,710
Is that why Mr. Seo called?

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,830
   

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,710
   

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,600
What's your relationship with that dead man?

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,820
Well, I said I wanted to help because he was a good person.

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,680
I met with the clients of the cases you gave me,

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,420
but they all detested Choi Hoon.

32
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,000
- Why? 
 - Many complained that he was creepy and persistent.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,540
He was basically fired.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,580
And he had a criminal record, too.

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,000
- What was he charged for? 
 - Stalking.

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,010
Well, Senior. Excuse me for a second.

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,870
Attorney Han.

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,250
Han Bom, what's wrong all of a sudden? Are you okay?

39
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,710
- No. 
 - What?

40
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,100
I saved them.

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,550
Attorney Han?

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,620
   

43
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,740
Wow, you came so fast.

44
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,960
Come down.

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,370
Come down, and we'll talk.

46
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,600
You come up, CEO Seo.

47
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,330
No, keep your distance.

48
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,090
What if this attorney loses a footing and dies?

49
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,590
 Don't get further away, Mr. Seo. 

50
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,730
 I'll try not to get any closer. 

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,250
It was really fun working at the counseling center.

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,460
Everyone was desperate, hopeless, and lonely.

53
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,570
Na Hyeon Joo was the most desperate among them.

54
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,760
But I willingly became her reason to live another day.

55
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,250
It was annoying to hear about her work sometimes,

56
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,840
but it was a perfect relationship.

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,150
Until Hyeon Joo started a relationship.

58
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,330
 Excuse me for a second. 

59
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,060
 Counselor, my boyfriend is calling. 

60
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,260
 I'll call you back soon. 

61
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,590
I managed to stop her from dying and gave her faith and hope.

62
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,610
I helped her grow.

63
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,050
I couldn't believe it. She was so ungrateful.

64
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,960
That's why I needed her to realize something.

65
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,440
She's so transparent. It wasn't hard to figure out her door code.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,860
She had to learn her place and who needed to be by her side.

67
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,950
 I'll have an iced Americano. 

68
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,400
 It's 4,800 won. 

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,160
   

70
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,920
 Oppa, let's meet at 8:00 at my place as usual. 

71
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,700
   

72
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,710
 Sorry, babe. I sent that by mistake. 

73
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,300
   

74
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,460
I led her to the edge of the cliff

75
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,110
and made sure she had no one left.

76
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,880
 My place is kind of messy. 

77
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,290
 It's okay. Wow, I've never been to a place where a woman lives alone. 

78
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,620
 Don't worry about these. 

79
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,110
 Oppa. 

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,170
 Hold on, Oppa. 

81
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,480
 Listen to me, Oppa. Oppa. 

82
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,180
 - Please listen to me— 
 - You're so unbelievable. 

83
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,560
 I hope you just die. 

84
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,110
   

85
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,850
   

86
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,630
 Ms. Hyeon Joo, we haven't talked in a while. 

87
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,530
 Counselor. 

88
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,230
I'm sure she finally realized...

89
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,860
 I'm so exhausted. 

90
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,500
what a valuable person I was.

91
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,300
I saved her life, but how dare she push me away?

92
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,800
And she wants to survive on her own? Gosh, I could never allow that.

93
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,610
That's a load of bullshit.

94
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,060
Where have I seen that expression before?

95
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,270
 I had to say goodbye to so many— 

96
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,570
 What are you doing right now? 

97
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,800
 Move. That's my spot. 

98
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,210
You like this woman, don't you?

99
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,570
I'm so curious to see

100
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,460
what expression you'll have if she fell and drowned here.

101
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,180
But listen carefully, Photographer.

102
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,000
It's for real this time.

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,790
Choose between seeing this woman die here or bring Na Hyeon Joo to me.

104
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,870
All right.

105
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,770
Why don't you come with me?

106
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,830
Don't try to be clever and bring Na Hyeon Joo.

107
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,790
If you really like someone,

108
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,830
you protect that person so she doesn't become unhappy.

109
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,300
Not leading her to a path of misery like you did.

110
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,810
Did Deputy Go teach you how to extinguish an evil spirit like you in addition to possessing?

111
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,450
- What are you saying? 
 - You kill them the same way...

112
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,590
they died originally.

113
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,150
So, stop saying you saved her or loved her.

114
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,080
You're nothing but a criminal.

115
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,800
- Let's go now. 
 - I can't leave until...

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,060
you bring Na Hyeon Joo.

117
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,610
What's this? Are they shooting the Avengers or something?

118
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,010
Our Mr. Baek...

119
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,910
is a "dehydrator" for sure.

120
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,380
I didn't make a mistake. Right?

121
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,960
I truly hope you're born as a good person in your next life.

122
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,170
Are you okay, Bom? It's me.

123
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,070
Mr. Seo.

124
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,100
Are you okay?

125
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,350
Mr. Seo, I was possessed, wasn't I?

126
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,800
I was possessed, right?

127
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
You're okay now.

128
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,870
I don't remember anything at all.

129
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,040
Did I do something by chance?

130
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,730
No.

131
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,400
By chance, did I hurt someone?

132
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,670
No.

133
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,630
Then did I perhaps...

134
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,870
hurt you, Mr. Seo?

135
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,840
No.

136
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,550
What a relief.

137
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,360
♫  I'm not used to spending the night alone  ♫

138
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,460
We're just on a night walk.

139
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,190
Just an outing.

140
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,350
Isn't the night air nice?

141
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:14,630
♫  Your traces won't disappear  ♫

142
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,580
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

143
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,080
♫  Tell me why  ♫

144
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:29,280
♫  I think I'll collapse without you  ♫

145
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,730
   

146
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
   

147
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,260
Where's CEO Seo?

148
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,460
He's at the ER.

149
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,930
Bom said she was okay, but he insisted.

150
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,500
Visitor...

151
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,100
I mean, where's that bastard?

152
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,260
He fell into the water, so he was probably extinguished.

153
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,400
They say you become an evil spirit if you have a lot of lingering feelings in this life.

154
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,940
We might also become evil spirits

155
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,810
if we stay here for too long. Right?

156
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:29,580
Would you be able to leave after finishing your bucket list?

157
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,400
We were already done a long time ago.

158
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,300
I...

159
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,050
will do everything on the list before I go.

160
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,210
Because death marks the second chapter of my life.

161
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,200
How about you?

162
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,250
Will you leave without any regrets once you catch him?

163
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,240
I need to leave...

164
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,000
for Na Rae to be at peace.

165
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,610
I'll go home now.

166
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,710
You're finally going home.

167
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,690
You haven't been home since you've been catching evil spirits lately.

168
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,210
I hope she doesn't divorce you for it.

169
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,580
Divorce? My Na Rae isn't that type of a person.

170
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,850
She understood and supported everything I did.

171
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,400
And she longed for me and loved me more than anyone.

172
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,190
You're so unbelievably clueless.

173
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,180
If I were your wife, I would've been so frustrated—

174
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,590
I'm sorry. I keep seeing cat ghosts these days.

175
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,260
What did you say?

176
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,760
I couldn't hear you well.

177
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,090
D-Did you need anything?

178
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,690
We've been here for more than three hours. Is it our turn yet?

179
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,870
No. Can't you see the people waiting here?

180
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,000
Please remain seated.

181
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,350
Could you let her lie down somewhere?

182
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,300
Well, Mr. Seo. I'm really okay.

183
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Let's go home now.

184
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll get criticized for coming to the ER when I'm totally fine.

185
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,200
An evil spirit possessed you. Don't think so lightly of it.

186
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,800
You can just protect me, then.

187
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,900
Looks like your wife is okay. Should I cancel your turn?

188
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,110
No, she's not my wife—

189
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,490
I know.

190
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,780
Unni, my husband freaks out whenever I get a little sick.

191
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,140
Let's go, Honey.

192
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,580
Well, I...

193
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,620
Your husband is the one who got injured.

194
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,200
Well, I'm okay.

195
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,300
What do you mean you're okay? You're bleeding, Mr. Seo.

196
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,030
Gosh! What do we do?

197
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,250
I'm really okay.

198
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,160
No, you aren't.

199
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,640
It must've hurt.

200
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Give me your hand.

201
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,840
Hurry.

202
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,020
Gosh, it looks painful.

203
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,150
Tell me if it hurts.

204
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,330
Does it hurt?

205
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,430
Put up with it for a moment.

206
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,290
It must've hurt a lot.

207
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:44,320
♫  Do you think we met by coincidence?  ♫

208
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,600
♫  No, I think it was meant...  ♫

209
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,740
Mr. Seo, I've been curious about something.

210
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,870
Why do you work so hard?

211
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,970
- What do you mean? 
 - The photo studio.

212
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,300
You won't get in trouble for not doing your best.

213
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Why are you so devoted to it?

214
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,820
You should take it easy. This is so upsetting.

215
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't get hurt, at least.

216
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,070
Done.

217
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,070
If the studio closes...

218
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,100
there's no place my uncle could come and find me.

219
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,510
♫  Even if my time stops and my life ends  ♫

220
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,930
♫  I choose you, it's meant to be  ♫

221
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,620
♫  You're the one person who loved me  ♫

222
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,550
♫  Even if you change your mind after time passes  ♫

223
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,260
Don't ever disappear before I do.

224
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,150
♫  I'll love you even more  ♫

225
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,360
♫  Please just be by my side  ♫

226
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,510
No, don't step on it.

227
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,250
It's not effective once it's ruined.

228
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,070
I worked on this barrier all night last night.

229
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,250
Although it took longer to get the salt than to set it up.

230
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,290
Didn't you say Choi Hoon died?

231
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,020
We haven't caught the evil spirit that killed Yoon So Myeong, either.

232
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,670
And since you've been possessed once,

233
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,370
the evil spirits will come after you more.

234
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,480
I'm okay. I've learned to carry salt around.

235
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,800
Where are you going, by the way? Looks like you're dressed for work.

236
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,970
Well, I'm going to work, too.

237
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,070
- Where? 
 - Wherever you're going.

238
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,410
You said you have the evidence of your husband's assault on you and your child. Right?

239
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,040
Yes.

240
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,600
    
 If so, I recommend...

241
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,990
that you file a criminal complaint immediately.

242
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,220
But if your husband doesn't get punished

243
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,140
or refuses to get divorced even after filing a criminal complaint,

244
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,700
the divorce could take about a year just to finish the first trial.

245
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,780
I know you haven't opened up to us because of Choi Hoon.

246
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,780
But starting the divorce lawsuit as soon as possible for your child

247
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,800
would help things move along faster.

248
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,500
I hope you keep up the spirit.

249
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm in your care.

250
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,860
We'll do our best.

251
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,910
What's that man doing over there?

252
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,490
Huh?

253
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,500
- There's a bit of a situation. 
 - He looks perfectly fine,

254
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,670
but he looks a bit familiar.

255
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,610
Where have I seen him?

256
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,600
Mr. Seo, what are you doing at my workplace right now?

257
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,200
Don't worry about me, and keep working.

258
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,700
I'm just doing my job.

259
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,720
How could I not worry? You're making yourself very noticeable.

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,360
Mr. Seo, I swear I'm okay.

261
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,250
I'll call you if an evil spirit shows up.

262
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,140
Here. "Emergency Contact." I have it right here.

263
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,620
It'd be too late by then.

264
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,240
Haven't you heard this saying?

265
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
"Beware of evil spirits day and night.

266
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,150
Don't disregard even the ones that are dead."

267
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,850
I'm just being faithful to our contract.

268
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,980
What does this have to do with our contract?

269
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,980
"One. Seo Ki Joo and Han Bom are required to

270
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,930
protect each other as each other's safe zone."

271
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,160
♫  A mild breeze  ♫

272
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,710
♫  Our hands are touching each other  ♫

273
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,990
♫  A small bird is whispering  ♫

274
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,500
 Two. Seo Ki Joo will do his best to fix Han Bom's eyes 

275
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,370
 and Han Bom will do her best to protect Seo Ki Joo from ghosts. 

276
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,570
♫  Your warm eyes  ♫

277
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,470
♫  Your touch is like a constellation  ♫

278
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:40,490
 Three. The two should remain a minimum of 40 cm distance for each other's safety. 

279
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,250
♫  The deeply tinted sky  ♫

280
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,630
♫  The beautiful moment I'm sharing with you  ♫

281
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:58,710
♫  Ooh, bye, bye, lonely days, hold my hand  ♫

282
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,310
 Four. This contract is effective until the day Seo Ki Joo leaves." 

283
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:10,230
♫  Let's dance in the rain without anyone knowing  ♫

284
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,110
♫  Just the two of us  ♫

285
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:19,430
♫  Ooh, bye, bye, sadness, times are now  ♫

286
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,700
Mr. Seo, how long will you hold my hand?

287
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,270
♫  On the boat called love under the night sky  ♫

288
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,220
We don't know when the evil spirits will show up. How can I let go?

289
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh, I see.

290
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,830
But I need to go alone starting here.

291
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,300
Call me if anything happens.

292
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,570
Call when you think something might happen, and call even when nothing happens.

293
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,950
Mr. Seo, how is that an emergency contact?

294
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,270
But I'll consider it.

295
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,770
   

296
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,300
- Hey. 
  - CEO Seo, are you okay? 

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,620
 The gate of the dead closed, so Choi Hoon... 

298
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,160
couldn't be sent within three days. It must be hard on you.

299
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,890
But you're not at the studio.

300
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,860
 Where are you roaming around? 

301
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,490
Be quiet. You're making my head ring.

302
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,900
How about Choi Hoon? Are you sure he was destroyed?

303
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,990
Mr. Baek is still looking for him.

304
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,790
But I think he was destroyed because he can't find him.

305
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,360
 I think you can relax now. 

306
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,710
This is all I have.

307
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,550
   

308
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:09,290
   

309
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
This is more than enough.

310
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,140
It was very smart of you to collect evidence.

311
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,300
There is a record of you reporting him for stalking.

312
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,750
If we can prove Choi Hoon's crime,

313
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,050
it's very likely that they'll end the investigation with no charge on you.

314
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,900
Thank you, Attorney Han.

315
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,290
 Well, then... 

316
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,500
   

317
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,510
Well, Ms. Na.

318
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,750
Do you have the waybills for these shoes, too?

319
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,140
Yes, I kept everything in here.

320
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,170
This might go quicker than expected.

321
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,800
I'll have a closer look at them later.

322
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,110
By the way, how did you find me, Attorney?

323
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,390
I never called an attorney.

324
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,600
How did you know I was at the police station?

325
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,760
Someone told me. A person with a very kind heart.

326
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,990
Senior.

327
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,280
I thought this was linked to the Choi Hoon case,

328
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,720
but I think it was a simple suicide attempt.

329
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,390
And Ms. Na will come in as a material witness tomorrow.

330
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,000
Okay. By the way, have a look at this.

331
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,900
Doesn't it look like he's trying to push her instead of saving her?

332
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,550
Looks like he's just holding her.

333
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,430
Really? Look closer.

334
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,040
Oh? Isn't that the attorney? Attorney Han?

335
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,490
What was Attorney Han doing here...

336
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,820
Seo Ki... Hey, this is Seo Ki Joo. Right?

337
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,420
You're right.

338
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,560
Hold on. He came to the crime scene, too.

339
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,910
He was probably just seeking attention.

340
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,530
Like those people who like to play detectives.

341
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,150
We did a background check on him. Right? Bring that to me.

342
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,170
- Okay, I'll get it for you right away. 
 - Okay.

343
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,940
- Shall we go home? 
 - Shall we?

344
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,440
Let's go.

345
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,620
- Let's go. Let's go. 
 - Good luck, Ji Won.

346
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,470
- Good luck. 
 - Get home safely.

347
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,110
- We should get some soju. 
 - Shall we?

348
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,290
I made a plan with a friend.

349
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,280
- Deputy, you're coming, right? 
 - Deputy Kim. Deputy Kim.

350
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,090
Seriously, that woman...

351
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,610
It will take you forever at that rate.

352
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,950
Haven't you ever sent a package before?

353
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,830
Deputy Park, I thought you left.

354
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,020
Can't believe how slow you are.

355
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,460
Let's finish it quickly before I change my mind.

356
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,320
Thank you, Deputy Park.

357
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:54,540
Seriously, they're as shameless as ever.

358
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,920
The tape. Where's the other tape?

359
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,560
It's on my desk.

360
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,370
What's this?

361
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,680
It's ghost repellent.

362
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,030
A friend gave it to me.

363
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,290
I heard there's an angry ghost at our office who couldn't become a deputy three years ago.

364
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,560
He's afraid he'll lose his desk.

365
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,350
So he kicks out whenever there's someone new.

366
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,410
Oh, I see.

367
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,920
But I guess you didn't hear this.

368
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,570
That you're using his desk right now.

369
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,210
Really?

370
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,380
I knew it. I got goosebumps for no reason.

371
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,820
Did you hear why he died, too?

372
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,990
Why did he die?

373
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,740
   

374
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,970
From overworking.

375
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,060
He thought he should work hard and get a good job.

376
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,370
After that, he thought...

377
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,490
getting promoted,

378
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,760
finding a nice woman,

379
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,660
getting married,

380
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,820
and living like that meant living a good life.

381
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,790
Without going home or taking weekends off,

382
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,320
he worked every night without taking a trip anywhere

383
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,460
and never got to leave his desk.

384
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,690
Like a complete fool.

385
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,010
That doesn't make him a fool.

386
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,690
He was just trying to live diligently.

387
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,150
I feel bad for that ghost.

388
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,190
I understand why he can't leave this world.

389
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,570
I made up my mind.

390
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,760
- To do what? 
 - No matter how much he harasses me,

391
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,930
I'll endure until the end without quitting.

392
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,010
I'll be acknowledged by the ghost.

393
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,040
What...

394
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,830
W-What kind of crazy woman are you?

395
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,130
Y-You want to do this, huh?

396
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,740
Wait right there!

397
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,540
Deputy.

398
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,390
What? He said he'd help me.

399
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,260
 Bom, I'm working late tonight. 

400
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,380
She said she was taking half a day off. Why is she working late again?

401
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,300
Thank you for being my bodyguard today, Mr. Seo.

402
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,940
See you tomorrow.

403
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,430
What are you doing?

404
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,050
I'll be watching you all night tonight.

405
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,880
I'll leave when your friend comes.

406
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Don't worry so much.

407
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,420
By the way, don't you have to open the studio?

408
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm just noticing the sun has set, too.

409
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,180
I do. But I don't have a customer today.

410
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,780
My staff will let me know if a visitor comes.

411
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,770
Thank you.

412
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,010
See you tomorrow, then.

413
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,560
- Mr. Seo. 
 - What?

414
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,640
Is there a ghost?

415
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,080
Do you want to sleep together?

416
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,130
Well, there's a sofa outside, too.

417
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,970
It's too far away.

418
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,760
That's well beyond the 40 cm perimeter.

419
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,150
Don't worry.

420
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,700
I won't do anything.

421
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,950
Why won't you do anything?

422
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,290
Why wouldn't he do anything?

423
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,290
A man and a woman are so close together.

424
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,590
Isn't it normal to do something?

425
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,530
Are you sleeping, Mr. Seo?

426
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,620
Are you really sleeping?

427
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,510
A healthy woman is seducing a man to sleep with her.

428
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,570
Should a man be sleeping peacefully like this?

429
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,280
Mr. Seo.

430
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,660
Mr. Seo, are you really...

431
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,620
He's sleeping.

432
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,600
He shouldn't have saved me.

433
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,510
He shouldn't have protected me.

434
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,740
Why does he keep making my heart flutter?

435
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,330
He's making me want to confess my love again.

436
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,980
Are you sick, Mr. Seo?

437
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,530
 It's phantom energy. 

438
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,290
 A side effect when a living forcefully opens the gate of the dead. 

439
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,910
Phantom energy.

440
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,270
He needs a towel.

441
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,060
It's too far away, I said.

442
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,050
Are you okay, Mr. Seo?

443
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,900
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

444
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,410
It's because of Choi Hoon, isn't it?

445
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,410
Because the gate of the dead is closed,

446
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,640
yet the dead couldn't leave.

447
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,530
I understand. Let go now.

448
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,250
I'll get a wet towel and medicine.

449
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,700
Just stay if you understand me.

450
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,750
I have no energy to move.

451
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,820
♫  Maybe it resembles me  ♫

452
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,190
♫  I can't erase it  ♫

453
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,000
♫  It hurts a little bit  ♫

454
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,560
♫  I've been hurting all this time  ♫

455
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,220
♫  Because I couldn't figure out what I could do for you  ♫

456
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,730
I don't just protect or save anyone.

457
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,150
Go to sleep now.

458
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll be the night watch tonight.

459
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,720
♫  I think of you one more time  ♫

460
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,620
♫  I think of you one more time  ♫

461
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,970
 I need to work alone today. Attorney Han is off to work now. 

462
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,220
 I have both the salt and red beans. Don't worry. 

463
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,240
 I've returned the favor for the abalone porridge. Okay? 

464
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,050
 By the way, are you sure I can call you even if it's unnecessary? 

465
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,320
   

466
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,120
Good morning, CEO Seo.

467
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,090
I'll get going now.

468
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,090
CEO Seo. CEO Seo.

469
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,850
CEO Seo! Why is he in such a hurry? Hold on!

470
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,360
CEO Seo, hold on.

471
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,310
CEO Seo.

472
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,200
You're up.

473
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,070
Bom asked me to make him breakfast.

474
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,630
Hey. W-What about the visitors? Why didn't you wake me up?

475
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,130
I did give you a call.

476
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,520
Thankfully, we can take care of it today.

477
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,560
I thought you were dead because I couldn't reach you.

478
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,410
You mean I've been sleeping the entire time?

479
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,800
My client already reported him for stalking four times.

480
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,930
Imagine how scared she must've felt encountering her stalker on the bridge.

481
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,790
She must've had a panic attack.

482
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,620
I acknowledge that Choi Hoon had a stalking history.

483
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:34,750
But there's no evidence that Choi Hoon stalked Ms. Na.

484
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,590
These look familiar, don't they?

485
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,750
The late Choi Hoon was wearing them.

486
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,030
And these are the shoes he sent Ms. Na.

487
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,860
Don't they share the same embroidered initials?

488
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,710
I checked with the store, and

489
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:04,170
it turns out a man purchased 10 pairs with the same engraving.

490
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,830
Lastly, these are the waybills of the shoes he's been sending Ms. Na.

491
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,110
 Here she comes! Here she comes! 

492
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,340
Ms. Na, why did you kill the counselor who's been helping you? Why did you do that?

493
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,530
Do you have anything to say to the victim's family?

494
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,510
What do you think of the public calling it "A kind young man's tragic death"?

495
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,630
My client is a victim of stalking by a criminal under the guise of a suicide prevention hotline counselor.

496
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,710
Sounds like you're saying a proper investigation

497
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,180
on the stalking could've prevented his death. Is that right?

498
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,050
In a nutshell, this is clearly a stalking case in which my client defended herself

499
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:53,600
from the attacker who threatened her after stalking her for six months

500
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,970
after the police refused to look into it.

501
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,810
Do you mean you blame the prosecution and the police for refusing to investigate?

502
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:04,320
Last year, the police issued arrest warrants to 1.2% of the reported stalkers.

503
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,130
And the Prosecutors' Office issued bench warrants to less than 5% of them.

504
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,440
I think that should answer your questions.

505
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,550
That's all. Let's go.

506
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,340
 - Please tell us more! 
 - How do you feel? 

507
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,650
- Just one moment, Ms. Na. 
 - Sure.

508
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,420
   

509
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,340
What's going on? Can't believe you called me.

510
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,890
You're with Ms. Na, right?

511
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,850
Could you ask her if she's free tomorrow?

512
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm afraid that I'll notice traces of him.

513
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,390
Ms. Na, please trust me just once.

514
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,890
Please?

515
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:28,710
♫  After walking down the memory lane with warm sunshine  ♫

516
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:35,490
♫  I see you at the end of the path smiling at me  ♫

517
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,320
♫  I'm holding you soft  ♫

518
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,140
♫  It's wrapped up preciously  ♫

519
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,250
How...

520
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,570
How did you do this...

521
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,230
Remember? I told you I know kind-hearted people?

522
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,820
♫  It resonated by my ears on the beautiful days  ♫

523
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,670
♫  You and I  ♫

524
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,300
Go.

525
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,840
♫  In the paused fond memories  ♫

526
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,050
♫  You dwell quietly  ♫

527
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:23,320
♫  I'll always be by your side  ♫

528
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:30,660
♫  The stories I didn't get to tell you in those moments  ♫

529
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,300
♫  I'll tell them to you now  ♫

530
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,820
♫  Press rewind to that time in the past  ♫

531
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,980
♫  I'm returning to you  ♫

532
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,120
To keep these alive,

533
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,330
you need to water them according to what's written on them.

534
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,380
That will give you a reason to wake up the next day for now.

535
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,140
And the kind-hearted person asked me to tell you this.

536
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,020
 Everyone has to walk through a very long and dark tunnel at some point in life. 

537
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,750
 While Hyeon Joo was wandering in the dark, 

538
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:09,820
 someone was blocking the path, so she couldn't come out. 

539
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,690
 That's... 

540
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,890
 not Ms. Hyeon Joo's fault. 

541
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,220
He said the tunnel will end soon.

542
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,710
He asked me to apologize to you, too.

543
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,060
- Why would he— 
 - Well...

544
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,540
He said it's his fault that he can't pick customers.

545
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,730
So you should come back, Ms. Hyeon Joo.

546
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:41,330
There's nothing that can hurt you anymore.

547
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:45,350
Thank you, Attorney Han.

548
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,570
Okay. Shall we raise our glasses?

549
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,820
Okay.

550
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,670
- Cheers. 
  - Cheers! 

551
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,760
Wow, beer tastes good even when you're dead.

552
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,600
He thinks everything tastes good.

553
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,150
Come on. This is our first team meal together.

554
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,340
We ate together last time.

555
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,700
But this is different. Today, the photo studio and the law firm

556
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,610
worked together for the first time.

557
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,430
I'll acknowledge it this time. Attorney Han.

558
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,230
It's all thanks to you guys.

559
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,910
I'm so relieved Ms. Na was able to cheer up.

560
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,120
Let's eat.

561
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,830
Give me a drumstick, CEO Seo.

562
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,150
Here's white meat.

563
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,370
Well done.

564
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,830
Will you eat this?

565
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,830
 Patrol No. 12. Patrol No. 12. 

566
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,310
 We're chasing a vehicle assumed to be Park Doo Chil's near Dongho Bridge. 

567
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,600
 The license plate number is 342-Ba-1459. 

568
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,900
- I'll have to excuse myself now. 
  - Men who are able to move out... 

569
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,330
- Enjoy your meal. 
  - I repeat. 

570
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,760
 Patrol No. 12. Patrol No. 12. Near Dongho Bridge... 

571
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,610
Park Doo Chil. I'll catch you.

572
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,520
Come out, you bastard. Come out!

573
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,550
Hey, open the door!

574
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,590
Open the door!

575
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,780
- Over there. 
 - Park Doo Chil!

576
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,530
Come down!

577
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,650
- Park Doo Chil, you bastard. 
 - Come here.

578
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,250
Hey!

579
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,920
Shit! Stop right there!

580
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,980
Get him!

581
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,950
Hey!

582
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,110
Stop!

583
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,580
Stop following me!

584
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,270
Who was that?

585
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,490
What? Who's doing this?

586
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,800
Long time no see, Park Doo Chil.

587
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,110
Listen carefully. I'm using live-ammo starting now.

588
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,370
Get up!

589
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,270
Okay.

590
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,380
Who's this? Come out.

591
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,150
What the hell?

592
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,020
What? What...

593
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,130
Shit. Come out!

594
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,140
You...

595
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,400
Son of a bitch.

596
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,580
Son of a bitch.

597
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,930
I thought I dropped them.

598
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,420
Park Doo Chil.

599
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,710
You're under arrest for the murder of Officer Baek Nam Goo.

600
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,160
You have the right to an attorney.

601
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,980
You have the right to defend yourself and refuse to answer questions.

602
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,410
You can request a review of the legality of confinement.

603
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,420
I finally caught him, Nam Goo.

604
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,100
Thank you.

605
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,620
 A gang member, Park Doo Chil, who's been on the run 

606
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,280
 after killing an officer on duty was arrested near Yongmun District this morning. 

607
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,340
 He was arrested 77 days after Officer Baek Nam Goo was killed on duty. 

608
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,800
 Gang member, Park Doo Chil, was arrested for smuggling drugs in 2020. 

609
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,030
 Out of resentment for arresting him, he attacked and killed Officer Baek 

610
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,910
 of Macheon Police Station... 

611
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,690
Applause.

612
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,760
Ms. Han.

613
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,700
No.

614
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,460
 It upset many since it was their wedding anniversary. 

615
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,960
 The police stated they will investigate his motives 

616
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,160
 and issue an arrest warrant for murder. 

617
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,790
 After hearing that Park was arrested this morning, 

618
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:20,430
 the officers' unwavering determination in the pursuit was highlighted. 

619
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,560
 I won't come back until I catch him. 

620
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,650
We caught him, Honey.

621
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,650
You should've come back...

622
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,520
after catching him, you fool.

623
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,740
I'm sorry...

624
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,200
it took so long.

625
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,100
   

626
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,510
 Excuse me. 

627
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,140
   

628
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,510
Excuse me.

629
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,380
Mr. Seo Ki Joo?

630
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,850
Gosh, you scared me.

631
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,990
Why are you coming out of there?

632
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,960
What are you doing here?

633
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,820
What's behind you?

634
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,920
It's the boiler room.

635
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,620
You don't mind if I check. Right?

636
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,700
Do you have a warrant?

637
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,370
That's just a boiler room.

638
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,380
What are you doing here, Attorney Han?

639
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,670
- Oh, didn't you hear that I opened a firm here? 
 - What?

640
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,350
How about him?

641
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,780
We're sharing the office.

642
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,200
It's a law firm next door to a photo studio.

643
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,360
Not too shabby, right?

644
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,100
It's so expensive to rent these days.

645
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,670
Okay.

646
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,750
You didn't have to see me out.

647
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,080
Well, Attorney Han.

648
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,740
Yes.

649
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:13,350
He tried to push you into Han River, right? By chance...

650
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,330
do you need my help?

651
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,890
No, we were on a walk, and the air was so nice then.

652
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,740
I can see why you were mistaken.

653
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,990
Take care.

654
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,870
   
 In a nutshell, this is clearly a stalking case in which 

655
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,200
 my client defended herself from the attacker 

656
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,480
 who threatened her after stalking her for six months 

657
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,140
 after the police refused to look into it. 

658
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,810
 Do you mean you blame the prosecution and the police for refusing to investigate? 

659
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,350
 Last year, the police— 

660
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,880
Looks like it became clear that the late Choi Hoon was the defendant's stalker.

661
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,110
They have clear evidence to prove it, too.

662
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,410
And since it took longer than expected to arrest Park Doo Chil, who killed a police officer,

663
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:30,150
public's trust in the Prosecutors' Office and police have significantly declined.

664
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,770
Make sure to control the media so they don't mention the lax investigation.

665
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:34,250
Got it.

666
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,580
And speaking of a lax investigation,

667
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:42,680
we should also prep you on Kim Yoon Cheol, the 2019 vacation rental murder suspect.

668
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,410
Why? The case was closed.

669
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,840
It's true, but it was a controversial case internally.

670
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:54,020
I'm sure the opposition party will bring that up again in addition to the current case.

671
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:59,000
Geez, they'll bring up all sorts of ancient cases.

672
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,140
Deputy Go.

673
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,340
Mr. Baek.

674
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,280
Why did you want to meet at a cafe? It's unlike you.

675
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,070
I haven't been to a cafe in a while. I wanted to treat myself.

676
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,730
To be honest, I'd like to ask you a favor.

677
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,780
- What is it? 
 - My wife only buys mums ever since I died.

678
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,920
So I'd like to gift her extravagant and pretty flowers.

679
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,940
There's a flower shop she likes.

680
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,680
Could you go there and put in an order for me?

681
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,480
They don't accept online orders there.

682
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,630
You need my excellent possessing skills, don't you?

683
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,000
Don't worry.

684
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,700
I'll order something pretty for you.

685
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,540
Thank you.

686
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,450
What are you looking at so intently?

687
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:07,260
   

688
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,760
   

689
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,090
Amicable divorce application.

690
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:31,350
♫  There was no response to the voice that resonated  ♫

691
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,990
   

692
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,420
♫  I endured a day trapped in long silence  ♫

693
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,320
- Who is it? 
  - It's a flower delivery. 

694
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,450
Just one moment.

695
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:55,950
♫  I blank out and think of you for a long time again  ♫

696
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:03,070
♫  I'm not used to spending the night alone  ♫

697
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:07,070
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

698
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,450
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

699
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:15,140
I missed you, Na Rae.

700
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:22,130
♫  Your traces won't disappear  ♫

701
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:26,070
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

702
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,750
♫  Tell me why  ♫

703
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:36,200
♫  I think I'll collapse without you  ♫

704
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,380
We're not catching any.

705
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,150
Did we choose the wrong time?

706
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,470
What is that?

707
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:34,080
So, getting a photo taken 50 days before you turn 35

708
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,390
has been a tradition at the studio?

709
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,010
What a strange tradition.

710
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:49,780
   

711
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,250
Open the aperture. This lets you zoom in and out.

712
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,770
And this lets you focus.

713
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,730
Would you like to try it?

714
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,990
Yes.

715
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,390
Like this...

716
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,960
Open the aperture. Zoom in and out.

717
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,580
Focus.

718
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:44,010
It's not working.

719
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,050
Are you sure you can take the best photo of my life?

720
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,760
Are we in the Joseon era or something?

721
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,050
Who uses stuff like this?

722
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,580
Can't we take one with a phone?

723
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,270
I think the picture quality would be a lot better on the phone.

724
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:58,540
This is the tradition.

725
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,810
Have a seat. I'll try to take a good one.

726
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,130
- Mr. Seo. 
 - Yes?

727
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:41,960
- Are you a robot? 
 - Well...

728
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,660
So try to be a little...

729
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,610
Try to relax a bit.

730
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,190
Smile.

731
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,540
No, like this. Smile. Like this.

732
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,800
Gosh, what do I do?

733
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,170
I've only taken photos of others.

734
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,990
It's my first time sitting here.

735
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:10,410
This guy is hopeless.

736
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,650
We should practice first.

737
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,210
Look.

738
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:21,590
A selfie is a pinnacle of photography.

739
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,620
Let's see.

740
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,050
So cute.

741
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,010
Bom.

742
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,610
Yes?

743
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:09,110
The world I live in is loud, scary,

744
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:11,490
and unpredictable.

745
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:18,580
You'll be meeting more dead people than live ones.

746
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,940
Sounds like a new experience.

747
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,340
The nights will be more fierce than the days.

748
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,530
Sounds thrilling.

749
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,430
I like you...

750
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:01,060
today, tomorrow, and the days after...

751
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:04,920
until there is a tomorrow.

752
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,220
Would you be okay with a man...

753
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:13,140
who'd be running away soon?

754
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,280
♫  No, I think it was meant to be  ♫

755
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,960
Well, Mr. Seo—

756
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:24,270
The last one was practice.

757
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,130

 Go camping with your new boyfriend.

 Since when was it? 

778
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,600
 You start becoming an evil spirit if your resentment for the world grows.

 If he can't accept his death and becomes an evil spirit,

 he'll hurt a lot more people.
