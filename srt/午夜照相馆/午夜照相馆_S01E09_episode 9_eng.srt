00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,690
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,410
​♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:14,400
♫  Why I don't want to let go of your memories?  ♫

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,670
   

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,520
   

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,600
   

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,980
   

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,860
♫  You hear me, I will call your name today too  ♫

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,460
   

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,200
   

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
   

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,630
 Why are you giving this to me? 

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,830
 Did you forget the fiftieth-day tradition? 

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,520
 The fiftieth day is still far away. 

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,890
 I'm just suggesting preparing in advance. 

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,470
 You said to go to the Pitcairn Islands together. 

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,860
 You wanted to live together there. Why are we taking this now? 

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,480
 Don't you know this is for a funeral? 

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,150
 You never know what will happen in life. 

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,270
 Hey, I'm letting you do this because I trust you the most. 

21
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,070
 Seriously. 

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,540
 Okay. Take a good one. I'll check. 

23
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,930
 By chance, by a very slim chance, if you die, 

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,240
 you have to come back to the studio. 

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,710
 Promise me now. 

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,670


27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,250
 The photographer can't come back. 

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,340
 The studio is for people who have died. 

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,050
 The photographer lives using the power of the camera 

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,800
 so he's neither alive nor dead. 

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 So no matter how badly you want to, you can't open the gate of the dead. 

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,820
 Hey, you'd better take a good one. 

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,860
 Think of it as the last one. 

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,210
 What do you think? Does it look good? 

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,470
 I don't know. It doesn't work. I think it broke. 

36
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,850
 What do you mean it broke? There's no way. 

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,890
 I just got it yesterday. It's brand new. 

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,730
 Return it then. 

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,140
 I don't like it, Uncle. 

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,460
 That little... 

41
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,440
   

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,770
Do this and...

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,360
do it like this.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
- And... 
 - Excuse me.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,100
♫  The glittering raindrops are falling and caressing me  ♫

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:27,660
♫  They embrace me warmly as if I'm dreaming  ♫

47
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,010
Well, Bom, you're a very impressive person.

48
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,100
You get involved in someone else's life plans.

49
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,210
I really tried not to leave anything behind.

50
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,180
See? I told you not to be so sure.

51
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,390
Life doesn't go as planned.

52
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,480
You probably don't know how difficult it was...

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,620
​♫  Love you  ♫

54
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,270
...for me to make the decision.

55
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,360
I'll take a good photo for you. Go and have a seat.

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:09,310
♫  I feel like I can do anything on the days we meet  ♫

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll take it now.

58
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,190
One, two, three.

59
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,000
Wh-What did you press, exactly?

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,230
Well, I just did what you told me to do.

61
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,900
Why don't we just check?

62
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,010
Hold on.

63
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,870
I...

64
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,110
d-don't want to take photos.

65
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,750
I don't need them.

66
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,240
Wh-Why not?

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,490
You said it's a tradition to get photos taken.

68
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,200
You're worried I took bad ones. Right?

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,710
- Let's check. 
 - Well...

70
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,800
- It's okay. 
 - Let's just check?

71
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,210
- It's okay. 
 - Why? Well...

72
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,850
- Let's just check. 
 - I said it's okay–

73
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,290
Mr. Seo, you're quite the ladies' man, aren't you?

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,670
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

75
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,440
Wh-What do you mean on purpose? It's because of the camera.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,740
 Mr. Seo. 

77
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,750
 Mr. Seo! 

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,830
Why are we hiding?

79
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,580
I don't know. I just felt like we should.

80
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,790
Go in there for now.

81
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,470
Oh?

82
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,710
Where did this guy go?

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,560
Geez, he's never around when I look for him.

84
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,490
Gosh, I dozed off for a second.

85
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,610
Am I sleepy because I have a lot to do?

86
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,700
- You came. 
 - You had one visitor today.

87
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,380
No.

88
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,770
T-There have been many lately.

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,750
One yesterday. One the day before.

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,000
You haven't done much lately.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,180
- Deputy Go. 
 - Yes?

92
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,400
People say you don't know how to read the room. Right?

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,950
Y-You are the first person to tell me that.

94
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,360
I have also prepared a team dinner perfectly on my own.

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,220
A team dinner? Why have another? We just had one last week.

96
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,400
Mr. Baek caught his killer.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,060
By the way, Mr. Baek is kind of strange.

98
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,300
- What do you mean? 
 - Mr. Baek...

99
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
is refusing to go home.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,040
The public servant who used to go home on the dot to see his wife refuses to go home.

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,390
- Really? 
 - Is he having a midlife crisis?

102
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,600
By the way, do you know where Bom is?

103
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,110
The lights were off at her place.

104
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,440
Hey, how am I supposed to know that?

105
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,230
Don't you know how late it is? She must be sleeping.

106
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,600
Why don't we go without them for now?

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
Hey.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,450
I'll do a deep cleaning here and be there.

109
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,420
Go there and get things ready.

110
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,080
I cleaned this morning.

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,540
- Why don't we do it together– 
 - No! No!

112
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,600
I wouldn't be doing this if you did it properly.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,350
- Okay. 
 - Hey!

114
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,930
I cleaned the floor here. Go that way.

115
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,860
Geez, I need to take a detour.

116
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,820
Bom.

117
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,580
He's gone.

118
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,250
- Is he gone? 
 - Yes.

119
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,800
Thank goodness.

120
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,560
   

121
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,960
You can finally leave, Mr. Baek.

122
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,780
Oh, right! Your wife received the flowers. Right?

123
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,140
   

124
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,420
I missed you, Na Rae.

125
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,870
How did you find me here?

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,150
- Didn't you order these flowers? 
 - Me?

127
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,140
It only had your name without the sender's name.

128
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,370
I thought you did that because you missed me.

129
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,790
- It wasn't me. 
 - It doesn't matter.

130
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,580
Whomever it was, I got to see your face.

131
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,040
Your face looks so worn.

132
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,490
Na Rae...

133
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,370
are you okay?

134
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,040
Sir, please don't call me anymore.

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,750
Don't come here like this either.

136
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,050
I feel uncomfortable.

137
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,830
When will you leave?

138
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,130
You'll take a photo with your wife. Right?

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,510
Fire! Fire!

140
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,040
Why is the lettuce on the grill?

141
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,680
Why are you two coming together?

142
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,310
- Huh? 
 - Pardon?

143
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,950
Oh, o-on the first floor–

144
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,900
T-The thing is, I wanted to drink coffee in the morning,

145
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,990
but Mr. Seo happened to be preparing to go home.

146
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,440
That's how we came together.

147
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,090
This early in the morning?

148
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,160
- Deputy Go. 
 - Yes?

149
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,940
There are many coffee shops that are open 24 hours.

150
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,800
There isn't one here.

151
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,340
Detective Baek, I heard you finally caught the culprit. Congratulations.

152
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,770
Yes, thank you.

153
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,210
The meat is burning. Have a seat.

154
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,450
Stop moving.

155
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,400
What are you doing right now?

156
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,910
Do you want to kill us with the safe zone?

157
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,520
Stay away from each other, you two.

158
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,290
Be far apart from each other. Hurry.

159
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,670
That was a close one. Have a seat. Sit.

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,280
Eat before it cools down.

161
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,540
How about mine?

162
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,360
Eat this one.

163
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,760
Did you drop off the visitor's family safely?

164
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,190
Yes. She said there was no way her husband cheated.

165
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,000
She went back, crying loudly.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,940
- Cheated? 
 - He came while you were catching Park Doo Chil.

167
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,930
He came to share the last moment with his loved one.

168
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,240
The problem is...

169
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,810
he couldn't decide which one.

170
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,540
 An affair? 

171
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,510
 Honey, did you have an affair with that bitch? 

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,740
 Babe, didn't you say you loved me? 

173
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,960
 Well, Visitor. You must decide now. 

174
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,720
 Which one do you want to take a photo with? 

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,620
 With me, of course, Oppa. 

176
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,460
 Come to your senses, Honey. 

177
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,820
 What are you looking at? Look at me. 

178
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,920
 - Honey. 
 - Come here. 

179
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,680
 Hold on! 

180
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,000
 I'm not sure. 

181
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,620
Who did he end up taking it with?

182
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,500
His wife, of course. Right?

183
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,060
There's nothing more desperate than love.

184
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,580
He left comfortably holding his girlfriend's hand.

185
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,740
I need to get going.

187
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,100
Where did you say it was?

188
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,080
- Pardon? 
 - The flower shop.

189
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,670
Gosh, it's cold.

190
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,970
Why is it so cold in the middle of summer?

191
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,880
Feeling cold makes me hungry.

192
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,990
What's this smell?

193
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,960
- Should I try some? 
 - Bam!

194
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,260
It still has thirty seconds to go.

195
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,460
You're supposed to cook pork belly for a minute and thirty seconds, flipping once–

196
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,210
Who's the little brat–

197
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,580
Hey, how could you eat this alone?

198
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,250
Three people live here, how could you eat this just the two of you?

199
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,250
Mr. Seo, I didn't think you were like this.

200
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,280
T-The intern girl...

201
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,880
I thought you were working late today.

202
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,500
You're not even interested when your only roommate is coming home.

203
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Oh, were you busy dating?

204
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,830
Dating, my foot.

205
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,360
I was going to call you, anyway. Sit, sit.

206
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,070
But why are you sitting so far apart from each other?

207
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,710
Gosh, why are you so shy at your age?

208
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,760
Go! Go!

209
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,710
Why is the intern girl here?

210
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,400
What's wrong with this?

211
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,340
And why is the table leg broken?

212
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,680
Hey, don't you work late too often these days?

213
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,550
How could they make you go home in the morning?

214
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,280
That chief is no good.

215
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,070
There's someone worse than the chief.

216
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
A ghost bastard.

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,700
Which company do you work for?

218
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,240
Oh, I wonder if you know it.

219
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,500
It's called Onjeong Foods.

220
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,870
   

221
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,110
Ji Won always got good grades since she was a kid. 
    

222
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,160
She used to work for a bigger corporation before.

223
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,960
She would've been a section chief by now if she kept working.

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,540
I know someone who used to work there.

225
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,130
- Really? 
 - Yes.

226
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,000
He tried to have a blind date, but–

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
- Hey! 
 - Pardon?

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,580
- No, no, no. 
 - Are you okay, Mr. Seo?

229
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,710
It's okay. It's okay.

230
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,120
Gosh, what was that?

231
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,070
Didn't a cup move by itself just now?

232
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,680
- Pardon? 
 - What?

233
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,350
Huh?

234
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,550
How could a cup move on its own?

235
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,980
You must be very tired. Go and get some sleep.

236
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,250
Was I mistaken?

237
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,650
- Of course. 
 - Of course.

238
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,490
Anyway, don't even mention the words "blind dates" with me.

239
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,610
I'm so traumatized because of someone who ghosted me even before we met.

240
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
 Hello. 

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,030
 Senior Eun Mi gave me your number. 

242
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,360
 I'm Kim Ji Won. 

243
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,380
 Nice to meet you, too. 

244
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,230
 Nice to meet you, too. 

245
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,990
 I'm Go Seong Ho. 

246
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,870
   

247
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,160
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

248
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,990
By the way,

249
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,220
why are there four glasses?

250
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,980
Same with the utensils too.

251
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,930
Is there anyone else besides us here?

252
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,340
Is it a ghost?

253
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
Gosh, hey.

254
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,000
Hey, what do you mean, a ghost?

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,100
I was kidding.

257
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,010
Gosh, it's cold.

258
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,210
It's tasty. Eat more.

259
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,860
Welcome.

260
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,640
   

261
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,110
I'm sorry. I deserve to die.

262
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,050
I definitely remembered your birthday, Madam.

263
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,540
I even picked up flowers...

264
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,300
I've sinned, and I'm talking too much, Madam.

265
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,200
It's okay. I know you're busy.

266
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,890
So did you catch him?

267
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,390
I did.

268
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,360
I raided and arrested him.

269
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,820
But the problem is...

270
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm afraid I'll get promoted again.

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,870
You'll end up catching all the bad guys in Korea.

272
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,290
I need to catch more.

273
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,700
There are still too many bad guys left.

274
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,710
What are these flowers?

275
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,080
- I got them as a gift. 
 - A gift?

276
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
From what bastard?

277
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,000
I told you.

278
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,350
I was taking a flower arranging class that started this winter.

279
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,830
It's hard to get a new job because of COVID, and I feel lonely.

280
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,660
Honey, should we go get something tasty tomorrow?

281
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,760
Let me buy you a present at a department store, too.

282
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,050
I'll get you something prettier than flowers.

283
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,130
I'll get you a designer sandbag.

284
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,960
You mean a handbag.

285
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,870
 Did you get home safely yesterday– 

286
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,400
 I was kind of out of it yesterday... 

287
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,450
 - Sir.  
 - Welcome.

288
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,000
 - The flowers... 
 - We want to get flowers for a friend's exhibition. 

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,430
 What kind of exhibition? 

290
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,330
 It's a graduation exhibition. 

291
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,200
 - Your graduation? 
 - No, no. It's our friend's. 

292
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,300
 Your friend? Oh, your college classmate? 

293
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,840
 How about... 

294
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,020
 something purple... 

295
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,280
   

296
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,770
 Isn't the sky so pretty? 

297
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,470
 I sent it because it reminded me of you, Na Rae. 

298
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,870
 I'll never make you feel lonely. 

299
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,660
 I love you. I mean it. 

300
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,000
 Me, too. I love you, Min Hyeon. 

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,740
 I told you. I'm taking a flower arranging class starting this winter. 

302
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,960
 It's hard to get a new job because of COVID, and I feel lonely. 

303
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,300
 Thank you for the flowers. I was happy today, thanks to you. 

304
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,350
- Since when? 
 - It's so pretty. I like it.

305
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,090
Since when?

306
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,670
Are you okay?

307
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,870
It's okay.

308
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,790
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

309
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,960
What was that?

310
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,500
- We'll come back some other time. 
 - I'll prepare a nice one next time.

311
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,710
Yes, thank you.

312
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,650
Sir, when did you come in?

313
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,910
I'm sorry. I don't think you can buy flowers now.

314
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,580
It's okay.

315
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm here to look for someone.

316
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,700
Oh, I see.

317
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,920
It's soju.

318
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,970
I burned incense over it. Drink it.

319
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,020
Someone I know drinks it whenever they're having a hard time.

320
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,680
It doesn't taste too bad.

321
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,500
Since Na Rae told me to make sure to catch him,

322
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,920
I had no choice but to come back.

323
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,010
So she wouldn't have to blame herself forever for saying that.

324
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,260
But what she actually wanted to do was...

325
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,330
ask for a divorce.

326
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,810
We were together for eight years, including when we dated.

327
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,610
I thought I knew her better than anyone,

328
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,690
but I don't recognize the Na Rae I'm seeing right now.

329
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,590
The face I used to see every day seems unfamiliar.

330
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,360
I think I might actually kill someone at this rate.

331
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,600
Do you want me to kill him?

332
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,970
I could make a ghost show up at his home and give him nightmares.

333
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,030
I could bring a few evil spirits to the flower shop and make him die slowly.

334
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,560
I could have him possessed and make him go crazy.

335
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,830
What would you like me to do?

336
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,540
That'd be a crime.

337
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,730
But...

338
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,610
it's better than you turning into an evil spirit.

339
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,860
You know you'll become an evil spirit if you resent this world deeply.

340
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,110
Just like Choi Hoon.

341
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,820
We don't have a visitor tomorrow. I'll let you rest for a few days.

342
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,400
Think carefully...

343
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
about what you want to do.

344
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,990
 Mr. Seo, did you have lunch? 

345
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,400
 Yes. 

346
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,720
 What's for dinner tonight? 

347
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,430
 Work. 

348
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,750
 Good luck. Fighting. 

349
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,660
 Okay. 

350
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,100
Okay?

351
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,560
Did he say "Okay" again?

352
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,910
How come he never writes more than three syllables?

353
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,940
Geez, seriously.

354
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,110
Attorney Han.

355
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,010
Hey, Senior.

356
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,650
Do you have a trial today?

357
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,760
Yes, it's an urgent commercial building lawsuit. I need to eat quickly and go.

358
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,210
You've been suspicious lately.

359
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,820
The Yoon So Myeong case and the Choi Hoon case. How are you getting so many cases?

360
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,960
Having the law firm next to the photo studio...

361
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,310
Did opening the law firm up on that hill really work?

362
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,950
Senior.

363
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,400
This is just between you and me.

364
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,600
There's a world even Lee Hyeon Oh can't reach.

365
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,410
I guess you could call it the night world.

366
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,530
Are you very stressed out lately?

367
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,800
Because Lee Hyeon Oh became the minister?

368
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,050
 Please tell us how you feel. 

369
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,370
 I'll have a sense of duty in every moment and case... 

370
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,190
I am stressed out.

371
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,660
Senior, what do you think of a man with short answers? Look.

372
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,220
   

373
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,440
Is he playing hard to get with me?

374
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,170
Hey, how can you joke right now?

375
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,580
Lee Hyeon Oh became the minister.

376
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,280
Whatever. I won't get involved with him anymore.

377
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,560
There's a market with no competition that he has no idea about.

378
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,100
No competition?

379
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,800
Okay. That's good to hear.

380
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,690
I'm sleepy. Seriously...

381
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,070
   

382
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,000
What? He never calls me.

383
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,190
Seriously.

384
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,410
   

385
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,270
No, this would make me look desperate.

386
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,520
Let's not worry and go to sleep.

387
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,050
How could he not contact me once all day?

388
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,290
No, I should sleep.

389
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,560
Doesn't he miss me?

390
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,970
Hello?

391
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,090
Were you sleeping?

392
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,380
Yes, I was.

393
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,460
I miss you.

394
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,930
Yes, me, too.

395
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,350
 Why don't you come out for a second then? 

396
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,620
Pardon?

397
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,540
I'm in front of your house.

398
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,980
♫  A mild breeze  ♫

399
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,930
Hey, I'm sorry.

400
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,750
Gosh, my pajamas.

401
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,200
♫  A small bird is whispering  ♫

402
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,900
♫  Your kindhearted eyes that hold the sunset  ♫

403
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,560
What is it? You didn't contact me once yesterday.

404
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,230
I thought you forgot that we were dating.

405
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,270
I was afraid I wouldn't want to work if I did.

406
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,510
I came as soon as I closed.

407
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,660
The tent you bought to go camping with your ex.

408
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,800
Do you still have it?

409
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,740
Yes, I do. I never got to go camping once–

410
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,210
♫  Just the two of us  ♫

411
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,690
Hold on. Are you already jealous?

412
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:22,950
Why don't you go camping with your new boyfriend with that?

413
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,410
I'm asking you out on a date.

414
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:33,290
♫  On the boat called love under the night sky, let's dream  ♫

415
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:39,580
♫  Without anyone knowing, just you and me  ♫

416
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,780
What will you do with the studio?

417
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,530
Deputy Go will take care of it.

418
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,290
Why are you tagging along with Ms. Han on her business trip?

419
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:03,030
Well, I need to meet someone who died in her case.

420
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,660
And that happened to be the West Coast?

421
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,210
They fell into the ocean and died, apparently.

422
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,130
Didn't you say they fell off a mountain earlier?

423
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,460
They fell off a mountain, rolled down, fell into the ocean, and died.

424
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,690
You can't go.

425
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,270
I can't manage this place on my own.

426
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,370
She's your first love. Right?

427
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,630
- No. 
 - I should ask her.

428
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,900
I'll ask her if she knows Deputy Go of Onjeong Foods.

429
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,810
O-O-Okay.

430
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,130
I'll watch the studio. I will.

431
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,310
Don't cause trouble. Okay?

432
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,780
Instead, you can never tell Ji Won that I'm the Deputy Go Seong Ho.

433
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,130
Well, do you think Deputy Go will be okay alone?

434
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,980
We don't have a visitor today, anyway. We hardly get anyone lately.

435
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,640
Should I return the car if you're worried?

436
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,090
Mr. Seo, it's about time Deputy Go works on his own. Let's keep going.

437
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:19,410
 Enter the North Expressway on the right in a moment. 

438
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,970
Mr. Seo! Turn the blinkers on!

439
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,580
You do have a driver's license. Right?

440
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,420
Of course.

441
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,490
It's just my first time driving since getting one.

442
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,590
When did you get it?

443
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,950
Was it when I was 20 or 21?

444
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,680
Mr. Seo, stop the car.

445
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,340
It's okay.

446
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,550
I might not look like it, but I got the perfect score for the written exam.

447
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,040
No, stop the car.

448
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,000
 Enter the highway on the right. 

449
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Use the turn signal when you switch lanes and...

450
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,040
using the side-view mirror... I'm sorry...

451
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,650
Try again. Use the turn signal and...

452
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,900
- A-Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

453
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,360
How could he scold a sick person?

454
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,730
How could he do that!

455
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,270
I'll be late if I miss that bus.

456
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,760
Gosh, Chief Kim will berate me again.

457
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,090
Excuse me! Hold on...

458
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,830
Hold on.

459
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,820
Aren't you getting on?

460
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,430
I'll get on, but...

461
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,310
H-How much is the fare?

462
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,640
- 1,300 won. 
 - Right...

463
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,380
How much would it be if I transfer?

464
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,460
- It depends on where you go. 
 - Just one moment.

465
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,590
Aren't you getting on?

466
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,210
Thank you.

467
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,740
I am not. Drive safely.

468
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,040
What a crazy bastard.

469
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,370
- Fighting! 
 - Me?

470
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,370
What?

471
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,140
Could I have an iced latte?

472
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,330
It will be 12,000 won.

473
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,530
Let me ring you up.

474
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,330
Hello.

475
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,690
I'll have three iced Americanos,

476
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,680
three iced lattes,

477
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,050
an espresso Frappuccino with extra whipped cream,

478
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,520
an iced vanilla latte,

479
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,770
and a normal coffee?

480
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,440
Oh, that's for Chief Kim.

481
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,250
He calls instant coffee "normal coffee."

482
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,650
It will be 38,000 won.

483
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,370
- How did you know? 
 - You're in the marketing team. Right?

484
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,760
- Yes. 
 - They order from us often.

485
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,510
I'll deliver them to the office.

486
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,570
You can go back now.

487
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,250
Well, I'm okay.

488
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,110
This is on the house.

489
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,190
It's very good for you. Don't share with anyone else.

490
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,460
Something is really strange.

491
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,440
 Chief Kim... 

492
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,670
 gets crankier when his blood sugar drops. 

493
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:15,390
 Supply him with enough sugar. Fighting. 

494
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,080
He must know my team very well.

495
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,890
 Pull the yearly sales records for the past ten years and the ads that got the highest CTR 

496
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,820
 and come up with ideas to improve the brand recognition for the menu set. 

497
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,380
When will I finish analyzing ten years of sales records?

498
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,580
I have no chance of going home on time today either.

499
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,820
I feel energized a bit.

500
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,810
Let's get started.

501
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,600
   

502
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,140
Oh?

503
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,040
Deputy.

504
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,850
 Chief Kim... 

505
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,330
 likes cool-looking things. 

506
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,290
 Make the cover eye-catching. 

507
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,020
 And this is a gift. 

508
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,220
 I recommend Doteum for the font. Fighting. 

509
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,590
Is this my lucky day or what?

510
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,710
I suspect a tragic ending.

511
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,330
This is...

512
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,750
the only way for me to beg for forgiveness.

513
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,870
   

514
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,340
2:10.

515
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,360
He went into the studio at 11:00 p.m. and came out at two in the morning.

516
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,260
Three hours.

517
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,920
Senior, did you stake out, too?

518
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,550
What time do photo studios normally close?

519
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,420
It doesn't take long to get a photo taken. Right?

520
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,710
Do they close around eight or something?

521
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,470
It probably takes thirty minutes maximum for a photo shoot.

522
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,840
I staked out in front of this photo studio for three days,

523
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,810
but I've never seen the owner coming out during the day.

524
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,920
He also only gets one or two customers at night.

525
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,550
It is strange.

526
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,560
Is it some kind of illegal business?

527
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,260
I keep thinking there's something more.

528
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,940
That neighborhood is really strange.

529
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,700
A cat died again, apparently.

530
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,750
I think some bastard has been killing all the stray cats.

531
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,540
Maybe we have a serial killer.

532
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,020
 Deviated from the route. Starting to reroute. 

533
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,340
Hey!

534
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,030
Hey! Hey! Hey! Please...

535
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,480
Please come to your senses!

536
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,920
I think we ran out of gas.

537
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,760
It took us five hours when it was supposed to take two hours. That's why.

538
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,320
How did you get a driver's license, Mr. Seo?

539
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,930
Stay in the car.

540
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,320
I'll go get some gas at a gas station nearby.

541
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,170
The nearest gas station is more than 10 km away.

542
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,080
To get to the West Coast within the day–

543
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,690
But we don't have to camp by the ocean.

544
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,550
I heard stargazing is trendy these days.

545
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,820
Should we gaze at stars together?

546
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:58,360
♫  The glittering raindrops are falling and caressing me  ♫

547
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:08,990
♫  They embrace me warmly as if I'm dreaming  ♫

548
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,700
♫  It feels like that whenever I'm with you  ♫

549
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,870
Are you okay?

550
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,010
Well, yes.

551
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,730
♫  Just like going on a trip somewhere far away  ♫

552
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,570
I think you'd be helping by doing nothing.

553
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,840
I don't want to hear that from such a poor driver.

554
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,310
♫  It makes my heart flutter  ♫

555
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,230
♫  Oh, I love you  ♫

556
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,930
Would you like some ramen? 
  (Equivalent of "watch Netflix and chill") 

557
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,510
♫   Like a dream   ♫

558
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,910
What? Why do you sound so cute?

559
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,570
Did you practice that?

560
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,880
♫  On the days we meet  ♫

561
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,300
Mr. Seo, don't move.

562
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,550
What?

563
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,250
What are you doing right now?

564
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,000
- What? 
 - The noodles aren't cooked yet.

565
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,250
You can't turn it off yet.

566
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,560
You scared me.

567
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,550
Three minutes and thirty seconds is the optimal ramen cooking time.

568
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,840
What are you saying?

569
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,890
The noodles are best when they are fully cooked.

570
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,420
Are you ignoring the expert's opinion?

571
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,680
Half-cooked noodles are an insult to noodles.

572
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,160
Do you want to get sued for insulting?

573
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,480
I think you mean defamation.

574
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,200
If you don't like it, cook it yourself.

575
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,840
What?

576
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,610
You're the reason I'm eating ramen here.

577
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:54,520
I should try some since you put effort into it.

578
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,410
It's good.

579
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,480
What happened? You must've cooked ramen for a few women.

580
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,140
There was a visitor who only ate al dente noodles.

581
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,500
She was a picky eater with a bad temper.

582
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,040
She used to get angry so easily.

583
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,780
Thanks to her, everything in the studio was destroyed.

584
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,110
She must've been a thug.

585
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,390
No.

586
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,220
It was a 12-year-old kid.

587
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,650
You mean you got bullied by a 12-year-old?

588
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,030
She wasn't just a normal elementary schooler.

589
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,160
Thinking about it, I almost died when I was 12, too.

590
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,890
We got into a car accident on the way to Grandma's house.

591
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:52,650
Both my parents died, and only I survived.

592
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,770
It took me two months to wake up since I lost consciousness.

593
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,650
My grandma prayed at the temple every day.

594
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,580
She told Buddha it's okay if I become stupid

595
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,840
or never have functioning legs again

596
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,740
as long as I wake up.

597
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,960
Her prayer worked.

598
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:22,530
Instead, I ended up with this glorious wound.

599
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,690
- Let me see.
 - You can't. It's really ugly.

600
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,760
Let me see.

601
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,400
I think it's just a passing rain.

602
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,920
Stay right here. I'll go clean up.

603
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,860
You don't want to catch a cold.

604
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,660
♫  Do you think we met by coincidence?  ♫

605
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:36,820

Geez, seriously.

00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,860
Don't they have any conscience?

618
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,700
They're on a trip, and someone is taking a day off

619
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,460
while I'm feeling depressed.

620
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:02,000
I told him to put these away once he's done. He just won't listen.

621
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,390
Wh-Wh-What's he always looking at? What is it?

622
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:13,440
 I suddenly started seeing bodies of cats in front of the studio. 

623
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,850
 The ancestor called that the shadow of death. 

624
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,750
Does it happen before the photographers die?

625
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,680
Gosh, Mr. Seo has plenty of time left, then.

626
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,360
The studio is so peaceful, and the camera is here.

627
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,610
How could the evil spirit come in here?

628
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:10,190
Wh-Who is it? Who is it?

629
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,100
Wh-What's this?

630
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,850
Wh-What's...

631
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,430
Where's the camera?

632
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,470
The camera!

633
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,640
Where is it?

634
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:58,500
I still have plenty left on my bucket list.

635
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,610
I said I can't manage the studio alone!

636
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,380
Come back quickly, Mr. Seo!

637
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,280
Bom, are you up?

638
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,260
Bom?

639
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,020
I'll open the tent, Bom.

640
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,990
Where did she go?

641
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,390
I just got this yesterday.

642
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,210
But she doodled on it.

643
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,400
What is she, a kid? 
     

644
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,880
She acts just like Jang Soo–

645
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,280
 D-Did the annoying visitor who doodles do those? 

646
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,870
   

647
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,490
- No way... 
   - Our first date today. 

648
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,590
 Seo Ki Joo is only good at making ramen. 

649
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,000
♫  With my eyes open  ♫

650
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:06,790
♫  Pacing back and forth by the window  ♫

651
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,570
♫  You exist in every little moment  ♫

652
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,670
Mr. Seo!

653
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,400
 Seo Ki Joo! 

654
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,370
 Thinking about it, I almost died when I was 12, too. 

655
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,790
♫  The smiley face  ♫

656
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:34,140
♫  And the tears behind it  ♫

657
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,120
♫  It perhaps resembles mine  ♫

658
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,780
 Both my parents died and only I survived. 

659
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,110
 It took me two months to wake up since I lost consciousness. 

660
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,310
By chance...

661
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:56,060
♫  Because I couldn't do what I wanted to do for you  ♫

662
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:03,460
♫  Even if my feelings for you come back  ♫

663
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,320
♫  In every moment of my life, I'll only stay by your side  ♫

664
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,480
What? Did you come here looking for me?

665
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,240
You couldn't wait even for a moment?

666
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,110
You can't sleep because you miss me. Right?

667
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,700
♫  ...like this  ♫

668
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,560
Jang Soo.

669
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,390
That was my nickname when I was a kid.

670
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,830
How did you know?

671
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,410
Did Ji Won tell you?

672
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,970
That scar...

673
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,310
Can I have a look at it?

674
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,250
Fine.

675
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,920
But you can't call it ugly. Okay?

676
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,510
You were alive.

677
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,070
Mr. Seo.

678
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,430
You were alive.

679
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,390
So I went to the studio while I was unconscious?

680
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,150
And I was the thuggish kid you mentioned?

681
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,610
I can't even imagine.

682
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,740
I met 15-year-old Seo Ki Joo.

683
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,230
By the way, why don't I remember it?

684
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,520
Because you were unconscious then.

685
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,380
In rare cases, the souls of people who are alive come thinking they are dead.

686
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,120
I thought you had died because you suddenly disappeared.

687
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,550
It's so fascinating.

688
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:32,220
I reunited with Seo Ki Joo at age 35 after seeing him at 15.

689
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,420
Have you heard of something called "timed fate"?

690
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,830
They say all the people you're destined to meet come at a certain time.

691
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,520
You're destined to meet those people, even if you didn't try.

692
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,540
Just like us.

693
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,050
Yes.

694
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,730
What was I like when I was 12?

695
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,990
You were mean.

696
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,780
- Pardon? 
 - You were ill-tempered.

697
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,440
You destroyed everything and threw tantrums.

698
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,040
Seriously.

699
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,980
Are you sure you're happy to see me again?

700
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,530
Thanks to that troublemaker, I survived.

701
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,470
When I didn't want to do anything because Uncle disappeared,

702
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,680
Jang Soo came and caused trouble every day.

703
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,770
So I didn't get a chance to think about Uncle.

704
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,690
I really saved your life, then.

705
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,610
Aren't you so grateful, Seo Ki Joo?

706
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,500
By the way,

707
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,300
why are you talking to me casually since earlier?

708
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,800
I don't think I would've spoken formally due to my temper.

709
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,620
Are you offended? Talk to me casually, too, then.

710
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,340
You really are Jang Soo.

711
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,580
But that ill-tempered kid came back as the safe zone.

712
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,350
Thinking about it, what would you have done if you never met me?

713
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,860
You wouldn't have had the safe zone.

714
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,830
I'm the one who created it. Okay?

715
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,060
What do you mean by that?

716
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,890
Because of a kid who was afraid of ghosts when she was a ghost,

717
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,080
I used salt to...

718
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,710
 create the circle carefully. 

719
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,570
 Stay in this circle. 

720
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,910
 Stay close to me. 

721
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,780
 - Really? 
 - I'll protect you. 

722
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,030
When you disappeared back then,

723
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,590
I really thought you were dead.

724
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,370
But you're by my side now.

725
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,470
That's why the safe zone gets activated when we're together.

726
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,380
Because you created it for me.

727
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,440
Thank you...

728
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,980
for always saving me in dangerous moments.

729
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,530
I want to live a very long time now.

730
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,530
A very long time.

731
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,290
Right, my phone got confiscated.

732
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,030
 Ta-da. 

733
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,070
 You're the first person I'm giving it to. 

734
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,310
 Make sure to come. 

735
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:51,300
Gosh, I'm sure she's waiting for my call.

736
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,780
I should just get going.

737
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,730
 So cold! Did the boiler die again? 

738
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,980
Let's see...

739
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,330
   

740
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,340
You're the one who framed me, aren't you?

741
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,840
Who are you?

742
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,450
I need to stop by somewhere today. I'll be back late.

743
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,030
I'll pick you up if it gets late.

744
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,730
Mr. Seo, you said you're going to the Pitcairn Islands with your uncle. Right?

745
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,410
Go with me if he doesn't come back in time.

746
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,270
I can't help myself because I'm nervous.

747
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,980
The population is small there. You'd be the most handsome man there.

748
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,770
How annoying.

749
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,040
Okay. Let's make sure to go together.

750
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,400
 What's going on... 

751
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,130
 - Look at the window. 
 - Look at it. 

752
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,360
 Look at all the blood. Did they use a brick... 

753
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,840
 Look at that. 

754
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,240
 You haven't found the culprit yet? 

755
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,020
M-Mr. Seo.

756
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,170
Mr. Seo.

757
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,130
What happened?

758
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,580
An evil spirit came last night.

759
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,140
Gosh. It stinks over here.

760
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,140
Mr. Seo, I've been calling you since the crack of dawn. You finally came.

761
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,520
The police searched the studio and interrogated people in the area.

762
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,840
It was a mess.

763
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,720
Yes, I had something to do.

764
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh, I see.

765
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,710
Where were you between two and three in the morning when the incident happened?

766
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,380
- I was outside of Seoul. 
 - I see.

767
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,760
Who could prove your alibi?

768
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,570
Am I a suspect?

769
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,040
No.

770
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,750
Oh, I'm investigating the case now.

771
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,890
We've been receiving calls about cats getting killed lately.

772
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,300
According to our investigation,

773
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,740
all the cats were strangely killed around your photo studio.

774
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,090
But...

775
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,780
it happened in front of your house this time.

776
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,650
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

777
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,320
Yes.

778
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,750
Are you saying I'm the culprit right now?

779
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,610
I wouldn't have done this unless I'm crazy.

780
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,130
Why would I have ruined my studio?

781
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:21,050
I didn't say you're the culprit.

782
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,900
Please leave if you have nothing to say. I have a business to run.

783
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,500
When do you open?

784
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,170
- Probably the same as other businesses. 
 - Apparently not.

785
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,830
You open at night and close at dawn. You only have one or two customers, too.

786
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,240
Mr. Seo,

787
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,130
do you know what we call a place like this?

788
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,460
A fake storefront.

789
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,720
What are you trying to disguise, exactly?

790
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,110
Please leave.

791
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:54,770
A terrorist attack like this is usually committed by someone

792
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,700
antisocial with a twisted desire to exhibit themselves.

793
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,170
For example, someone who frequents the police station

794
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:07,490
or claims attention by causing trouble often.

795
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:13,920
An officer should investigate, not hypothesize.

796
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,580
I agree.

797
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,660
I'll be in touch again.

798
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,440
Don't move to a different place again.

799
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:33,670
M-Mr. Seo, are you okay?

800
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,770
- Where's the camera? 
 - Thankfully, the evil spirit couldn't enter the studio.

801
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,780
B-But the fact that an evil spirit came this far means–

802
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:46,660
It means my death is approaching.

803
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,720
   

804
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,720
Tell Ms. Han that we got robbed or something.

805
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,600
Okay.

806
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:27,950
   

807
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,770
 I'm busy because the studio got robbed. 

808
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,980
 Take your time coming back. 

809
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,200
 Was anything stolen? 

810
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,810
 I'll come home quickly and help. 

811
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,610
 It's okay. There are many helping hands here. 

812
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,790
Mr. Baek,

813
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,750
what took you so long?

814
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,970
Why are you back so late?

815
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,010
Seriously...

816
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:10,760
I could've gotten killed.

817
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,620
I almost died twice! I'm serious.

818
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,200
Hey, that's enough now. Okay?

819
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,870
I-I think it's the evil spirit again!

820
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:49,420
The one who framed me for murder came to my house yesterday and killed me.

821
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,950
If I don't catch him now...

822
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,400
Prosecutor.

823
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,790
Prosecutor Han Bom. Please let me meet her.

824
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,020
I need to speak to her.

825
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,180
I need to tell her that I saw the real culprit.

826
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:11,750
Hold on. The suspect for the Ahnjin Vacation Home murder from a few years ago.

827
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,850
Kim Yoon Cheol, right?

828
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,930
He is an evil spirit, isn't he?

829
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,010
A few years ago?

830
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,340
What do you mean? I got released yesterday.

831
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,010
Visitor, what year is it now?

832
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,020
Of course, it's 2019.

833
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:35,960
It's 2023 right now.

834
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,830
No way.

835
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,980
What?

836
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,560
No.

837
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,310
No.

838
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,030
No.

839
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,890
No. No. No...

840
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,640
- No... 
 - Visitor.

841
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,540
It's okay. Let us help you.

842
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,990
- Visitor! 
 - No!

843
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,280
Stop!

844
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,240
Mr. Seo, are you okay?

845
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,680
He mentioned being framed.

846
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,550
He must be the murderer.

847
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:43,060
Staying on the path of the netherworld for long can blur your memory.

848
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:49,440
Kim Yoon Cheol might not be sure if he killed someone or not.

849
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,690
What would happen if his anger grows uncontrollably?

850
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,090
Would he become an evil spirit by chance?

851
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,150
We need to prevent it from happening.

852
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,290
Whether he's the real culprit or not,

853
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:05,380
make sure he doesn't meet Ms. Han.

854
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,220
I can't put her in danger again.

855
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,890
We might need to destroy him.

856
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,040
Destroy?

857
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,940
Let's split up and look first.

858
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,710
I...

859
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,530
You should stay back at the studio.

860
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,450
Let's go.

861
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,190
No.

862
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,740
   

863
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,680
No.

864
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:50,660
   

865
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,170
Hello, Sir.

866
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,080
Hello, you came.

867
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,910
- Is the photo ready? 
 - Yes.

868
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,900
It turned out very nicely.

869
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,230
Wow, it did turn out nicely.

870
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:04,390
I wonder who took it. It's the best photo of his life.

871
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,810
Ms. Han, what are you doing right now?

872
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,880
Deputy Go.

873
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,300
Why are you hanging Mr. Seo's photo here?

874
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:32,300
Well, I heard getting a photo taken before turning 35 is a tradition.

875
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,000
It's a funeral photo.

876
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,600
All of these people here...

877
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,600
died before they turned thirty-five.

878
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:51,010
   

879
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,660
You're still up.

880
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:29,160
I almost died...

881
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,280
because I missed you.

882
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,490
Mr. Seo,

883
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,970
are you going to die?

884
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,400
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

885
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,070
Did you make me take your funeral photo?

886
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:05,820
♫  I don't want to lose memories of you  ♫

887
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,630
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

888
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,640
♫  Tell me why  ♫

889
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,950
♫  So that the long night can pass  ♫

890
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:24,520
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

891
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,060
♫  Your traces won't disappear  ♫

892
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,710
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

893
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:35,860
♫  Until my heart reaches you  ♫

894
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,500
♫  You told me we'd never  ♫

895
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,850
♫  I'll call your name  ♫

896
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,800
   

897
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:50,400
   

898
01:08:55,010 --> 01:09:02,000


899
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,950
 I'll never die like this. 

900
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,110
 The bastard who killed me... 

901
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:13,920
 I need to find him. 

902
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,120
 This is so unfair. 

903
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,960
 Someone, please help me! 

904
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,340
 Please! 

905
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,500
   

906
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,780
 Do you think it was easy for me to accept this damned curse? 

907
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:50,860
 You shouldn't have made me take your funeral photo. 

908
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,260
 He chose to die. Why did he return? 

909
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,440
 Kim Yoon Cheol, the suspect of the vacation home murder? 

910
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,160
 What if someone has been planning this from the beginning? 

911
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,080
 I'll kill you! 

912
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,310
 I'll find him, no matter what. 

913
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,180
 Because that was my uncle's last request.
