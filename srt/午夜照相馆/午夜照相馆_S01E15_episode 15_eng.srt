♫  I still wonder why  ♫

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,390
​♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,340
♫  I don't want to forget your memories  ♫

♫  You hear me  ♫

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,860
♫  I will call your name today too  ♫

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,710
   

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,160
   

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,760
   

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,030
   

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,950


15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,670
Here you go.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,570
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,480
By the way, could the curse actually have been lifted?

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,650
Of course, it has.

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,480
You lived past your 35th birthday...

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,400
and your seal is fading, too.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,370
And the evil spirit who tried to kill you disappeared, too.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,510
What evidence could be clearer than that?

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,990
But the camera is still there.

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,870
Same with the studio.

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,460
But you said the visitors aren't coming by anymore.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,030
Seo Nam Gook stole the camera from the Grim Reaper.

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,740
So I thought the Grim Reaper created the curse, too.

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,780
But it was an evil spirit who came to kill me.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,650
He became a monstrous evil spirit trying to steal the camera like Seo Nam Gook did.

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,330
He's not the one who put the curse on me.

31
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,000
I keep feeling nervous.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,190
I think this might not be the end.

33
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,790
Gosh, don't worry.

34
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,520
Mr. Seo, haven't you read a storybook?

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,210
You lift the curse yourself, not the witch who put the curse on you.

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,020
You did a great job lifting the curse...

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,870
and now you just have to live happily ever after.

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,960
Okay?

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Okay.

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,410
And I'll use my muscles if the Grim Reaper appears.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,530
You're all talk.

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,720
Did you laugh?

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,270
Muscles. Should I use my muscles? Huh?

44
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,310
Hold on, I love that face.

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,040
Do it again. I want to photograph it.

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
What? No, I won't do it twice.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,450
Do it again. What did you say you'd do?

48
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,970
Muscles.

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,410
Should I use my muscles? Huh?

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,860
   

51
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,240
No, Mr. Baek!

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,590
Mr. Baek!

53
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,410
Why did you do that? Why?

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,330
Good work, Ki Joo.

55
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,380
Good work.

56
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,820
No, no...

57
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,160
This is not right! This is not right!

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,570
This is not right!

59
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,560
Why is this...

60
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,620
My scar is...

61
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,580
What's going on here?

62
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,440
Mr. Seo, are you okay?

63
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,940
Mr. Seo?

64
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,100
Mr. Baek...

65
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,130
Because of me...

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,850
He tried to kill the evil spirit and...

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,590
It's okay.

68
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,330
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

69
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,810
♫  Tell me why  ♫

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,010
♫  I don't want to lose memories of you  ♫

♫  Tell me why  ♫

73
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,300
♫  Let the long night pass  ♫

74
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,590
♫  I still wonder why, where you are  ♫

75
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,230
How could you do this?

76
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,040
You should've let us throw you a sendoff party, at least.

77
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,280
♫  You told me we'd never change  ♫

78

♫  You hear me? I'll call your name again today  ♫

80
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,420
I'll close the studio...

81
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,650
for the last time.

82
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,630
 After the evil spirit was destroyed, the seal disappeared. 

83
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,710
 The studio's door was sealed,  
    

84
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,300
 and the camera disappeared.  
    

85
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,190
   

86
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,020
 The curse that's been torturing me my whole life ended. 

87
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,020
Come on in.

88
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,510
I heard something strange.

89
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,940
That my late husband is here.

90
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,130
I know this sounds really strange,

91
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,740
but is Oppa really...

92
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,990
here at this place?

93
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,050
Not anymore.

94
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,570
This is what I wanted to give you.

95
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,850
Mr. Baek asked me to give this to you when he was alive.

96
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,780
   

97
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,240
How could this be... 
    

98
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,460
He said he's been planning to do this,

99
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,940
but he couldn't deliver it because he didn't have the courage.

100
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,260
What do you mean...

101
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,740
Mr. Baek Nam Goo...

102
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,000
tried to get divorced.

103
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,770
There's no way.

104
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,930
There's no way he thought this first.

105
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,760
He saw the divorce paper I wrote up. Right?

106
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,210
So, he's lying to make me feel better. Right?

107
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,110
Just be honest with me.

108
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,410
 Don't try to tell Na Rae behind my back. 

109
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,940
 Please just disregard this time. 

110
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,060
 That's the right thing to do. 

111
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,110
Oppa...

112
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,510
is here, isn't he?

113
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,490
No. I'm not sure what you heard,

114
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,580
but Mr. Baek gave this to me while he was alive.

115
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,240
What's certain is that you'd never be able to see him again.

116
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,470
He said you can leave without worries.

117
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,590
He said he was...

118
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,100
happy while he was alive.

119
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,140
He said...

120
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,940
you can become happy now.

121
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,140
♫  I close my eyes  ♫

122
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,770
♫  I try to shake the memory of you again  ♫

123
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,300
 Why do detectives get stabbed all the time? What are you, thugs? 

124
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,040
 Would you have time to get married at this rate? 

125
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,410
 Of course. I'll definitely marry you even if the earth comes to an end. 

126
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,510
 I'll take care of everything else, but you have to do this. 

127
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,020
 Got it. I'll fill out the pages. 

128
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,160
 We'll break the engagement if you can't even do this. 

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,080
 Yes, sir. 

130
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,190
 Don't look. 

131
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,780
♫  How much of you did I erase?  ♫

132
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,010
♫  Is there still more left?  ♫

133
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,400
♫  You still visit me on my empty nights  ♫

134
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,940
   

135
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,570
♫  You left me only faint traces  ♫

136
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,380
♫  I'm so mad at you for leaving me  ♫

137
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,700
♫  I blamed you all night long  ♫

138
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:41,400
♫  But I'm thinking of you again  ♫

139
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,860
It must be all over now, right?

140
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,030
The seal completely disappeared, too.

141
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,890
Let me see.

142
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,320
You're right.

143
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,030
It was a bit faint before,

144
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,830
but now it's completely gone.

145
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,770
By the way, why do you think you still see ghosts?

146
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
Since I've been photographing ghosts for a long time,

147
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,580
I probably have more side effects than other people.

148
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,400
Thank you.

149
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,750
It wouldn't have been possible without you.

150
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,640
But I didn't do anything.

151
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,820
The desire to live

152
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,840
and the hope that I could lift the curse,

153
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,590
they were all from you.

154
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,670
I swear I'll live the best way I can.

155
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,190
On behalf of my uncle and Mr. Baek, who died for me.

156
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,250
So, I have no regrets.

157
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,080
Did you catch a cold?

158
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,830
I feel a bit cold. I must've caught a cold.

159
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,310
You have a fever. I'll go get medicine. Wait here.

160
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,570
No, I'm really okay—

161
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,500
This should be okay. Right?

162
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,110
Mr. Seo will worry if he sees it.

163
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,770
Okay, attention! Attention!

164
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,810
Our intern's name was Won—

165
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,310
It's Kim Ji Won.

166
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,550
That's right. Kim Ji Won.

167
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,880
Everyone has been complimenting your great performance, so...

168
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,360
I decided to...

169
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,790
extend it by three months!

170
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,940
The internship.

171
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,160
I'm extending it because you've been doing great.

172
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,420
Chief, how about the full-time position—

173
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes, that. That's a great question.

174
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,920
- Ye Na! 
 - Yes.

175
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,620
Don't run. Don't run. You'd get hurt.

176
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,710
Yes, come here.

177
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,900
This is our new employee, Ms. Kim Ye Na.

178
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,770
Say hello.

179
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,670
Hello, I'm Kim Ye Na.

180
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,890
Nice to meet you. Fighting!

181
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,070
Applause. Applause. Applause.

182
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,080
Go easy on her even if she makes mistakes since she's new.

183
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,590
Okay, everyone?

184
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,800
Where should Ms. Kim sit? Ji Won or... okay.

185
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,370
Hey, Go Seung Ji, move here.

186
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,930
- Me? 
 - Yes, you sit there, Ms. Kim.

187
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,590
Okay.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,420
Ji Won, hand over your duties to her. Okay?

189
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,990
High five!

190
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,910
Okay, nice.

191
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,890
This is the new employee's document. Keep it safe.

192
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,190
So what if he got me a watch?

193
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,810
You came, the unemployed boss.

194
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,290
Come on. I'm not unemployed.

195
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,880
I'm just taking a break.

196
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,620
That's what unemployed means.

197
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,540
I'm looking into how to send you back.

198
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,110
I'll send you off somehow.

199
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,140
Mr. Seo,

200
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm not planning on leaving.

201
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
You are not?

202
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,430
- If you stay in this world for too long— 
 - I know.

203
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,140
I might get destroyed by an evil spirit,

204
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,960
and I can become an evil spirit, too.

205
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,180
But maybe I won't.

206
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,630
I've only been living according to plans when I was alive.

207
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,760
You can become unemployed if you don't get a job

208
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,100
and you can grow old alone if you don't get married.

209
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,590
I was afraid of things like that.

210
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:58,150
I thought veering off the path would be a disaster.

211
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,090
But the worst thing that could happen to me

212
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,300
is not being able to see someone I love.

213
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,290
Even if I become an evil spirit tomorrow,

214
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,060
I want to hang out with Ji Won today.

215
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,660
But you shouldn't think of it so lightly.

216
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,500
No one knows what happens to a ghost who stays here too long.

217
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,110
I'll take that risk, too.

218
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,760
Because my time belongs to me.

219
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,810
You can just keep assisting me, then.

220
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,800
Mr. Seo,

221
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,170
will you raise my salary, then?

222
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,830
- What? 
 - Pardon?

223
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,360
I provide food and lodging.

224
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,440
Burn more clothes each quarter, then.

225
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,740
How much did you spend on clothes at the Galleria last time?

226
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,350
I only did that once!

227
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,490
You spent five million. Five million.  ($5,000) 

228
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,860
- It was 4.9 million! 
 - That's five million!

229
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,710
What?

230
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,450
He'll generously extend my contract?

231
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,980
Gosh, Chief Kim, that son of a bitch...

232
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,460
Chief Kim really went too far this time.

233
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,740
What will Ji Won do?

234
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,100
 She never got to go home on time. 

235
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,620
 Did you hear the rumor? 

236
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,270
The new employee is apparently Chief Kim's daughter.

237
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,120
 I feel so sorry for Ji Won. 

238
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,530
 I know. 

239
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,000
I hope she doesn't get sick from anger.

240
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,390
When will Chief Kim quit?

241
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,330
Huh? Ji Won, are you okay?

242
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,380
Of course.

243
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,450
I'm sorry, Seong Ho.

244
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,970
We couldn't have our date because of me again.

245
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,610
We were supposed to go to a famous restaurant in Hongdae.

246
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,960
But we're eating kimbap again.

247
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,200
This neighborhood has the best kimbap.

248
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,020
By the way, Ji Won,

249
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,740
did something happen today?

250
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,960
You seem a bit upset.

251
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm curious about something.

252
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,050
You scared off all the interns who worked here,

253
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,060
but why didn't you ever punish Chief Kim?

254
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,980
You must've resented him a lot.

255
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,360
I would've killed him already if I were a ghost.

256
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,850
Maybe I should actually kill him.

257
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,380
The day I died,

258
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,440
Chief Kim was the last person I talked to on the phone.

259
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,480
He was screaming at me.

260
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,750
And I suddenly couldn't breathe.

261
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,470
The sky looked yellow, too.

262
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,630
Whenever I think of that,

263
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,660
it gets hard to breathe.

264
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,500
"I really thought...

265
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,440
I might actually kill...

266
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,620
Chief Kim."

267
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,140
But if I kill him,

268
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,580
I won't be able to finish my bucket list.

269
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,820
What's on your bucket list, Seong Ho?

270
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,850
There are too many.

271
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,570
Since the studio's door was sealed,

272
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,820
I might not be able to go back, apparently.

273
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,010
I might become an evil spirit and disappear.

274
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,580
I don't know what will happen,

275
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,140
but for as long as I can...

276
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,150
can I stay by your side, Ji Won?

277
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,710
C-Can I not?

278
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,390
That won't really work, right?

279
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,730
You're a human...

280
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,050
and I'm a ghost.

281
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,480
How do you kiss a ghost?

282
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,100
Is it here?

283
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,560
A little...

284
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,130
to the left.

285
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,350
Here?

286
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,270
A little...

287
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,330
to the right.

288
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,610
This is...

289
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,970
my first time.

290
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,310
This is...

291
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,400
my last time.

292
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,790
♫  Even if my life ends  ♫

293
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,190
♫  I choose you, it's meant to be  ♫

294
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,000
♫  You're the one person who loved me  ♫

295
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,570
♫  Even if you change your mind after time passes  ♫

296
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,490
♫  I'll love you even more  ♫

297
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,150
♫  Please just be by my side  ♫

298
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,850
   

299
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,040
   

300
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,260
Black moon? What's this?

301
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,370
   

302
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,560
   

303
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,200
   

304
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,390
   

305
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,600
Look over here! 
    

306
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,780
- Peek-a-boo! 
 - Look over here. Over here.

307
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,320
Oh, my goodness. Don't cry.

308
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,670
Peek-a-boo. Look over here.

309
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,140
Here, here. Look.

310
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,560
Goodness, you're so good.

311
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,520
Look over here. Here.

312
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,070
So cute.

313
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,170
One on the left. One in the middle.

314
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,570
And one by the tree.

315
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,040
Why are there so many?

316
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,580
I knew I hadn't seen one for too long.

317
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,250
Hello.

318
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,260
H-Hold on.

319
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,030
Please...

320
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,880
Please, please, please!

321
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,030
Wow, they're not interested in me.

322
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,720
   

323
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,600
According to the late Im Gwan Rok's will,

324
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,250
he wanted his eldest and second eldest sons to split—

325
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,480
Shit, that lady is back.

326
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,210
According to the late Im Gwan Rok's will,

327
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,970
he wanted his eldest and second eldest sons to split land compensation equally.

328
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,420
However, the defendant—

329
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,420
Is she gone?

330
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,350
Why do I keep seeing ghosts these days?

331
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,220
You scared me!

332
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,390
Get me my money back, please?

333
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,610
Gosh, seriously.

334
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,380
That's all.

335
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,470
Plaintiff's attorney, present your case.

336
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,110
   

337
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,420
According to the plaintiff's father, the late In Gwan Rok's will,

338
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,440
he wanted his eldest and second eldest sons to split land compensation equally.

339
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
But the defendant said he gave his father a loan and—

340
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,120
How does that make sense?

341
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,260
How could the eldest and second eldest get the same amount?

342
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,950
The eldest son takes care of his memorial services.

343
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,620
He should get a little more.

344
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,880
He said he needs 300 million won.  ($300k) 

345
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,470
Defendant, do you have an IOU, by chance?

346
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,640
I-I don't.

347
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,620
A parent and a child don't need an IOU. You just go without it.

348
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,640
He's lying.

349
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,420
My older brother owes over 100 million to a private loan company.

350
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,960
How could he have lent money to Father?

351
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,250
- That's what the eldest son says! 
 - Plaintiff, please be quiet.

352
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,630
Be quiet, please.

353
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,500
No, I'm sorry.

354
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,140
Forget about it. Lady, I asked you to get my money back.

355
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
That money is so important.

356
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,730
Ssada Market. Just go to Ssada Market and look for Park Bok Rye.

357
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,340
You've been ignoring me since yesterday.

358
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,820
Lady, I know you see me.

359
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,110
Excuse me.

360
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,850
B-But Plaintiff was the one who's been helping his father.

361
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,340
He's been paying his father a million won  ($1000)  every month for living expenses.

362
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,620
I'll submit the bank transfer record as evidence.

363
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,930
How can you be like this?

364
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,700
You need to at least look if an elder is talking to you.

365
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,000
Don't be rude!

366
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,730
Attorney Han, what are you doing?

367
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,230
Attorney.

368
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm sorry.

369
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,770
Lady, can you hear me now?

370
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,600
Stop, I'm begging you!

371
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,280
- Attorney. 
 - You're not letting me work. You aren't.

372
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,560
I'll ask the plaintiff's defense to leave the court.

373
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,940
The backup attorney can continue.

374
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,000
Oh, o-okay.

375
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,580
Why are you doing this to me?

376
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,130
My client could've suffered damage because of you.

377
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,150
I'm suffering damage because of you.

378
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,010
What did I do, exactly?

379
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,710
You're not doing what you're supposed to do.

380
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,490
You need to open the door for me!

381
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,520
What door do you mean?

382
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,170
Gosh, I don't know. I don't know what you mean.

383
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,280
Stop following me.

384
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,400
Hey! Stop right there!

385
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,510
So, he extended your contract and...

386
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,370
he hired his daughter?

387
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,740
Yes! Chief Kim, that son of a bitch.

388
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,710
I've been working to the bone all this time.

389
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,740
By the way, do you know what's funny?

390
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,650
- What? 
 - Even after all that,

391
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,670
I worked overtime tonight.

392
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,930
Why? Because I had to keep the extended contract.

393
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,720
What? Hey, that's considered exploitation.

394
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,930
That's my specialty. Do you want me to sue him?

395
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,200
I can't.

396
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,060
Chief Kim might be incapable and annoying,

397
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,290
but I can't get a new job if I make a bad impression.

398
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,310
And no one hires me because I'm a cancer patient.

399
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,580
Hey. Stop drinking.

400
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,430
You're a cancer patient. Don't drink.

401
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,020
I used to be a cancer patient.

402
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,530
You're just a patient.

403
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,340
By the way, what's going on with you?

404
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,630
Ghosts. Ghosts keep following me.

405
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,800
I thought that curse or whatever was lifted.

406
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,750
That's what I'm saying.

407
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,540
It's weird.

408
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,300
Ask the photographer.

409
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,770
No.

410
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,340
Ever since Mr. Baek left,

411
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,810
he's been blaming himself a lot already.

412
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,700
I can't add to his worries.

413
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,420
You date someone who sees ghosts...

414
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,590
and I date a ghost.

415
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,140
- Ji Won. 
 - Yes?

416
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,890
Are you okay, by the way?

417
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,820
About what?

418
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,250
About Deputy Go.

419
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,770
He's really nice and great.

420
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,790
But, Ji Won,

421
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,340
he's a dead person.

422
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,520
I...

423
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,770
like him.

424
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,000
I like him a lot.

425
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,860
   

426
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,240
How does she still have a cold?

427
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,000
She got so thin.

428
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,670
I should get her herbal medicine or something.

429
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,610
You...

430
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,590
Why is she sleeping in this cold room?

431
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,290
Hey, Kim Ji Won, get up.

432
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,930
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.

433
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,960
- Geez. 
 - It's cold. Come.

434
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,810
Hey, I'll kill Chief Kim. I will.

435
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,470
Okay, okay.

436
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,600
Hey, Ji Won!

437
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,280
Ji Won.

438
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,320
What's going on?

439
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,880
   

440
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,790
What's this?

441
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,740
You're the Grim Reaper, aren't you?

442
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,200
You've been...

443
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,220
cursing my family for a hundred years.

444
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,520
Human, there was no curse.

445
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,500
It's just that your ancestor had a desperate wish.

446
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,640
 Please let my child live. 

447
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,740
 Allow him to live until 

448
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,500
 he reaches my age, 35. 

449
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,170
 I beg you. 

450
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,590
Then, his child and

451
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,720
his descendants will all end up with the same fate.

452
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,030
Do you still want that?

453
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,120
Your ancestor made the decision.

454
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,420
All I did was give him an opportunity.

455
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,790
You didn't give him an opportunity.

456
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:04,200
You just enjoyed watching us desperately trying to survive.

457
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,490
You're the ones who dared to desire what belongs in the netherworld.

458
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,930
Did you think you wouldn't pay for it at all?

459
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,360
Why did you let me live?

460
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,320
For what reason?

461
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,280
Because I need to receive something from you.

462
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,060
- What do you mean— 
 - You prayed, too.

463
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,100
Just like Seo Nam Gook. Desperately.

464
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,840
Pray?

465
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,560
By chance... By chance, is the price...

466
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,890
As long as the camera stays in this world,

467
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,830
someone has to carry on the task.

468
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,200
The one you tried to save desperately will be...

469
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,860
paying the price now.

470
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,970
No way...

471
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,440
There's no way!

472
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,400
Please...

473
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,890
Please, not Bom.

474
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,920
It can't be Bom...

475
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,250
Please... Please...

476
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,850
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

477
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,480
Please.

478
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,350
Why is this...

479
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,220
Bom!

480
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,650
Bom!

481
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,470
Bom!

482
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,180
Bom.

483
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,790
No, don't touch it.

484
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,530
Mr. Seo.

485
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,000
Are you okay?

486
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,450
Are you hurt at all?

487
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,340
What's going on right now?

488
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,720
Why... Why is this on you?

489
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,830
S-Since when?

490
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,620
When Mr. Baek passed away.

491
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,340
By the way, Mr. Seo,

492
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,460
am I dying now?

493
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,030
Why is this...

494
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,420
Why is this on you, of all people?

495
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,340
Why you...

496
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,260
I thought it was all over.

497
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,490
How come you...

498
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,630
Mr. Seo.

499
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,630
You know better than anyone that this won't do anything.

500
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,170
This is your room.

501
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,310
The ghosts will be coming in here all the time.

502
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,870
That's great, then.

503
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,150
I should move into your house.

504
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,420
How could you joke around right now?

505
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,100
Yes, let's joke around.

506
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,320
Let's joke around and be silly.

507
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,400
And go on dates, too.

508
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,250
Let's do everything without missing anything.

509
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,900
Let's never surrender. Okay?

510
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,070
I'm sorry.

511
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,720
I'll...

512
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,840
make sure to find a solution.

513
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,400
I promise I'll turn things back to normal.

514
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:22,880
♫  There was no response to the voice that resonated  ♫

515
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,260
♫  I endured a day trapped in long silence  ♫

516
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:37,480
♫  I'm not used to spending the night alone  ♫

517
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:44,550
♫  I can still feel your warmth clearly  ♫

518
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:51,750
♫  I couldn't say the last word to you  ♫

519
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,450
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

520
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,450
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

521
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,810
♫  Tell me why  ♫

522
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:10,850
♫  Your traces won't disappear  ♫

523
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,740
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

524
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,390
♫  Tell me why  ♫

525
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:25,360
♫  I think I'll collapse without you  ♫

526
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,740
I said I'm okay, Mr. Seo.

527
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,670
The ghost you said you saw. She might be a visitor.

528
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,770
Let's look for her together.

529
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,550
You might get sick again if you lose her again.

530
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,940
I finally became a proper lawyer.

531
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,080
I can't let a ghost ruin that.

532
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,970
Let me finish this trial first. Okay?

533
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,930
I'll be right back.

534
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,350
Don't get hurt.

535
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,340
Lady, where's my money?

536
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,040
I need to get your money back. Right?

537
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,490
Okay.

538
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,840
But please wait a little bit.

539
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,720
This is a very important meeting. I'll help you afterward.

540
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,780
Ma'am!

541
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,180
The order is all wrong. I came here first.

542
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,550
My money comes first.

543
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,290
Gosh, okay.

544
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,890
Hold on! It hurts!

545
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,060
It hurts!

546
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,680
Okay! Okay, I'll do it!

547
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,540
Check this folder to check task information.

548
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:23,000
Don't forget to order 10,000 products for the promotion.

549
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,350
- I taught you how yesterday. Right? 
 - Yes, yes.

550
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,690
You need to do that before you get off work.

551
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,710
And study this by tomorrow.

552
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,080
Please give me the summary.

553
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,200
- Pardon? 
 - Summarize it so I can learn at a glance.

554
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,580
Isn't that what an intern is supposed to do?

555
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,650
Thank you in advance.

556
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,430
Chief Kim is so unbelievable.

557
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:02,060
He's been exploiting Ji Won, acting like she'd hire her full-time.

558
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,190
This isn't the first time.

559
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,190
He's been reserving the full-time position for his daughter.

560
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,840
Did you see how she was treating Ji Won?

561
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,860
I saw it. She was ignoring Ji Won while looking at her phone.

562
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,700
"Shouldn't an intern do this? Bring me the summary?"

563
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,700
- She's so obnoxious. 
 - How could she say that?

564
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,560
Seriously. Poor Ji Won.

565
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,790
You saw Ji Won's face earlier. Right?

566
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,920
- She was about to cry. 
 - I wanted to say something.

567
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,180
You should've. Poor Ji Won...

568
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,290
Do you know what happens...

569
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,920
when a man acts worse than an animal?

570
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,530
He'll meet an enraged ghost.

571
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,900
Here. I added three days' worth.

572
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,140
She should've told me she'd be quitting.

573
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,190
I told her to take a day off because she was sick, but I couldn't reach her.

574
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,840
How could she demand money like this?

575
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,260
She even made her lawyer do it.

576
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,090
It's not like that. Ms. Park Bok Rye—

577
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,240
I thought she was diligent and nice.

578
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,580
It's always like this. You can't trust anyone.

579
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,300
 No one named Park Bok Rye was registered as deceased in the last few days. 

580
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,110
Nothing's easy now that Mr. Baek is gone.

581
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,040
 As long as the camera stays in this world, 

582
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,730
 someone has to carry on the task. 

583
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:44,220
 The one you tried to save desperately will be... 

584
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,470
 paying the price now. 

585
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,750
He said, "price."

586
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,300
If I paid that price on her behalf...

587
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,060
would she be able to live?

588
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,430
I need to see the Grim Reaper again.

589
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,000
Here. I could burn it for you,

590
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,880
but you can't take anything to the netherworld.

591
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,530
Should I give it to your family instead?

592
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,900
Please notify the police for me.

593
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,970
I've been dead for a long time.

594
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,650
Too many people will suffer if it gets delayed too long.

595
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,840
Use this money to take care of things for me.

596
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,630
Burn pretty clothes, too.

597
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,570
Let me dress nicely and take a funeral photo, please?

598
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,740
She's that little brat who took my Ji Won's spot.

599
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,810
 Deposit two million won  ($2k)  if you want to save the data. 

600
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,780
What's this?

601
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,510
 Otherwise, I'll reveal that you've been shopping during work hours. 

602
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,930
Seriously, what's this?

603
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,780
I bet my life that you're leaving in three days.

604
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,440
Ye Na, have you not placed the order for the event yet?

605
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Yes, I'm on it right now.

606
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,200
   

607
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,120
Ye Na.

608
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,590
I put in the order on your computer because mine is broken.

609
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,600
That's okay. Right?

610
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,400
Uncle said he was looking for the gate to the netherworld.

611
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,190
March 9, 1924.

612
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,520
1933. 1936.

613
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,500
1997. 2000.

614
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,980
May 16, 2003.

615
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,720
The day Uncle disappeared.

616
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,550
Is this his handwriting?

617
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,000
Gosh, I'm so late.

618
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,090
   

619
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,230
Yes, Mr. Seo.

620
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,580
Bom, what's wrong? Is something going on?

621
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,260
No, I'm just running late.

622
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,200
What is it?

623
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,380
I think I need to go into the studio because of the journal.

624
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,330
You don't have to ask me. Just go in.

625
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,230
You're sure everything's okay. Right?

626
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,150
Yes, I'm really okay.

627
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,520
I'll hang up.

628
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,120
Seriously, he worries too much.

629
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,210
   

630
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,500
Huh? This woman. Yes, it's this woman.

631
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,770
She took the money pretending to be the late Ms. Park.

632
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,590
Pardon? No, I think you're mistaken—

633
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:54,620
It was you!

634
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,030
- No, the thing is— 
 - Let's talk at the police station.

635
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,630
Pardon?

636
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,790
How could you use a dead woman for a scam?

637
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,670
No, sir. There's a misunderstanding.

638
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,990
It's a misunderstanding. Mr. Seo!

639
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:31,410
Of course, a living person can't open it.

640
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,250
The photo studio is actually in here.

641
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,250
Oh, here.

642
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,120
By the way, didn't you say you checked the journals enough?

643
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,100
It's not the content. There's something I need to check.

644
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,620
   

645
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,410
It indeed was Uncle's handwriting.

646
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,350
What do these dates mean, anyway?

647
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,030
August 1, 2000.

648
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,250
   

649
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,950
   

650
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:34,540
May 16, 2003.

651
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,470
   

652
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,280
February 19, 2006.

653
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,090
   

654
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,060
The black moon.

655
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,800
Heukwol. 
  (Means black moon) 

656
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,440
   

657
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,590
   

658
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,780
   

659
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,160
   

660
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,530
   

661
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,100
   

662
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,310
Ms. Park Bok Rye...

663
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,780
Attorney Han Bom...

664
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,870
   

665
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,290
You said you don't even know Ms. Park.

666
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:45,350
How did you know she was dead?

667
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,710
Looks like we keep coming back to this.

668
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:55,010
Ms. Park came to me.

669
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,790
- Ms. Park did? 
 - Yes.

670
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,590
- The dead person? 
 - Yes.

671
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,910
You're not making any sense right now.

672
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,320
This is driving me crazy.

673
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,790
Mr. Seo.

674
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,590
I'm sorry, Attorney Han.

675
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,170
It's my fault.

676
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,040
Not at all. I am actually grateful.

677
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,570
I could've been in trouble.

678
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,940
This reminds me of the old days. Don't you agree?

679
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,530
We met at a police station.

680
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,010
How could you joke around right now?

681
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,390
You should've called me, at least.

682
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:38,230
I'm sorry.

683
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,680
I didn't want you to worry.

684
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,060
Are you feeling okay?

685
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,180
Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Seo.

686
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,120
Senior.

687
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,380
Did you forget you had a trial today?

688
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,080
Well, I didn't forget—

689
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,410
You were supposed to bring the key evidence.

690
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,980
I called you dozens of times...

691
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,220
Do you know how much trouble our client is in because of you?

692
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,750
Well, I'm sorry, Senior. But the thing is—

693
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,350
Attorney Han, I've been giving you a pass because

694
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:20,180
you at least cared about your clients.

695
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,850
Uncle, please tell me.

696
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,360
What did you find out, exactly?

697
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,070
Going to that tunnel won't tell you anything.

698
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,870
Look at this.

699
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,380
One of them is the date my uncle went missing.

700
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,560
The other dates are when the Black Moon appeared.

701
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,420
My uncle found out how to go to the netherworld. To meet the Grim Reaper.

702
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,190
But going there won't tell you anything.

703
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,520
There's a temple that's over a hundred years old in Mt. Yongmoon near there.

704
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,320
I'll try to find out something there.

705
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,700
Please take good care of Bom.

706
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,140
Don't worry, and get going.

707
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,260
Hey, Kim Ji Won!

708
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,620
1,000?

709
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,820
I told you to order 10,000. Where's the last zero?

710
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,560
Can't you get it together?

711
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,720
I didn't put in the order.

712
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,190
Hey, don't you see this?

713
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,220
You put in the order for this event!

714
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,450
There's no way.

715
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,130
Ye Na was supposed to put in the order—

716
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:18,780
 I put in the order on your computer because mine is broken. 

717
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,320
Ye Na did put in that order.

718
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,010
She used my computer because hers was apparently broken.

719
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,930
Right?

720
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,020
Is that true, Ms. Kim?

721
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,160
No, you said you'd put in the order for me.

722
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,680
Why...

723
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,260
are you blaming me?

724
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,900
You did put in the order!

725
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,300
That's why your name is right here!

726
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,200
- How dare you blame the new employee? 
 - I said I didn't do it!

727
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,790
I'll make you compensate it if the event goes wrong!

728
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,550
You'd better get the full amount.

729
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,820
You'll have to pay for it if even one of them is missing!

730
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,180
No one better help her!

731
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,020
You do it all.

732
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,300
 I'm sorry, sir. There was a mistake on our end. 

733
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,980
I'll put in a new order, so—

734
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,000
 I don't care. That's your problem. 

735
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,110
 We can't do that. Hang up. Hang up. 

736
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,990
Sir.

737
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:33,000
Hello, this is Onjeong Foods.

738
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,800
Okay, got it.

739
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,390
Ji Won.

740
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,790
You said you like musicals. Right?

741
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,940
I reserved the VIP seats for us.

742
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,470
Take tomorrow off. Let's go see it together.

743
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:01,350
Seong Ho, I'm an intern.

744
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,510
I can't take days off whenever I want,

745
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,780
and I don't have a lot of free time right now.

746
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,450
Is it because of that cocky chief's daughter?

747
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,530
Don't worry, I punished her for you.

748
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:26,880
Was it you who broke her computer, by chance?

749
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,810
Yes. I took revenge on her for you.

750
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,200
You think I'm putting up with it because I'm a fool?

751
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,820
It's annoying me to death,

752
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,820
but I need to keep this position no matter what.

753
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,920
I'm hanging in with all my might.

754
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,790
W-What do you...

755
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,070
g-get from hanging in there like that?

756
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,690
I got rejected 20 times before I came here.

757
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,820
Including the places I never would've applied to before I got sick.

758
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,130
My bank account is draining...

759
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,530
and I don't have a place to live.

760
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:14,570
Will you give up on everything, then?

761
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,720
Including your health, happiness, and everything?

762
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,570
I'll get going now.

763
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,840
I need to go to the factory.

764
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:36,680
   

765
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,200
People used to say...

766
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,610
this is the place closest to the netherworld.

767
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,450
The night when there's no light at all.

768
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,990
That's the only night the gate to the netherworld opens.

769
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,270
And the beings from the netherworld come out.

770
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,030
That place...

771
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,210
Please tell me where it is exactly.

772
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,320
It'd be better not to know.

773
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,010
Foolish people go there to make a wish on those nights

774
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,350
and always get into tragic accidents.

775
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:31,450
Also, because too many people died in the Jangjin Tunnel,

776
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,610
it was shut down 20 years ago.

777
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:38,250
We call it "The tunnel of death."

778
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,830
Someone asked the same question you asked 20 years ago.

779
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:47,330
He said he had to take back something he acquired unintentionally.

780
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,530
That was my uncle.

781
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:51,810
Please. Please tell me anything.

782
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:56,510
No one who went in there came back alive.

783
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:00,380
No living person can go to that place.

784
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:16,240
Do you still insist on going?

785
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,950
Yes.

786
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:24,030
Because I want her to live happily

787
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:29,760
at the age of 36 and onward.

788
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,870
Sir.

789
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,890
Sir.

790
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:50,140
Sir, I beg you.

791
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,360
Please send us the products you set aside, please?

792
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,320
But it wasn't our mistake.

793
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,600
Sir.

794
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,800
Sir, sir, sir.

795
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,000
Sir, please help me out just once.

796
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,180
I said we don't have enough, either.

797
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,080
I know. I do, but...

798
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,380
I'll lose my job if I can't fix this. I only have a week.

799
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:12,640
Sir, please help me just once.

800
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:16,960
   

801
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,480
Mr. Seo, you're driving often these days.

802
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,620
What brings you here?

803
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:31,160
I came because I missed you.

804
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,600
You were worried about me, huh?

805
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,130
Okay...

806
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,140
By the way, where are we going?

807
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:08,870
Yes, I shouldn't have said that.

808
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:14,250
   

809
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:23,370
Yes, I can't let a lady apologize first.

810
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:27,300
 I'm sorry for saying that without understanding your position. 

811
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,880
 I'm sorry, Seong Ho, for getting angry like that. 

812
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,370
 I know how you feel... 

813
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,520
Did I overdo it?

814
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,300
J-Ji Won... 911...

815
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,760
Gosh, where did it go?

816
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,260
J-Ji Won...

817
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,740
Ji Won...

818
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,510
J-Ji Won... J-Ji Won...

819
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,390
Excuse me!

820
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,920
J-Ji Won... What do I do?

821
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,370
S-Someone call 911!

822
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,660
Please!

823
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:22,500
 Wow, this is so pretty. 

824
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,210
I've never been on a Ferris wheel.

825
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,930
You called it childish before.

826
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,820
I mean, I could change my mind, you know.

827
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:35,940
Huh? You're wearing the shoes I got you. They look great.

828
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,760
Where will you go in those shoes now, Mr. Seo?

829
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,820
Are you okay, Bom?

830
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,740
What do you mean?

831
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,730
Living like this.

832
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,410
Being harassed by ghosts every day

833
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,040
and people treating you like you're crazy.

834
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,510
Living in this world without being able to go far away somewhere.

835
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:06,640
That's how you used to live, too.

836
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:12,540
I shouldn't have been greedy then.

837
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:18,200
Safe zone or not, I shouldn't have been greedy

838
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,320
and just accepted my fate.

839
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,410
In order for me to live,

840
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,610
I dragged you in, Bom.

841
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:31,070
Don't be like that, Mr. Seo. I said I'm okay.

842
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:33,400
I'm not okay with it.

843
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,210
So...

844
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,710
I'm thinking of visiting the netherworld.

845
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,340
The netherworld?

846
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,020
I promise I'll be back.

847
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,270
Could you wait for me?

848
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:41,950


849
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:51,280
♫  Because I couldn't figure out what I could do for you  ♫

850
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:57,960
♫  Because I felt bad for my feelings for you  ♫

851
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:05,710
♫  I think of you being with me every waking moment  ♫

852
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,140
   

853
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,770
 The path to the netherworld? 

854
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:13,260
 You don't know how scary it is since you've never been there. 

855
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,640
 I said I'm okay. 

856
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,570
 How could I send you to the netherworld so I could live? 

857
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,590
 I promise I'll be back before sunrise. 

858
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:27,350
 Please protect Bom until I return the camera. 

859
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:32,550
 Where's Mr. Seo? 

860
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,210
 It's time to end everything.
