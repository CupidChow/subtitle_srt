00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,950
â™«  I still wonder why   â™«

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,250
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:14,460
â™«  Why I don't want to let go of your memories?  â™«

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,880
   

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,520
   

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,640
   

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,970
   

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,930
â™«  You hear me, I will call your name today too  â™«

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,150
   

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,340
   

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,710
 My ancestor stole the camera to live, 

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,360
 but he didn't know then. 

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,100
 That this camera contains a very dreadful curse. 

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,360
 Whether they die in the mountains 
   

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,740
 or the river... 

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,470
   

17
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,800
   

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,410
   

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,740
   

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,230
 ...none of them were able to live past 35. 

21

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Midnight Ghost ðŸ‘» Team @ Viki.com 

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,010
 It's okay. 

23
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,530
 Everything's okay. 

24
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,410
 It's okay. 

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,110
 Don't come! Don't come! Don't come! 

26
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,520
 Uncle! Uncle! 

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
 Seo Ki Joo, you're a scaredy cat. 

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
 Huh? 

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,300
   

30
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,540
   

31
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,030
 I became the seventh photographer after my uncle. 

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,100
I'll take the last photo.

33
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,700
One, two, three.

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,040
 And I'm nearing my 35th birthday. 

35
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,250
Then I'll take the last photo.

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,010
One, two, three.

37
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,010
 But the camera's worst curse is 

38
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,570
 enduring a very short life with horrible loneliness. 

39
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,640
 That was the biggest curse in my misfortune-filled life. 
   

40
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,910
What...

41
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,200
are you?

42
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,780
What is this place?

43
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,740
Hold on.

44
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,490
 You said you were an attorney. Right? 

45
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,600
 Go ahead and prove your skills. 

46
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,620
 My visitor doesn't have a lot of time. 

47
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,340
The police station.

48
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,660
How did you come in hereâ€“

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,410
By chance,

50
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,510
are you dead?

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,340
You're the psycho from the elevator. Right?

52
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,420
But why are you saying I'm dead? I'm perfectly fine.

53
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Everyone says that at first.

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,420
How long has it been?

55
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,900
Or do you not remember?

56
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,790
Oh, did you just move?

57
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,970
I'm Han Bom.

58
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,470
 Why is a dead person's hand warm? 

59
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,070
 There's no way. 

60
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you...

61
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,970
alive?

62
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,570
Pardon?

63
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,870
 She has a shadow, too. 

64
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,600
 By chance... 

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,220
 No way. 

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,090
 How could a living person come in here? 

67
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,810
- Get out. 
 - I asked you what this place is.

68
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,390
Don't touch me. I'll report you.

69
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,230
So how did you get in?

70
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,240
I just opened the door and went in.

71
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,590
By the way, what was that place?

72
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,990
Petals were flying around everywhere.

73
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,140
Please leave.

74
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,920
We're closed.

75
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,950
Hold on, it's not that.

76
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,690
Your phone. Could I borrow your phone?

77
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,350
I needed to make an urgent call, but I ran out of battery.

78
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,490
Please.

79
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,580
   

80
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,950
 What's with this guy? 

81
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,520
 Why doesn't he have any contacts on his phone? 

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,610
 Is he a foreigner? 

83
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,410
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep 

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,870
 and there will be an additional charge. 

85
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,640
She must be asleep.

86
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,530
I suppose it's kind of late.

87
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,660
Thank you.

88
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,700
Oh, I'm not a weirdo. Don't get the wrong idea.

89
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,520
I live in the rooftop unit upstairs.

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,930
Some jerk moved in without my permission.

91
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,510
It might've been on the market, but someone is obviously living there.

92
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,100
How could they be so shameless and brazen?

93
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,210
They put my stuff outside without my permission.

94
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,930
I'd like to see the face of this guy.

95
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,640
You're looking at him right now.

96
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,440
- Pardon? 
 - I'm that guy.

97
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,050
And I'm not the one who took your stuff out.

98
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,530
Your landlord did it.

99
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,120
Please leave.

100
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,940
I think there's a misunderstanding.

101
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,180
- It's strange. 
 - Talk to the landlord.

102
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Hold on.

103
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,840
 Excuse me. Open this and talk to me. Please? 

104
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,630
Excuse me. Open the door, please?

105
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,460
Sir? Sir!

106
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,380
Hey!

107
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,170
   

108
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,800
12,840.

109
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,350
12,841.

110
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,750
12,842.

111
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,260
12,843.

112
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,580
12,844.

113
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,740
12,84â€“

114
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,720
I can't sleep.

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,750
I can't sleep because I'm curious.

116
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,850
What's the deal with that woman, anyway?

117
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,280
 Sir, are you in there? 

118
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,350
 Sir. 

119
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,970
 Mr. Photographer. 

120
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,270
Hello. I'm happy to see you, too.

121
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,620
We were both a bit startled yesterday, weren't we?

122
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,910
So I'd like to discuss the situation calmly.

123
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,150
You're free. Right?

124
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,130
By the way, how did you come in yesterday?

125
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,030
The gate of the dead? The gate of the living?

126
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,330
Which is it?

127
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,820
I just opened the door.

128
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,520
That's not a place that you can just enter like that.

129
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,640
Here's a housewarming gift.

130
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,530
What's this?

131
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,920
It says right there.

132
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,270
It says I'll sue you for trespassing. 
    

133
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,340
You'll sue me?

134
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,710
According to the Criminal Code, Article 319, "If you enter an occupied property,

135
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,560
you can serve up to three years in prison or pay a fine of up to five million won."

136
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,290
Let me explain what that means.

137
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,460
You might've signed a contract with the landlord,

138
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,110
but you touched my belongings without permission.

139
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,880
I'm saying you're in big trouble.

140
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Gosh, this got dusty.

141
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,510
You've never seen this before? I'm a legal professional.

142
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,920
Yes, it's my first time seeing it.

143
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Someone as shameless as you.

144
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,920
Anyway, if you give me my place back, I'll reimburse the moving fee.

145
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,820
Hey, do you have money?

146
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,690
Grandma, where have you been?

147
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,480
You got kicked out because you couldn't pay the rent. Quit bluffing.

148
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,000
I know you're angry at me, but you can't do this.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,070
Tell him to move out now.

150
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,040
My grandmother made a mistake, soâ€“

151
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,470
Yes, it was a mistake to rent you the apartment.

152
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,330
Sometimes things work out, and sometimes they don't.

153
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,810
Are you really going to be like this?

154
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,930
How come things haven't been working out for three years?

155
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,750
There's no need to go on.

156
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,010
I'll remove you from the family registry today.

157
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,190
You and I are strangers from now on.

158
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,040
Don't be like that. Okay?

159
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,050
Yes, why don't we talk calmly inside then?

160
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,090
Do as you'd like.

161
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,870
You either move out or I'll call the police.

162
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Grandma. Grandma!

163
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,820
- The thing isâ€“ 
 - You heard her. Right?

164
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,590
Please leave.

165
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,330
Caffeine and alcohol are giving me life.

166
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,700
It's not like she's got two or three granddaughters! I'm the only one.

167
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,960
How could she kick me out on the streets?

168
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,990
 There's no way I'm related to her. 

169
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,150
I know you're her granddaughter but you haven't paid rent in three months.

170
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,130
That was very shameless of you.

171
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,000
 Hey, how can an unemployed person pay rent? 

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
 - Whose side are you on? 
 - I'm on your side. 

173
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,210
 That's why I'm being your drinking buddy at this hour. 

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,370
By the way, why does the Eiffel Tower have to be so pretty?

175
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,240
You must be happy traveling around the world.

176
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,600
 I spent all the security deposit and severance pay. 

177
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,500
 I'll be penniless once I go back. 

178
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,380
 I'm penniless already without having traveled. 

179
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,400
When you told me you'd be traveling around the world,

180
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
I should've followed you instead of calling you crazy.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,970
I have no home or a job, anyway.

182
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,330
 - Hey, Ms. Han Bom. 
 - Yeah? 

183
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,900
 Will you let that bastard take your home while complaining? 

184
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
 Never. 

185
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,900
Gosh. Mr. Seo, what's the matter?

186
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,300
How could a living person enter through the gate of the dead?

187
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,050
I've never seen such a thing in my three years as a ghost.

188
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,250
Three years?

189
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,060
I haven't seen anything like it in the 20 years I've been running the photo studio.

190
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,500
Does it mean she entered through the gate of the living?

191
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,800
 Only you can open the gate of the living. 

192
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,250
 And only the visitors can open the gate of the dead. 

193
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,500
She's neither of those things and is alive. How could she have entered the studio?

194
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,930
Geez! Do you think I don't know that?

195
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,990
Maybe you hallucinated since you've been in poor health.

196
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,190
She was definitely alone in the hallway.

197
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,690
By chance, did you leave it open and forget?

198
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:51,490
I think you haven't recovered fully after the virgin ghost incident.

199
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,420
 Here? 

200
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,610
 There doesn't seem to be a wound here. 

201
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,900
What?

202
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,320
Geez, you can't do this now.

203
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,340
Geez, seriously.

204
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,840
What?

205
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,550
Mr. Seo!

206
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll kill you if there's nothing here.

207
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,810
I-I think there's a ghost here.

208
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,500
- Hey, Deputy Go. 
 - Yes?

209
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
What do you think you are?

210
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,020
I'm talking about an evil spirit.

211
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,860
I'm a nice ghost.

212
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,960
This is the photo studio. How could an evil spirit enter?

213
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,420
You... What are you?

214
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,090
I feel an evil energy somewhere.

215
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm Kang Rim.

216
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,540
Hey, kid! What's this now?

217
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,720
Are you out of your mind?

218
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,050
Don't move.

219
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,140
I, Kang Rim, am here to destroy you. Yap!

220
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,250
Stop right there!

221
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,150
Wait, Deputy Go!

222
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,600
Whether it's Deputy Go or Deputy Ma...

223
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,380
Wh-What...

224
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,490
Hello.

225
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,300
Mr. Seo!

226
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,600
Wait, Deputy Go! Come here!

227
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,180
Deputy Go!

228
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,080
Mr. Seo... Mr. Seo!

229
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,940
Mr. Seo!

230
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,230
Stop moving!

231
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,180
 Faceless ghosts, bachelor ghosts, and virgin ghosts. 

232
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,720
 There are a lot of notorious ghosts, 

233
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,960
 but the scariest one is... 

234
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,960
 the child ghost. They're the scariest. 

235
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,030
You clean up the mess.

236
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,780
You clean up the mess again.

237
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,210
Is this what they mean by "childrearing hell"?

238
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,380
It's okay.

239
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,100
I endured two months. Three days aren't so bad.

240
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,180
Who did you have for two months?

241
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,340
You won't know. She was a very annoying first visitor.

242
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,580
 Seo Ki Joo! Seo Ki Joo! Come out! 

243
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,160
 Seo Ki Joo! 

244
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,740
 Seo Ki Joo! 

245
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,820
 Hey, put that down. 

246
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,710
 Put it down. 

247
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,990
 Hey! 

248
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,300
- Huh? Don't do it. 
 - Don't do it.

249
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
- Don't do it. 
 - D-Don't do it.

250
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,580
- Don't do it. 
 - Seriously, don't do it.

251
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,100
- Okay, go ahead. 
 - Do it. Do it.

252
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,220
- Do it. Do it. 
 - You can't, can you?

253
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
That's mine!

254
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
I looked up the accident records in the neighborhood.

255
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,900
There was a car accident at the intersection a month ago.

256
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,250
A seven-year-old boy died.

257
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,090
The suspect was drunk driving.

258
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,000
They couldn't settle since the boy was from an orphanage.

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
You're in trouble. Okay?

260
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,370
Mr. Seo, catch him!

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,240
Hey, kid.

262
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,470
I'm not a kid. I'm Im Yoon Hae.

263
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,520
Yes, Im Yoon Hae.

264
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Do you remember anything?

265
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,680
Do you have any regrets or a family you miss?

266
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,090
There's no time.

267
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,750
The gate of the dead you came through closes in three days.

268
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,980
The gate of the dead?

269
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,600
Oh, I thought of something.

270
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
What is it?

271
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,330
   

272
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,700
Do they make limited-edition toys these days?

273
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,350
- Yes, let's go. 
 - Seriously.

274
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,330
Here we go.

275
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,590
Can't you open the door for me?

276
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,680
I told you not to run. You'll end up falling.

277
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,000
I need the Biryong Exorcising Sword. 
    

278
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,350
Hey, all swords are the same.

279
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,990
Hey, how about this? How's this one?

280
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,990
This looks super sharp.

281
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,110
Look.

282
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,910
This is a really good one.

283
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,450
No.

284
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,530
It's not.

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,260
It hurts.

286
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,300
My gosh, they sold out already. 
    

287
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,130
Hey.

288
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,180
Hey, do something.

289
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,620
Wh-What can we do?

290
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,220
Biryong Exorcising Sword. There were about three left. Here...

291
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,120
They sold out already. 
     

292
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,400
Gosh, what do we do?

293
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
They sell out as soon as they arrive these days.

294
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,810
- Over here! 
 - Tyrannosaurus.

295
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,180
Are there any left?

296
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,780
   

297
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,860
Y-Yoon Hae, look at this. What about this one?

298
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,150
This is so cool.

299
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,560
Should we just get this one?

300
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,190
- Wow, it's so cool. 
 - This isn't a Biryong Exorcising Sword.

301
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,790
Mr. Seo, this is the seventh store. We don't have anywhere else to go.

302
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,100
Whether he wanders this world or not,

303
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,550
should I just kick him out?

304
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,150
No, I meant childrearing.

305
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,820
I meant that childrearing is hard once I experienced it.

306
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,580
We all feel the same way.

307
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,190
Heartless man.

308
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,380
- Let's go somewhere else. 
 - What now?

309
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,360
Hurry.

310
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,950
Gosh, seriously.

311
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm not so good at controlling my strength.

312
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,250
Geez, seriously.

313
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,810
I'd rather work overtime

314
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,450
than babysit.

315
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,840
Excuse me. Could you give me your number, if you don't mind?

316
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,160
Are you asking for my phone number right now?

317
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,710
Yes, your number.

318
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,890
Well, I'm so sorry.

319
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,230
I haven't gotten over my first love yet.

320
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,890
What?

321
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,340
Thank you.

322
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,510
Thank you.

323
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,310
Should I have given her Mr. Seo's number?

324
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,470
No, he would yell at me.

325
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,390
   

326
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,520
   

327
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,870
I can't seem to recall her name.

328
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,970
My one-and-only.

329
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,860
Where are you?

330
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,370
â™«  A mild breeze  â™«

331
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,800
â™«  Your warm eyes  â™«

332
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,680
â™«  Your touch is like a constellation  â™«

333
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,480
â™«  Your sweet voice  â™«

334
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,650
â™«  The deeply tinted sky  â™«

335
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,760
 I'm sorry I couldn't keep the promise again today. 

336
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,590
 It's okay. 

337
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,630
â™«  Bye-bye, my lonely days. Hold my hand  â™«

338
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,310
â™«   Let's dance together in the moonlight   â™«

339
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,290
   

340
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,690
â™«  Secretly. Without anyone knowing  â™«

341
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,260
Please. Hold on a second!

342
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,530
Hold on.

343
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,170
â™«  Times with me  â™«

344
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,480
â™«  On the boat that's called love  â™«

345
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,950
â™«  Let's dream together  â™«

346
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,170
â™«  Without anyone knowing  â™«

347
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,890
Knowing that...

348
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,250
we've been living in Seoul together

349
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,780
makes me feel hopeful.

350
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,900
What's this?

351
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,250
You came.

352
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,870
What's this hideous thing, anyway?

353
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,160
Oh, this?

354
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,090
I bought this from Cucumber Market to go to Han River with my boyfriend last year.

355
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,420
But he broke up with me.

356
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,840
I thought I'd never use it, but I'm glad I bought it.

357
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm not really interested in that.

358
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,580
Hey, you were in there?

359
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,680
Come out right now. Come on.

360
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,150
You can't hide even if you try.

361
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,580
What? Do you two know each other?

362
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,830
Of course, we do.

363
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,850
Wait! Do you see him?

364
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,920
Did you know you ask the strangest questions?

365
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,910
- Is it a boy or a girl? 
 - Does he look like a girl to you?

366
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,320
   

367
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,550
Mr. Clingy, do you know him?

368
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,890
No, I don't.

369
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,450
I've never seen him before.

370
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,140
Hey, how many hamburgers and toys did I buy you this morning?

371
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,070
I'm really hurt right now. Come on out.

372
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,280
You can't be in there. Come on out.

373
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,630
Come here. Hurry...

374
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,280
Hey, where are you going, Mr. Clingy?

375
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,080
Why did you provoke a well-behaved boy?

376
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,470
Hey, wait for me!

377
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,870
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me. Geez, he's fast.

378
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,550
Hey.

379
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,490
Hey! Stop right there!

380
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,100
Hey!

381
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,780
What?

382
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,840
She definitely sees him.

383
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,960
She definitely saw the visitor.

384
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,160
I knew I didn't leave the door open.

385
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,640
She was suspicious in the elevator, too.

386
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,970
I've never met anyone like this.

387
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,260
Maybe she came to take over after you.

388
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,290
But the camera has been handed down only within the Seo family.

389
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,330
There's no one to inherit it after you die.

390
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,750
Mr. Seo!

391
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,180
Geez, you scared me.

392
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,150
You scared me. Can't you use the door?

393
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,970
I...

394
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,210
finally found her.

395
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,570
- Found who? 
 - My long lost...

396
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,920
first love.

397
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,720
Do you mean your internet girlfriend?

398
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,910
I think I'll get very busy soon.

399
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,200
Since I'll be going on dates.

400
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,410
By the way, does she know, too?

401
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,760
That you're stalking her?

402
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,950
What do you mean, stalking?

403
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,990
It's stalking. She can't see you following her around anyway.

404
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,030
Oh, since we're on the topic,

405
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,620
can I borrow your body if I get to see her againâ€“

406
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,680
Don't even think about it.

407
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,160
I'm having a hard time because of a strange woman already.

408
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,130
It would've been perfect.

409
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,960
Welcome.

410
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,770
How big is your party?

411
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,210
I'm alone.

412
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,130
The smallest portion we have is two servings.

413
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,880
It's a party of two.

414
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,440
Two servings of the squid stir-fry, please.

415
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,450
That's the best thing on the menu here.

416
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,670
Okay.

417
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,950
What are you, exactly?

418
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,030
How come you see that little boy?

419
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,610
And how did you open the door to the studio?

420
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,550
Are you bringing that up again?

421
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,480
I saw what I saw and...

422
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,050
I opened the door because I could.

423
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,410
It's totally normal.

424
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,500
Is it normal for you, too?

425
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,530
I have a question myself.

426
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,090
What are you, exactly?

427
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,060
You just moved in,

428
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,400
but how do you know the boy, and why did you visit Ms. Jang?

429
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,810
I thought you ran a photo studio.

430
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,920
Why would a photographer meet with a suspect in a crime?

431
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,510
And why did Jang Bo Ra come clean about everything after she met you?

432
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,540
Well...

433
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,720
Am I being interrogated right now?

434
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,510
Anyway, whatever you are, stop bothering the boy.

435
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,860
He had a hard time because of the accident a month ago.

436
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,510
He needs to leave in three days. Don't try to change his mind.

437
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,500
Do you also know he needs to leave in three days?

438
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,040
How did you know about that?

439
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,110
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

440
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,250
Anyway, that's all the advice I have for you.

441
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,580
Let's eat now.

442
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,080
It's not like we're having a memorial service.

443
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,610
Well...

444
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,280
you don't get to pay less for eating less.

445
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,090
Eat at least half. One serving each.

446
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,250
Let's hurry and eat.

447
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,700
It's warm.

448
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,060
Memorial service food is cold.

449
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,680
Memorial service food is for ghosts. We're supposed to eat human food.

450
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,800
Everyone knows that.

451
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,970
It's so good.

452
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,130
What?

453
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,950
You act like you've never eaten before.

454
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:35,050
Try this, too.

455
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,070
You can call me whenever you want to eat.

456
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,650
I'll complete the party of two for you.

457
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,700
Was it Mr. Seo Ki Joo, by the way?

458
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,020
Mr. Seo, you know the rooftop unitâ€“

459
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,660
I love it.

460
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,220
So much so that I don't ever want to move.

461
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,530
â™«  I'm dreaming again  â™«

462
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,040
I enjoyed the meal. And...

463
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,980
thank you, No. 2.

464
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,700
â™«  I want to leave somewhere secretly  â™«

465
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,530
Wait, excuse me. Hold on.

466
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:53,620
â™«  You make my heart flutter  â™«

467
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,550
Why are you following me?

468
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm not following you. I'm going to my grandma's place.

469
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,500
â™«   Like a dream   â™«

470
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,950
Here. It's a coupon for that restaurant.

471
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,630
You get a meal for free if you collect ten stamps.

472
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,460
You know, right? You can't use this alone.

473
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,290
I'm entitled to half of it.

474
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,600
- Here. 
 - You can use it by yourself.

475
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,770
I'll never complete it.

476
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,290
It goes fast once you start eating there.

477
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,590
Their food is good.

478
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,360
There's someone who sees ghosts.

479
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,730
She sees the same things I see?

480
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,220
Mr. Seo!

481
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,750
What? What's going on?

482
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,460
I finally found the sword.

483
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,540
   

484
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,150
 Where are you? 

485
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,310
We'll only buy the sword and leave.

486
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,820
Don't get distracted. Okay?

487
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,170
Yes, sir.

488
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,580
Kiddo, behave yourself.

489
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,520
I'll be right back.

490
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,230
Hey!

491
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,420
Tell them to pay for our ride, at least.

492
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:53,070
Wow, fireworks that size must cost a lot.

493
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,810
- I think it's my first time seeing fireworks. 
 - How fancy.

494
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,220
Where did he go?

495
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,530
- What do you mean? 
 - Yoon Hae.

496
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,990
He was here just now.

497
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,500
He couldn't have gone far. Let's look for him.

498
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,920
- Shit. 
 - Yoon Hae.

499
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,500
- Yoon Hae. Y-Yoon Hae. 
 - Yoon Hae!

500
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,940
- Y-Yoon Hae. 
 - Yoon Hae!

501
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,600
Y-Yoon Hae.

502
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,660
Y-Yoon Hae!

503
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,410
- Yoon Hae! 
 - Yoon Hae... Yoon Hae!

504
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,900
   

505
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,590
Enjoy.

506
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,820
Grandma, I'll have a tteokbokki.

507
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,350
Who's there?

508
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,790
I don't know you, Miss.

509
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,650
What? Is it sold out? 
    

510
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,860
Gosh, I was craving tteokbokki today.

511
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,850
You said it was sold out.

512
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,590
Did you set this aside for me, by chance?

513
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,340
I set it aside for myself.

514
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,770
What's that? Is it a credit book, by chance?

515
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,960
Grandma, will you charge your granddaughter, too?

516
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,290
Gosh, I know. I don't know who you are.

517
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,200
My family registry is empty.

518
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,220
Grandma, are you still angry? Huh?

519
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,400
Since I'm not working, why don't we go to Jeju to see flowers?

520
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,110
I know you love flowers.

521
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,860
Come to think of it, we didn't get to see cherry blossoms this year again.

522
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,240
- Should we go see cherry blossoms? 
 - It's summer right now.

523
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,280
They were gone a long time ago.

524
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,990
Well, we can go next year then.

525
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,840
Spring always comes back.

526
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,670
Just like me.

527
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,130
Gosh. An unemployed person shouldn't be talking about flowers.

528
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,480
Are you proud of being unemployed?

529
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,190
Cut the nonsense and go get a job already.

530
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,610
Okay.

531
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,710
Grandma, I'll have a tteokbokki, too.

532
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,170
Here. Let's share it.

533
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,210
Do you like it?

534
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,990
What kind of toy sword is this expensive?

535
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,330
   

536
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,940
Hey, kiddo.

537
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,990
I told you to behave yourself, didn't I?

538
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,610
It's the scary guy.

539
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,120
I told you to stay with us, didn't I?

540
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,360
What are you doing right now?

541
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,670
He needs to be scolded.

542
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,330
What are you talking about? Let go.

543
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,950
- Let go right now. 
 - Mr. Seo.

544
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,040
Yoon Hae is here.

545
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,290
Let go.

546
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,090
 Yoon Hae has a scar on the back of his neck. 

547
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,910
 Who's this kid in front of me? 

548
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,340
Were they twins?

549
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,840
Mister, why are you bothering my brother?

550
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,420
Why are you bothering him?

551
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,150
- Hey. 
 - There are two Yoon Haes.

552
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,150
Why are you bothering him?

553
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,450
Do you really not see him?

554
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,000
What are you talking about now?

555
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,880
I think we're really meant to be.

556
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,950
Did you want to give this sword to your brother?

557
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,470
Tomorrow is Yoon Dal's birthday.

558
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,470
I wanted to get it for him.

559
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,090
You should've told me so then.

560
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,190
I didn't know, and I told that womanâ€“

561
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,090
Pardon? What do you mean?

562
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,610
Forget it. Whatever.

563
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:04,230
This boy came back desperately to see his brother, not the toy.

564
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,120
I'm so proud of you.

565
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,030
Are you happy about something?

566
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,500
Pardon?

567
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,460
Well, I think I need new clothes.

568
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,220
I might go on a date.

569
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,880
Do you have any travel money left?

570
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,030
 It's so tasty. 

571
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,150
 You can't use this alone. 

572
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,770
 I'm entitled to the half of it. 

573
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,060
 Here. 

574
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,650
 Why are you bothering him? 

575
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,510
 Do you really not see him? 

576
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,060
 What are you talking about now? 

577
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,830
What were you hoping for, Seo Ki Joo?

578
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,050
Tell me. What do you need?

579
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,450
The sword.

580
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,550
You want me to burn it?

581
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,450
Yoon Dal, did you pack your things?

582
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,660
You need to go to bed early to leave tomorrow.

583
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,020
Ma'am.

584
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,660
Can I bring this to the US, too?

585
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,820
   

586
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,030
Yes, go ahead.

587
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,010
Double-check your locker to see if you forgot anything.

588
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,470
Okay.

589
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,350
Yoon Dal wanted that sword for his birthday.

590
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,150
Brother.

591
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,390
Brother.

592
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,890
Brother.

593
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,020
Brother.

594
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,730
Public urination.

595
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,400
Refused to pay the taxi fare.

596
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,220
Provoked someone on the street, 
     

597
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,150
bar fights, road rage.

598
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,050
Everyone needs the law so badly.

599
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,420
But no one needs me.

600
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,810
 Hey. Do you really not see him? 

601
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,340
I feel guilty for not seeing things.

602
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,350
Why do I feel so uneasy?

603
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,500
What's this about?

604
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Hello, ma'am. We received a report regarding squatting.

605
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,350
Is this where you currently live?

606
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,060
- Yes. 
 - Let me check your identification.

607
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,180
Hand me your ID.

608
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,160
Officers, you must be so busy.

609
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,520
There's something I need to tell you.

610
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,470
This is my grandma's... So she's the landlordâ€“

611
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,730
The one who filed the report is a renter here.

612
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,210
You need to evacuate.

613
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,090
Just one moment.

614
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,620
Sir, we got along very well. We had a meal together, too.

615
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,090
Please evacuate.

616
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,140
Otherwise, I'll file a lawsuit.

617
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,140
Hey! Hey, how could you do this to me?

618
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,830
Hold on. Excuse me.

619
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,590
Well, sir.

620
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,620
Please forgive me... Forgive me just once.

621
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,280
Open the door for a moment.

622
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
Let's talk about this, please?

623
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,310
Hey!

624
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,580
Shit. Seriously, why...

625
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,030
What?

626
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,960
Gosh, you should've done it sooner.

627
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,470
Shit. Can't you walk straight?

628
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,260
I'm sorry. I've never been in a woman's body.

629
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,330
You're okay, right?

630
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,990
Please. You're making me walk funny, too.

631
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,590
You want to sponsor Yoon Dal?

632
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,250
We don't have a baby yet.

633
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,530
By the way, I heard Yoon Dal had a twin brother.

634
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,270
You heard.

635
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,960
Both of them were found together in front of the orphanage.

636
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,350
It was so sweet how they were holding hands when they couldn't even talk.

637
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,320
Yoon Hae cared a lot for his brother.

638
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:08,600
He went out to get a birthday present for Yoon Dal that day, too...

639
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,890
My goodness.

640
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,760
It... It breaks my heart so much.

641
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,830
Oh, my. It sounds like you're from the North.

642
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,120
But I'm sorry to tell you this.

643
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,420
Yoon Dal is getting adopted by a family in the US today.

644
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,290
Hey, I mean... Honey.

645
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,530
Ma'am.

646
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,600
We need to leave now.

647
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,160
It's about to come out.

648
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,520
- Are you okay? 
 - This happens sometimes.

649
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,410
Honey.

650
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,860
- Hurry! 
 - Shit!

651
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,980
Thank you, ma'am!

652
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,570
Hey! Hey!

653
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,460
You were shopping at the grocery store.

654
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,400
Pardon? Gosh, I must be getting dementia.

655
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,910
Gosh, that was a close one.

656
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:29,570
Hey, how come you can only possess someone for 10 minutes?

657
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,720
I've been improving.

658
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,180
Yes. You're doing great.

659
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,940
Thank you.

660
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,630
Hey, this is fun.

661
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,990
It's so fun.

662
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,580
You can't go there!

663
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,120
It was difficult to get that sword. Why are you sitting like this?

664
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,120
You should be having fun with it.

665
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,190
Who would I have a sword fight with?

666
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,180
Visitor,

667
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,570
we need to take photos.

668
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,590
There's no time left.

669
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,520
You know Yoon Dal was adopted. Right?

670
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,450
Won't you say goodbye for the last time?

671
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,250
I don't want to say goodbye.

672
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,940
It's over once you say goodbye.

673
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,620
I won't be able to see him again.

674
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,880
I hate goodbyes.

675
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,550
Kiddo,

676
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,950
unfortunately, the dead need to go somewhere.

677
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,800
Why? Why am I the only one who's leaving?

678
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,840
How about the bad man who did this to me?

679
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,380
Why am I the only one leaving?

680
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,020
If I leave,

681
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,820
Yoon Dal will be left alone.

682
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,060
Hey! Hey, don't cry.

683
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,650
Gosh, seriously...

684
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,850
I was left alone as a kid, too.

685
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,550
I've never told anyone this,

686
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,110
but I was really scared back then.

687
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:36,420
But I also had... well...

688
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,820
What's the sword called again?

689
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,960
Biryong Exorcising Sword.

690
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,970
I had something like that, too.

691
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:47,340
It was like Superman, who always protected me.

692
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,880
 It's okay. It's okay. 

693
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,150
 Uncle! 

694
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,710
So I wasn't afraid at all.

695
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,790
Even if you leave,

696
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:04,090
Yoon Dal will end up with someone like Superman, too.

697
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,420
So it's okay.

698
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,540
Yoon Dal...

699
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,560
He'll be okay.

700
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,900
You'll say goodbye to him...

701
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,200
like a cool older brother. Right?

702
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:41,200
   

703
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,950
 Wow, Brother. It's Biryong Exorcising Sword. 

704
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,390
 I want that. I want it. Hurry, Brother. 

705
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,360
   

706
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,750
Brother.

707
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:58,570
I don't want to go to the US.

708
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,570
Brother.

709
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,120
I miss you.

710
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,400
Can I help you meet him?

711
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,940
Hey, kiddo, wait...

712
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,240
Don't come near me.

713
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,980
I'll scream if you come closer.

714
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,810
Okay, I won't come.

715
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,410
I won't. So could you listen to me?

716
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,490
Yoon Hae is next to me right now.

717
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,800
He wants to see you.

718
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,560
Don't lie.

719
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,300
Even seven-year-olds don't believe in stuff like that these days.

720
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,240
Hey, your little brother is way smarter than you.

721
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,110
Show me the evidence.

722
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:54,560
- Evidence? 
 - Kang Rim of the Haunted House.

723
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,470
The Haunted House stuff?

724
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,520
Hurry up and repeat after me.

725
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,430
Fire of devotion!

726
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,830
Hey, kiddo. I have social status and dignity.

727
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,380
Do you think I'd do anything you tell me to?

728
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,660
Fire of devotion.

729
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,920
Fire of devotion!

730
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,720
Pierce the enemy with the burning flame.

731
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,200
Fire of devotion.

732
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,920
Pierce the enemy with the burning flame!

733
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,570
- Kang Rim... 
 - Seals the evil energy!

734
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,690
Kang Rim seals the evil energy!

735
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,090
Was expelling ghosts always this embarrassing?

736
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,320
   

737
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,900
You need to have a birthday party, kiddo.

738
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,170
â™«  I've nothing to lose  â™«

739
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,880
â™«  Every day was the same  â™«

740
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,910
- Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday.

741
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,760
- Congrats. Congrats! 
 - Congrats. Congrats!

742
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,950
Brother!

743
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,960
Brother!

744
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,180
â™«  Sometimes there's no meaning  â™«

745
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,170
I don't need stuff like this.

746
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,610
I don't want this anymore.

747
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,640
If only I didn't ask you for the toy...

748
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,760
I'm sorry, Brother.

749
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,430
â™«  Why was I so blind?  â™«

750
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm actually not dead.

751
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm executing my mission according to Kang Rim's order.

752
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,310
You're lying.

753
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,180
I'm serious.

754
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,520
Have you ever seen me lie?

755
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,090
When are you coming back then?

756
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,560
After I finish my mission.

757
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,950
You'll wait for me until then. Right?

758
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,610
Swear on Kang Rim's name.

759
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,910
I swear on Kang Rim's name.

760
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,010
Come back soon, okay?

761
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,770
How dare he report me at my house?

762
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:14,080
Why does he want a photo studio on top of the hill?

763
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,440
He never gets customers, so why is the light on?

764
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,740
How strange.

765
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,270
Are they open or not?

766
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,580
   

767
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,670
I'm sure I was mistaken then.

768
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,620
There can't be a space like that behind the boiler room.

769
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,280
By the way, this is strange.

770
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,140
He just moved, but he's showing interest in Yoon Dal's orphanage.

771
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,380
Is he committing some kind of new crime?

772
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,460
   

773
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,480
Hello, Director.

774
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,790
I haven't volunteered there in a while. I'm sorry.

775
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,340
Attorney Han, is Yoon Dal there, by chance?

776
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,260
- Pardon? 
 - Someone saw him following some man earlier today.

777
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,360
Yes, I'll look for him, too.

778
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,870
Mr. Baek put his blood and sweat into this special cake.

779
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,400
Make a wish now.

780
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,970
Please make Brother come back quickly.

781
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,820
Amen...

782
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,850
Please make sure Yoon Dal doesn't feel afraid.

783
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,780
Okay. One, two, three.

784
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,680
Happy birthday!

785
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,860
It's your birthday, too, kiddo.

786
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,800
Mister.

787
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,460
Goodbye, kiddo.

788
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,640
Brother, come back soon.

789
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,560
Brother!

790
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,630
Brother!

791
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,560
Brother!

792
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,440
Brother!

793
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,470
Brother...

794
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,690
Don't go.

795
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,290
Brother!

796
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,710
Oh, my gosh!

797
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,310
Thank God!

798
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,090
Im Yoon Dal, we were worried about you.

799
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,410
I met Yoon Hae just now.

800
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,640
The hyung at the photo studio let me see him.

801
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,840
- What? 
 - Look at this.

802
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,460
I had a birthday party with Yoon Hae.

803
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,250
He gave me the Biryong Exorcising Sword, too.

804
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,550
This bastard was an awful man.

805
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,770
 The people who come here ask me. 

806
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:45,240
 "Why? For what reason... 

807
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,680
Where's the camera?

808
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:53,400
 ...is it my life that's filled with misfortunes?" 

809
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,850
Where's the camera?

810
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,700
Give me the camera!

811
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,600
Give me!

812
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,260
 Even though life is... 

813
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,060
 filled with misfortunes... 

814
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,050
 ...don't be discouraged.

01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,140
â™«  It's okay if it's creepy  â™«

824
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,360
â™«  I, at least, will always be with you  â™«

825
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:59,550
â™«  It's okay even if it's the middle of the night  â™«

826
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:04,750
â™«  Don't worry anymore, I'll be by your side  â™«

827
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,750
â™«  Oh, look at me now  â™«

828
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,770
â™«  In this rough world, I'm with you  â™«

829
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,680
â™«  I won't run away anymore  â™«

830
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,670
â™«  I'm here for you no matter what happens  â™«

831
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,020
â™«  I'll protect you like it's nothing  â™«

832
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,950
â™«  Count on me, baby. Count on me, baby  â™«

833
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:25,480
â™«  Don't be afraid, just stay by my side  â™«

834
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,370
   

835
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,600
 That man is suspicious in so many ways. 

836
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,610
 He doesn't have a single contact on his phone. 

837
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,450
 I'm a ghost photographer who takes photos of the dead. 

838
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,020
 I really need you. 

839
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,530
 Come to the studio when the sun sets. 

840
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,390
 Can you actually see dead people? 

841
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,170
 Shit, seriously. 

842
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,330
 Don't tell Attorney Han. 

843
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,540
 I never came here. Okay? 

844
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,240
 Stop feeling bad, lady. 

845
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,980
â™«  I, at least, will always be with you  â™«
