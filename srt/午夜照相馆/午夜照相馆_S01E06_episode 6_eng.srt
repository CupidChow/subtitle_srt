♫  I still wonder why  ♫

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,360
​♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,640
♫  I don't want to forget your memories  ♫

7

8

♫  You hear me, I will call your name today too  ♫

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,840

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,160
   

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,990
   

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,000
   

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,620
 Grandma will be so happy if she learns you bought it with your pocket money. Right? 

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,670
 I know. 

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,850
 You've been begging me to visit grandma since last week to give her the flowers. 

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,560
 Let's hurry up. 

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,040
 I miss Grandma. 

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,130
 We're almost there, Princess. 

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,670
 She's so unbelievable. 

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,460
 What's wrong with that car? 

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,850
 Honey. 

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,040


23
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,190
 Mom. 

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,420
 Dad. 

25
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,320
 Mom. 

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,580
 Dad. 

27
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,600
 I miss you. 

28
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,830
   

29
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,330
Where did this woman go off to?

30
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,970
She should be okay. Right?

31
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,420
Don't open your eyes.

32
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,180
Mr. Seo.

33
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,770
Are you okay?

34
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,890
You said I was all cured.

35
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,170
You said I'd be okay.

36
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,680
What's this then?

37
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,380
I was scared to death.

38
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,230
Mr. Seo, are you ignoring me right now?

39
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,250
You can't remain silent in this situation–

40
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,750
Mr. Seo.

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,520
Mr. Seo.

42
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,520
Why is he sweating so much?

43
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,420
Mr. Seo, are you okay? Mr. Seo.

44
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,740
You should've stayed home.

45
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,230
 Please help! 

46
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,650
 Over here! Help! 

47
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,730
Gosh, so heavy.

48
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,090
Why is this guy so heavy?

49
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,220
Why did he come out if he was this sick?

50
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm thirsty since I sweated.

51
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,860
What's this?

52
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,830
My goodness. Buddha statues, bibles,

53
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,590
Jesus, Mother Mary,

54
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,860
and shamanism, too?

55
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,330
How many religions does he follow?

56
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,330
What time is it right now?

57
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,880
Mr. Seo, are you okay?

58
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,610
When is the sunset today?

59
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,360
Just one moment.

60
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,590
   

61
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,350
It's at 7:40 p.m. Why?

62
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,640
What time is it now?

63
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
7:20 p.m.

64
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,710
Why are you getting up? Stay lying down.

65
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,540
See?

66
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,310
You're still boiling.

67
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,740
But why are you suddenly about to die? You were fine yesterday.

68
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,710
Did you catch a cold in the summer, by chance?

69
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,320
Can't you ask just one question? My head is ringing.

70
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Are you really sick or something?

71
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,310
It's phantom energy.

72
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,990
A side effect of when a living being forcefully opens the gate of the dead.

73
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,760
The gate of the dead is...

74
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,090
By chance, is it because of me...

75
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,080
No, it's because of me.

76
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,220
I was prepared for this much.

77
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,770
There's no point in being sick now.

78
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,740
Where are you going?

79
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm going to work.

80
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,050
The sun is setting soon.

81
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,670
I'm asking where you're going in that condition.

82
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,070
Just rest for the day.

83
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,150
Can you hear the sirens right now?

84
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,310
When the night gets noisy, the night at the studio gets noisy, too.

85
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,920
Especially a major accident like this that wasn't intended.

86
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,500
People are always left desperate after an unexpected death.

87
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,650
I understand, but you'll pass out again in that condition.

88
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,150
I'll go, too, then. Let me help you.

89
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,290
You couldn't do anything because you were scared earlier.

90
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,170
Will you be okay?

91
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,110
So, I...

92
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,430
I'm still scared of ghosts even though I've been seeing them all this time.

93
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,310
So it's okay to show that you're scared.

94
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,500
You should sleep here tonight.

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,920
It will be a very long and dark night.

96
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Don't look, listen, or get possessed.

97
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,510
Sleep tight.

98
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,140
Okay, okay. Create a single line. Don't cut in.

99
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,090
The ones who died first will come to the front.

100
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,700
Okay. The first visitor. Tell me your name.

101
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,120
Kwon Byeong Cheol.

102
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,860
- How old are you? 
 - I was born on October 30, 1992.

103
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,410
Thank you. Next one.

104
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,800
I think this color will suit you. Would you like to try it on?

105
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,420
♫  Running in circles  ♫

106
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,040
♫  For the losing  ♫

107
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,310
Here's some tea.

108
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,850
♫  Sometimes there's no meaning  ♫

109
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,460
I hope you enjoy it.

110
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,440
♫  Life goes the way it came  ♫

111
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,400
♫  Always caught in the middle  ♫

112
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,160
♫  There's no fun to plan  ♫

113
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,210
♫  How about superstitions?  ♫

114
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,920
♫  Try clinging to your soul  ♫

115
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,170
♫  But only then a girl can dream about  ♫

116
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,310
I'm sorry. Unborn babies can't even become ghosts.

117
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,320
I know.

118
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,840
A photo of the two of us will be enough.

119
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,730
He couldn't have been in a lot of pain. Right?

120
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sure he was okay.

121
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,040
Because you protected him.

122
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,510
♫  And then the troubles we've had  ♫

123
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,750
Ddol. My Ddol.

124
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,660
Let's meet again.

125
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,360
I'll take the photo now then.

126
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,730
One, two, three.

127
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,670
Gosh, I dozed off for a second.

128
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,420
Where am I?

129
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,400
The GPS isn't working either.

130
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,800
   

131
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,010
128 undelivered?

132
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,650
Gosh, how many hours did I sleep?

133
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,150
I need to finish by today.

134
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,760
Excuse me, where am I–

135
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,060
Excuse me.

136
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,340
Excuse me.

137
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,380
 Over here! Please help us here! 

138
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,290
 Help! Help! 

139
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,990
 Please help us here! 

140
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,490
 Please help us! 

141
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,550
Hello? Where are the police officers?

142
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,960
No...

143
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,020
No!

144
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,930
What will you do with that attorney? I heard the safe zone didn't work either.

145
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,340
Isn't that a serious problem?

146
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,420
No.

147
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,780
It was definitely the safe zone.

148
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,900
What's more important is that this accident happened because of me.

149
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,740
 I was the target. 

150
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,240
No evil spirit has ever attacked me like this.

151
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,740
Unless it's the Grim Reaper.

152
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,300
 Have you seen the Grim Reaper? 

153
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,070
I'm sure only Seo Nam Gook knows. My ancestor who started this curse.

154
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,810
A force that bound us with this curse for 100 years

155
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,310
could've easily caused an accident like that.

156
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,590
I suppose death is really approaching.

157
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,550
Why worry if the safe zone actually exists, as you said?

158
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,870
You have the attorney.

159
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,250
No one has ever...

160
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,970
avoided death.

161
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,330
Don't worry.

162
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,810
Even if I die tomorrow, I need to rest for now.

163
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,210
I'm so tired that I might actually die.

164
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,530
Okay. Go ahead and rest.

165
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,440
I'll go home then.

166
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
You are...

167
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

168
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,470
I was so sleepy. 
    

169
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,130
I haven't slept enough lately.

170
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,130
Because of me, everyone...

171
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,290
Do I have the right to come here, too?

172
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,860
Welcome, Visitor.

173
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,540
What do you want as the last memory of your life?

174
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,010
Okay. I finished the sales report.

175
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,810
Do I just need to do the market research analysis now?

176
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,070
No, no, no. Control S. Control S.

177
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,510
I almost lost what I'd been working on all day.

178
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,690
Am I working too much?

179
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,430
 Remember that a miracle doesn't happen twice. 

180
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,560
 Make sure to take care of your health. 

181
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,140
Doc, survival is more pressing than a miracle for me right now.

182
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,620
What?

183
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,960
What's this?

184
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,910
My gosh. My gosh.

185
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,170
 Are you usually clumsy? 

186
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,490
 Do you usually have trouble hearing and understanding? 

187
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,660
 The commander has a shovel or pickaxe at home. Right? 

188
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,150
- What's wrong with this? 
  - Give me some time. 

189
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,470
 There are rivers and mountains, too. 

190
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,620
 There are plenty of places to bury a woman... 

191
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,440
There are rivers and mountains, too.

192
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,100
There are plenty of places to bury a woman all over the country.

193
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,160
What are you saying?

194
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,700
Do...

195
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,100
Do you see me?

196
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,160
I see everything, you ghost.

197
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,090
I'm having silly thoughts because of Han Bom.

198
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,790
Come out whether you're a ghost or not.

199
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,380
So we can split the report.

200
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,590
Wh-Who is this woman, anyway?

201
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,620
Seriously.

202
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,290
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

203
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,050
Hello.

204
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,000
- Good morning. 
 - Hello.

205
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,940
- Where's the intern? 
 - Well, we haven't seen her.

206
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,570
Hello.

207
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,590
Is the office restroom your personal washroom?

208
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
You're an intern, but you're late already.

209
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,360
- I'm not late. 
 - Do you know what time it is now?

210
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
I haven't gone home yet.

211
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,880
I sent the email at 9:00.

212
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,400
- You finished them? 
 - Of course.

213
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,530
I used to be the ace of a marketing team—

214
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,600
Ace?

215
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,600
- Move. 
 - Of course.

216
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,280
My nickname was "Razor" because I was so precise at my job.

217
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,460
So you did this all night last night?

218
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,300
Wh-What's this? 
    

219
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,710
Hold on. T-This is not possible.

220
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,810
What happened?

221
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,050
Ms. Kim Ji Won.

222
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,080
Do you think work is a joke?

223
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,790
- No. 
 - Get out immediately.

224
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,250
- Sir. 
 - You!

225
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,130
Get out! Get out.

226
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,700
- Sir. 
 - Marketing Team, remove her!

227
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,260
- The thing is– 
 - Get out of here!

228
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,350
I told you.

229
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,560
There are plenty of places to bury a woman all over the country.

230
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,120
   

231
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,820
He would've gotten a doctorate if there was a ghost study department.

232
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
   

233
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,530
October 17th?

234
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,910
I suppose he wanted to go there for his sabbatical.

235
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,440
Pitcairn Islands?

236
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,650
Where's that?

237
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,340
Are they in New Zealand?

238
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,480
Who's he going with that there are two tickets?

239
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,310
What brings you here, Mr. Seo–

240
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,630
This is my house.

241
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,120
Oh, right.

242
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,670
Do you like dogs, by chance?

243
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,980
Wow, you're so pretty.

244
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,800
My gosh, where did you come from?

245
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,220
What's with the dog, by the way?

246
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,200
The safe zone definitely doesn't work.

247
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,980
Huh?

248
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,610
Is he a ghost?

249
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,460
How did you end up here?

250
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,110
He was abandoned.

251
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,970
The owner must've tied him here and abandoned him.

252
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,020
Poor thing.

253
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,150
The safe zone doesn't seem to work here, either.

254
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,690
Did you say the evil spirit who started a fire burned your hair?

255
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,420
I wasn't there then.

256
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,500
The first time I saw the safe zone was...

257
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,380
when the sign fell.

258
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,400
I was there then.

259
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,070
What's your relationship like with the men at the studio?

260
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,150
Did you know them when they were alive?

261
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,900
No.

262
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,300
They came to me as visitors, too.

263
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,430
But why are they still here, then?

264
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,470
Because they haven't sorted out their day yet.

265
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,520
The people who come here don't get to have tomorrow.

266
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,520
It's not like they can live in the present, either.

267
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,780
Because they're dead.

268
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,180
It looks like it's still not working from here.

269
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,400
Stay still.

270
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,200
One.

271
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,830
Two.

272
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,890
Two hand lengths.

273
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,260
Exactly this much.

274
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,520
This is how big our safe zone is.

275
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,390
You don't care that I don't see it.

276
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,580
Well, where's the circle?

277
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,080
I don't even see it.

278
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,360
The circle starts from my back and ends...

279
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,120
around here.

280
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,620
♫  The glittering raindrops are falling and caressing me  ♫

281
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,390
♫  It caresses me even more sweetly  ♫

282
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,280
 I'll take you there. 

283
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,540
 Stop calling me. 

284
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,980
 I'm here. 

285
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,840
♫  It feels like that whenever I'm with you  ♫

286
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,890
 Don't open your eyes. 

287
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,850
 You should sleep here tonight. 

288
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,270
 It will be a very long and dark night. 

289
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,870
 Don't look, listen, or get possessed. 

290
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,710
 Sleep tight. 

291
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,790
♫  Oh, I love you  ♫

292
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,680
♫  It can't be more beautiful than this  ♫

293
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,440
Mr. Seo.

294
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,480
Yes?

295
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
Do you like me, by chance?

296
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

297
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,140
Pardon?

298
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,300
I asked if you like me.

299
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,790
You keep worrying about me and rescuing me.

300
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,220
Why are you always nice to me?

301
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,660
There's no explanation other than that you like me.

302
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,270
What I like is...

303
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,250
your...

304
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,270
circle.

305
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,770
The two-hand-length distance.

306
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,380
Let's just maintain this distance from each other.

307
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,380
I never said I liked him, either.

308
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,890
I asked him if he liked me.

309
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,650
How embarrassing...

310
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,420
 One, two, three. 

311
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,610
 Wow, I'm so proud of you. Well done. You worked so hard. 

312
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,200
 You're the best. You're the best. 

313
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,450
Am I here too late?

314
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,820
- Photographer. 
 - I know you can't take it,

315
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,430
but it's your graduation.

316
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,260
   

317
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,630
 Let's do it one more time. 

318
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,280
   

319
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,600
I wanted that so badly.

320
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,180
Seeing this is enough.

321
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,290
I'm at my graduation thanks to you.

322
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,100
You should leave now, too.

323
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,890
You should work for the ones who are more desperate.

324
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,240
They died because of me.

325
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,810
That accident wasn't your fault.

326
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,810
It was...

327
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,740
Did you really come to the studio because of the graduation?

328
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,310
Yes.

329
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,950
It took me...

330
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,570
28 years to get a diploma.

331
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,870
 I was in front of a church when I was born. 

332
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,990
 This is... 
   

333
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,240
 - Pastor, it's a baby... 
 - It's a baby. 

334
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,690
They didn't know my age or name.

335
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,740
So the name of the noodle restaurant on the bag became my name. 
    

336
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,740
 - Geez, let me see. Let me see your face. 
 - Please don't. 

337
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,070
 - You're in pain, huh? 
 - It's so annoying. 

338
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,010
 - Let me see. 
 - It hurts. It hurts. 

339
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,940
 - Dong Hee. 
 - Dad. 

340
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,740
 - My gosh! 
 - He suddenly... 

341
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,350
 Is it him? 

342
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,450
 You punk. Hey, hey. 

343
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,810
 Someone like him needs to be expelled! 

344
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,070
 Please calm down. 

345
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,110
 - Please calm down. 
 - Sir, I heard he lives at an orphanage. 

346
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,600
 No one knows where he's from. 

347
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,310
 This is why your parents abandoned you. 

348
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,780
 - Are you okay? 
 - Right here, Mom. 

349
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,410
 Gosh, seriously. 

350
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,840
 Sir, you should have him expelled. 

351
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,400
 - Please calm down, ma'am. 
 - He'll end up influencing everyone. 

352
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,600
 - Let's talk outside. 
 - Please expel him. 

353
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,730
 Write down your name. 

354
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,140
   

355
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,040
Without being able to belong anywhere...

356
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,500
   

357
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,910
 - Here's a package. 
 - Honey. 

358
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,710
 - What is it? 
 - Son, your birthday present arrived. 

359
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,430
 Dad, is it my birthday present? 

360
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,570
 Mom, the present arrived. 

361
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,060
 How exciting. 

362
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,940
It was as if no one knew I existed in this world.

363
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,770
♫  Happy birthday, our dear son  ♫

364
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:03,550
Maybe I'll disappear before anyone knew I existed.

365
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:19,490
   

366
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,550
You know what?

367
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,460
When you receive a diploma,

368
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,080
it says your name, affiliation, and major.

369
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,710
And it says this below.

370
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,110
"The facts above have been verified."

371
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,530
It felt like that was the only thing that verified me.

372
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,950
I wanted to have proof that says,

373
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,580
"Yoon So Myeong lived diligently.

374
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,030
And he's still living diligently."

375
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,550
Namo Amitābha,

376
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,400
I surrender to you.

377
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,190
Namo Amitābha, I surrender to you.

378
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,940
Have mercy on us.

379
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,820
 - I'll be right back. 
 - Honey! Honey, wait. 

380
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,420
 - Take this. 
 - I'm late. 

381
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,330
 Have a bite. 

382
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,820
 Sorry. It's our wedding anniversary. 

383
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,020
 But Park Doo Chil might smuggle himself away if we don't catch him today. 

384
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,560
 It's okay. 

385
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,940
 7:30 at Soryeo Hotel. Let's have a nice meal. 

386
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,230
 - Honey. 
 - Yes. 

387
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,000
 I actually need to tell you something. 

388
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,680
 What is it? 

389
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,830
 Yes, tell me. 

390
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,060
 It's okay. Make sure to catch him. 

391
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,390
 I won't come back until I do. 

392
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,050
 Park Doo Chil, help me out. 

393
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,020
 It's my wedding anniversary today. I need to leave in 30 minutes. 

394
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,010
 Son of a bitch. 

395
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,930
 Let go. Let go! 

396
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,190
 Let go. Let go! 

397
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,770
   

398
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,810
   

399
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,520
I'm sorry, Na Rae.

400
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
We haven't caught that bastard yet.

401
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,220
It must be difficult for you.

402
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,210
No, it's okay. You're the one who's working hard.

403
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,520
I'm sure Nam Goo can't leave this world

404
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,500
because he couldn't catch Park Chil Doo.

405
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,890
What a psychic.

406
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,780
I'll be sure to catch that bastard.

407
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,840
I'll put handcuffs on that asshole myself for killing Detective Baek.

408
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,710
Yes, let's catch him.

409
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,400
Well, then.

410
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,780
Detective.

411
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,060
Yes.

412
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,740
By chance, didn't you collect Oppa's walkie-talkie?

413
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,490
Walkie-talkie?

414
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,720
No, I didn't collect anything in particular.

415
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,600
Why do you ask?

416
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
It's nothing.

417
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,350
   

418
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,410
Well, we're in your care.

419
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,360
We didn't expect help from a scholarship foundation.

420
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,420
It took eight years, Chancellor.

421
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,870
That's how long he worked to pay the tuition in order to graduate.

422
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,110
He must be devastated that he suddenly had to die.

423
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,730
Instead of ignoring his death, you're giving him an honorary degree.

424
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,720
That's a perfect headline.

425
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,800
We were thinking of giving him an honorary degree, anyway.

426
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,670
Since we'll need a photo for the news, we might as well prepare a diploma for him, too.

427
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,060
Of course. We'll deliver it to you immediately.

428
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,900
Yes, sir.

429
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,070
By the way, how about the next chancellor election...

430
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:02,070
A warm-hearted leader who cares about people should lead the school.

431
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,650
Thank you. Yes.

432
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,660
- I'll get going, then. 
 - Yes.

433
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,750
Take care.

434
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,740
You deserve an acting award.

435
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,020
You must've heard the horrible news.

436
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,730
- Ji Won. 
 - Yes.

437
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,440
Do you know how long it's been since I dated?

438
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,230
You bought a tent on OE Market to go camping with the accountant last spring.

439
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,410
Has it been a bit more than a year?

440
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,520
No. It's been exactly 401 days.

441
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,740
What? Why do you ask if you've been counting?

442
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,330
I'm saying my dating cells couldn't have died yet.

443
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,000
Do you want to date someone?

444
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,280
He saved me when I was almost scorched to death and when I nearly got hit by a car.

445
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,370
And he was sick for three days and nights because of me.

446
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,600
But he says he doesn't like me.

447
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,980
What?

448
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,410
Oh, sorry.

449
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,640
Only up to here.

450
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,710
He told me not to come any closer than this.

451
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,700
Come close, but don't cross the line.

452
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,790
Hey, is it that thing?

453
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,220
What?

454
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,000
Kids today...

455
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,510
sleep together, but they don't have relationships.

456
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,840
Enjoying without restricting each other.

457
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,490
Come on. He doesn't know how to do that.

458
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,150
It's the man from the photo studio. ight?

459
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,370
Why? What's he like?

460
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,310
He's like Charlie Chaplin.

461
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,800
- What do you mean? 
 - It's a comedy from a distance,

462
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,960
but it's a tragedy up close.

463
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,660
He's a psycho from a distance,

464
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,800
but up close...

465
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,800
he's a pitiful bastard.

466
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,290
He looked handsome.

467
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,990
Give up then.

468
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,020
Handsome and crazy means hopeless.

469
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,480
You said you got rejected, anyway.

470
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,160
Hey, but you look heartbroken yourself. Why the long face?

471
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,610
- Bom. 
 - Yes.

472
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,860
I think there's a ghost at my office.

473
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,600
I heard a dead employee is still lingering at the office.

474
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,610
Is that true?

475
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,890
Are you okay?

476
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,330
What's he like? Should we go catch him?

477
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,350
What's with you, Han Bom?

478
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,710
Do you believe what I said?

479
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,650
You became a coward while I haven't seen you.

480
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,740
They're very precious to me.

481
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,830
- Buddy. 
 - Yes.

482
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,050
It doesn't mean they don't exist just because they're invisible.

483
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,210
Salt. Red beans.

484
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,480
Make sure to carry these around.

485
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,140
Refill them if you need more. I heard that Korean red beans work better.

486
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,640
I need to go now.

487
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,000
Where are you going?

488
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,310
I was told to redo it by tomorrow morning.

489
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,610
Otherwise, I'll get fired.

490
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,120
- Do you want me to sue them for you? 
 - Yes.

491
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,610
- Bye. 
 - See you.

492
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,540
He's handsome, but he's crazy.

493
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,170
Deputy Go.

494
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,350
You should come, too. The more, the merrier.

495
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,270
Make sure to come.

496
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,640
Please come!

497
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,700
   

498
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,930
Diploma No. 20231829. 
    

499
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,190
Counseling Psychology Department. Yoon So Myeong.

500
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:22,560
You're given this degree diploma for finishing the entire program at this university.

501
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:30,810
Read on behalf of Hanguk University's chancellor, Yoon Jae Ho, on July 22nd, 2023.

502
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,680
   

503
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,760
   

504
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,980
I wish those hyungnims from work were here, too.

505
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:48,730
But thanks to you, I get to leave behind my footprints that say I was here.

506
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,450
Thank you so much, everyone.

507
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,670
Congratulations on graduating.

508
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,250
Congratulations.

509
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,960
Thank you.

510
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,590
Shall we take the graduation photo now, then?

511
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,100
Yes.

512
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,480
He does great things.

513
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,030
   

514
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,830
- Yes. 
  - Are you out of your mind? 

515
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,810
 Are you determined to destroy me? 

516
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,300
You made me give an honorary degree to a murderer?

517
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,280
Well, what do you mean by that–

518
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,490
 Watch the news! Watch it! 

519
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,690
I'm canceling the honorary degree.

520
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,850
Wait, excuse me–

521
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,820
Deputy Go, turn on the news.

522
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,030
- News? 
 - Yes.

523
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,710
 It was a major accident with 25 casualties. 

524
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,770
 The driver who caused the accident also died. 

525
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,160
 The cause is assumed to be the driver of Haru Delivery falling asleep at the wheel, 

526
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,640
 but the police are investigating the exact reason. 

527
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,800
 According to the investigation so far, 
   

528
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,680
 Driver Yoon expressed he was tired that day. 

529
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,610
 The heavy workload seems to be the cause. 

530
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,100
 Haru Delivery stated they followed the legal work hours  

531
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,300
 despite the public's assumption. 

532
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,570
 And since Yoon was contracted as an independent contractor, not an employee, 

533
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,720
 it was impossible to give excessive orders. 

534
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,470
 They emphasized that the accident was caused by Yoon's careless driving. 

535
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,590
 Even so, they feel responsible since the accident occurred while he was on duty 

536
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,190
 and they expressed regret and remorse toward the victims. 

537
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,600
You can't just leave him like this.

538
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,360
Just leave him alone for now.

539
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,040
You don't know what it's like to be denied of your existence.

540
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,320
You're right. I don't.

541
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,290
But what can you do right now?

542
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:39,910
Will you defend the dead person or something?

543
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,120
   

544
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,880
Good afternoon.

545
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,990
Do these belong to your company?

546
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,590
They were Mr. Yoon So Myeong's belongings, but he had no family.

547
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,610
Yes, they were So Myeong's.

548
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,380
Got it. Carry on.

549
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,830
He even wrote down when he got on and off the vehicle and overtime hours, too. 
    

550
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,400
Crazy bastard.

551
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,380
Chief.

552
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,570
We didn't want So Myeong to worry about the undelivered packages even after death,

553
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,010
so we missed his funeral and delivered all of them for him.

554
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,890
But when we came back,

555
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:33,600
the company is blaming him for everything instead of defending the poor guy.

556
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,750
- What are we supposed to do? 
 - Just sit still.

557
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:43,560
They promised to hire all the drivers full-time as soon as things got sorted out if you sit still.

558
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,520
How long do you want to be an independent contractor?

559
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,900
You're basically a day laborer, aren't you?

560
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,290
Four insurance plans, medical care, and a 52-hour work week.

561
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,860
That's what full-time employment means.

562
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
The evidence is gone now.

563
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,560
The witness also needs to be gone now.

564
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,580
 Here's the next story. 

565
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,320
 In Seoul, many casualties resulted from a collision caused by a delivery truck. 

566
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,870
 Many innocent citizens became victims of the irreparable tragedy. 

567
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:44,110
 Unfortunately, more injured victims passed away at the hospital this afternoon. 

568
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,630
 The cause of the accident is assumed to be the driver falling asleep at the wheel. 

569
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,560
 One of the victims was a pregnant woman who was due in a week... 

570
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,340
I know it's hard to believe, but some ghosts hurt the living.

571
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,040
The accident happened because you were possessed by such a ghost momentarily.

572
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,560
But I did fall asleep.

573
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,220
You steered to the side to save them.

574
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,820
Because I steered to the side,

575
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,330
other people died.

576
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,220
That's...

577
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,740
not entirely your fault.

578
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,080
Don't blame yourself.

579
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,130
Gosh, what do I do?

580
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,650
I feel too terrible.

581
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,680
Because of me...

582
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,930
I'm not saying the visitor is faultless.

583
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:20,160
But he's worked over 70 hours a week for the past six months.

584
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,710
And the company gave him no choice but to do that.

585
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,710
It's unfair for him to take all the blame.

586
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,320
He might be dead, but he shouldn't be punished unfairly.

587
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:38,420
Should I possess the chancellor and undo the cancellation?

588
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,800
No. That's not important right now.

589
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,200
We need to make sure to reveal the truth.

590
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,930
But the visitor doesn't have the time to fight the company.

591
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,400
The time...

592
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,430
How about we try to negotiate, then?

593
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,580
There's this law called the Severe Disaster Punishment Act.

594
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:03,120
If there was a fatal accident at a workplace because the employer didn't follow safety regulations,

595
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,530
the employer can either serve over a year in prison or pay up to one billion won  ($1M)  in fines.

596
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,900
There's also a winning precedent of a workplace accident case for a sole proprietor already.

597
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,870
But will that be possible?

598
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,850
We only have a day left.

599
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,510
That's up to one's ability.

600
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,330
Here I am. A very competent attorney who happens to be free.

601
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,730
But we have a major issue.

602
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,420
We need a client who's alive.

603
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,680
Someone to represent the late Mr. Yoon.

604
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,330
I'll try looking for one.

605
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:42,750
We need someone to accept the case. Right?

606
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:46,920
Okay. We'll be counting on you for that, then.

607
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,720
By the way, who will be paying me for the case?

608
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,740
How much does it cost to hire a very competent attorney?

609
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,720
Grant me a wish, then.

610
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,680
It's as desperate as the ones of the dead.

611
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,440
Excuse me, where's Mr. Jang Cheol Soo?

612
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,780
Excuse me, you're Mr. Jang Cheol Soo. Correct?

613
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,660
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Seo Ki Joo, who called you several times.

614
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,210
We need someone to prove the unfairness of

615
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,120
this case on behalf of the late Yoon So Myeong.

616
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,350
I'm sorry. I don't know much about it.

617
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,560
I need to work. I'm sorry.

618
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,110
- Well, I– 
 - Why do I have to do stuff like that for him?

619
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,780
I'm busy enough to make a living.

620
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,440
What if I get fired? Will you be responsible?

621
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,390
I don't want to risk my life for someone else. Leave.

622
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,430
You promised to celebrate So Myeong's graduation together.

623
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,370
Who the hell are you?

624
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,480
What's going on over there?

625
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,510
I think he came to the wrong place. Don't worry.

626
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,680
We're busy today.

627
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,160
He thinks Jang Seul Woo would be good.

628
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,880
It means "Survive wisely and strongly."

629
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,950
So Myeong said it's his last present for you.

630
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,460
- How did you know— 
 - Try considering it for...

631
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,600
Seul Woo, not So Myeong.

632
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:41,920
If Seul Woo grows up in a world where his father doesn't fight against injustice,

633
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,250
what kind of injustice will he end up facing?

634
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,080
 Look. I'm dying here because I got married late. 

635
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,340
 But I live because of him. 

636
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,360
 - Did you come up with a name? 
 - No. 

637
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,160
 Come up with one since you're smart. 

638
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,830
 With a name given by a smart and clever uncle like you, 

639
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,370
 he'll go to a good university like you. 

640
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,360
 What are you saying? I'm not his uncle. 

641
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,600
   

642
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,470
- Yes, Honey. 
  - You must be tired. 

643
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,000
No, not at all.

644
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,540
 Peanut is resting after having some milk now. 

645
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,030
Peanut, it's Dad. It's Dad.

646
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,980
 Dad. 

647
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,110
 Dad. 

648
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,930
Honey, have you thought about his name?

649
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,510
Seul Woo.

650
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,420
 Seul Woo? 

651
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,610
It means to be wise and strong.

652
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:06,040
Seul Woo. Jang Seul Woo.

653
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,020
Okay, Jang Seul Woo?

654
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,960
 Seul Woo. 

655
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:28,090
How come you always take the losing cases that won't pay?

656
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,570
- How impressive. 
 - Sorting of goods without pay.

657
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,740
Car rental fee issue. Overtime that's expected every day.

658
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,120
Evidence. Do you have any?

659
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,400
The time sheet says everything was normal.

660
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,090
I see. What is it called? I guess you're talking about the work place accident.

661
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:51,080
You know. Mr. Yoon was a sole proprietor and an atypical worker.

662
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,280
The Severe Disaster Punishment Act doesn't apply, and it doesn't count as a workplace accident.

663
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,090
They threatened not to give him the job unless he was self-employed.

664
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:02,590
There's no evidence for that, either. Right?

665
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,620
   

666
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,590
It's a work log according to the vehicle's GPS history.

667
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:14,440
Mr. Yoon delivered packages over 10 hours a day.

668
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,510
What do you think?

669
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,900
That's not what our work log says.

670
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,230
This is the late Mr. Yoon's work log.

671
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,270
   

672
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,730
   

673
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,940
- You know this is wrong. 
 - To be honest,

674
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,550
no employee has complained yet.

675
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,870
Of course, including the late Mr. Yoon.

676
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:51,730
- Hey, Yoon Ji Yeong. 
 - But, Senior,

677
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,320
who are you negotiating for right now?

678
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,550
No way.

679
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,420
The late Mr. Yoon So Myeong?

680
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,720
Seriously.

681
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,450
You should've brought a client to negotiate, at least.

682
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,200
How frustrating.

683
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,200
I don't know how you even graduated from law school. My goodness.

684
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,680
There she is. Our attorney.

685
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,820
- Here's the power of attorney. 
 - Who are you people?

686
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:25,890
Us? We're filing the lawsuit. Her clients.

687
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,900
   

688
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,950
   

689
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,160
 We're on our way to sue this company. 

690
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,420
 What? Are you all out of your minds? 

691
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,720
 Don't you want to be full-timers? 

692
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,590
 We'd love to become full-time, but... 

693
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,230
 not enough to betray So Myeong. 

694
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,950
 Of course not. 

695
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,910
 So Myeong did so much for us. 

696
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,830
 I'm quitting. 

697
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,840
 Me, too. 

698
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,790
 Me, too. 

699
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,480
 Do you think you could quit just like that? 

700
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,410
 Get us the replacement trucks if you're going to. 

701
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,310
 Do you know how much that costs? 

702
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,360
 You'll have to compensate for damages, too. 

703
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,250
 Order the replacement trucks. 

704
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,230
 It'll be So Myeong's graduation gift. 

705
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,040
 You can have this. 

706
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,920
 Hey! Where are you going, Cheol Soo? 

707
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,920
 Get back in here. You bastards. 

708
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,520
   

709
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,180
   

710
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,820
   

711
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:05,240
Goodness, Chief. You took so much.

712
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,970
   

713
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,160
   

714
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,680
   

715
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,500
 Yes. 

716
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,230
 I committed embezzlement? 

717
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,900
 It'll be a disaster if we can't deliver today. Would it be okay? 
   

718
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,040
 What can we do? It still needs to be done. 

719
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,440
 Huh? Where did all the packages go? 

720
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,910
   

721
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,780
 Hyungnim, it says all of my packages for today were delivered. 

722
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,820
 - So are mine. 
 - Mine, too. 

723
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,780
   

724
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,210
♫  Oh, look at me now  ♫

725
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,630
♫  In this rough world, I'm with you  ♫

726
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,500
♫  I won't run away anymore  ♫

727
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,340
♫  I'm here for you, no matter what happens  ♫

728
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,720
♫  I'll protect you like it's nothing  ♫

729
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,560
♫  Count on me, baby  ♫

730
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,240
♫  There's nothing to fear anymore  ♫

731
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,790
♫  Gon' be all right  ♫

732
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,210
I brought the written statements and doctor's notes.

733
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,320
What else do you need, Attorney Han?

734
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,410
   

735
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,180
Wow! Mr. Seo, you're good at your job.

736
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,550
I keep falling for you.

737
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,970
Ji Yeong, I have a lot of time, as you said.

738
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,980
I have no cases, but I have a lot of time these days.

739
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,660
Since I have free time,

740
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,330
I'm thinking of combining similar cases and filing a class action lawsuit.

741
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,310
By the way, will this be your only case?

742
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,790
What is it that you want?

743
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:39,780
Clearing the late Mr. Yoon's name.

744
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,570
Oh, and to improve working conditions.

745
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,810
Settling the overtime payments, too.

746
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,940
Gosh, seriously...

747
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,540
   

748
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,980
"Diploma. Yoon So Myeong.

749
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,300
You're given this degree diploma for finishing the entire program at this university.

750
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,460
Read on behalf of Hanguk University's chancellor, Yoon Jae Ho, on July 22nd, 2023."

751
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,620
   

752
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,380
Congratulations, So Myeong.

753
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,290
- Thank you. 
 - You did great.

754
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,910
Congratulations.

755
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:29,880
Congratulations.

756
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,760
I'm sorry about what I did.

757
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,470
I went crazy when I heard the words "full-time."

758
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:53,150
I said I thought of you as my little brother,

759
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,340
but all that meant nothing when I looked out for myself.

760
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,930
It's okay, Hyungnim.

761
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:00,490
You kept your promise.

762
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,660
Ta-da.

763
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,880
Let me hold those.

764
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,590
Have a look.

765
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,890
Hyungnim.

766
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,140
Let me put it on you.

767
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,330
We...

768
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,980
pooled money and bought this for you.

769
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:33,700
We wanted you to live proudly without feeling discouraged out in the world.

770
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,520
All right?

771
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,520
I wanted to give it to you on your graduation day, but I'm giving it to you now.

772
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,560
Hey, I've never put on a tie before, so...

773
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,550
♫  Running in circles  ♫

774
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:51,000
We, delivery truck drivers, don't ever wear ties.

775
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,910
But since you have such a nice face...

776
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:58,590
♫  Sometimes there's no meaning  ♫

777
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,350
Wow...

778
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,860
- You look great. 
 - You look great.

779
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,200
We picked a good one.

780
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,310
The tie isn't that great, but your face is elevating it.

781
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:16,320
So Myeong, if someone asks where you belong,

782
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:23,020
say, "Me? I belong to Hyungnim." Okay?

783
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,860
Whether you went to college or not, no matter where you were born,

784
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,930
and whether your name is known or not,

785
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:34,990
say, "I forever belong to my Hyungnim." Say that.

786
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,220
Got it?

787
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,680
Okay?

788
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,620
Okay.

789
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,770
Let me hug you once.

790
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,390
♫  There are no superstitions  ♫

791
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,110
Congratulations on graduating, little brother.

792
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,850
You did well.

793
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,400
You did well.

794
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,070
Congratulations on graduating, our little brother!

795
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:05,740
♫  You see, I'll just walk away  ♫

796
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:15,030
I'll take the last photo.

797
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,750
One, two, three.

798
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:25,650
♫  What's missing, what's missing, what's missing  ♫

799
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:29,360
♫  What's missing, you know  ♫

800
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,620
Mr. Seo.

801
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,910
Are you done cleaning up?

802
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,590
Yes.

803
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,610
You said you'd grant me a wish. Right?

804
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,380
I...

805
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,250
- don't drink. 
 - What?

806
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,940
Am I drinking alone on a happy day like this?

807
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,230
How boring.

808
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,600
This close, right? 40 cm.

809
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,070
We'll be in the safe zone from now on.

810
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:50,010
I'll protect you so you won't be in danger. So drink up. Here.

811
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:58,060
People would think you're an alien if you never had a drink for more than 30 years.

812
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,970
Hurry.

813
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,120
Cheers.

814
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,990
Wh-Why do you drink this stuff?

815
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,980
This is the taste of adulthood.

816
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,770
It will taste better the second time.

817
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,070
Cheers.

818
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,530
It's tasty, right?

819
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,090
Another glass?

820
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:25,230
You don't know how it feels to finally win again.

821
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,120
So Myeong asked me to thank you for him.

822
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,490
Really?

823
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,840
I haven't heard that in a very long time, either.

824
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,540
It feels great.

825
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:48,650
By the way, don't you owe me?

826
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,570
- Pardon? 
 - Mr. Seo, let me collect my legal fee.

827
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,890
How much is it?

828
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,130
Don't move out.

829
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:10,030
You're going to the Pitcairn Islands in three months. Right?

830
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,580
Can I like you until then?

831
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,950
Bom.

832
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,730
Don't interrupt me.

833
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,330
I'm embarrassed because I've been rejected once already.

834
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:30,240
I've been thinking about what kind of relationship we have.

835
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:36,350
You said the people with no tomorrow come to the studio. Right?

836
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:41,840
Let's always see each other tomorrow, then.

837
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:47,080
"Bye. Take care. Be well."

838
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:51,460
That's all you say at your studio.

839
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,610
So why don't we always see each other tomorrow?

840
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,150
We'll face a lot of dangers from now on,

841
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:05,920
but let's promise we'll always see each other tomorrow, at least.

842
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:12,740
Go ahead and accept.

843
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,940
Put a seal on.

844
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:40,760
Make a copy.

845
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:52,020
♫  Do you think we met by coincidence?  ♫

846
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:59,190
♫  No, I think it was meant to be  ♫

847
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:06,030
♫  If I get to meet you again after a long detour  ♫

848
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:12,570
♫  I'll hug you without a word  ♫

849
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:20,740
♫  My careless love caused you pain  ♫

850
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:27,180
♫  As long as I have you, I don't mind a long detour  ♫

851
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,000
Sign.

852
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,680
See you tomorrow, Mr. Seo.

853
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,290
♫  You're the one person who loved me  ♫

854
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:49,040
♫  Even if you change your mind after time passes  ♫

855
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,900
♫  I'll love you even more  ♫

856
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:58,600
♫  Please just be by my side  ♫

857
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:06,930


858
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,540
   

859
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,450
 Why did we have to live in the same building? 

860
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,340
 How could he be so clueless? 

861
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,550
 You mean you'll start a business at my business site? 

862
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,410
 - Hyeon Joo. 
 - Don't come! 

863
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:25,190
 Not all visitors who come here tell only the truth. 

864
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:29,020
 They say you become an evil spirit if you have a lot of regrets. 

865
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:33,560
 Take a photo while I'm asking nicely. 

866
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,730
 The photographer must like this woman. 

867
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:39,360
 I saved you. 

868
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,120
♫  The times that have passed  ♫
