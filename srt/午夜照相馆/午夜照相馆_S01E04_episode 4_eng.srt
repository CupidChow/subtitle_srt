00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,430
♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,280
♫  Why I don't want to let go of your memories?  ♫

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
   

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,460
   

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,590
   

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,890
   

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:30,650
♫  You hear me, I will call your name today too  ♫

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,190
   

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,570
   

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,960
This is your last photo.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,600
I'll take it now.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,160
One, two, three.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,140
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Midnight Ghost 👻 Team @ Viki.com 

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,390
Be well, Father.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,970
 It rarely happens to the people who stop by the studio, 

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,070
 but sometimes a minor side-effect will show up. 

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,590
What do you mean my son is dead?

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,140
Look! I have a photo here, too.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,440
He laughed, made jokes, and took a photo with me yesterday.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,600
He smiled so handsomely and brightly.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,760
 For a moment, they see what they're not supposed to see. 

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,720
Open my eyes with the Holy Spirit's light, and let me see your path.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,630
Open my ears and let me hear the words of life.

25
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,020
Amen.

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,370
Today, we'll talk about death...

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,530
 Sometimes they become very religious. 

28
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,320
 And the biggest side-effect is... 

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,420
Uncle.

30
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,710
Uncle.

31
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,610
Who are you?

32
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,990
 It's a sense of loss that can't be replaced with anything. 

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,630
   

34
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,890
Ma'am, you were supposed to pick up the photo tomorrow.

35
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,320
You see me, don't you?

36
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,370
Yes.

37
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,920
A photo studio for the dead?

38
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,160
For the three days you'll be staying here,

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,360
you can get your last photo clicked to take with you.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,380
The photo you took for me is enough.

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,570
I was going to use that as a funeral portrait, anyway.

42
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,490
I have no regrets since I have lived long enough,

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,820
but I couldn't leave because I'm worried about one thing.

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,890
What can I help you with, Ma'am?

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,410
- Can't you see the light's red? 
 - Did you see my grandma?

46
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,550
- Bom. 
 - No.

47
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,830
You didn't see her. Right?

48
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm mistaken. Right?

49
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,710
Come on and say I'm mistaken.

50
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,740
Please...

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,980
Let's move!

52
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,060
   

53
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,300
 Get rid of the tent and come inside. 

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,010
 I won't say it again. 

55
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,620
Grandma.

56
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,560
Grandma, why are you here?

57
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,690
It should've been a lie.

58
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,520
It should've been a joke.

59
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,800
Grandma...

60
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,870
Grandma.

61
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,820
Where did Mr. Seo go? He left the studio open, too.

62
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,500
Hospital.

63
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,560
He's accompanying a visitor's family.

64
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,500
Mr. Seo is?

65
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,060
"Is it necessary to check if they're dead?"

66
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,980
That's what he usually says. You're saying that person went to the hospital?

67
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,450
That visitor is...

68
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,840
I see.

69
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,240
You are the ghosts who work at the ghost house.

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,140
You're still so young. Why did you die so early?

71
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,590
Bom's grandmother?

72
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,610
The visitor's family he was accompanying was Bom?

73
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,590
The space is big, but it's empty.

74
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,650
There isn't even a chair to sit on.

75
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,220
Excuse me, scary-looking young man.

76
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,700
Bring out a comfy chair for me.

77
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,940
Ma'am, you'd get in trouble if you upset him.

78
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,000
What worse could happen at my age?

79
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,240
Let's see...

80
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,100
Ma'am, the chair arrived.

81
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,270
Might as well get me some tea, too.

82
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,030
Ssanghwacha would be good. 
  (Korean medicinal tea) 

83
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,340
Would you like an egg yolk on it?

84
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,940
Of course.

85
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,260
A ssanghwacha without an egg yolk

86
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,190
is like a red bean bun without red bean paste.

87
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,670
Ma'am,

88
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,770
let me know if you need anything.

89
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,110
We'll make sure to get anything for you.

90
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,140
To be honest, Mr. Seo has to ask Bom a favor.

91
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,260
 Grandma. 

92
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,190
 Grandma, why are you here? 

93
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,330
 It should've been a lie. 

94
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,270
 It should've been a joke. 

95
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,820
Where's the funeral parlor for Ms. So Geum Soon?

96
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,010
Ms. So Geum Soon? It would be this way.

97
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,820
Ms. Han Bom is getting changed right now.

98
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,240
What brings you here, Mr. Seo?

99
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,780
How about you? What brings you here?

100
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,240
We needed to deliver something to Attorney Han.

101
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,180
Lieutenant Lee.

102
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,360
Thank you for helping me today.

103
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,710
And if you see...

104
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,140
If you see Grandma, you need to contact me first.

105
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,400
I'll get going.

106
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,380
 Don't tell Attorney Han for now. 

107
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,140
 I never came here. Okay? 

108
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,860
 But why... 

109
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,650
 Because the living have to live. 

110
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,460
That's what the deceased wants.

111
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,610
Don't worry about it.

112
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,940
What does it have to do with you?

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,400
The person who called 911 kept this for you.

114
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,960
- Thank you. 
 - She had a heart attack.

115
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,460
They tried to get there as soon as possible, but...

116
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,580
It's okay. They did their best.

117
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,600
And here...

118
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,850
What's this?

119
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,390
Ms. So had this when she passed away.

120
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,010
I suppose you like injeolmi a lot. 
  (A type of Korean rice cake) 

121
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,000
Who did she...

122
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,570
get all this for?

123
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,190
Gosh, seriously...

124
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,750
You're too young to be sleeping in so much.

125
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,230
Get up. Get up.

126
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,250
You said I only have three days.

127
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,170
Ma'am, the business hour starts after sunset.

128
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,890
You said you work for the dead.

129
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,620
Get up right now!

130
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,200
I don't work for the dead.

131
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,040
I take photos of the dead. Okay?

132
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,370
That's what I meant. What's the difference?

133
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,860
Hurry!

134
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,730
Gosh, seriously, Ma'am.

135
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,700
I heard you want to impress Bom.

136
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm not sure what it is, but I'll put in a good word for you.

137
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,460
So you should work for me.

138
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,490
As hard as you can.

139
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,360
   

140
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,100
These are the types of caskets and these are the types of shrouds available.

141
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,880
They usually...

142
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,530
go with these options.

143
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,930
And some also go with more premium options like these.

144
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,130
Did you announce her passing?

145
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,630
Well, I messaged the contacts on my phone,

146
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,490
but her phone is passcode-protected.

147
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,230
You have to contact people quickly.

148
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,130
Did you choose a funeral portrait?

149
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,080
Here's the funeral portrait.

150
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,590
Sorry for the delay. I should've given it to you sooner.

151
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,590
Why do you have this...

152
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,360
By chance, did Grandma—

153
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,600
No.

154
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,150
She took the picture a few days before she passed away.

155
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,030
We'll let you know a little later.

156
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,340
Mr. Seo, what kind of people come to the studio again?

157
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,130
Before entering the netherworld, the dead walk a very treacherous and long path.

158
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,700
This place is only visible to those who retrace their steps on that difficult path.

159
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,780
You don't see it unless you're very desperate.

160
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,130
That means only the ones with a lot of regrets in life come to visit.

161
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,510
Ms. So probably didn't need to come

162
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,740
since she had no regrets in life.

163
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,410
For the casket,

164
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,850
I recommend Paulownia wood.

165
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,260
As for the shroud,

166
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I heard this is good.

167
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,190
How do you know all this?

168
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,010
Because I've always done this.

169
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,350
- Thank you. 
 - If you're thankful,

170
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,200
why don't you reconsider?

171
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
The safe zone.

172
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,610
    
 We'll have this and this.

173
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,540
   

174
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,420
One more soju and more soup, please.

175
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,590
Yes, got it.

176
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,390
Soju.

177
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,870
Soup.

178
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,230
Here's the soup and soju.

179
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,830
Do you need anything else?

180
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,280
Let me do the physical labor. You should stay inside, Bom.

181
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,240
Your job is to remain inside as the grieving family.

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,340
I don't think we've met. Who are you?

183
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,520
Nice to meet you. I'm Go Seong Ho.

184
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,810
Right, Go Seong Ho is my uncle's name.

185
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,940
   

186
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,120
Well, my name is Go Woon.

187
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
Kim Go Woon.

188
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,550
Hello. How do you know my grandmother, by the way?

189
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,530
I'm sorry. I don't recall meeting you.

190
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,280
It's just... our souls talk to one another?

191
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,510
- Pardon? 
 - Anyway,

192
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,990
maybe not today, but...

193
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,780
I'll make sure to return with a different appearance.

194
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,530
The safe zone.

195
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,570
Cheer up, Bom. Fighting!

196
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,860
Cheer up,

197
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,550
Bom.

198
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,320
   

199
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,640
It's not her birthday,

200
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,770
the passcode for the door, or my birthday.

201
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,660
What is it, Grandma?

202
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,830
You like money, Grandma.

203
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,380
I need to send the obituary to invite people.

204
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,320
You said you need to reap what you sow.

205
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,130
But what's the use?

206
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,020
I can't even collect the money.

207
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,410
 You need to get something for me behind Bom's back. 

208
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,890
Where's the list of condolence payments?

209
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,490
Right here.

210
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,400
You can't take anything to the netherworld, Ma'am.

211
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm not trying to take it. I'm trying to check.

212
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,350
This ledger is my everything.

213
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,870
My loan ledger.

214
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,490
I've been keeping this my entire life.

215
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,900
Let's see how much I reaped after what I sowed.

216
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,180
Huh? The Lees who own the produce store.

217
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,730
I sent 100,000 won when his son got married.

218
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,040
But he only gave 50,000 for my funeral? Geez.

219
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,340
Is he serious? I can't even argue with him right now!

220
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,970
Wow. Nothing's better than fried chicken after physical labor.

221
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,410
You sure enjoy fried chicken.

222
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:25,440
I won't be able to have tasty food like this once I leave.

223
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,630
You seem to disapprove of me, Mr. Seo.

224
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,650
Have some.

225
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,790
That little...

226
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,190
Mr. Seo is disapproving of any visitors. Don't worry.

227
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,870
He is pretty likable minus his temper.

228
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,800
How do you do this?

229
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,480
I noticed you were good at it.

230
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,140
Not anyone has this skill.

231
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,450
There's no point in being a ghost at all.

232
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,750
Ghosts can harass people in movies, you know.

233
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,730
They aren't just ghosts. They're resentful or evil ones.

234
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,190
The bastards who hurt people because they're resentful of this world.

235
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,430
By the way, Ma'am, I forgot to tell you this.

236
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,040
- Did you hear about my relationship with Bom? 
 - What?

237
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,770
About three years ago, I—

238
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,280
Eat.

239
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,700
- The drumsticks are the best. 
 - Gosh.

240
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,600
Have a wing.

241
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,270
- The chairs... 
 - What's going on?

242
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
The chairs... The chairs...

243
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,680
Thank you.

244
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,090
What's that? What's that? What's going on?

245
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,910
Oh my gosh!

246
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,180
My gosh, it's moving on its own. My gosh.

247
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,060
My gosh. My gosh. Look at that!

248
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,790
Hey, there's a ghost in our neighborhood! It's a ghost!

249
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,230
Ghost! Ghost!

250
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,010
Hold on. Hold on. Wait!

251
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,130
How do I photograph this? Geez.

252
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,420
   

253
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,960
 Why don't we go to Jeju to see the flowers? 

254
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,270
 - Should we go see the cherry blossoms? 
 - It's summer right now. 

255
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,160
 They were gone a long time ago. 

256
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,110
 Well, we can go next year, then. 

257
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,980
 Spring always comes back. 

258
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,030
 Just like me. 

259
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,020
   

260
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Attorney Han, there are no more guests.

261
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,530
Get some sleep in the chief mourner's room.

262
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,180
You need to hang in there to send her off well.

263
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,020
Senior.

264
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,560
Yes?

265
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,290
She must've really removed me from the family registry.

266
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,630
What are you talking about?

267
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,230
Other people apparently come back because they can't leave.

268
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,430
Because they miss someone and can't leave.

269
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
They go back on a long, treacherous path and return to meet them.

270
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,090
But I suppose Madam So...

271
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,160
doesn't miss me.

272
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,300
I suppose...

273
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,070
I've caused nothing but trouble. What right do I have?

274
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,950
Right?

275
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,590
Attorney Han.

276
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,630
How foolish.

277
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,690
I didn't even know it would be the last time.

278
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,860
I thought another spring would come again.

279
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,780
I thought they would keep coming back.

280
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,390
I think I took too long.

281
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,110
Attorney Han, what are you looking for?

282
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,640
Grandma's phone and purse.

283
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,260
I definitely put them here, but they're gone.

284
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,450
Huh?

285
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,600
W-What's that?

286
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,620
Hold on. Let me play it again.

287
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,420
No, it's okay.

288
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,370
I think I know who took them.

289
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:28,760
That Mr. Yang. I've given him tons of free food.

290
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,720
How could he only give me 30,000 won? Seriously.

291
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,230
You're supposed to give at least 100,000 won for a wedding these days.

292
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,250
Maybe Bom really isn't her biological granddaughter.

293
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,520
She might be better off not knowing.

294
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,140
I can hear everything, Mr. Chatty.

295
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,100
My hearing is as good as a young person's since I'm dead.

296
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,600
- Put it back in. 
 - O-Okay.

297
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,710
   

298
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,610
The safe zone?

299
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,390
Bom?

300
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,990
Bom.

301
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,600
Attorney Han.

302
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,860
This isn't a funeral portrait, is it?

303
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,410
You lied when you said she took it a few days ago. Right?

304
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,750
What are you talking about, exactly?

305
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,150
Grandma's phone.

306
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,530
You took it and sent the obituary around.

307
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,610
Grandma's here. Right?

308
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,770
Where is she?

309
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,030
Bom.

310
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,930
My heaven.

311
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,660
Have you been eating at all?

312
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,080
Do you still have anything to say to me?

313
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,440
Let's leave.

314
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,820
Bom...

315
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,980
Mr. Seo, where's my grandma?

316
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
Bom, let's talk outside.

317
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,260
I don't want to.

318
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,150
Why would I leave? I can't.

319
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,680
Ms. So Geum Soon was here. I can't leave until I meet her.

320
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,180
Why are you lying to me? Why?

321
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,840
Did my grandma say...

322
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,390
she didn't want to see me?

323
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,820
Who said so?

324
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,650
No, Ma'am—

325
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,330
Is she here?

326
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,070
Right now?

327
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,100
Grandma, do you really not want to see me?

328
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,680
It doesn't matter.

329
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,160
You've been doing whatever you want all this time.

330
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,220
I'll do whatever I want from now on.

331
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,000
Madam So, let's go see the flowers.

332
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,330
Let's go see the flowers, Grandma.

333
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,800
There won't be...

334
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,090
any more springs.

335
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,920
What are you doing in there?

336
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,670
Wow, her taste is so consistent. She's so single-minded.

337
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,900
There's a flower festival right in her wardrobe.

338
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,220
This would be good for the brunch.

339
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,200
Grandma, I found a cafe with an amazing ocean view.

340
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,010
And for lounging at night...

341
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,890
- Mr. Seo. 
 - Yes.

342
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,490
Ask her what she's talking about right now.

343
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,950
Ms. So is asking what you're doing right now.

344
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,410
Mr. Seo, ask her what she prefers between these.

345
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,440
No, this suits her better.

346
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,540
She's picking outfits for you.

347
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,540
Grandma,  go with me to Jeju.

348
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,450
It's still the hydrangea season there now.

349
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,770
Let's go see flowers right now.

350
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,750
What kind of utter nonsense is this?

351
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,710
The funeral guests are going to arrive soon.

352
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,360
Where are you going without collecting my precious money?

353
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,290
You're the chief mourner. Okay?

354
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,340
They're about to come since we sent the obituary.

355
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,990
What are you doing? Tell her, Mr. Seo.

356
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,090
Ms. So is telling you to stay at the funeral home.

357
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,900
Why did you cut out the last part?

358
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,780
She doesn't like any of these. Right?

359
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,170
I'll put them back, then.

360
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,000
Get it together, you fool.

361
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,550
You need to collect my money.

362
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,120
I gave 50,000 won for Jeong Won's wedding last month.

363
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,830
30,000 won for Yeong Ji's first birthday.

364
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,360
And... where's my ledger? My ledger.

365
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,270
Why won't you interpret properly?

366
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,240
I suppose she gave away a lot of money gifts.

367
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,380
She wants to get all of that paid back.

368
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,700
Why do you care about money gifts?

369
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,350
Is it that important to get back what you gave out?

370
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,780
Why? What will you do with that money?

371
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,030
It's not like you can take it with you. Why are you doing this?

372
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,670
I'll use it for my traveling expenses to the netherworld.

373
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,010
So, collect every single penny of my condolence money.

374
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,000
What's the point of doing that?

375
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,740
Don't you find it unfair?

376
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,550
You've only bought clothes that cost 10,000 won for five to save money.

377
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,470
You never had a meal that cost over 5,000 won at restaurants.

378
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,600
To provide me with food, home, and clothes in my parents' place,

379
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,640
you never got to see flowers properly

380
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,030
while so many springs passed by in your life.

381
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,530
You've always wanted to go see flowers,

382
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,050
but I never took you there.

383
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,420
But if you don't see them now, you'll never see them again.

384
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,190
There's no next time anymore, Grandma.

385
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,950
Hey, look.

386
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,590
Why would I go see flowers with you?

387
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,640
Yes.

388
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,580
For the past 20 years,

389
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,150
I provided food, home, and sent you to school.

390
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,670
All I've done was work hard to raise you.

391
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm glad you brought it up.

392
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,850
I never had a meal that cost more than 5,000 won my whole life.

393
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,200
And I never got to see the flowers as I wanted to.

394
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,570
Those money gifts are where I spent them. That's how precious it is.

395
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,830
How dare you try to take that precious moment from me?

396
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,280
Grandma.

397
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,970
I'll take plenty of travel money and...

398
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,610
go to the netherworld comfortably.

399
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,130
So, I don't care whether you play the chief mourner or not,

400
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,920
just live your life doing what you want.

401
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,410
Ma'am.

402
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,480
♫  There was no response to the voice that resonated  ♫

403
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,340
Bom.

404
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,840
She didn't get to go see the flowers...

405
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,890
because of me.

406
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,300
She had to raise me.

407
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,500
It was because of me.

408
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,440
I'll try to persuade her again.

409
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,870
I'm sure she didn't mean it, either.

410
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:15,870
♫  I'm not used to spending the night alone  ♫

411
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,100
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

412
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,370
No, I'll go. I need to do what I'm supposed to do.

413
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,000
I could never face her if I didn't even do this.

414
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,400
Let me take you there.

415
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,830
Do you want to do that thing?

416
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,760
♫  I still don't know why  ♫

417
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,410
Do what?

418
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,470
The stuff you like to do.

419
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:47,920
♫  I think I'll fall apart without you  ♫

420
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,130
How much time does my grandma have?

421
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,370
She has about 40 hours left now.

422
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,800
So I just need to...

423
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,010
stay at the funeral home as she wants. Right?

424
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,580
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,380
The visitor's request is my priority.

426
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,030
She likes very flashy flower patterns.

427
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,900
Let her wear the flashiest one for the photo.

428
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,120
And she's really pretty when she smiles. But she can't smile when she's nervous.

429
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,690
You should try to relax her, too.

430
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,600
That way, the photo will turn out nicely.

431
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,140
She was very beautiful when she was young.

432
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,990
I'll do that.

433
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,070
And...

434
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,280
And make sure to tell her...

435
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,270
that I was very happy...

436
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,390
living as her granddaughter.

437
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,380
Excuse me, Ma'am.

438
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,340
Why are you out here instead of going in?

439
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,340
It's you, Bom.

440
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,140
I'm so sorry.

441
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,680
Oh, you couldn't come in because I wasn't there.

442
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,100
- Come on in. 
 - No, no, no.

443
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,110
I need to go. I need to tend to the shop.

444
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,290
Oh, right. You're busy.

445
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,350
- Why don't you come in and eat— 
 - No.

446
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,240
I need to go. Yes.

447
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,350
- I'll go. 
 - Well...

448
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,960
Well, Bom...

449
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,360
Yes.

450
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,590
I'm sorry.

451
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,610
Pardon? Why would you suddenly say that?

452
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,090
I heard Ms. So collapsed in front of the Prosecutors' Office.

453
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:27,670
Gosh! I shouldn't have told her that. Seriously...

454
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,090
What do you mean?

455
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,830
I told her that you got fired from the Prosecutor's Office.

456
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,680
I didn't know she'd go there right away.

457
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,320
I even wrote down, "Chief Prosecutor Lee Hyeon Oh."

458
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,080
I was really out of my mind! I don't know what to do.

459
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,690
Wait. Grandma learned all about that?

460
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,340
Well...

461
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,260
I'm sorry.

462
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,030
I'm really sorry.

463
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm sorry. Gosh...

464
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,690
Grandma...

465
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,120
Because of me...

466
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,090
   

467
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,490
 Do you want to sell tteokbokki with me? 

468
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,070
 Maybe it's my age, 

469
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,210
 I get bored and feel lonely. 

470
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,070
She knew, but she pretended like she didn't.

471
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,820
Kim Ji Won.

472
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,880
I'm sorry. I came straight from the airport.

473
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,240
The only funeral-appropriate outfit I had was my last Halloween outfit.

474
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,600
I thought you were in Italy.

475
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,300
That doesn't matter when you're here right now.

476
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,370
Han Bom, you must've been hurting a lot.

477
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,360
Ji Won.

478
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,810
Grandma knew everything.

479
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,100
She knew I got fired from the Prosecutor's Office

480
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,400
and that was going around as a pathetic lawyer without a single case.

481
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,780
She knew all about it.

482
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,480
She must've found me so pathetic that

483
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
she even went there...

484
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,550
It's all my fault.

485
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,560
I miss my grandma.

486
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,330
It's my fault.

487
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,300
It's all done now.

488
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,340
The list is finally complete.

489
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,990
Ma'am, you must've done a lot of favors for people.

490
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,970
I didn't do a lot of favors. I just sowed around a lot of money.

491
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,570
Does my coffin need to be sent away now?

492
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,120
There isn't a lot of time left.

493
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,990
Should we bring Bom here even now?

494
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,050
Since I'm done sorting out the ledger,

495
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,820
I should leave now.

496
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,140
Mr. Seo, I'll leave on my own.

497
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,730
I like it the way it is now.

498
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,090
Pardon? Will you really not see Bom before you leave?

499
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,360
If you disappear like that, what about the people who are left behind?

500
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,060
I mean...

501
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,100
if you sort things out on your own and leave without saying goodbye,

502
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,250
what about the people left behind?

503
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,480
There's nothing they can do but wait.

504
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,930
You should at least let them say goodbye.

505
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,920
That's a burden for the living.

506
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,830
Isn't that your job, Mr. Seo?

507
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,880
Must that be your conclusion?

508
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,190
You have no regrets. Right?

509
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,640
I'll start preparing, then.

510
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,320
   

511
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,380
Grandma.

512
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,220
Grandma,

513
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,180
I'm sorry.

514
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,290
It's my fault. I'm sorry, Grandma.

515
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:04,190
♫  Do you think we met by coincidence?  ♫

516
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,400
♫  No, I think it was meant to be  ♫

517
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,000
It's okay.

518
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,570
It's okay.

519
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,150
♫  If I get to meet you again  ♫

520
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:24,600
♫  I'll hug you without a word  ♫

521
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:32,740
♫  My careless love caused you pain  ♫

522
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:39,100
♫  As long as I have you, I don't mind a long detour  ♫

523
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:46,340
♫  Even if my time stops and my life ends  ♫

524
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,770
♫  I choose you, it's meant to be  ♫

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,450
♫  You're the one person who loved me  ♫

526
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,440
I'm sorry...

527
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,250
Grandma.

528
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,150
I'm sorry.

529
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,790
♫  I'll love you even more  ♫

530
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,420
Stop feeling bad...

531
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,000
lady.

532
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,080
I provided Bom with food, clothes, and home with this truck.

533
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,640
She grew up here.

534
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,980
Since I had to run the business all the time,

535
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,850
I was too nervous to leave her at home by herself.

536
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,660
   

537
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,230
 It's hot. Be careful. 

538
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,280
 - Thank you. 
 - Sure. 

539
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,100
   

540
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,310
 I measured her height here, too. 

541
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,470
 Her playground was in front of the truck. 

542
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,510
 There's nothing here she didn't touch. 

543
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,950
This place had the best night view, you know.

544
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,830
It's a shame I won't get to see that.

545
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,360
Did you really come back here because of the condolence money?

546
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,470
Mr. Seo, how many more years would I have lived if I didn't die?

547
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,540
Five years? Ten years?

548
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,300
Or I would've lived 15 more years till I went senile.

549
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,110
That kid has many days ahead of her.

550
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,390
I didn't want her to be alone when it was time

551
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,910
to celebrate or mourn.

552
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:29,020
That's why I'd been going to all those parties.

553
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,610
 - Ms. So. 
 - Congratulations. Congratulations. 

554
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,860
   

555
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:41,050
   

556
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,990
The people who remember me

557
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,780
 - You came.  
 - ...would remember Bom

558
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,510
even when I'm no longer in this world.

559
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,070
So, you need to deliver that to her.

560
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,890
Throw that one away. She won't need it.

561
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,560
   

562
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,780
Check on her once in a while.

563
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,080
I'm glad she has a neighbor like you, at least.

564
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:33,890
   

565
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,070
I threw it away.

566
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,590
This is Grandma's ledger.

567
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,620
Wow, you look so beautiful.

568
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:52,550
Attorney Han got it for me with her first paycheck as a prosecutor.

569
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,880
Wow, she definitely has great taste.

570
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,300
It's a nice day to leave for the netherworld.

571
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,820
Mr. Seo rarely does outdoor photoshoots,

572
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,940
but he's making an exception for you, Ma'am.

573
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,540
Wait outside, Ms. So.

574
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,060
I'll bring the equipment.

575
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,850
Okay, I will.

576
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,280
   

577
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,200
It would've been nice if I lived until spring.

578
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,160
I don't get to see the flowers.

579
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:50,190
   

580
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,960
Ta-da!

581
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,630
Welcome to Bom's Night Cherry Blossom Festival.

582
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,490
What's going on?

583
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,450
Bom brought spring. 
  (Bom's name is also the word for "spring" in Korean) 

584
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,100
 

585
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,420
♫  With my eyes open  ♫

586
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,730
   

587
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:05,660
   

588
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:13,640
 March 18th, 1996. The day my baby had her first tteokbokki. 

589
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,190
 I feel full just looking at her. 

590
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,380
   

591
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,920
 - Goodness. 
 - I love you, Grandma. 

592
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,660
 Goodness, yes. My baby. Sweetheart. 

593
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:31,750
 May 8th, 1997. The first carnation my baby gave me. Don't wither away. 

594
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,370
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

595
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:39,030
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫ 
    

596
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:44,210
♫  Happy birthday, dear Madam So. Happy birthday...  ♫

597
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,150
 The first birthday meal my baby made me. 

598
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,930
 I had a shot of soju because I felt good. This is the best. 

599
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:52,780
♫  Because I couldn't hold on to those things  ♫

600
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,610
 May 19th, 2018. 

601
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,790
 The day my baby was appointed as a prosecutor. 

602
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,130
 - Fighting! 
 - This is a new beginning. 

603
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,230
 You really made it. 

604
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,450
 Hey, smile more brightly. 

605
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,910
 I'll send it to all the matchmakers. 

606
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,410
 You're not doing that, Grandma. 

607
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,060
 I'll take one of you with Bom, too. 

608
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,990
 Just take one. 

609
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,410
 One, two, three. 

610
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:18,020
 She must've struggled a lot alone after getting fired. 

611
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,580
 I wish she had told me. 

612
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,780
 My heaven. I'll make sure to feed you until I die. 

613
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,790
 Appointment of a party of one for Ms. So Geum Soon at midnight today. 

614
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,500
 I hope you get a chance. 

615
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:39,050
♫  Maybe tomorrow, I hope you rely on me  ♫

616

Ji Won, please stay here for me.

620
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,520

How's this?

623
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,420
It's pretty.

624
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,860
I think this one looks good.

627
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:25,350
Dad, look at this.

628
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,830
Okay, okay. One more time.

629
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,950
- Let's go one more time. 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

630
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,510
An elderly visitor will be here soon.

631
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,080
She'll be walking this way. You can't let her see you. Okay?

632
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,920
You'll be going up in the sky.

633
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,720
Please sprinkle the petals with a bright and happy energy.

634
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,070
- Okay? 
  - Okay. 

635
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,610
Here. Who wants tteokbokki?

636
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:14,860
♫  Even our desperate pain that I feel on my fingertips  ♫

637
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:24,390
♫  I might not find what I can do for you  ♫

♫  like this  ♫

642
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,070
Did you really do all this yourself?

643
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,180
Because you wanted me to see spring blossoms?

644
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,500
The invisible ghosts helped us.

645
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,230
What do you think of my spring?

646
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,970
It's pretty.

647
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,920
Isn't it?

648
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,040
Grandma?

649
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:35,480
Is it really you, Grandma?

650
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,730
My baby.

651
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:43,670
My precious baby.

652
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,240
Grandma, I'm sorry.

653
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,210
I'm not as impressive a person as you wrote in the ledger.

654
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,720
I was fired from the Prosecutor's Office, too.

655
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,810
You cared for me so much, but I'm sorry I couldn't be better.

656
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,790
I'm sorry.

657
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,230
Bom, you were my pride.

658
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:12,800
You are the best and number one to me.

659
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,370
I, So Geum Soon, acknowledge you.

660
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:20,540
So, stand tall from now on.

661
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,580
Grandma.

662
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,690
What are you doing?

663
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,770
You said it's a cherry blossom festival.

664
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,610
Let's go look at the flowers.

665
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,380
Okay.

666
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,050
We should.

667
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,220
Let's go.

668
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,580
Bom.

669
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,990
Yes.

670
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,910
Someone on TV said...

671
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,120
the one who smiles at the end isn't truly happy.

672
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,710
The one who smiles often is truly happy.

673
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,880
Thanks to you, I got to smile a lot.

674
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,570
You could say I lived a happy life.

675
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,180
For me, too, Grandma...

676
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:23,430
I had the happiest life because of you.

677
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:27,000
My baby who's more precious than any treasure.

678
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,010
Don't remember me for too long.

679
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,290
Okay.

680
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,400
Don't miss me for too long.

681
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,720
Okay.

682
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,750
Don't hurt for too long, either.

683
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,840
Okay, Grandma.

684
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,790
I won't.

685
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,690
I promise.

686
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,060
How pretty.

687
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,140
Mr. Seo, you broke the rule for something for once.

688
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,010
You said the visitor's request is your priority.

689
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,600
They ended up seeing each other, anyway.

690
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:23,320
I'll take the second photo now.

691
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:40,330
How pretty.

692
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,500
Grandma,

693
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,470
you brought spring to my life.

694
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,470
Thank you.

695
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,990
Don't be nervous.

696
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,010
Say "kimchi."

697
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,540
Kimchi.

698
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,640
I'll take it now.

699
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,900
One, two, three.

700
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,030
♫  I've nothing to lose  ♫

701
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,600
♫  Every day was the same  ♫

702
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:29,350
♫  Running in circles  ♫

703
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:35,310
♫  For a losing game  ♫

704
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,920
♫  Sometimes there's no meaning  ♫

705
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:47,330
♫  Life goes the way it came  ♫

706
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,330
♫  Always caught in the middle  ♫

707
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:58,930
♫  There's no fun to plan  ♫

708
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,120
♫  How about superstitions?  ♫

709
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:10,790
♫  Try clinging to your soul  ♫

710
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:16,050
♫  So only then a girl can dream about what's missing  ♫

711
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:22,520
♫  What's missing, what's missing, what's missing, you know  ♫

712
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,610
Deputy Go will come back after seeing the deceased's family off.

713
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,520
I see.

714
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,120
- The deceased's family. 
 - I found it a bit unexpected.

715
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,140
You gave the ledger to the deceased's family, which went against the visitor's request.

716
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,320
I heard this was your first-time taking photos outside despite the risks.

717
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,860
There are a lot of variables outside and it's dangerous.

718
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,650
But you still took the risk and went ahead.

719
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:06,450
Looks like you're treating her differently than usual.

720
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,630
By chance, do you have feelings for her?

721
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,560
Not at all.

722
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,390
I just owe her because of a coupon.

723
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:24,530
Is that so? I'll go home now, then.

724
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,540
 At least, you could... 

725
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:37,460
 say goodbye to Bom, right? 
   

726
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,010
 I had an uncle. 

727
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,950
 He was my only family member. 

728
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,860
 - I... 
 - Don't go anywhere without me. 

729
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,770
 - didn't know that would be our last day together. 
 - Okay. 

730
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,900
 I was certain I'd see him the next day. 

731
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,060
 I didn't even get to say goodbye. 

732
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,510
 It's been almost 20 years, 

733
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,930
 but I keep thinking about the last moment that day. 

734
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,050
 I revisit it over and over again. 

735
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,420
 I keep thinking I didn't say goodbye for the last time. 

736
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,830
 Bom would feel that way, too. 

737
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:09,560
 She'll keep reliving the last day with you for the rest of her life. 

738
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,300
 Would you really be okay with that? 

739
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,350
 Why do you think I ended up with Bom? 

740
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,810
 She was in an accident... 

741
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:23,720
 and she survived alone. 

742
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,020
 She saw her parents dying while trapped in the car. 

743
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,120
 Mom. 

744
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,740
 She can't be free from that nightmare, either. 

745
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,520
 Because she feels guilty for surviving alone. 

746
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,330
 She can't even erase the scar from that day. 

747
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:44,240
 But if I showed up in this state, too... 

748
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,160
 I might look fine right now, 

749
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,480
 but I'm already dead. 

750
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,650
 I can't let her have another nightmare like that. 

751
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,550
I know, huh?

752
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:03,010
Why did you do that, Seo Ki Joo?

753
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:28,100
   

754
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:34,120
Uncle, will we get a chance to say goodbye, too?

755
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:07,080
Why have a meeting this early?

756
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,130
I'll be back.

757
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,670
Good morning, Bom.

758
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,390
You look more energetic than I expected.

759
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,760
   

760
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,200
 Each person visiting the studio has a different side-effect depending on their personality. 

761
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,520
You got up early.

762
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,930
I haven't gone to bed yet. I'm getting off work now.

763
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:15,280
That's great. I had something to tell you, anyway.

764
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,210
If you want to thank me, it's not necessary.

765
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,950
You know the landlord of this building has changed now. Right?

766
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:28,920
Are you demanding a reward after I saved you?

767
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,620
I'll charge the same rent.

768
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:33,360
I'll send you my account number later.

769
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,150
Okay.

770
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:41,440
And thank you for the ledger, Mr. Seo.

771
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,560
By the way, Mr. Seo...

772
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:59,350
when will I stop seeing ghosts?

773
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,920
Pardon?

774
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:09,660
It's him, right? The one who insists that he had a blind date with me.

775
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,160
   

776
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,610
Deputy Go Seong Ho.

777
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:24,950
Do you see me right now?

778
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,950
Yes, I see you very clearly.

779
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,090
But I know now that I see his face.

780
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:34,040
I never had a blind date with him. I'm certain.

781
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,580
D-Do you still see him?

782
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:40,310
Didn't you say I'd stop seeing them after taking the photo?

783
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,600
What else do you see?

784
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,500
A little girl on the earthenware pot.

785
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,880
And...

786
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,820
the lady with messy hair in front of the wall.

787
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,950
That man is bleeding a lot.

788
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:03,780
The man who's bleeding next to the car.

789
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:12,300
Huh? He's the jeweler who passed away last year.

790
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:19,300
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Midnight Ghost 👻 Team @ Viki.com 

791
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,520
And a lady is waving her hand, up in the air.

792
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,040
 But I never thought about what side-effect would show up... 

793
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,780
I see everything. Very clearly.

794
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:32,470
 ...when a one-of-a-kind camera and a one-of-a-kind 

795
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:34,910
 mutant encounter one another. 

796
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,110
♫  Every day I floated breathlessly  ♫

797
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,700
♫  And every night I endured it dangerously alone  ♫

798
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:45,170

805
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:05,130
 I don't care what it is. Find out if there were similar cases. 

806
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,930
 Why is she always an exception? 

807
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,550
 She came inside a place she wasn't supposed to. 

808
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,050
 You have a comrade. A comrade who sees ghosts. 

809
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:18,110
 Strange things started happening to Bom since I moved into this place. 

810
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:23,200
 The safe zone or whatever. I'm not safe. It doesn't work on me.
