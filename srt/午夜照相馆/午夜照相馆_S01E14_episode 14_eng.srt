â™«  I still wonder why  â™«

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,120
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,330
â™«  I don't want to forget your memories.  â™«

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,540
   

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,420
   

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,460
   

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,870
   

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:30,870
â™«  You hear me, I will call your name today too  â™«

00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,310
   
   

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,180
   

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,890
   

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,160
   

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,680
Bom!

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,960
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Midnight Ghost ðŸ‘» Team @ Viki.com 

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,790
 Attorney Han! 

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,100
 Are you okay? 

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,670
- Mr. Seo. 
 - M-Mr. Seo.

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,730
- Are you okay? 
 - Attorney!

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,550
Bring something to cover her with!

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,610
Wait here for a moment.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,810
Bom, are you okay?

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,000
Mr. Seo.

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,440
It's okay.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,010
It's okay. It's all over.

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,120
This is Uncle's photo studio.

26
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,300
How could this be...

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,990
You came.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,410
Uncle.

29
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,320
Yes. It's your uncle.

30
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,630
I'm sorry, Uncle.

31
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,740
I thought you left me behind.

32
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,770
I thought you left me alone...

33
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,850
in this damned world.

34
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,360
So I've been blaming you my whole life.

35
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,380
It's okay.

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,550
It's okay.

37
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,130
I came too late, didn't I?

38
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,300
My last photo should be taken by you.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Wow, it feels really weird to be a customer here.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,610
Hold still.

41
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,770
I'll take the first photo, then.

42
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,880
One, two, three.

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,660
You know what the second photo means. Right?

44
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,050
A goodbye between...

45
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,100
the dead and the living.

46
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,520
Yes.

47
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,540
I won't say embarrassing things like, "Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you."

48
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,660
Don't you dare.

49
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,780
I'm glad that...

50
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,690
I get to see you all grown up.

51
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,340
â™«  Every day was the same  â™«

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Uncle.

53
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,280
Can we just not take the photo?

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,800
We just met. Only just.

55
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,550
â™«  Sometimes there's no meaning  â™«

56
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,520
Seo Ki Joo,

57
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,300
there's someone waiting for you.

58
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,390
Aren't you going to go back?

59
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,320
- Uncle. 
 - What are you doing?

60
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,300
You need to do your job as a photographer.

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,670
â™«  There's no fun to plan  â™«

62
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,690
â™«  How about superstition?  â™«

63
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,200
If so...

64
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,290
I'll take the second photo.

65
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,560
- One. 
 - I'm...

66
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,580
sorry I'm leaving you behind...

67
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,330
â™«  What's missing? What's missing?  â™«

68
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,970
...once again, Ki Joo.

69
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,110
In your next life,

70
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,310
don't be a photographer who takes care of ghosts...

71
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,750
or my uncle.

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,500
Just be born as a normal person...

73
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,190
and live a long life, Uncle.

74
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,970
â™«  What's missing, what's missing, you know  â™«

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,380
I'll take the...

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
last photo, then.

77
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,740
One,

78
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,360
two,

79
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,580
three.

80
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,400
See you again, Uncle.

81
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,470
Happy birthday.

82
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,800
   

83
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,760
Ma'am, are you okay?

84
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,020
Ma'am!

85
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,300
M-Mr. Seo...

86
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,320
â™«  There was no response to the voice  â™«

87
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,500
Mr. Seo.

88
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,510
Mr. Seo?

89
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,250
â™«  I endured a day trapped in long silence  â™«

90
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,300
No.

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,490
No, please.

92
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,470
â™«  The greeting I couldn't say is   â™«

93
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,580
â™«  Still on the tip of my tongue  â™«

94
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,300
â™«  I blank out  â™«

95
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,600
Are you looking for me?

96
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,320
â™«  I'm not used to spending the night alone  â™«

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,070
â™«  I can still feel your warmth clearly  â™«

98
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,100
Is it really you, Mr. Seo?

99
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,490
â™«  I couldn't say the last word to you  â™«

100
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,380
â™«  Stay by my side  â™«

101
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,890
â™«  I still wonder why  â™«

102
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,130
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

103
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,470
It's you.

104
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,590
â™«  I don't want to lose my memories of you  â™«

105
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,530
â™«  I still don't know why  â™«

106
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,510
I'm back.

107
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,140
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

108
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,620
â™«  Let the long night pass  â™«

109
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,230
â™«  I still wonder why  â™«

110
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,570
â™«  Where you are  â™«

111
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,430
â™«  I still don't know why  â™«

112
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,530
â™«  Until my heart reaches you  â™«

113
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,200
â™«  You told me we'd never  â™«

114
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
â™«  I'll call your name  â™«

115
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,270
Three ribs broke, and...

116
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,830
he was injured everywhere, from head to toe,

117
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,380
but he'll live, apparently.

118
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,150
What are ghosts doing? They should've taken someone like him.

119
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,220
That's good.

120
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,560
- Open it. 
 - Pardon?

121
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,860
Will you really go in?

122
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,080
Yes.

123
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,970
H-He might still be possessed.

124
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,740
What if he attacks like last time...

125
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,290
That'd be even better, then.

126
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,210
I'll get rid of him using this opportunity.

127
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,630
You still haven't learned your lesson after getting stabbed?

128
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,820
If Bom found out, she'd kill me.

129
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,950
Five minutes.

130
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,990
I just need five minutes.

131
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,180
Gosh, I feel alive. I was so thirsty.

132
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,410
You look much better than I thought.

133
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,550
Why are you...

134
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,540
Gosh, it slipped. I'm sorry.

135
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,330
You think my life is over because...

136
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,740
I tried to kill a silly lawyer?

137
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,270
Murder of Kim Seong Soo, Kang Hyeong Il, and Jo Seong Tae,

138
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,850
and Seo Ki Won.

139
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,970
Attempted murder of Seo Ki Joo and Han Bom.

140
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,310
There were a lot more.

141
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,500
Anyway, you won't get out until you die.

142
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,610
It's easy to cover up stuff like that.

143
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,750
The law is on my side.

144
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,670
- Do you really think so? 
 - Of course.

145
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,690
My father can never abandon me.

146
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,620
Okay.

147
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,900
Hang in there, then.

148
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,410
The evil spirit. Where is he?

149
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,110
You know, right?

150
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,650
I know this one thing.

151
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,780
About what happens to a person who was possessed by an evil spirit.

152
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,720
You'll keep seeing and hearing things.

153
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,150
They'll visit you every night.

154
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,810
You'll slowly wither away.

155
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,210
I wish you a speedy recovery.

156
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,900
I want you to live a very long life.

157
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,900
Geez, what's this?

158
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,930
Who are you?

159
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,970
Hey, why did you come out?

160
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,760
- Excuse me. 
 - You should've stayed in there.

161
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,350
- I can only do it for 10 minutes. 
 - Sir?

162
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,460
He didn't even password-protect it.

163
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,460
 By the way, why am I still "Safe Zone"? 

164
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,660
 What should I write instead, then? 

165
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,520
 I don't know. 

166
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,850
 Think about it carefully. 

167
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,890
 With plenty of love and affection. 

168
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:29,950
   

169
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,590
Seo Ki Joo can be pretty cute sometimes.

170
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,990
Did you pack everything?

171
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,530
Yes, we can leave.

172
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,090
Right, the Detective asked me to give this to you.

173
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,550
I saw it.

174
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,350
Saw what?

175
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
"My Bom."

176
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,640
You told me to...

177
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,010
You told me to change it. Give it to me.

178
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,800
Why? I really like this. "My Bom."

179
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
You can't look at someone else's phone. Give it to me.

180
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,990
Just once. I'll change it to something better.

181
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,370
But I like this.

182
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,000
L-Let me pass, My Mr. Seo.

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,810
What are you doing in a public space?

184
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,590
My Bom.

185
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,380
Hold on. The safe zone didn't activate just now. Right?

186
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,540
You're right.

187
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,790
What's with you? You killed me, and then you revived me.

188
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,280
How did this...

189
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,420
 Thinking about it now, nothing made much sense. 

190
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,430
 How could my uncle, who was supposed to be wandering...  
 

191
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,260
 in the netherworld, come to meet me 

192
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,460
 in a space that's already gone? 

193
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,510
 We were neither dead nor alive. 

194
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,600
 How were we able to take photos? 

195
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,880
   

196
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,130
 Unbelievable things that happened 

197
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,810
 ever since the camera came to this world from the netherworld. 

198
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:32,740
 I decided to call all of those things miracles. 

199
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,760
Yes, got it.

200
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,000
   

201
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,690
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

202
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,190
Your son was transferred to the detention center.

203
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,170
- How about Assemblywoman Kim? 
 - She can't be reached.

204
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,680
Both Assemblymen Park and Choi are also letting their secretaries answer.

205
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,730
Saying they're not feeling well.

206
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,660
Minister, the president wants to hear your answer

207
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,990
because the petitions keep being posted.

208
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,220
Kim Seong Soo's body was found in the suitcase you moved.

209
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,690
Will you keep denying the charge?

210
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,160
Where's my father?

211
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,170
I requested him many times. Is he still not here yet?

212
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,170
Do you think my father would do nothing if he found out

213
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,340
you prohibited me from contacting him?

214
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,910
Your father rejected our call. Okay?

215
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,830
I see. I guess you don't know since you've been in the detention center.

216
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,670
   

217
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:07,380
   

218
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,940
Do you really think Father didn't know anything?

219
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,150
   

220
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,560
What's this?

221
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,030
Who did all this...

222
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,500
   

223
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,160
â™«  Happy birthday to you  â™«

224
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,020
â™«  Happy birthday to you  â™«

225
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,230
â™«  Happy birthday to you, dear Mr. Seo Ki Joo  â™«

226
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,360
â™«  Happy birthday to you  â™«

227
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,710
- Happy, happy birthday! 
 - Happy, happy birthday!

228
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,790
- What's all this? 
 - Make a wish, Mr. Seo.

229
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,250
â™«  Even if my time stops and my life ends  â™«

230
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,750
â™«  I choose you, it's meant to be  â™«

231
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,300
â™«  You're the one person who loved me  â™«

232
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:09,120
â™«  Even if you change your mind after time passes  â™«

233
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,640
â™«  I'll love you even more  â™«

234
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,340
Ta-da.

235
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, right. Let's eat before it gets cold.

236
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
Come in.

237
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,970
You need to wear this because it's your birthday.

238
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,250
- How pretty. 
 - No!

239
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,650
Hold on. Sit further away from each other.

240
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,970
Oh, right. The safe zone doesn't work anymore.

241
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,470
Oh, I see.

242
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,950
You're right.

243
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,150
That's more the reason to stay closer.

244
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,670
We did grocery shopping, prepped ingredients, and decorated the room since this morning.

245
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,570
Do you know how hard we worked?

246
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,960
I was in charge of cooking.

247
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,410
Bom didn't do anything, then.

248
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,990
I didn't do anything?

249
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,970
Mr. Seo, don't you see all this stuff?

250
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,740
Every little thing that I worked hard to decorate. My gift to you.

251
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,110
I worked so hard on all this.

252
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,020
How cool.

253
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,620
Mr. Seo,

254
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,860
let's stop being so dark and depressing. Let's live brightly.

255
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,290
We'll wake up and go to bed at normal times, too.

256
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,770
- Ta-da. 
 - Whoa.

257
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,620
It's a birthday present.

258
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,090
It's a pocketknife made from a tree that lightning struck.

259
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,020
It'll be easy to carry around since it's compact.

260
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,970
Don't get stabbed by anyone from now on.

261
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,640
Lee Seon Ho suddenly lunged at me then...

262
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,720
Anyway, thank you.

263
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,610
- I sent my present via message. 
 - Huh?

264
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,290
Getting a reservation here is harder than registering for college classes.

265
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,330
I possessed five people at a PC cafe to pull it off.

266
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,610
Mr. Seo, go out to get tasty food like normal people from now on.

267
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,830
Live a long and healthy life.

268
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,690
Thank you.

269
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,600
Right, right. I forgot to give this to you.

270
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,450
- How could you forget that? 
 - Seriously.

271
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,360
Birthday punishment!

272
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,810
So cute.

273
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,950
Come on.

274
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,330
I told you not to be rude to him! I knew you'd get punished...

275
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,640
Come here, my little brother. Let me give you a peck.

276
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,120
It still feels awkward.

277
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,920
It feels bright and warm, like a normal house.

278
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,580
Let's get used to things one by one.

279
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,940
Oh, I wanted to pick a pink wallpaper, but I held back.

280
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,570
Because I thought you might faint.

281
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,140
You'd better not do that. Seriously.

282
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,790
Oh, right. Hold on.

283
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,640
Here you go.

284
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,850
It's my last present.

285
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,840
What is it?

286
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,720
Thank you.

287
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,640
By the way,

288
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,920
they say if you gift someone shoes, they run away.

289
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm giving them to you so you can run away.

290
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,150
Wear these and run far away.

291
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,710
From the studio, curse, and death.

292
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,110
Run very far away.

293
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,650
So they can't chase you again.

294
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,730
What if I actually run far away?

295
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,020
These shoes come with one condition.

296
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,930
Condition?

297
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,960
No matter how far away you go, you have to go with me.

298
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,510
Whether it's the Pitcairn Islands or somewhere further,

299
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,930
I'll go with you.

300
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,210
I no longer need to go to the Pitcairn Islands.

301
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,050
Gosh, you must be tired.

302
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,200
We must've stayed too long.

303
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,860
They said patients need to rest in body and soul.

304
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,840
Mr. Seo, I really wish you a happy birthday.

305
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,390
I'll leave now.

306
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,090
No...

307
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,890
I'm not tired at all.

308
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,350
No, no, you're tired. I'll leave.

309
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,420
Mr. Seo, what's wrong? Are you in pain?

310
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,330
The wound must've opened. Let me see.

311
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,870
What? Were you tricking me?

312
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,360
No.

313
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,490
It really hurt,

314
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,160
but I think I feel fine now.

315
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,900
â™«  Because it's so beautiful  â™«

316
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,000
Hey, Seo Ki Joo.

317
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,340
â™«  Melting just like sweet ice cream  â™«

318
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,920
â™«  My heart is beating  â™«

319
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,310
â™«  Oh, I love you  â™«

320
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,440
Resting body and soul is important.

321
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,340
â€‹â™«   Like a dream  â™«

322
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,370
â™«   Like I can do anything  â™«

323
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,660
- This is no good. 
 - Pardon?

324
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,420
Should we rest our body and soul starting now?

325
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,150
W-What do you mean... What?

326
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,980
Hold on. Hold on.

327
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,200
- I'm sorry. I'm not ready yetâ€” 
 - No, Mr. Seo.

328
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,580
- We no longer need to wait to be ready. 
 - No.

329
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,210
Seriously, you can't fool me.

330
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,390
Hold on. Hold on.

331
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,410
The seal. The seal.

332
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,620
Let me have a look.

333
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,060
The seal is getting faint.

334
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,590
The curse really must be ending.

335
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,420
While you were at the hospital after waking up,

336
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,630
no visitors came to the studio.

337
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,960
The seal is starting to fade away, too.

338
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,090
Maybe the evil spirit disappeared because you're past 35 years old now.

339
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,320
That must've been the reason the evil spirit existed.

340
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,040
I searched everywhere after it left Lee Seon Ho,

341
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,910
but I couldn't find its trace anywhere.

342
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,780
Everything that's been torturing me is disappearing.

343
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,170
Disappearing.

344
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:02,540
Yes, the safe zone didn't activate at the hospital, either.

345
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,430
Maybe that's disappearing, too, since the curse is ending.

346
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,680
Ta-da!

347
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,530
How do I look today?

348
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,780
Where did you get those clothesâ€”

349
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,280
- Did you use my cardâ€” 
 - No, no, no.

350
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,590
I-I bought it on Cucumber Market.

351
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,790
With my own money.

352
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,510
- Where are you going? 
 - I have a girlfriend. What else?

353
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,730
I'm going on a date.

354
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,000
By the way, what were you two talking about?

355
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,610
The curse seems to be ending.

356
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,370
Which means the studio is about to close, too.

357
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,630
You two should also prepare to leave this world.

358
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,030
What are you doing?

359
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,490
Mr. Seo, I'm ready.

360
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,150
You can take your time to think about it.

361
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,450
I should've left a long time ago.

362
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,040
Your decision hasn't changed since last time?

363
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,010
No. Before that,

364
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,030
I'd like you to let me see Goo Min Hyeon.

365
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,140
Did you wait long?

366
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm sorry, I had to close the shop in a hurry.

367
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,550
By the way, I didn't think you'd contact me first.

368
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,780
I wanted to give you this.

369
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,280
Na Rae...

370
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,290
It won't be as good as the seaweed soup you made me,

371
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,740
but I'm sure it's pretty good.

372
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,590
I'm a pretty good cook.

373
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,910
It's not even my birthday.

374
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,240
Thank you. I'll finish every last drop of it.

375
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,900
It's a goodbye present.

376
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,890
I don't think I could see you off.

377
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,340
Thanks to your affection,

378
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,790
I've felt your warmth.

379
00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sorry this is all I can give you.

380
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,630
It's okay to take your time to give me the answer.

381
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,150
My answer will always be the same.

382
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,680
We should really part ways now.

383
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,650
   

384
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,550
   

385
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,820
You've got something there. Goodness gracious!

386
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,020
Do I...

387
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,880
really have to leave?

388
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,680
 I'm sorry, Seong Ho. Chief Kim is making me work overtime. 

389
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,340
 I won't be able to meet you tonight. 

390
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,110
Chief Kim, that son of a bitch.

391
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,830
Your internship is ending soon. Right?

392
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,260
You got the perfect score on the HR review.

393
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,860
I'm sure you'll get hired full-time if you wrap this up well.

394
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,000
Fighting!

395
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,110
Of course. I'll work hard.

396
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,320
Great.

397
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,180
I like how you work hard on everything, Ji Won.

398
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,110
I'll leave you to it, then.

399
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,390
- Well, Deputy. 
 - Yes.

400
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,050
Do you have a photo of the late Go Seong Ho, by the way?

401
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,320
You said you joined the company the same year.

402
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,790
I'm not sure if I have a photo of someone who died three years ago.

403
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,800
But what about Mr. Go?

404
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,710
Just because.

405
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,690
I wanted to see...

406
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,610
how handsome he was.

407
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,590
See you.

408
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,350
Here's food delivery.

409
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,720
Huh? What are you doing here?

410
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,220
I had to come because you were busy.

411
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,890
By the way, it's been almost 10 minutes. I need to goâ€”

412
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,940
Hold on. Where are you going?

413
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,220
Send the delivery guy away and eat with me.

414
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,940
I don't want to eat alone.

415
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,360
But, Iâ€”

416
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,210
It's okay.

417
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,050
It's okay if I can't see you.

418
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,060
You just need to be by my side.

419
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,960
Because that's the real you.

420
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,620
 You two should also prepare to leave this world. 

421
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,340
I'll let him go quickly and be right back. Wait.

422
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,770
Welcome.

423
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,170
Welcomeâ€”

424
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,440
You've been here before, haven't you?

425
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,770
You know Mr. Baek Nam Goo. Right?

426
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,300
Baek Nam Goo?

427
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,260
Ms. Jin Na Rae's husband.

428
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,170
The late Mr. Baek wants to tell you something before he leaves.

429
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,150
What kind of ridiculous thing is that to say?

430
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,770
A ghost?

431
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,880
Whether you believe me or not...

432
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,350
is up to you.

433
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,900
It's because there's no one else...

434
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,110
who could care for Na Rae.

435
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,060
Whether you believe me or not is up to you.

436
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:37,230
It's because there's no one else who could care for Na Rae.

437
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,150
Although I was a bad husband,

438
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,100
she'll need some time to move on.

439
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,520
So, although it might be difficult,

440
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,120
give her time and wait.

441
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,500
Although I was a bad husband, she'll need some time to move on.

442
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,440
So, although it might be difficult, give her time and wait.

443
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,710
I'm not sure what you're talking about nowâ€”

444
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,740
Let her go on a trip once a year, at least.

445
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,760
She likes to travel.

446
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,190
She likes watching movies.

447
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,930
Watch a lot of them with her, too.

448
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,930
She doesn't like eating alone.

449
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,380
So eat with her, too.

450
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,060
- Excuse me. 
 - Don't gift her flowers too often.

451
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,850
She actually doesn't like flowers.

452
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,130
Sir, please leave now.

453
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,030
Whenever she needed me,

454
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,650
I was never by her side.

455
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,040
I hope you don't make the same mistake.

456
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,610
And...

457
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,440
make her smile a lot.

458
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,070
Gosh, what's the deal?

459
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,810
I thought you'd have a fistfight or something.

460
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,380
You should've been a man and punched him.

461
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,130
A police officer doesn't assault citizens.

462
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,650
Okay.

463
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,580
By the way, you really don't need to see her before you go?

464
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,100
You couldn't leave because you wanted to see her.

465
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,460
I don't want Na Rae to be in more pain.

466
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,150
That's also the reason I stayed.

467
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,370
I'll see Lee Seon Ho being punished

468
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,720
and be on my way.

469
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,840
Lee, a police officer who got arrested for murder

470
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,210
criticized his father, Lee Hyeon Oh,

471
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,640
the Minister of Justice, for concealing the evidence of his crime.

472
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,230
As Minister Lee strongly denies the claim and

473
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,830
Officer Lee continues to proclaim his guilt

474
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,660
 the prosecution has summoned witnesses 

475
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,380
 including Officer Lee for a cross interrogation. 

476
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,020
We'll start the cross-interrogation.

477
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,080
Suspect, is it true that you've been concealing the evidence of

478
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,030
Lee Seon Ho's murders of Kang Hyeong Il and Jo Seong Tae using your authority?

479
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,590
No.

480
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,940
I didn't know my son committed murders, either.

481
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:51,060
Yes, that's correct.

482
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,980
The suspect, a chief prosecutor at the time,

483
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,350
hid the fact that there is a back door at the vacation home in the initial investigation

484
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,360
and he pressured me, a prosecutor at the time,

485
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,950
to close the case quickly.

486
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,330
All the evidence was pointing at Kim Yoon Cheol then.

487
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,250
How about the Jangjin Tunnel case in 2003?

488
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,060
I killed three people by mistake that day.

489
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,890
There were two accidents in total.

490
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,220
Seo Ki Won, who tried to save me...

491
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,250
was killed outside the tunnel.

492
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,580
You were the one who covered everything up, Father.

493
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,800
Look up the case.

494
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,430
You'll see that Kang Hyeong Il went to prison in my place.

495
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:43,990
You don't believe a high school student took care of everything. Right?

496
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,510
You bastard.

497
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,450
I worked so hard to come this far.

498
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,560
You bastard! How dare you...

499
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,820
How dare you? How dare you?

500
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,570
- Mr. Lee Hyeon Oh! 
 - You bastard.

501
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,900
What are you doing right now?

502
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,710
- Let go! 
 - Sit down!

503
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,370
You cheeky bastard.

504
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,840
What year did you graduate from the institute? Huh?

505
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,020
You're neither the minister nor my senior.

506
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,160
You're being investigated as a suspect now.

507
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,330
What are you doing right now?

508
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,190
Sit down.

509
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,560
Sit down!

510
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:34,780
Father, you should've done a better job of cleaning up.

511
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,410
Do you think you won?

512
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,420
Nothing can prove that I did that.

513
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,060
The public will start losing interest, too.

514
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,390
I'll be cleared of charges due to lack of evidence soon.

515
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,600
You killed someone.

516
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,890
Because you didn't want to lose what you had.

517
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,640
Lee Seon Ho thought that was possible because you kept covering things up for him.

518
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,870
So?

519
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,770
I've been living with the guilt that I killed my parents my whole life.

520
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,850
And the family of the man you killed that day

521
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,760
has been waiting for 20 years

522
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,390
without even knowing he was dead or alive.

523
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,230
But that's not how you use the law.

524
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,380
You can't get out of this so easily.

525
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,130
   

526
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,590
   

527
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,940
   

528
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,940
"Attorney Han Bom is in the center of attention again."

529
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,260
   

530
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Wow! How does it feel to be famous?

531
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,790
Pardon?

532
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,070
Please sign the back of my phone. I'll keep it forever.

533
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,270
Come on, don't make fun of me.

534
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,020
Stop looking at this.

535
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,350
What's the point of all this?

536
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,590
Although Lee Seon Ho is blaming Lee Hyeon Oh,

537
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,950
Lee Hyeon Oh will only be punished for abuse of power and concealing evidence.

538
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,040
He'll serve five years at most.

539
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,130
But if he keeps denying and covering things up using his authority,

540
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,930
he might get a suspended sentence.

541
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,430
Lee Hyeon Oh won't get out of it this time.

542
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,350
I took care of it.

543
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,940
You did?

544
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,950
Just wait and see.

545
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,550
What's with this confidence?

546
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,960
By the way, how does it feel not to be under the curse anymore?

547
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,410
Mr. Baek says he's leaving.

548
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,090
Deputy Go will leave soon, too.

549
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,100
And the studio will close soon, too.

550
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,130
They're leaving because they have to.

551
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,590
But I feel conflicted about it.

552
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:57,760
Have you thought about what to do after they both leave?

553
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,670
I'm thinking about it.

554
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,220
I have more experience as an unemployed person than you.

555
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,620
Should I give you some tips?

556
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,070
You should finally sleep in,

557
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,800
try cooking,

558
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,190
and go to movie theaters to see movies, too.

559
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,820
Go hiking on the weekends, too.

560
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh? Hiking sounds great.

561
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,060
Let's go to Mt. Gwanak first.

562
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,070
What else should we do?

563
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,360
There's something I want to do right now.

564
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,070
What's this? You said you wanted to sleep together.

565
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,860
But I'm lying on your arm.

566
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,400
Well, you must've imagined something else.

567
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,960
Yes.

568
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,950
Well, I mean...

569
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,290
There's nothing wrong with imagining.

570
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,580
I'm free to imagine.

571
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,320
You couldn't sleep at the hospital.

572
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,620
I really wanted to feel your warmth, then.

573
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,750
â™«  The smiley face  â™«

574
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,800
â™«  And the tears behind it  â™«

575
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,000
â™«  It perhaps resembles mine  â™«

576
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,210
â™«  It hurts a bit because I can't erase it  â™«

577
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,990
â™«  I've been hurting all this time  â™«

578
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:58,580
â™«  Because I couldn't do what I wanted to do for you  â™«

579
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:04,950
â™«  Because I felt bad for my feelings for you  â™«

580
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:14,880
â™«  I think of you being with me every waking moment  â™«

581
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,780
â™«  One more time  â™«

582
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,980
It's been over two weeks since the Lee Hyeon Oh scandal began.

583
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,600
Both parties are demanding Minister Lee to be removed.

584
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,180
But since he's denying all charges without wavering,

585
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,530
it was unclear if he'd be arrested and investigated.

586
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,260
 Last night, a day before the warrant evaluation, 

587
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,920
 an audio file of the former Inspector Han and Minister Lee 

588
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,890
 admitting to the crime was released, and the case entered a new chapter. 

589
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,570
What's the reason you aren't stepping down?

590
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,780
- Please say something! 
 - Is the recording true?

591
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,900
Did you make Inspector Han cover up the murder of Kim Yoon Cheol?

592
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,210
Do you still insist on your innocence on all the charges?

593
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,920
Please say something!

594
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,040
- Where's Secretary Kim? 
 - Secretary Kim!

595
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,790
- Minister Lee Hyeon Oh! 
 - Say something!

596
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,830
- Please just a comment! 
 - Minister Lee!

597
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,670
Minister Lee!

598
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,130
 The truths you thought you buried. 

599
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:19,080
 They will eventually come out in the open. 

600
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,870
 Because I, Yoon Cheol, and the people who are helping him 

601
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:26,350
 will make that happen. 

602
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,370
It was you.

603
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,140
The one who released the audio.

604
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,460
â™«   I'm serious  â™«

605
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,410
 You think you would've had a chance 

606
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,410
 at a major law firm like Kang &amp; Goo if it wasn't for me? 

607
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,980
   

608
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,290
â™«  I, at least, will always be with you  â™«

609
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,560
   

610
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,010
â™«  It's okay even if it's the middle of the night  â™«

611
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,570
- Minister! Minister! 
 - Minister!

612
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,480
â™«  Don't worry  â™«

613
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,480
- Stop him! 
 - Block the path!

614
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,390
â™«  Look at me now  â™«

615
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,540
â™«  In this rough world, I'm with you  â™«

616
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,670
â™«  I won't run away anymore  â™«

617
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,430
â™«  I'm here for you no matter what happens  â™«

618
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,780
â™«  I'll protect you like it's nothing  â™«

619
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,790
â™«  Count on me, baby  â™«

620
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,310
â™«  Don't worry anymore, I'll be by your side  â™«

621
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,010
â™«  Count on me, baby  â™«

622
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,750
â™«  There's nothing to fear anymore  â™«

623
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,190
â™«  Gon' be all right  â™«

624
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,520
 Cheers! 

625
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,610
 - Good work.  
 - Bottoms up.

626
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,290
No one else drank the whole thing?

627
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,880
You told me to leave it to you. You were serious.

628
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,110
There was only circumstantial evidence then.

629
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,630
Even if the audio was released, it would've been buried.

630
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,270
But not anymore since Lee Hyeon Oh confessed.

631
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,040
Even if it doesn't hold legal power,

632
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,080
Lee Hyeon Oh can't keep his minister position because of public opinion.

633
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,880
It was another successful cooperation investigation, then.

634
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,190
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers.

635
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,380
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

636
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,610
Well...

637
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,190
the seal is almost gone now.

638
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,390
You two really need to leave now.

639
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,330
Pick a date and let me know.

640
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,770
We've grown so close together already.

641
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:34,560
But it'd be good for you two to leave. Right?

642
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,460
The living stay in this world

643
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,500
and the dead need to go to the netherworld.

644
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,130
That's right.

645
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,020
When will you leave, Mr. Baek?

646
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,920
It'll be difficult to connect Lee Seon Ho to the Jangjin Tunnel case, though.

647
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,440
It's a bit of a disappointing ending.

648
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,030
The rest of us will finish up the rest.

649
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,200
The law is weak.

650
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,640
What's this?

651
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,020
Shit! Hey!

652
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,410
 I know this one thing. 

653
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,090
 About what happens to a person who was possessed by an evil spirit. 

654
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,220
 You'll keep seeing and hearing things. 

655
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,250
 They'll visit you every night. 

656
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,510
 You'll slowly wither away. 

657
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,620
Seriously! Hey!

658
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,670
Go crazy quietly if you have to!

659
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,630
Hey! Hey!

660
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,440
You cop bastard! Beat him up!

661
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,010
Well, hold on. Hold on.

662
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,470
W-Well, excuse me...

663
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,150
Excuse me, I'm a cop. A cop...

664
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,400
Get out of the way.

665
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,040
What are you saying, bastard?

666
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,180
Ouch, it hurts!

667
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,990
Stomp on him.

668
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,040
No! No!

669
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,730
 Please stop! 

670
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,590
Mr. Seo, how's the unemployed life?

671
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,100
What do you mean, unemployed?

672
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,900
I cook, clean, cook, and do the dishes.

673
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,350
Do you know what it's like to be a homemaker? It's a lot of work.

674
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:31,850
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

675
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,790
By the way, what's that camera? Is it new?

676
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,950
There's something I want to try.

677
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,770
What is it?

678
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,670
I'm thinking of starting a real photo studio.

679
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,400
A real photo studio?

680
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,020
The old one was just a cover, you know.

681
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,330
I want to try to actually photograph people now.

682
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,730
I can be your model, then.

683
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,180
Here. Photograph me.

684
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,900
Is that okay?

685
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,670
Of course. Go ahead.

686
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,010
Make me look pretty.

687
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,430
Let's just keep it natural.

688
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,900
â™«  A mild breeze  â™«

689
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,770
 We shared everyday life. 

690
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,300
â™«  Our hands are touching each other  â™«

691
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,770
â™«  A small bird is whispering  â™«

692
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,890
 We fought about trivial things and... 

693
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,820
â™«  Your warm eyes  â™«

694
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,180
â™«  Your touch is like a constellation  â™«

695
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,100
One, two, three.

696
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,140
Don't embarrass me like that.

697
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,300
What's so embarrassing? We're a couple.

698
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,000
Just once more, please. I'm sorry.

699
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,800
One, two, three.

700
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,150
â™«  The beautiful moment I'm sharing with you  â™«

701
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,750
Mr. Seo, look at this. It's so cute.

702
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,690
Mr. Seo,

703
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,120
which is the prettiest out of these three?

704
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,970
The answer is the one in the middle.

705
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:10,350
- That's correct. 
  - We'll eventually die, 

706
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,800
 but as if we'll live forever... 

707
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,450
â™«  Let's dream  â™«

708
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,920
See you tomorrow.

709
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,830
See you tomorrow, Mr. Seo.

710
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,260
 ...we promised each other our future. 

711
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,140
I don't want to say goodbye.

712
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:34,310
â™«  Forget all the painful memories from yesterday  â™«

713
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:37,070
Good night.

714
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,330
Good night, Mr. Seo.

715
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,770
â™«  Bye-bye, lonely days, hold my hand  â™«

716
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:55,260
â™«  Let's dance under the moonlight  â™«

717
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,560
â™«  In the rain without anyone knowing  â™«

718
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,760
I thought you wanted to see me tomorrow.

719
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,590
I missed you already. What was I supposed to do?

720
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,820
W-What's this?

721
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,580
Open it.

722
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,260
N-No, I don't need stuff like this.

723
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,480
Give it to me, then.

724
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,820
Okay, okay.

725
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,140
It's not my style, but it's not bad.

726
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,020
I thought it'd suit your new clothes.

727
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,390
I should burn it and wear it for tomorrow's date.

728
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,300
Do everything you want to do.

729
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,280
Don't regret it later.

730
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,180
Finish your bucket list, too.

731
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,250
Your time belongs to you.

732
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,910
Thank you.

733
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,670
I've been thinking about it.

734
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,060
If there's such a thing as an afterlife,

735
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:56,900
wouldn't it be fun to be born as brothers with Mr. Seo and me?

736
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,710
Gosh, I don't like it.

737
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,250
You don't like it? Why?

738
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,890
Because you'd bully me.

739
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,520
Make me the eldest brother, then.

740
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,230
Okay, Hyung.

741
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,620
Okay, Nam Goo.

742
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,320
"Nam Goo"?

743
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,980
Okay.

744
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,790
Enjoy the date.

745
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,880
Thank you.

746
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,270
Mr. Baek.

747
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,940
Have a seat.

748
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,720
Deputy Go has a date tomorrow. Right?

749
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,660
Yes. They're having dinner. He said he'd be late.

750
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,660
And Attorney Han has a trial tomorrow?

751
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,430
Yes.

752
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,370
By the way, why do you ask...

753
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,040
By chance...

754
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,390
Let's do it tomorrow night, then.

755
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,150
I want to leave quietly with just you.

756
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,070
But...

757
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,600
I didn't want them to see me like this.

758
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,890
You told me...

759
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,060
that you become an evil spirit if you resent this world too much.

760
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:34,460
I tried to figure out why I was so angry at Goo Min Hyeon.

761
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,610
But I wasn't angry at him.

762
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,870
I was just angry at myself.

763
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,600
Why didn't I have any clue when I was alive?

764
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,600
I promised to cherish her,

765
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,770
but why did I leave her so lonely for so long?

766
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,950
How much did Na Rae cry

767
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,770
while I was catching all those culprits?

768
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,120
The more I think about it, the angrier I get with myself.

769
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,020
I can't take it anymore.

770
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,830
So, before I get angrier and become an evil spirit,

771
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,710
I want to leave quickly.

772
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,410
I beg you.

773
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,260
All right.

774
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,420
And this.

775
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,720
Make sure to give it to Na Rae after I leave.

776
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:37,130
   

777
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:41,360
   

778
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,840
Okay, got it.

779
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,060
Don't try to tell Na Rae behind my back.

780
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,800
Okay?

781
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,690
I've known you long enough.

782
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,600
You were always cold to the visitors,

783
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,660
but your heart toward them was never cold.

784
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,150
You never disregarded a single ghost.

785
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,580
By the way, Mr. Seo,

786
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,780
please just overlook things this time.

787
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,590
That's the right thing to do.

788
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,800
It's a lonely...

789
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,940
and treacherous path.

790
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,180
I don't want to send you alone. That's why.

791
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,290
Why would I be alone?

792
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,560
You're with me.

793
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,600
Take a nice one. Okay?

794
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,220
It really isn't visible anymore.

795
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,950
There haven't been visitors. Right?

796
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,860
Will you be back very late tonight?

797
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:01,730
Yes. I'm getting a lot of cases thanks to Lee Hyeon Oh.

798
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,490
Being labeled as an attorney of justice...

799
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:06,700
It really makes me feel uncomfortable.

800
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,850
Why do you ask?

801
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,780
Just because. I wanted to see you sooner.

802
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,980
What? You're acting strange today.

803
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,020
Hold on.

804
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,290
I need to go.

805
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:29,420
I'll leave for now. Let's talk later.

806
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,390
   

807
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,370
   

808
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,020
Open it.

809
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,640
   

810
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,400
Where did you get this...

811
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,780
You should look good when you leave.

812
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,280
â™«  I've nothing to lose  â™«

813
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,780
â™«  Every day was the same  â™«

814
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,390
â™«  Running in circles  â™«

815
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,620
â™«  For all the useless games  â™«

816
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:01,230
â™«  Sometimes there's no meaning  â™«

817
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,340
â™«  Life goes away it came  â™«

818
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,240
â™«  Always caught in the middle  â™«

819
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,960
â™«  There's no fun to plan  â™«

820
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,280
â™«  How about superstition?  â™«

821
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:30,970
â™«  Try cling inside your soul  â™«

822
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:36,170
â™«  But only then I can dream about what's missing  â™«

823
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:39,100
â™«  What's missing, what's missing  â™«

824
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,570
Deputy Go said he'd be late.

825
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:49,610
You can at least say a last goodbye to them.

826
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,890
I don't think I'd want to leave, then.

827
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,680
Take one quickly before I change my mind.

828
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,810
If so,

829
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:00,670
I'll take it.

830
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:05,990
â™«  You see, I'll just love away  â™«

831
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:08,190
Mr. Seo.

832
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:10,250
Yes.

833
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,360
Thank you for everything.

834
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,990
Me, too.

835
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,280
I'll take it now.

836
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,800
One,

837
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,860
two,

838
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,560
three.

839
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,640
What's going on?

840
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,720
What's wrong?

841
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,850
The camera...

842
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,980
isn't working.

843
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:21,660
Why did you come back here?

844
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,600
Na Rae,

845
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,050
I know this sounds weird,

846
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:31,630
but you thought your husband was still here. Right?

847
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:36,940
Did something happen?

848
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:45,430
I think I met your husband, Na Rae.

849
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,360
The camera is mine now.

850
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,060
You can't do anything with that.

851
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:48,350
You don't know how I died.

852
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,930
I'm your opponent.

853
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,500
This is no good.

854
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,540
I have no choice but to send him there.

855
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,620
The camera.

856
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,910
The camera!

857
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:28,050
The camera!

858
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,240
Mr. Baek.

859
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,780
This really is the end.

860
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,560
Mr. Baek...

861
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,370
Mr. Baek!

862
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,670
Mr. Baek!

863
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,380
Mr. Baek.

864
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,300
Mr. Baek.

865
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,810
Mr. Baek!

866
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,850
Mr. Seo.

867
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,640
You know how I died. Right?

868
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,420
I...

869
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,460
will stall the evil spirit.

870
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,410
Use this knife...

871
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,080
to kill me.

872
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:54,120
I-I-I can't do it.

873
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,260
Will you kill other people, too?

874
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,790
You'll be destroyed, then!

875
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:00,930
You can't go to the netherworld...

876
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,250
and you'll disappear forever. You know that!

877
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,730
I can't last any longer.

878
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,820
Seo Ki Joo!

879
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,990
Hurry up!

880
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,180
Mr. Baek.

881
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,610
Mr. Baek!

882
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,590
Why did you do that? Why?

883
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,530
Good work,

884
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:56,350
Ki Joo.

885
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,110
Good work.

886
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,910
No... No...

887
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:07,300
This is not right! This is not right!

888
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,980
This is not right!

889
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,590
â™«  I still wonder why  â™«

890
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,830
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

891
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:22,500
â™«  Your traces won't disappear  â™«

892
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,830
â™«  I still don't know why  â™«

893
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,810
â™«  Tell me why  â™«

894
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:36,180
â™«  I think I'll collapse without you  â™«

895
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,570
   

896
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,720
Why isn't he answering?

897
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,260
I want to have dinner with him.

898
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,950
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Midnight Ghost ðŸ‘» Team @ Viki.com 

899
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,310
Why...

900
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,530
Why is this...

901
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,650
 Why did I forget... 

902
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,440
 that someone else cursed me? 

903
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,110
â™«  How much did I erase you?  â™«

904
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,340
â™«  Would it have lasted still?  â™«

905
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:51,300
â™«  You still visit me during my empty nights  â™«

906
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:58,030
â™«  You left me by only leaving faint traces  â™«

907
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:01,260
   

908
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,000
 I may not be able to go back because the studio's door is closed. 

909
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,020
 The one you tried to save desperately will pay their price now. 

910
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,760
 There's no way! 

911
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,620
 Am I going to die now? 

912
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,880
 What's scarier than the path to the netherworld is... 

913
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,180
 living in the world without you alone. 

914
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,350
 I'll come back for sure.
