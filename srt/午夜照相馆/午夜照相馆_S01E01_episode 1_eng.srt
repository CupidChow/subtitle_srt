1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,900
♫  I still wonder why   ♫

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,350
♫  Tell me why  ♫

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,360
♫  Why do I not want to let go of your memories?  ♫

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,640
   

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,470
   

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,600
   

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,960
   

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,770
♫  You hear me, I will call your name today too  ♫

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,140
   

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,950
   

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,760


12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,300
 There is a saying that goes like this, 

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,000
 "A tiger leaves its fur after death... 

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,570
   

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,990
 ...and humans leave photographs as evidence of their life." 

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,830
Welcome.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,070
 Out of the countless memories in life, there's one we can't photograph. 

18
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,250
I'll take the photo now.

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,010
One, two, three.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,580
 It's the memory of the last breath. 

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,600
 There was a studio that took photos of your last memories, the ones you couldn't take while you were alive. 

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,600
 Somewhere between life and death. 

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,430
 Somewhere on the treacherous and arduous path to death. 

24
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,180
 It's only allowed to the ones who want it desperately. 

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,250
My baby.

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,790
 You can't go back once you get lost on the way to death. 

27
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,420
 You have to walk in the skin-cutting snowstorm... 

28
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,430
 across the valley where the ground splits and fills up with molten lava, 

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,210
 and go through an endless maze to finally reach this place. 

30
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,690
 A photo studio only for the dead. 

31
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,380
 People called this place, "A photo studio that opens at night." 

32
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,960
 But the camera there could not only photograph the dead, 

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,090
 but also had the miraculous power to bring them back to life. 

34
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,820
 Therefore, it always attracted intruders. 

35
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,710
 Although it couldn't have been easy, 

36
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,250
 and rare may it be, but at times some fool shows up, 

37
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,790
 not knowing how scary the Grim Reaper, the guardian of the camera, is. 

38
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,780
 He was a desperate soul, 

39
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,920
  who risked their life in the netherworld where only the dead are allowed, 

40
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,060
 and stole the reaper's belongings. 

41
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,370
His Excellency is back.

42
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,150
Sir...

43
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,970
Father.

44
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,820
Yes.

45
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,550
Kyeong!

46
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,380
Hold this tightly.

47
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,300
I went all the way to the netherworld and stole it.

48
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,710
 How dare you steal from the netherworld? How foolish. 

49
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,860
I deserve to die.

50
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,160
But I need this camera to save this child.

51
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I do not care if I die.

52
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
Please let my child live.

53
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,540
Allow him to live until he reaches my age, 35.

54
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,610
I beg you.

55
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,900
In that case, his son, and all descendants that follow

56
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,970
will all end up with the same fate.

57
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,440
The dead will chase them during their very short lives.

58
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,830
Do you still want that?

59
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,820
Yes, just let him live. Let him live.

60
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,010
Kyeong.

61
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,460
 He probably didn't know that... 

62
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,640
 his desperate desire to save his son 

63
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,810
 would create a curse that would last hundreds of years for generations. 

64
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,520
Kyeong.

65
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,390
Yes.

66
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes, my child.

67
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,440
   

68
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,160
This is from Joshua 1:9.

69
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,890
"Have I not commanded you?

70
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,670
Be strong and courageous.

71
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,990
Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged,

72
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,310
for the Lord your God...

73
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,390
will be with you wherever you go."

74
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,150
He said that to Joshua.

75
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,210
My brother Moses died—

76
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,090
 And I didn't know either, 

77
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,390
 that one of his cursed descendants who will live 

78
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,180
 a very short life being chased by the dead because 

79
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,270
 I'll tell the descendant of Israel... 
   

80
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,810
 the camera couldn't be returned to the netherworld would be me. 

81
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,400
 Go and offer... 

82
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,190
I saw you open your eyes slightly. Stop pretending to be asleep.

83
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,100
I'm sleeping.

84
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,510
This place is known to be sacred.

85
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,830
Do you know how much I waited to sleep in this chapel?

86
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,530
Get up right now. Our visitor from the other world is waiting.

87
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,130
You're not allowed to work more than 52 hours a week in Korea.

88
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,930
I have the right to enjoy a legal holiday, at least.

89
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,670
- "Be careful to obey all the law... 
 - Tell the visitor to wait a bit.

90
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,940
They shall keep that in mind and obey.

91
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,500
Do not turn from it to the right or to the left,

92
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,910
that you may be successful wherever you go."

93
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,050
This tells us we're under God's protection.

94
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,530
You're not an employee. You're a business owner.

95
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,330
You have to respond to the client whenever they need you.

96
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,930
Let's go.

97
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,650
H-Hold on! This is my rare chance to sleep soundly.

98
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,660
Give me three hours. No, two hours.

99
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,880
One hour! Please, I beg you!

100
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,280
Be strong and courageous.

101
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,350
 Be strong and courageous. 

102
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,960
Be strong and courageous!

103
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,020
 Be strong and courageous. 

104
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,030
Mr. Seo, you look like a totally different person.

105
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,760
Hey, is this right? Are you sure?

106
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,080
Okay, okay. There's no time. Let's hurry.

107
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,230
Here comes the groom.

108
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,530
- Hold on. I need to use the restroom. 
 - You can't do that now.

109
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,870
M-Mr. Seo, the visitor has been here for three days now.

110
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,750
- I know, too. 
 - This is the last wish of a ghost,

111
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,970
who died at age 32 without ever holding a man's hand.

112
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,140
Just put up with it for three seconds. Three seconds.

113
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,380
You know things will get bad if today passes by.

114
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,830
- Three seconds. 
 -Three seconds. Okay.

115
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,430
Here comes the groom.

116
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,350
Hey, I can't do it.

117
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,270
Kissing her would be...

118
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,240
worse than kissing you!

119
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,020
C-Calm down. Please calm down.

120
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,350
Ms. V-Visitor...

121
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,580
L-Let's have a conversation...

122
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
Wh-What are you doing?

123
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,300
H-Hold on. Hold on, hold on!

124
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,620
Are you okay?

125
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,060
Seo Ki Joo, I'll destroy you!

126
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,880
I told you to hold it in for three seconds!

127
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,580
You try it! You!

128
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,770
Why do you keep blaming me? I said it for you! Seriously...

129
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,420
8:00 in the morning, I said. 
    

130
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,270
8:00, during rush hour. It's Line No. 2, the busiest subway line.

131
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,700
You get the picture, right? 
    

132
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,820
There's no room to set your foot on that train.

133
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,290
There's no room to even breathe.

134
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,640
I know. I know about the hellish Line No. 2.

135
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,420
In that situation, my hand slightly...

136
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,320
fell like this for a hot second.

137
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,570
But she says I touched her butt?

138
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,810
I'm so shocked that I'm speechless.

139
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,980
I know. You must find this so unfair.

140
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,620
Of course, it's so unfair.

141
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,510
You must be tired of commuting from Paju to Seoul every day already.

142
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,000
But you were falsely accused, too.

143
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,620
By the way, do you know who owns the supercar that's parked outside?

144
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, it fits your clean image perfectly.

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,730
Bam! So I thought it was yours.

146
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,790
Whoa, it's so pretty.

147
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,960
It is mine.

148
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,580
- Really? 
 - There are only five in the country.

149
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,300
Gosh, I can't ride the subway for longer than 10 minutes because I'm squeamish.

150
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,390
It's smelly and dirty.

151
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,160
So would I be able to countersue?

152
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,820
Unfortunately, anything can be sexual harassment if the victim feels humiliated.

153
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,460
What am I supposed to do then?

154
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,610
I know. What do we do?

155
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,550
You're so squeamish, but instead of taking that pretty supercar,

156
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,090
you took the dirty and smelly subway.

157
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,530
I wonder if the judge would understand why.

158
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,620
I don't get it, either.

159
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,360
I came here to tell you to figure that out.

160
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,610
You touched her. It wasn't a mistake.

161
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,850
There must be many witnesses, and someone must've filmed it, too.

162
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,940
Do you want me to look for them seriously?

163
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,850
Wh-What's with you?

164
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,480
I thought you were a lawyer.

165
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,890
Attorney Kang Soo Mi.

166
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,170
Here. Yes, I touched her. I did.

167
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,930
Shouldn't you still defend me?

168
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,760
How dare you think you can interrogate me? Huh?

169
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,810
When did I say I'm Attorney Kang Soo Mi?

170
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,870
You came in and told me to sit down, so I did.

171
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,910
You started complaining as soon as you got here, and I...

172
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,010
Like this...

173
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,950
I got your confession unexpectedly.

174
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,970
- You little... 
 - Okay, let's go to the police station.

175
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,600
Wow, I've never been in a supercar before.

176
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,760
Do you mind if I drive?

177
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey! Who are you?

178
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,920
Me?

179
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm a part-timer.

180
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,290
   

181
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,410
Someone parked a foreign car in front of the building—

182
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,520
Oh, there she is.

183
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,610
She's Attorney Kang Soo Mi.

184
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,710
What is this, a corner store?

185
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,960
Do you run a business with a part-timer?

186
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,250
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,480
Hey, Attorney Han!

188
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,440
How dare you interrogate my client?

189
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,940
Do you still think you're a prosecutor?

190
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,710
Seriously.

191
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,760
Calm down. Have a seat first.

192
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,440
Let's be more selective with clients.

193
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,810
A molester? How embarrassing is that?

194
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,180
You're not hungry enough yet, are you?

195
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,550
Since you caused trouble three years ago and lost Chief Lee Hyeon Oh's trust,

196
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,350
you can't even get a proper case.

197
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,760
Who's Lee Hyeon Oh again?

198
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,810
Oh, Chief Prosecutor Lee Hyeon Oh?

199
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,930
Go beg him instead of being stubborn.

200
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,060
You'll end up jobless at this rate.

201
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,650
Senior, I have an interview tomorrow with Kang &amp; Goo, who owns one of the top law firms.

202
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,340
The interview is just a formality. It's already been decided.

203
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,890
I just need to go and say hello like this.

204
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,210
You used to be a top student in law school, look at you being happy that you managed to get just a measly job.

205
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,470
Don't worry. I'll live a longer and happier life than him.

206
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,400
Because I'm young and...

207
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,220
pretty, you know.

208
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm off.

209
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,620
 You won't get a single case once you leave the Prosecutors' Office. 

210
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,520
 You'll keep insisting you're right, huh? 

211
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,690
It's cold.

212
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,150
Put your arm up.

213
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,440
Your temperature went down, thankfully.

214
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
Why did you have to do that?

215
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,110
She said she'd take the last photo and leave this world after a kiss.

216
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,960
You know what happens when you deny the visitor's wish.

217
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,630
Shit. I said I wanted to stay at the chapel.

218
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,870
You're in danger these days already.

219
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,090
You might die if you get possessed by an evil spirit.

220
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,390
And you're not supposed to provoke a virgin ghost with resentment.

221
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,380
I see.

222
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,570
I suppose a bachelor ghost knows how she feels.

223
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,590
Even elementary schoolers date these days. How is it that you've never dated?

224
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,320
Why didn't you follow that visitor earlier?

225
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,830
What? Wh-What do you mean?

226
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,160
I-I might not look like it, but I had my first love.

227
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,150
You know I haven't left this world for three years because I'm looking for her.

228
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,800
Whatever.

229
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,090
Get me a new wet towel.

230
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,720
Don't you think the ghosts are getting aggressive

231
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,180
b-because of that camera?

232
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,300
You almost died a few days ago, too.

233
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,100
How many times did that happen this month?

234
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,470
- Mr. Seo. 
 - What?

235
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,080
I smell something funny.

236
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,270
What smell?

237
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,540
Mr. Seo, the s-studio is burning.

238
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,570
What?

239
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,620
Hey, run away! Hurry!

240
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,940
Hurry! Hurry!

241
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,330
Who set fire in front of my house?

242
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,600
Hot!

243
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,530
Hurry! Hurry! Over here.

244
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,610
   

245
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,080
Let's stop now, Honey.

246
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,530
Are we getting kicked out again?

247
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,930
I'll destroy her. That woman.

248
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,170
We'd be in trouble if the landlord found out.

249
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,780
- S-She's here. 
 - Oh, my gosh!

250
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,710
What happened? Gosh.

251
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,200
Why would the lawn suddenly start burning at this hour of the morning?

252
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,770
I heard you run a photo studio. What were you doing in there?

253
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,150
Move out immediately. Pack your things right now.

254
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,370
W-Well, what about the security deposit...

255
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,390
Gosh. Security deposit, my foot.

256
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,410
Do you know how much this tree cost?

257
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,230
Move out immediately. Evacuate right now!

258
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,190
You looked like a normal person. What will you do about this?

259
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,610
What will you do with this yard?

260
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,750
We need to get the security deposit back.

261
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,540
Hey, Attorney Han.

262
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,110
I know you're in there. Come out right now.

263
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,620
Hey! Attorney Han!

264
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,240
Whether you're in there or not, I'll say what I have to say.

265
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,150
You haven't paid the rent for too long.
    

266
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,400
There's no more security deposit for me to deduct from.

267
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,510
I put the apartment on the market.

268
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,720
I warned you. You're moving out.

269
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,340
I said everything I needed to say. Okay?

270
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:26,430
   

271
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,050
   

272
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,100
You can't do this to me, Mrs. So.

273
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,620
Who would tolerate this place up on the hill but me?

274
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,220
I'll pass this interview and...

275
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,960
make sure she can't say anything.

276
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,550
My interview.

277
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,480
I thought we could last at least six months.

278
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200
How many times have we moved already?

279
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,170
My celadon.

280
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,330
My white porcelain.

281
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,120
- My precious babies. 
 - It's such a shame.

282
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,360
So did you find a place?

283
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,460
Do you think it's easy to find a place within our budget?

284
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,240
What do we do?

285
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,560
W-Wow, this place is so cheap.

286
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,210
Hey.

287
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,150
It's so nice. Why is it so cheap?

288
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,150
Isn't this place haunted?

289
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,810
I don't want to bother with lost ghosts.

290
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,070
L-Let's check it out, at least.

291
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,250
- Should I come with you? 
 - No.

292
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,650
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

293
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,220
If so, at least take this ghost kit with you.

294
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm fine. I'm Seo Ki Joo.

295
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,620
I've been dealing with ghosts for 20 years.

296
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,390
Please, please, please!

297
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,750
What? It can't be.

298
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,810
CEO.

299
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,670
   

300
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,100
Please be my investor.

301
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,700
Excuse me! Hello!

302
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,020
CEO, I'm behind six months in paying my employees.

303
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,300
I need to pay my kids' academy tuition, too!

304
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,220
Excuse me!

305
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,330
I'm not a CEO.

306
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,210
I don't want to be killed by a lowly ghost on a day like this.

307
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,210
You promised you'd invest in our company!

308
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,820
You sold away our plan!

309
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,010
Why did you do that? Why?

310
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,080
Why?

311
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,760
What? Is it broken?

312
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,820
   

313
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,450
I'm late.

314
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,660
- Shit! 
 - Please invest in us.

315
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,420
Invest in us, CEO.

316
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,920
Invest in us, CEO.

317
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,140
Invest in us!

318
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,330
Invest in us!

319
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,070
Wh-What's going on?

320
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,900
P-Pardon?

321
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,570
I'm going to the 12th floor. How about you?

322
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,950
- No, j-just now— 
 - Yes.

323
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,910
I'm not buying.

324
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,240
Am I really about to die?

325
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Hello, I'm Han Bom.

326
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,300
- Yes, Attorney Han. 
 - Yes.

327
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,200
You came early. The elevator is out of order.

328
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,790
Pardon?

329
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,520
Take this.

330
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,000
Please turn your phone off and come this way.

331
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,620
Okay.

332
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,700
Excuse me for a moment.

333
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,700
 The media is going crazy over this case, but it's kind of strange. 

334
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,150
 There's nothing suspicious, but the suspect turned themselves in. 

335
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,410
 They are refusing to get an attorney, too. 

336
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,990
   

337
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,800
 Prosecutor, it wasn't me. 

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,560
 I'm a thief, not a murderer. 

339
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,350
 Prosecutor! 

340
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,180
 I need to be punished only for what I've done. 

341
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,630
 I have been wronged. 

342
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:02,900
 You're the only one I can trust right now. 

343
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:08,880
   

344
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,790
Aren't you going in?

345
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,360
Pardon?

346
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,260
 She'll be sent to the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office, where Lee Hyeon Oh is. 

347
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,940
 I'm afraid she'd be wrongfully accused again. 

348
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,450
 Can you come right now? 

349
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,330
 You're the only one I can trust to handle this. 

350
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,090
I'll have a tteokbokki and a kimbap.

351
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,950
Here.

352
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:49,560
   

353
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,110
Wait a moment. Okay?

354
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,440
You said they're nice places, but they're all expensive.

355
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,030
And a fake listing?

356
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,160
The real estate industry can't be like this.

357
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,820
What kind of place do you want?

358
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,830
How many times did I tell you...

359
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:32,010
Somewhere very cheap. I just need to live there for 105 days.

360
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,540
Student apartments are your only option then.

361
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,550
You said you know a lot of nice places.

362
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,500
Don't eat. Don't eat. Don't eat. Shit...

363
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,130
May I make a suggestion?

364
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,180
Pardon?

365
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,870
A-Are we going up again?

366
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,010
You just need to go up another staircase up there after this.

367
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,380
A-Are we there yet?

368
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,370
I said we're almost there.

369
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,860
We just need to go up again after this.

370
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,580
What are you, old? What's wrong with you? You're young.

371
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,940
You're in worse shape than me.

372
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,610
We're here. We're here.

373
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,050
Here. It's this place.

374
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,990
Come on in.

375
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,750
I've been using this place as a storage.

376
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,060
It might look a little messy,

377
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,480
but it'll be fine if you clean up a little bit.

378
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,500
I don't think cleaning up a bit will cut it.

379
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,160
I'll give you a special price.

380
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,050
It's basically free.

381
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,850
And you can move in immediately.

382
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,410
What do you say? It meets your needs. Right?

383
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,250
By the way, what's that door over there?

384
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,670
What?

385
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,570
Oh, that? That's a...

386
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:43,640
As they say these days, it's a bit retro for a boiler room, right?

387
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,450
What do you think? It's not too shabby. Right?

388
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,510
Can we have a 105 day-contract...

389
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,660
What? What kind of awkward length is that?

390
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,270
As if you know when you'll die.

391
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,420
Just move in and decide later.

392
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,680
We'll discuss renewing the contract later.

393
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,850
- No, I can't renew– 
 - Oh, also...

394
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,010
don't you need a place to live?

395
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,820
P-Place to live?

396
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,260
Yes.

397
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,300
   

398
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,760
Are you Ms. Jang Bo Ra's attorney?

399
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,930
She said she wouldn't see anyone and didn't need an attorney.

400
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,740
- Were you appointed? 
 - Let me see her for a moment.

401
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,190
I'll make sure to win her over.

402
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,780
Hello, Ms. Jang Bo Ra.

403
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,080
No need to sit.

404
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,050
I did kill my husband.

405
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,800
I said I don't need an attorney.

406
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,440
Just follow the law.

407
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,180
I killed him.

408
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,600
I said I killed him.

409
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,660
Yes, you need me because we need to follow the law.

410
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,500
Because everyone has the right to be protected.

411
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,230
I want to end this quickly.

412
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,140
Yes, let's end this quickly.

413
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,630
You didn't kill him, did you?

414
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,110
How many times did I say I killed him?

415
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,650
I killed him, I said.

416
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,080
How many times do I have to tell you?

417
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,030
Every day, I talked to, washed, and fed the man who couldn't talk.

418
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,020
I wasted my youth to pay off the debt for five years because of his hospital bills.

419
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,230
Do you even know how exhausting and horrible that is?

420
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,960
I just threw away a job interview to come here.

421
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,680
Still, what can I do?

422
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,640
There's no evidence or witness.

423
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,250
But you're insisting you're the culprit.

424
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,830
It just doesn't make sense.

425
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,790
That's why I need to know what happened.

426
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,150
I hope we get along.

427
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm Attorney Han Bom.

428
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,060
Let's find out if you're the culprit or not, starting now.

429
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,950
Wow, you seem frugal, but you have expensive taste.

430
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,500
This has glitters.

431
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,980
Mr. Seo, could you burn this for me?

432
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,690
I've been wearing this outfit for three years.

433
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,910
Aren't you busy? Shouldn't you prepare to open?

434
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,470
I think the sun will set soon.

435
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,060
You're heartless.

436
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,750
- What did you say? 
 - Pardon?

437
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,080
I mean, the virgin ghost is heartless.

438
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,410
I-I meant the ghost.

439
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,620
   

440
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,960
   

441
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,520
   

442
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,400
   

443
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,470
   

444
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,300
Mr. Seo, we're ready to open.

445
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,160
 What price did he have to pay for saving his son, you ask? 

446
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
 It was this photo studio. 

447
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,880
We'll open then.

448
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,450
 A photo studio that exists only for the dead 

449
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,990
 came to exist here in this world. 

450
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,960
 Only the photographer can open the gate to this world. 

451
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,300
 And the gate of the dead 

452
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,060
 where only the dead can enter for three days. 

453
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:55,260
 After 100 years, people call this place "Yahan Studio." 
 (Means "Midnight Studio.") 

454
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,680
 It's not some shady photo studio. 
 (Yahan could be mistaken for 'erotic', but the Chinese character is different) 

455
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,000
 "Ya" as in the night. "Han" as in limit. 

456
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,240
 It's a photo studio that opens only at night. 

457
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,000
 Midnight Studio. 

458
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,900
 I'm the photographer who inherited the family business. 

459
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,070
   

460
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,540
Bo Ra.

461
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,120
Welcome, Visitor.

462
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,500
This is a photo studio between the worlds of the dead and the living.

463
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,080
We take the last photo you want to take with you.

464
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,830
What's the last memory you want to keep from your life?

465
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:35,410
Please free my wife.

466
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,170
   

467
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,900
   

468
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,810
   

469
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,100
   

470
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,410
 Paralyzed husband murder case. 

471
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,710
 After struggling financially and mentally caring for the husband, 

472
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,290
 the wife confessed to suffocating him with a pillow. 

473
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,010
 The cause of death was cardiac arrest from shortness of breath. 

474
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,360
 He was found dead on the floor. 

475
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,780
   

476
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,000
I can't. 
    

477
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,470
- But— 
 - This is...

478
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,810
just a photo studio.

479
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,920
This is a job for an attorney.

480
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,900
What am I supposed to do, then?

481
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,200
No one can hear or see me.

482
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,420
I know, but...

483
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,360
she was already arrested. How could we get her out?

484
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,280
If you have a message for Bo Ra, I'll relay it to her.

485
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,010
I need to meet her. I need to meet her myself.

486
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,990
By chance,

487
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,060
are you trying to take revenge?

488
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,750
No! No!

489
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,810
Bo Ra didn't kill me. Okay?

490
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:41,540
Are you sure? What you remember might be different from what happened.

491
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:46,310
Are you absolutely certain that she didn't kill you?

492
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,820
   

493
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,330
   

494
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,700
 There's no visual sign of external force, 

495
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,860
 but the cause of death was cardiac arrest from shortness of breath. 

496
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,290
 She admitted that she killed him in front of everyone. 

497
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,530
Why is she doing this?

498
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,510
 It appears she's been harassed by debt collectors for a while. 

499
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,500
Why did she say she killed him?

500
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,820
 The suspect has been devoted to caring for her husband, 

501
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,660
 but a witness said she seemed very tired and fed up. 

502
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,120
   

503
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,200
Okay, let's each do our jobs.

504
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,800
Hold on, sir. Just one sec.

505
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,110
What is it?

506
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,810
Take this with you. You need to be careful.

507
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,570
- It's okay. 
 - It was difficult for me to get this.

508
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,940
Korean salt and red beans that work best on Korean ghosts.

509
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,290
I bought the lightning-struck jujube branch in person.

510
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,470
A ghost is giving me a ghost-repelling kit.

511
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,400
What's this?

512
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,410
I'm not just any ghost.

513
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,320
I can touch things since I got the magical power from the camera.

514
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,790
I can walk past things like this easily.

515
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,330
I should be considered a special ghost.

516
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,570
Here. Take it. Take it.

517
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,900
Okay.

518
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,100
Let's go.

519
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,340
You care for your body more than me.

520
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,110
When did you prepare all that?

521
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,550
I'm Ms. Jang Bo Ra's attorney. 
    

522
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,640
Ms. Jang's attorney?

523
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,830
Her attorney is a woman, though.

524
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,310
That's not true. I think you're mistaken.

525
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,040
Pardon?

526
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,750
What do you think?

527
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:51,590
Don't move. You're under arrest.

528
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,360
There's no time for this. Move it.

529
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,880
Find Jang Bo Ra quickly.

530
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,650
Yes, sir.

531
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,940
   

532
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,910
She isn't here.

533
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,390
Act naturally, please. Be natural.

534
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,670
He looks excited.

535
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,380
I found her.

536
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,970
Gosh, what the hell? Geez...

537
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,630
We'll use this space just for an hour, everyone.

538
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,030
No?

539
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,080
Just an hour, I said.

540
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,100
Hello, Ms. Jang.

541
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,740
- What's this? 
 - Mr. Park Seong Joon sent me.

542
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,420
He wants to take a photo with you.

543
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,440
What are you? A reporter? A prosecutor?

544
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,990
Mr. Park Seong Joon saw it that day.

545
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,730
That day?

546
00:48:55,730 --> 00:49:00,470
 You decided to kill your husband that day. 

547
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,580
 But you must've been afraid... 

548
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,090
 to kill someone you love with your own hands. 

549
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:24,150
 In the end, you failed to be completely cruel. 

550
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:44,120
 Then, Mr. Park passed away after you ran away from the ward. 

551
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,520
How do you know—

552
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,710
When you die, you need to walk the death's path to enter the netherworld.

553
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,740
The path takes your memory from this world one by one.

554
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,350
It goes in chronological order starting from the moment you were born.

555
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,490
- Pardon? 
 - If you give up like this now,

556
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:07,560
his last memory will be his wife trying to kill him.

557
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:14,190
Do you really want that to be his last memory of you?

558
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,490
Your husband said he doesn't mind it.

559
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:22,170
 Are you absolutely certain that she didn't kill you? 

560
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,520
 Whether she killed me or not... 

561
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,920
 is not my concern. 

562
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,240
 I just want my Bo Ra... 

563
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,720
 to finally become happy. 

564
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,690
He said he just wants his memory to be of you.

565
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,410
The moment we get to say goodbye to our loved ones,

566
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,960
we call that a miracle.

567
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,850
Will you waste a miracle like this? At a place like this?

568
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,720
Your husband is waiting for you.

569
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,120
Who are you?

570
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,730
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

571
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,230
Detective.

572
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,010
I'm glad you're here. Can I visit Ms. Jang?

573
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:22,320
Hey, Attorney Han. Ms. Jang had seen her attorney earlier.

574
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,760
- Who? 
 - Attorney Han Bom.

575
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,300
- That's me. 
 - Yes.

576
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,010
What?

577
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:34,550
What am I doing here? Shit.

578
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,590
Bo Ra.

579
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,680
Wh-What's wrong?

580
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,390
Bo Ra.

581
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,560
Let go of him.

582
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,850
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

583
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,580
What are you two?

584
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,890
Are you in this together?

585
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,350
I said I'd be punished quietly!

586
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:01,590
Bo Ra, take a deep breath. Calm down.

587
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,390
Excuse me, are you an attorney?

588
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,780
I'm in charge of Ms. Jang's case. Who are you?

589
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,670
I'm just a proxy.

590
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,630
I send the struggling people to a good place.

591
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,170
Pardon?

592
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,680
White rice and soybean stew full of pollack roe.

593
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,250
He said he'd make them and wait for you.

594
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,560
How do you know—

595
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,810
 I'll make white rice and soybean stew full of pollack roe and wait for you. 

596
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,920
 I'll be right back. 

597
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,620
   

598
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,960
There's only one chance.

599
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,360
Keep that in mind.

600
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,420
You said you're an attorney, right?

601
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,550
Go ahead and prove your skills.

602
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,540
My visitor doesn't have a lot of time. 
    

603
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,010
Wait, excuse me.

604
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,020
Excuse me, where are you going? Why did you suddenly bring up rice?

605
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,520
Wait!

606
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,350
Bo Ra, why did you put socks on him?

607
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:30,430
Even when you had a caretaker, you didn't let them touch his socks.

608
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:34,950
You always changed his socks whenever his doctor made his rounds.

609
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,260
As if someone was watching.

610
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:43,460
Mr. Park injured his feet in a fire seven years ago.

611
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,500
It's because you don't want people to see the scar. Right?

612
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,770
Bo Ra...

613
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:05,950
I don't think someone who cares that much

614
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,590
about his feet and loves him so much

615
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,450
could have killed him.

616
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,590
I received...

617
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,010
I received too many texts.

618
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,720
Even on the day Oppa collapsed from overworking

619
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,340
I said I'd cook him dinner...

620
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,600
with a big smile. I hated myself for that.

621
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,610
   

622
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,440
If Oppa wakes up,

623
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,300
I wanted us to eat together. 
    

624
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,400
I'd been hanging in there thinking that.

625
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:05,180
♫  I still wonder why  ♫

626
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,720
♫  Tell me why  ♫

627
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,110
♫  Your traces...  ♫

628
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,410
I was going to kill him and...

629
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,430
kill myself afterward, but...

630
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,580
No.

631
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,120
I killed him.

632
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,310
I did.

633
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,460
♫  I don't think I can let you go  ♫

634
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,560
You didn't, Bo Ra.

635
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,340
The autopsy will determine it anyway,

636
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,120
but you need to say it yourself

637
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,600
so you can say goodbye to Mr. Park in time.

638
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,670
Bo Ra, can you testify again?

639
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,810
Yes.

640
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,140
   

641
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:06,060
 This camera allows you to take only two shots. 

642
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,970
 The first shot allows the living and the dead... 

643
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:18,250
- Who are you... 
  - to meet each other. 

644
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,390
Oppa.

645
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:38,820
 It lets you meet the person you thought you'd never see or touch again. 

646
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,880
O-Oppa, is it you?

647
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,540
How are you...

648
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,300
 It lets you have a very brief but miraculous moment. 

649
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,360
I'm sorry.

650
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,590
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

651
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,920
I have no idea what you're talking about.

652
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,130
I was too exhausted.

653
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,210
I'm sorry.

654
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,660
♫  I have nothing to prove  ♫

655
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,830
It's because I was too exhausted...

656
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:15,490
You went through a lot.

657
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,610
You really did.

658
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,290
♫  Running in circles  ♫

659
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:24,070
I'm really okay, Bo Ra.

660
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:28,250
♫  For the lucid game  ♫

661
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,540
♫  Sometimes there's no meaning  ♫

662
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,810
♫  Life goes the way it came  ♫

663
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,310
Here's the food you ordered.

664
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,750
Pollock roe soybean stew.

665
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,560
Our dinner got delayed too much.

666
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,220
Didn't it?

667
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,670
- Looks tasty. 
 - Should we eat?

668
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,060
♫  How about superstition?  ♫

669
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,390
 Okay, here you go. 

670
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,040
 Gosh, it's my favorite. 

671
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,110
♫  But only then a girl can dream about what's missing  ♫

672
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,310
♫  What's missing  ♫

673
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,200
 Why is it so tasty today? 

674
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,400
 Is today a special day? 

675
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,050
 A special day isn't much. 

676
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,020
 It's a special day if I spend it with you. 

677
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,390
 I was really tired today. 

678
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,860
 Maybe that's why. It's so tasty. 

679
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,100
 Eat slowly. You might get indigestion. 

680
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,810
Seong Joon. Bo Ra. This is your last photo.

681
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,840
I'll take it now.

682
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,400
One, two, three.

683
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,570
 The second shot... 

684
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,570
Bo Ra...

685
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,360
 signifies goodbye. 

686
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
My life...

687
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,230
every single day was a good day because I had you.

688
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,670
Mine, too.

689
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,510
The socks.

690
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,590
Thanks for the socks.

691
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,130
Ta-da.

692
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,370
 H-Hold on. 

693
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,440
You changed my socks every single day.

694
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,440
I know all about it.

695
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:47,210
I know you don't like other people to see them, Oppa.

696
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:52,710
But I even loved those feet of yours.

697
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:58,350
 It announces that the brief but miraculous encounter 

698
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:02,470
 that you'll remember forever is over. 

699
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:10,270
 Their final goodbye. 

700
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,750
I guess I need to leave now.

701
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,050
I love you.

702
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,100
Me, too. I love you.

703
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:17,470
 And a photo of the desperate souls' last moment. 

704
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,810
Geez, I'm beat.

705
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,970
I achieved something, at least.

706
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,800
Gosh, well done.

707
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,410
Good job, Han Bom.

708
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,600
Let's go rest inside.

709
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,980
Did I work too much today?

710
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:16,200
What's this?

711
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,390
T-These things look very familiar.

712
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,150
This is my stuff.
    

713
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,120
 I emptied your room. Move out. 

714
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,490
Gosh, seriously.

715
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,330
What's this? I'm out of battery, too?

716
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,880
   

717
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,140
 The dead leave to the netherworld 

718
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,930
 and their memories stay here. 

719
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,790
   

720
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:46,540
 This camera has a very serious curse. 

721
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,160
 The curse of a short life. 

722
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,330
 None of the photographers... 

723
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:08,870
 got to live past 35 years. 

724
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,100
What's this?

725
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,450
Did someone move in?

726
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:26,870
Why did they leave the boiler on? What a waste of electricity.

727
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,600
   

728
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,050
What's this?

729
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,750
Has there always been a space like this?

730
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,580
What's this?

731
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,730
Who...

732
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,500
are you?

733
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:11,670
What is this place?

734
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,560
Are you...

735
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,820
dead?

736
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:38,000


737
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:43,290
♫  Every day I floated breathlessly  ♫

738
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:46,280
♫  And every night I endured it dangerously alone  ♫

739
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,370
♫  Stop now, trust me, I'm on your side  ♫

740
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,840
   

741
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,870
 How could a living person enter through the gate of the dead? 

742
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:59,610
 I've never seen anyone for the 20 years I've run the studio. Not even one. 

743
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:02,700
 Are they in business or not? 

744
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,580
 What's with you? 

745
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,620
 Stop it! 

746
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,020
 Stop moving! 

747
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,270
 Can you see him? 

748
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,230
 You have seen ghosts ever since you were a kid? 

749
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:16,020
 I need you. 

750
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,010
 I want you to protect me just for a hundred days. 

751
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,090
♫  In this rough world, I'm with you  ♫
