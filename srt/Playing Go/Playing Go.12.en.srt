00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,480
Dear passengers,

4
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,120
we're arriving at Xincun Station.

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,200
Passengers getting off at Xincun Station

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
should get your luggage

7
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
- Mister,
- and get ready to get off.

8
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
can you get this for me, please?

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
- This one?
- Yes.

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,310
It's mine.

11
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,470
- Sorry to trouble you.
- Be careful.

12
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,500
- This bag.
- Be careful.

13
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,190
- Thank you.
- No problem. Be careful.

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,750
- Be careful.
- Okay.

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,470
How rude.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
What are you doing?

17
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,470
What are you doing?

18
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,360
Don't cut the queue.

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,030
Excuse me, I'm getting off.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Let me

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,310
ask you about a place.

22
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,240
Where's the police station?

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,910
I don't know.

24
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,190
You may ask someone else.

25
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,240
What are you doing?

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,030
What are you doing?
Are you harassing me?

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,630
- Let go.
- Go to the front.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,510
Let go.

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,750
- Go.
- I'll count to three.

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,830
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

31
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,000
- Are you harassing me?
- Guys,

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,860
he's harassing me.

33
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,000
This man is indecent.

34
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,350
Officer, someone
is harassing this woman here.

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,150
Officer, look, he's harassing me.

36
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,630
- Let go!
- What did you shout?

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,360
Are you justified in stealing?

38
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,190
You've got the wrong person.

39
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,470
Don't watch the fun.

40
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,950
Get out of the train if you have to.

41
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,910
As soon as you touched your waist,

42
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,000
I knew we were peers.

43
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,080
How could you tell she was a thief?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,750
She just came out of the toilet
and wiped her hands on her tummy.

45
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,830
If she was really pregnant,
would she bear to do that?

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,590
When my wife was pregnant
with my daughter,

47
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,000
she wouldn't let me touch her tummy.

48
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,870
You saw her squeeze
through the hallway, right?

49
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,590
Her tummy

50
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,080
got bigger every time

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,630
she crossed a carriage.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,800
You're on a mission?

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
Alone?

54
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,190
I'm traveling.

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,590
Where are you going?

56
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,630
Dantong.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,150
Have you been there before?

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,190
It's my first time.

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,960
Where are you going to go?

60
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,590
Fengcheng.

61
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,910
Look,

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,910
we're just destined to meet.

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,000
I

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,470
am from Fengcheng.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,750
What's there to explore in that place?

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,190
Clean rivers?

67
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,190
You're on a mission, aren't you?

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm really traveling.

69
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,600
I just think

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
you Southerners are too discreet.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know your superiors.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,430
You don't know your way

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,510
around there.

74
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,160
Tell me your plans.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,310
I might be able to help you, right?

76
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,630
Do you know Dongfeng Coal Mine?

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,380
(Dantong Railway Station)

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
Our train will arrive on time.

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,040
When you get off the train,

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,340
- go straight to Hongyuan Market
- Follow me, will you?

81
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,800
and look for my buddy.

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,430
My buddy's

83
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,920
hair is always shiny

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,560
like a calf's lick,

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,190
so he's easy to be found and recognised.

86
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,870
Are there enough people?

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,830
It's all here. Count it.

88
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,240
One, two, three, four, five.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,430
Get on the truck.

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Hi.

91
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,800
What's the matter?

92
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,240
Are you Erpao?

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,630
Quick. Get on the truck.

94
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,870
A friend of Stick Liu?

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,310
He's my buddy.

96
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,240
Just mention my name.

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,870
Tell him not to say he knows me.

98
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
I don't know him well.

99
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,480
Let me ask you about someone.

100
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,870
Look, do you know this person?

101
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,710
No, I don't.

102
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you know this man?

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,240
I don't care
if it's crushed on you.

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
- What about Dongfeng Coal Mine?
- I don't care if it's crushed on you.

105
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,390
I don't care if it's crushed on you.

106

(Xinqiao Inn)

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,920
Boss, how did you fix this car?

108
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,870
What's wrong?

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,680
Here's the thing.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,430
Sir, take a look.

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
This engine

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,360
is broken.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,070
I got you a new one.

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
This engine is mine.

115
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,870
No.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
That engine

117
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,040
is originally imported.

118
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
I've replaced it for you.

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Got it?

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,310
You can't get it?

121
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,680
This one is imported,

122
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
not yours.

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,190
I've replaced it.

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,720
It's yours now. Got it?

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,800
Sir,

126
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,430
you're from the city.

127
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,800
The car

128
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
was fixed

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
here.

130
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,660
Are you going to get on with your trip?

131
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,270
Think about it.

132
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,560
Your wife and your son

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
are waiting for you.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520

Sir,

this money

137
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
is just enough for parts.

Report, Captain Cui Yangao.

152

I've caught up with the bad guys ahead.

don't follow them too closely.

156

Don't let them find out.

157

Yes, Captain.

158
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,630
Report, Captain.

159
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,000
There's a car in front of me
that's blocking the view.

Please instruct.

162
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,870
Try to keep up with it.

163
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,150
I'll call for backup right away.

191
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Leave now.

192
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,840
The chicken hearts are ready.

193
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Thanks, Boss.

194
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,510
Pao,

195
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,960
what's that guy doing?

196
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,320
Why does he keep following you?

197
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,720
He's from the South.

198
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Just ignore him.

199
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,640
Darn it.

200
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,080
I got ripped off
by a couple of southerners in my business

201
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,320
a while back.

202
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,960
Just you wait.
I'll deal with him for you.

203
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
Come on.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Cheers.

205
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,440
What do you want?

206
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
What do you mean?

207
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,900
It's not even dark yet,
and you're drunk.

208
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,670
Does it matter to you if I am?

209
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,630
Do you know him?

210
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,670
I'll show you what we've got.

211
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,670
How many times have you come this month?

212
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,960
You like this place so much?

213
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
You're here to work?

214
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,360
You're pretty good at this.

215
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,000
Seems experienced, huh?

216
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,120
Cui Wei.

217
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,630
A cop.

218
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,440
You're a cop?

219
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
Where's your ID card?

220
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,960
Is this what you do here too?

221
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,670
Nothing new?

222
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,200
(ID, Cui Wei, Criminal Police Officer)
You've traveled a long way.

223
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,270
Why did you come all the way here?

224
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,440
On official duty?

225
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,920
A personal errand.

226
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,720
Do you know who you hit?

227
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,960
You assaulted a police officer,
you know?

228
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,830
It's all about mutual assault.

229
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
- Look.
- What?

230
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,200
Mutual assault?

231
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,580
You're still trying to argue, huh?

232
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,440
Who are you trying to argue with?

233
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
Mutual assault?

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll let you assault each other tonight.

235
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,240
We're friends.

236
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,680
They've had a few drinks

237
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,030
and were just messing with me.

238
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,800
Thanks for your hard work.

239
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,520
Thanks for your hard work.

240
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,540
Thanks for your hard work.

241
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you satisfied?

242
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,590
Thank you.

243
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,230
- No, he...
- All right, shut it.

244
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,680
Sit down and keep your mouth shut.

245
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,840
What do you want?

246
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,200
Do you still want to fight us?

247
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,590
You have nowhere to go?

248
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,160
Do you dare come with me?

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,240
Let's go.

250
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,270
Come and dance.

251
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,830
Come on. Hurry up.

252
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Go ahead.

253
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,750
You're a good dancer.

254
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,110
What's wrong?

255
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,400
You don't dance

256
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
or drink.

257
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,720
What are you doing here?

258
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Cheer up, will you?

259
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,960
Why are you so happy?

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
We

261
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,640
shouldn't

262
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,750
be too specific about our goals in life.

263
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,080
Got it?

264
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,030
People's brains

265
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
are just this big.

266
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,680
When you hold a lot of things in

267
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
for a long time,

268
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,510
it'll explode.

269
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,350
Yun,

270
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,440
come here.

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
My big brother.

272
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,210
- Hi, sir.
- Toast to him.

273
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,110
Sir,

274
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,440
here's a toast to you.

275
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Have a drink with my sister.

276
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
Why did you put it down again?

277
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
What do you mean?

278
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Sir, what's wrong?

279
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,110
Tell me.

280
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,030
You need to unleash

281
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,590
what you've been holding in.

282
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,190
Sir,

283
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,510
let's dance

284
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
to unleash.

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,110
Go ahead yourself.

286
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,000
Why? You don't dare to dance?

287
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
I'm afraid I'll scare you.

288
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
What does that mean?

289
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,510
There's no way that we'll be scared.

290
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,920
Try to scare us now.

291
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,680
Come on.

292
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
Go now.

293
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,280
Unleash!

294
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,680
Unleash it!

295
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Yan, look.

296
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,590
It can swim backstroke.

297
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,030
Is it cute?

298
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,200
Mister, please take a photo for us.

299
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,800
Okay.

300
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,840
Come on.

301
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,160
Let's take a photo.

302
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,800
Come on.

303
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,750
Good. Stand closer.

304
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,480
Ocean Park is too big.

305
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,920
I want to go back tomorrow.

306
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,040
Yan,

307
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
you must be hungry.

308
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
You haven't eaten well all day.

309
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,110
I'll cook some noodles fro you.

310
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,350
We're not eating this.

311
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,200
Let's go down to the restaurant.

312
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,720
Yan,

313
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,520
let's go.

314
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,960
Let's not eat that. Leave it here.

315
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,520
Let's go.

316
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,030
Yan, come on. Have this.

317
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,350
Dip in the sauce.

318
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Dig in.

319
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,350
Is it good?

320
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,440
Yes.

321
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,830
Have a fish ball.

322
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
Tomorrow, we're going
to Ocean Park again

323
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,900
to see the sharks.

324
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,660
And the day after that, we're going
to Queen's Pier for a boat ride.

325
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,640
Yan.

326
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
Aren't we supposed to go
to the hospital tomorrow?

327
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,560
Yan,

328
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
tomorrow,

329
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,680
let's not go to Ocean Park.

330
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,090
Let's go to the hospital
with your mom for a body check-up.

331
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,640
What's wrong with Mom?

332
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,250
Nothing.

333
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,110
I haven't had a body check-up
for a long time.

334
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,030
I was supposed to go
to the People's Hospital.

335
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
But your dad said

336
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,830
the equipment here is advanced,

337
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,830
so I'm doing it here.

338
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,960
Why don't

339
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,000
you go

340
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,200
for a check-up too?

341
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,720
My leg doesn't need to be treated.

342
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,960
Zhang Wei's arm was in a cast

343
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,440
last term,

344
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
but it healed in two months.

345
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,960
It's okay. We're not treating the leg.

346
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,920
We're just checking it.

347
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,040
Drink this.

348
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,400
What are you doing? Get down.

349
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,240
Come on.

350
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,160
I just danced too hard.

351
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,030
I'm a little dizzy.

352
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,200
Let me cool down.

353
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,160
Did you dance?

354
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,400
What did you dance?

355
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,740
As the water in the pool is shallow,
the snappers are exposed.

356
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,960
What do you mean?

357
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,830
What's your tattoo?

358
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,680
The dragon's had

359
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,510
a rough time of it.

360
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,240
The first time,

361
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,480
I went to jail

362
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,040
before it was finished.

363
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
The second time, I went to jail again

364
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,750
before it was finished.

365
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,270
The third time, I thought

366
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,750
it had to be finished this time,

367
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,200
and the tattoo artist went in.

368
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,510
What's it?

369
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
Both times,

370
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,920
it was Stick Liu who caught me.

371
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,200
After that,

372
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,750
he told everyone

373
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,920
that we were buddies.

374
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,160
What kind of buddy is that?

375
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,200
Would you arrest your buddy?

376
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
If I didn't think you were a nice guy,

377
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,110
I'd never want to have anything to do

378
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,680
with you again.

379
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,110
It's true.

380
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,840
Wait.

381
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm asking you a serious question.

382
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,830
What the hell are you cops thinking?

383
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,380
You make a little money

384
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,960
and you have to risk your life
every once in a while out there.

385
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,240
What? Are you addicted
to arresting people or serving people?

386
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,030
What's the reason?

387
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,830
When I was a kid,

388
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
my family's attention was never on me.

389
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
No one cared about me.

390
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,160
I always roamed around.

391
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,480
One day, I wandered off

392
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,960
and couldn't find my way home
even when it was dark.

393
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,300
The more I thought about it,
the more scared I got.

394
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,240
Suddenly,

395
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,160
a light shone on me.

396
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,440
Do you believe in light?

397
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,200
Two cops

398
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,640
on a big motorbike.

399
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
In your words, that's super cool.

400
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,520
Yes.

401
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,750
From then on,

402
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,350
I was sure to wear this glowing suit.

403
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Okay?

404
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,680
That's it?

405
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes, that's it.

406
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,350
I don't think about it that much.

407
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,680
You're dishonest.

408
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,440
Are you honest, then?

409
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,240
I asked you a question

410
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,920
and you still haven't answered it.

411
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,920
Do you recognise the man in the photo
I showed you or not?

412
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,270
Come down first.

413
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,830
Let's talk when we both
have nothing on us.

414
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,680
We can't talk through the layers.

415
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,030
How? Do you feel comfortable?

416
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,510
I

417
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,350
work for the factory.

418
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
Don't make me lose my job.

419
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
We can talk about anything else. Okay?

420
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,590
No one will know you said it.

421
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,440
Words spread easily in circles.

422
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,750
Nothing can be hidden.

423
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,960
Just listen to me.

424
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,920
I'll entertain you for a few days

425
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,880
and you should go back
where you came from.

426
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,960
It's decided, then.

427
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Stop asking for trouble.

428
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,200
Later,

429
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,750
you can get a scrub from No. 13, Wu,

430
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:45,110
and you'll feel refreshed.

431
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Remember,

432
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,590
it's No. 13.

433
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,030
Sir, is this strength okay?

434
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,720
If it's painful, just bear with it.

435
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,270
Scrubbing

436
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,550
is only comfortable when it's done

437
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,480
hard enough.

438
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,000
You haven't been at it long, have you?

439
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,590
It hasn't been a year yet.

440
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,880
What did you do before?

441
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,030
I used to work easy,

442
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,590
in an office.

443
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,920
I used to be

444
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,400
an accountant in a mine.

445
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,160
Then,

446
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,440
I went off to sea.

447
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,640
No, I mean I came to the bathhouse.

448
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,160
Which mine?

449
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,240
Dongfeng Coal Mine

450
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,160
Dongfeng Coal Mine was fine.

451
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,680
How come it was reorganized?

452
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,200
A few years ago,
the factory was not doing well.

453
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,720
Our factory manager

454
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,000
listened to the advice of someone

455
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,000
and said that he wanted
to purchase new equipment,

456
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,510
so he mortgaged
the entire factory's equity.

457
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,320
He borrowed money
from the current factory manager.

458
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,200
As a result,

459
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,270
the equipment didn't arrive

460
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,240
and the money was lost.

461
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,200
After that,

462
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,720
he died.

463
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,750
How?

464
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,510
About a month ago,

465
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,440
he told us

466
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,160
that the current factory manager

467
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,030
was behind the whole thing,

468
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,510
but there's no proof.

469
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,720
Who would believe that?

470
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:25,310
After that,

471
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,830
he hanged himself.

472
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,310
Isn't this Jin's son, Chunsheng?

473
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,720
He also has a youngest son
named Xiasheng.

474
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
Jin?

475
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,590
Who's that?

476
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,750
Jin Chaoshan.

477
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,880
It's the old factory manager

478
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
of our factory who died.

479
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,070
Are you sure?

480
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
I'm sure.

481
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,000
I watched them

482
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,110
growing up.

483
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,240
Do you know where Chunsheng
and Xiasheng are now?

484
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,400
I have no idea.

485
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,590
I'll get you the change.

486
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,070
No need.

487
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,510
You know where their house is, right?

488
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,550
You're Hu Kuiyong, right?

489
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,790
I am not.

490
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,240
I am not Hu Kuiyong.

491
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,590
It can't be wrong.

492
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,510
I've been following you for two days.

493
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,110
(50)

494
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,960
One million.

495
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,800
Is it enough?

496
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,510
You don't recognise me?

497
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Do you know Jin Chaoshan?

498
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,760
I'm Jin Chaoshan's son.

499
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,630
What did you do?

500
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:57,000
What did you do?

501
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,110
I'm asking you what you did.

502
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,800
My dad sold the factory

503
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,960
and the house,

504
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,630
so he had to live in this kind of place.

505
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
He couldn't even live
in a house outside.

506
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,840
If he hadn't found the equipment seller
half a month ago,

507
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,880
he'd have thought it was his fault.

508
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,510
You're the one
who killed my dad and my brother.

509
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,920
Sorry. I was wrong.

510
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,550
I'm sorry.

511
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,440
What's the use of apologizing now?

512
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,110
I'll let you die here today

513
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,110
to make you pay for it.

514
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,380
(Yueshi Textile Factory)

515
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,380
(Production Schedule
of Yueshi Textile Factory)

516
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Xia Yu.

517
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,960
Xia Yu.

518
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
Xia Yu.

519
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,440
Don't you lose focus.

520
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,880
If there's a mistake in this batch,
the factory will be in trouble.

521
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,840
I haven't closed my eyes for two days.

522
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,960
I'm going to take a nap.

523
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,000
Stay here and don't make any mistakes.

524
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,550
Don't worry. I'm here, it will be fine.

525
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,960
- Go ahead.
- Be careful.

526
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,110
It's me.

527
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,320
I've sent you a card.

528
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,000
What's in there is for you.

529
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,320
What are you saying? I can't hear you.

530
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,760
I was just about to call you.

531
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
It's your birthday.

532
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,150
Wait a minute.

533
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,280
Happy birthday,

534
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,320
Xiasheng.

535
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,000
I miss you.

536
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,480
I've decided to sing you happy birthday

537
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,280
every year from now on.

538
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,320
♪Happy birthday to you♪

539
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,510
♪Happy birthday to you♪

540
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,960
♪Happy birthday to you♪

541
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,110
♪Happy birthday to you♪

542
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,440
Happy birthday,

543
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,960
Xiasheng.

544
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,070
Look carefully.

545
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,510
One is for my dad.

546
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
One is for my brother.

547
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,110
I beg you, don't kill me.

548
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,320
Don't look at me!

549
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,840
Mr. Cui,

550
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,230
let me put it to you this way.

551
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,400
This test report

552
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,920
confirms that Cui Yangao is not suffering
from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

553
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
He has

554
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
spinal muscular dystrophy.

555
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,000
This disease is primarily characterized
by muscle weakness and atrophy

556
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,800
caused by degeneration

557
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,510
and loss of motor neurons

558
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,150
in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.

559
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,070
It's not life-threatening

560
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,630
at this age.

561
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,800
Anyway,

562
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,510
in the future,

563
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,640
he could become

564
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,280
progressively incapacitated.

565
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,550
This disease requires

566
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,800
a huge amount of money to cure.

567
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,070
The family must be well prepared.

568
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,440
Of course, we also have
a more conservative compromise,

569
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,030
which is cheaper.

570
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,030
You can choose according
to your own financial situation.

571
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,030
It's best to make a decision
as soon as possible.

572
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,960
Got it, Mr. Cui?

573
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,030
How much does it cost?

574
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,880
I'll tell you what. Mr. Cui,

575
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,960
I have a questionnaire here.

576
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,920
Please fill it out.

577
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,880
It will help us to understand
your family's situation

578
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,630
and help us to give Cui Yangao

579
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,110
the most suitable treatment plan

580
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,150
according to your ability.

581
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,180
(Progressive Spinal Muscular Atrophy,
currently incurable)

582
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,060
(Mr. Cui)

583
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,280
Hello.

584
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,550
Where are you?

585
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,380
I'm back.
