191
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,220
Long.

192
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,460
Mr. Liu.

193
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,380
Sit down.

194
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
I've got everything.

195
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,100
I'll give you my cannery as collateral

196
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,500
to borrow another half a million.

197
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,660
No problem.

198
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,060
I've got all the money ready for you.

199
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,260
Thank you.

200
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,220
I'll proceed with the formalities.

201
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,860
You'll get your money then.

202
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,300
Sure, thank you.

203
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,220
Is the amount correct?

204
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,780
Sign the contract.

205
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,460
Hey,

206
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,980
what are you looking at?

207
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,060
Are you going
to borrow the money or not?

208
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,340
What are you doing here?

209
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,260
I came to see the view.

210
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,290
Well, when I asked you about that question
in the Internet cafe,

211
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
did you say yes?

212
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,740
Who knows if you were serious?

213
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,260
Of course I was serious.

214
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,140
What kind of person says that
when they're blowing people's heads off?

215
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,660
Look.

216
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,100
No.

217
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,820
I'm really serious.

218
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,100
So tell me how serious you are.

219
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,300
I've got it all figured out.

220
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,380
You quit your job.

221
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
I

222
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,820
will open an Internet cafe.

223
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,450
We'll make money when people come.

224
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,300
If no one comes,

225
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,260
we'll play hard

226
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,540
and have fun.

227
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,540
All you do is play.

228
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,260
I'm not leaving the factory.

229
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,820
If you really want to be with me,

230
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,900
get a proper job.

231
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,660
Is opening an Internet cafe not proper?

232
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,620
Have you received the letter I sent you?

233
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,140
Letter?

234
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,580
Did you send me a letter?

235
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,900
Hello.

236
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,240
What's wrong?

237
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,720
Something's wrong with
the factory's goods. I have to go now.

238
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,460

240
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,940
(Bless your son. From Handkerchief)

241
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,390
- We've lost all our hard-earned money.
- You must give us an explanation.

242
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,620
What's the solution?

243
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,580
Li.

244
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
Li,

245
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,900
aren't you usually a reliable person?

246
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
Why did you make a mistake
when it mattered?

247
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,980
Why this batch?

248
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,660
If this batch is ruined,

249
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,340
our factory will be ruined.

250
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,580
You're driving us to death.

251
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,660
If the factory is ruined,

252
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,020
you'll be a sinner.

253
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,500
You'll be a sinner.

254
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,580
It's my fault. Don't blame Li.

255
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,170
We've all become sinners.

256
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,020
You,

257
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,580
your dad tricked your mum
by gambling with the factory's money.

258
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,980
- We've raised money for you once.
- Yes.

259
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,900
Why did the factory

260
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,100
have to deal with your family?

261
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,260
Calm down, everyone.

262
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,300
Pay us back!

263
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Feng, you're just in time.

264
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,780
I was just looking for you.

265
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,060
(Yueshi Textile Factory Is My Home)
Does the factory

266
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,980
(Development Depends On All)
want everyone

267
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
to pay for the damages?

268
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Does it?

269
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,620
We don't have any money.

270
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,500
Why is that?

271
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
We don't have money.

272
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,300
- Listen to me, everyone.
- We don't have money.

273
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,300
We have two family members working
in the factory.

274
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,820
Stop it.

275
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,580
Give us an idea.

276
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,980
Give us an idea.

277
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,460
We must solve it.

278
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,820
How else can we live?

279
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,980
How can we live?

280
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,580
Where else can we make a living?

281
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,500
Give us an explanation.

282
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,340
I'll give you all a satisfactory answer.

283
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,660
Li.

284
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,580
Li.

285
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,220
- Get down.
- Get down.

286
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,660
Don't jump.

287
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,740
- Li.
- No.

288
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,580
- Li.
- Get down.

289
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,860
- Get down.
- Get down now.

290
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,820
Get down now.

291
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
Li,

292
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,900
get down first.

293
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,020
I'm sure we'll work something out.

294
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,540
It's really not your fault this time.

295
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,340
- It's my responsibility.
- I shouldn't have

296
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,540
left my duty.

297
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,660
I'm responsible for it.

298
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,900
It's all my fault.

299
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,860
Uncle Song has been working
in this factory all his life.

300
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,980
He'll retire in a year.

301
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,620
Wei's whole family are factory workers.

302
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
And Shen,

303
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,100
Xiao,

304
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,900
Li.

305
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,340
Li's husband was laid off
a long time ago.

306
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,580
She's raising a family on her own.

307
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,900
It was actually my shift that day,

308
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,580
but I didn't even notice
that the machine was acting up.

309
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,060
This batch is the last hope
of the factory.

310
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,660
If the factory is closed down,

311
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,900
what will happen to everyone?

312
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm the one who should die.

313
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,680
Does it mean the factory won't have
to close down

314
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,540
if we compensate for that money?

315
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,580
I have money.

316
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,780
I called you

317
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,540
on my birthday

318
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,860
and said I'd sent you a card

319
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,300
and the stuff inside was left for you.

320
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,020
Do you remember?

321
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,020
That's a card from the depository
at the train station.

322
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,580
There's money in it.

323
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,360
It's enough to save your factory.

324
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,100
It's all because I called you.

325
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,380
I should take care of it.

326
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,060
I sent it by registered mail.

327
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,980
It should be here by now.

328
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,220
(Mr. Cui)

329
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,660
I have something to do
and have to go right now.

330
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,300
Xia Yu,

331
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,380
believe me.

332
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,260
Now, you go back and see
if the registered letter has arrived.

333
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,660
I'll meet you later.

334
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,420
Okay?

335
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,660
All right, I'll see you later.

336
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,900
Xia Yu,

337
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,060
your registered mail.

338
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,640
Uncle Xia.

339
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,620
Is your daughter home?

340
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,860
There's registered mail for her.

341
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,990
It needs to be signed for
by the recipient.

342
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,960
You have so many rules
when you come to my house.

343
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,860
Give me the pen.

344
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,140
Okay, bye.

345
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,220
Anything else?

346
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,300
Long.

347
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,460
Long.

348
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,860
I'll definitely pay you back.

349
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,220
Can you please

350
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,060
give me a few more days?

351
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,260
Xia,

352
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,860
I'll give you a chance.

353
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,260
You've got to fight for yourself.

354
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,100
Ten seconds counts as a day.

355
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,060
Let's see how long
you can hold your breath.

356
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,260
After we split up,

357
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,820
I took him to Hong Kong, China.

358
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,860
He's been diagnosed

359
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,460
as not having
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

360
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,020
I've accepted everything in the past,

361
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,060
but now it gives me hope.

362
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,980
Isn't it funny?

363
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,580
Sometimes, hope

364
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,620
is worse than despair.

365
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,500
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about

366
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,460
earlier.

367
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,860
When I was in Hong Kong, China,

368
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
you were the first person

369
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,020
I could think of to help me.

370
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,540
But when I saw you,

371
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,900
I couldn't say anything.

372
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
I really,

373
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,580
really have no choice.

374
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,620
I really can't come up
with that much money.

375
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
How much do you want?

376
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,020
800,000 yuan.

377
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,060
Please help me out.

378
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,060
You've got a problem?

379
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,540
It's Xia Yu.

380
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,660
Something's happened
to Xia Yu's factory.

381
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,780
She's responsible.

382
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,620
Without this money,

383
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,100
the factory could be closed down.

384
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,940
I've seen it before.

385
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,900
It can really drive someone to death.

386
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,060
Her factory?

387
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,540
What's her factory got to do with you?

388
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,140
For her factory,

389
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,580
a bunch of people you don't know,

390
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,220
you're willing to help them
rather than me.

391
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,340
That's my son.

392
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,700
Your pendant is still around his neck.

393
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,700
Ye.

394
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,620
Don't call me that.

395
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,700
What's our relationship?

396
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,220
I saved your life.

397
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,900
You saved my life too.

398
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,620
We're buddies through life and death.

399
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,220
You'd rather help them?

400
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,860
You haven't been through it.

401
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,500
Whenever there's an accident
at the factory,

402
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,700
everyone in the factory suffers.

403
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,340
I don't want
to see them lose their lives,

404
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,910
and I don't want

405
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,730
this to force Xia Yu to lose her life.

406
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,380
I can't

407
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,530
stay out of this.

408
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,780
You went gambling again?

409
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,660
Where is my letter?

410
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,260
Where's your passbook?

411
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,460
What do you need the passbook for?

412
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,100
Where's the thing inside?

413
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,580
I asked you
where you keep your passbook.

414
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,020
You don't care whether I live or die.

415
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,380
You're guarding me like a thief.

416
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,270
Give me your passbook!

417
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,620
Give me the thing inside!

418
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,310
Give me the passbook
and I'll give you the stuff.

419
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,540
What did you store at the train station?

420
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
Boss, one hundred more.

421
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,060
Sir,

422
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,420
you've scraped everything I have here.

423
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,740
How about this?

424
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,980
I'll cash these out

425
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,180
for you first.

426
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,500
The total is 85 yuan.

427
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,380
Sir, there are slot machines in there.

428
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,580
Would you like to try?

429
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,740
Why didn't you watch out?

430
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,940
Look at you.

431
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,820
Why did you fall again?

432
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,900
This side. Be careful.

433
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,020
Come on. Stretch your hand back.

434
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,820
Ye, you're back just in time.

435
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,100
Give Yan a bath.

436
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,260
The kid hasn't even had
his cast removed yet

437
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,300
and he fell down again.

438
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,300
Come on.

439
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,380
Come on, be careful.

440
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,660
Where is Shuhua?

441
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,220
She went out this afternoon.

442
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,580
Go on, go and take a bath with your dad.

443
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,260
I'll get you some clean clothes.

444
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,220
Ye,

445
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,220
the washing machine seems to be broken.

446
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,500
Come and have a look later.

447
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,620
Yan,

448
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:01,900
why were you so careless

449
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,100
and fell down again?

450
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,900
Is there something wrong

451
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,300
with your leg?

452
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,140
Dad,

453
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,900
I'll never

454
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,580
play video games again.

455
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,380
What's wrong with you?

456
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,980
I want to spend all my time

457
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,180
learning Go with you.

458
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,380
Teach me how to play Go.

459
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,620
I want to make up for all the time

460
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,260
I've wasted.

461
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,780
I know all about it.

462
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I won't be able

463
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,690
to stand up later.

464
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,100
I don't have to stand to play Go.

465
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,620
Dad,

466
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,580
I'm ready for it.

467
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,580
Hello, Dr. Lin.

468
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,300
I'm Cui Yangao's parent.

469
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,540
I'm not considering
the option you mentioned.

470
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,540
Money is not an issue.

471
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,220
I want the best.

472
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,660
