(Guoying Restaurant)

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,230
Did you just arrive?

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,150
I just got off the car.

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,070
You're busier than me.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,150
You won, right?

6
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,920
Show me what you won.

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,140
(The 3rd Shining Cup,
Amateur Group, Champion)

8
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,540
The 3rd Shining Cup

9
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,980
amateur group's champion.

10
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,820
30 yuan.

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,620
This thing is worth 30 yuan.

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,860
It's about half a month's salary.

13
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,060
You invited me to a meal.

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,820
I thought you were happy for me.

15
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,500
You're not a child anymore.

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,500
Stop asking Mom for money

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,660
to participate in these.

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,500
I don't want
to join this competition either.

19
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,140
Mom insisted that I go.

20
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,930
You've always done this
since you were young.

21
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,420
You always dissociate yourself
from any responsibility.

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,700
Do you remember the time you drowned
when you were a kid?

23
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,980
You know if you learn to play Go,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,780
Dad will ask me
to work at the factory with him

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,980
and make money to support you.

26
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,620
You want to go,
but you're afraid that I will blame you.

27
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,100
So you just jump into the sea.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,460
I really thought
it had nothing to do with you.

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,260
Now that I recall it,

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,820
everything was actually part of your plan.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,380
To support to learn Go,

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I worked in the factory's
security department for three years.

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,100
Luckily, I didn't give up.

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,540
Now,

35
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,540
I finally got to put on this uniform.

All the numbers are here.

39
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Check them yourself.

40
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,100
Is there a 0983 for this?

41
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,300
(Business consultation)
If it's not there, we don't have it.

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,700
Fine, this one then.

43
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,660
Give me another card.

44
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,660
I'm fine with any number.

45
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,540
This is 100.

46
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,900
I have something to ask you.

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,140
If

48
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,780
I want to check

49
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,420
the messages sent from this phone
through you,

50
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,020
can I do so?

51
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,160
You want to check your wife?

52
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,060
Our system doesn't record it.

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,580
Even if the police couldn't check it.

54
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,500
I know.

55
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,460
Xia Yu.

56
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Listen to me.

57
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,140
I will tell you when I can say it, okay?

58
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,140
I won't lie to you.

59
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,940
I really can't tell you now.

60
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,780
You...

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,300
(Convenience Store)

62
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,100
It tastes awful.

63
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,460
How much is it?

64
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,980
Where were you?

65
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,060
Dinner.

66
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,060
Did something happen?

67
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,060
Calm down.

68
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,060
You performed very well yesterday.

69
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Something unexpected happened.

70
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,100
Take out Qin Xiaoming's phone card

71
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,860
and replace it with this.

72
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,300
(Bring 3 million yuan in cash
for the exchange.)

73
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,620
Something unexpected happened?
Why burn everything then?

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,700
It's useless now. Why take it?

75
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,420
Did the police target you?

76
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,220
The police came
as soon as I hung up yesterday.

77
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,060
The whole park was surrounded.

78
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,900
Park?

79
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,020
What park?

80
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,940
You went to the park?

81
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,700
Did you

82
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,940
go to the park
with the person from that day?

83
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,380
Did you make the call in the park

84
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,140
or in front of her?

85
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,580
You haven't told me

86
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,580
why the police went to the park.

87
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,140
I should have known it long ago.

88
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,980
You're my spoon move,

89
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,980
the worst move on the board.

90
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,220
You've seen my brother.

91
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,740
They tapped Wang Hongyu's phone

92
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,860
and found out
about Qin Xiaoming's phone.

93
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,500
Maybe they followed the phone signal

94
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,500
to locate it or something like that.

95
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,220
This was shown in movies.

96
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,220
If I hadn't gone to the park,

97
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,980
would they have located near this place?

98
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,380
If they located near here,

99
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,300
would we be in danger?

100
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,220
Luckily, I went out.

101
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,740
Right?

102
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Did they find anything in the park?

103
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,540
No.

104
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,060
Xia Yu also knows nothing.

105
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,820
Should we continue?

106
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,660
The game has started.

107
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,380
There's no stopping.

108
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,020
There has to be a win or loss.

109
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,020
How should we continue?

110
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,740
Change your phone card

111
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,100
and send him a message.

112
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,860
Change this

113
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,980
and send it to him.

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,420
We're telling him
that he was being monitored?

115
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,940
Let him know.

116
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,340
(Text Message)

117
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,700
(You're being monitored by the police.)

118
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,500
I don't know how my brother
managed to tap it either.

119
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,140
When I went to Hongyu Group yesterday,

120
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,980
he probably had just been
to Wang Hongyu's office.

121
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,460
Maybe he did it at that time.

122
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,220
It's here.

123
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,980
Save it.

124
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,860
After Wang Hongyu finds out the problem,

125
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,660
he will help us solve it.

126
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,380
Tell him about this.

127
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
I know.

128
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,340
Let that fool do the trading.

129
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,180
By the way,
have you ever set off fireworks?

130
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,940
I've set off firecrackers before.

131
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,820
Take your time.

132
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,620
Mom.

133
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,140
Shuhua.

134
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,860
What happened to your leg?

135
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,420
It's all my fault.

136
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,820
I didn't take good care of him.

137
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,460
It has nothing to do with Ye.

138
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,860
I fell by accident.

139
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,050
Mom.

140
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,900
Look.

141
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,100
I've recovered.

142
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,060
Shuhua.

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,020
Let's go home and have a meal together.

144
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
I'll make you something delicious.

145
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Mom.

146
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,740
There's a new restaurant nearby.

147
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,900
I want to take Yan to try it out.

148
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,260
Alright.

149
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
Get home as soon as you're done.

150
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,100
Go, Yan.

151
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,140
Here. I'll teach you
how to use a knife and fork.

152
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
No.

153
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,300
I learned it from TV.

154
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,020
Do it like this.

155
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,220
How is it? Is it good?

156
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,940
Would you like to eat it often
in the future?

157
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,140
It's too expensive.

158
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,780
This is Western food.

159
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,420
It's expensive to eat here,

160
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,100
but it's not expensive abroad.

161
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,140
I have a chance to work abroad.

162
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
Do you want to go with me?

163
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,060
There are many yummy food and fun things,

164
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,540
and things you've never seen.

165
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,980
It will be very different
from your current life.

166
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Is Dad coming with us?

167
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,740
Isn't it good to have just the two of us?

168
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,940
I'll take care of you.

169
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,900
Mom.

170
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,180
Don't you want to be with Dad anymore?

171
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Why did you get together back then?

172
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,940
I had just graduated from university.

173
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,100
There happened
to be an international Go competition

174
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,900
in the province.

175
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,620
I went to work as a translator.

176
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,780
It was also the first time
I saw your father.

177
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
He only had eyes for Go

178
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,820
and was quite handsome.

179
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,900
Why do you dislike him now?

180
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,340
Because he only had eyes for Go.

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
Dad is different now.

182
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,180
He has changed.

183
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,220
He won't.

184
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,100
Dig in.

185
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,420
Yan and Lin are in the same school.

186
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,100
Yan skipped school for a few days,

187
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,300
and your brother called to ask.

188
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,180
I explained about what's going on.

189
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,380
I was afraid that he would worry.

190
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,380
It's okay if your brother knows.

191
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,060
Tell him

192
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,580
if you have any problems.

193
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,180
Your brother is successful now.

194
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,460
Let him contribute

195
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,300
to family matters whenever he can.

196
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,420
Look.

197
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,300
With Lin's grades,

198
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,260
your brother got her
into Experimental Middle School

199
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,020
(American Ginseng Slices)

200
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,540
Can children eat this ginseng?

201
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,700
He can't do that.

202
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,100
That's what Lin told Yan.

203
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,700
No need to wait.

204
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Shuhua said

205
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,790
she would send him back
after they finished eating.

206
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,300
Look at you two.

207
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,980
You have no big problems,

208
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,860
but you can't get along.

209
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,140
You put the child in the middle
and make him suffer.

210
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,860
I think Shuhua is pretty good.

211
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,060
One year...

212
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,660
Which year was it?

213
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,580
She even asked around to find you a job.

214
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,140
You didn't take the job afterward.

215
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Mom.

216
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,820
It's Shuhua
who thinks I'm not good enough.

217
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,020
She's the one at fault, not me.

218
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,180
There is no right or wrong

219
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,620
in the way a couple live their lives.

220
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,260
How is there no right or wrong?

221
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
(Public Security)

222
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,340
Captain, the manager is here.

223
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,860
- Hello.
- Sorry to bother you.

224
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,700
It's okay.

225
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,700
- Sit down. We're just waiting for you
- Okay.

226
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,980
Sit down too. Sit, relax.

227
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,380
Just treat it as if you're at work.

228
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Check if this voice

229
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,420
is the one you're familiar with.

230
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,900
Okay, play it.

231
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,580
Is the money ready?

232
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,380
I will inform you of the time and place,

233
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,100
but don't send your people.

234
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Hello?

235
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,180
I can't tell.

236
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,260
You can't tell, or it's not him?

237
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,340
I can't tell.

238
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,380
Qin Xiaoming, right?

239
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,420
It doesn't sound like Qin Xiaoming.

240
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,580
Right?

241
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,780
- It doesn't sound like him?
- Yes.

242
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,420
Tell me how it doesn't sound like him.

243
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,380
He usually mumbles

244
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,420
when he speaks.

245
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,660
He gets nervous when he talks to you.

246
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,780
Qin Xiaoming isn't talkative

247
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,700
at work either.

248
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,580
How about I

249
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,460
listen to it one more time?

250
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
Sure, play it again.

251
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,700
Is the money ready?

252
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,580
It doesn't sound like him.

253
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,100
Does he play Go?

254
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,220
I haven't seen him play it.

255
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,540
Have you seen him play Go?

256
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,940
If you can play, he can play too.

257
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,820
Play it again.

258
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,660
Okay.

259
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,020
(Kuanyun Dim Sum Restaurant)

260
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,580
What's going on?

261
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,820
See for yourself.

262
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
That's what's going on.

263
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,500
(Kuanyun Dim Sum Restaurant)
You made such a scene

264
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,820
that I have no customers now.

265
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,460
I'm ordering a few dishes.

266
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,500
Wang Hongyu recently took out
a large sum of money from outside.

267
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Where did he get it from?

268
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
I don't know.

269
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,220
How much did he take out?

270
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,580
I don't know.

271
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,060
I heard it's quite urgent.

272
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,900
You don't want to eat anymore?

273
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,340
My mom asked me to move in with her.

274
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
That's good.

275
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,820
Today, we'll continue

276
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,060
with the rest of Ten Golden Rules.

277
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,740
Think before action.

278
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,300
(Think before action
means avoid hasty moves)

279
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Do you

280
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,300
think what I say

281
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,460
is quite boring?

282
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,380
Playing Go

283
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,060
seems

284
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,700
quite boring.

285
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,940
When I was a kid,

286
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,180
I couldn't focus on learning Go either.

287
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,540
My dad wanted to beat me up every day.

288
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,540
Later, I found Go is interesting.

289
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
It can help you
develop mind-reading skills

290
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
and predict the future.

291
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,220
Liu Yuanda, come on up.

292
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,460
Think of a move,

293
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,100
but don't say it out loud.

294
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,940
Have you decided?

295
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,020
Were you thinking of this move?

296
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,180
Mr. Cui, how did you know?

297
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,980
Amazing.

298
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,820
Liu Yuanda,
you colluded with Mr. Cui, right?

299
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,680
How did you do it?

300
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,300
I didn't collude with Mr. Cui.

301
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,300
You must have colluded with Mr. Cui.

302
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,060
Yes, you must have colluded with him.

303
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,100
- He must have colluded with him.
- Okay. Fang Chengdong, come here.

304
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,140
Come on up.

305
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,300
Think about a move.

306
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
Don't say it.

307
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,220
Have you decided?

308
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,540
Yes.

309
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,900
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

310
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,370
- No more changes?
- No more changes.

311
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,820
Is it here?

312
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,060
Yes.

313
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,260
I told you I didn't collude with Mr. Cui.

314
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,300
Actually,

315
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,780
it's not difficult.

316
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,620
Playing Go eventually becomes

317
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,780
about reading people.

318
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Liu Yuanda.

319
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,500
You're timid.

320
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,020
You have a soft playing style
and dislike confrontation.

321
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,980
You keep thinking
about securing your own position,

322
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,990
while hoping your opponent
doesn't break through.

323
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,380
As for Fang Chengdong,

324
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,820
he's usually a troublemaker,

325
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
always looking for chances
to cause trouble.

326
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,540
He wants to cause trouble everywhere.

327
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,660
You all should learn

328
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,580
my mind-reading skill well.

329
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,180
You'll be like me in the future.

330
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,180
Alright, you two can sit down.

331
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
That's why I said

332
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,100
Go is interesting.

333
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,660
It's complex.

334
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,980
Mr. Cui.

335
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,780
Mr. Cui.

336
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,940
Mr. Wang came to see you.

337
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Mr. Cui.

338
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,220
Sit.

339
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,780
Mr. Wang, have a drink.

340
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,740
Thank you.

341
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
Let's chat.

342
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,900
Mr. Zhang.

343
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,740
Can I speak to Mr. Cui alone?

344
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,740
Sure.

345
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,210
You want to exchange ideas about Go.

346
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,860
Okay, you can chat.

347
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

348
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,020
How are you, Mr. Cui?

349
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm fine.

350
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,500
I just

351
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,020
have high blood pressure.

352
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,740
You came to me last time

353
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,380
to talk about the master class, right?

354
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,660
Come on.

355
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,980
This is

356
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,620
the start-up capital
for our master class.

357
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,900
This is

358
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,180
the list of the first batch of students.

359
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,260
Take a look.

360
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,180
They're very proactive.

361
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,700
There's one more thing.

362
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,380
I also

363
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,660
printed a business card for you.

364
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,740
You decide

365
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,900
when the class starts.

366
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,380
(Cui Ye)
Vice Chairman of City Chess Association?

367
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,540
This... I'm not.

368
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,940
You will be soon.

369
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,140
You need this title

370
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,980
to run a master class like this.

371
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Well... Is this appropriate?

372
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,620
Yes.

373
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,980
Of course.

374
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,100
If you want everyone to know

375
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,060
and if you want this position,

376
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,860
you still have one more move to make.

377
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,420
What move do you think is missing?

378
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,580
Mr. Cui.

379
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,300
Look, this is our first
cooperation after all.

380
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,740
Right?

381
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Doing business

382
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,220
requires mutual trust.

383
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,620
So I think

384
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,140
we need to sort it out first.

385
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
Last time...

386
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,580
What did you want me to do?

387
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,900
It's actually simple.

388
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,500
Help me pass something

389
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,580
to a friend.

390
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,100
It's just that...

391
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,660
Is there anything else?

392
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,780
That's all.

393
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,380
It's that simple.

394
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,780
Think about it.

395
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,260
Why are you here?

396
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,060
Why did he see you again?

397
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,700
I told you.

398
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,860
We're organizing a class.

399
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
You told me yesterday
that he ignored you,

400
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,620
but today he came to see you.

401
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,500
He came to apologize.

402
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Were you stalking me?

403
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,580
I only stalk suspects.

404
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,940
Are you a suspect?

405
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
What do you think?

406
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,580
I'm telling you, stay away from him.

407
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,820
It's for your own good.

408
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,780
What's wrong
with him investing in my classes?

409
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,300
Is it against the law?

410
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,940
If you really want what's best for me,

411
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,620
find investors for me.

412
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,940
What kind of idea is that?

413
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,540
Why can't you just listen to me?

414
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,100
Why can't you stay away from him?

415
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,590
Why should I?

416
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,740
Because I'm your brother.

417
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,220
I'm telling you things you don't learn
from playing Go.

418
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,180
Wang Hongyu has met more people
than the chess you played.

419
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,980
Don't you wonder why he found you?

420
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,300
What freaking cooperation?

421
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,940
What's wrong with me?

422
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,860
He's a wealthy businessman.

423
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,140
Why would he harm me?

424
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,360
With your pathetic appearance,

425
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,100
who else would he harm if not you?

426
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
No, what do you mean?

427
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,220
You just can't stand
seeing me doing well, right?

428
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,260
You just want to see me suffer,

429
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,460
and you'll feel happy.

430
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,380
You keep controlling me and my son.

431
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,300
You act as if
you're the boss of this family.

432
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,380
You're just a lousy police captain.
What's so great about you?

433
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,520
It feels like
we have to listen to everything you say.

434
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,420
Dad really didn't teach you well.

435
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,940
You deserve a beating.

436
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,580
You just found a good wife.

437
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,830
If you didn't marry a good wife,

438
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,100
could you have become a captain?

439
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,660
You're a matrilocal son-in-law.
You're a part of the Qiu family.

440
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,620
Who are you to boss me around?

441
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,660
What about the phone number?

442
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,300
Why is it an invalid number?

443
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,300
13903800893

444
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,980
You said 0983.

445
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,780
0893!

446
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,740
You have such a bad memory.

447
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,900
Police my foot.

448
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
You said 0983!

449
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,980
Mr. Cui, are you not getting off work yet?

450
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,260
I'll stay back for a bit.

451
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,180
I'll go first, Mr. Cui.

452
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,980
Hello?

453
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,380
There are two suitcases
next to your company's front desk.

454
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,900
Put the money in them.

455
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,580
Wait for me to contact you again.

456
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
Okay.

457
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,940
(Mr. Wang)

458
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,940
Mr. Cui.

459
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,200
There are two suitcases

460
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,580
at the security office downstairs.

461
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,540
Take them

462
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,740
and head to Crown Grand Hotel.

463
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,340
Sir, to Crown Grand Hotel.

464
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
Let him take Yushanhu East Road.

465
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,460
After passing by Yushanhu Hotel,

466
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,700
go in at the first intersection.

467
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,820
Okay.

468
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,900
Boss.

469
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,500
Do you have fireworks?

470
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,800
(Baihe General Store)
Yes.

471
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,990
We have some left from Chinese New Year,
but there's not much.

472
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,020
Give me a minute.

473
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,140
Okay, let me take a look.

474
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,420
Go to the train station

475
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,900
and put the suitcases in locker No. 57.

476
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,380
I'll pick them up myself.

477
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,900
Don't play tricks.

478
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,420
Mr. Cui.

479
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,660
Go to the storage room now.

480
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,780
Yes.

481
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,900
Put the suitcases in locker 57.

482
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,100
Okay.

483
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,940
Sir, go to the train station.

484
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,900
(Baihe General Store)

485
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,020
Here, have a look.

486
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
Boss.

487
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,860
Don't you have any big fireworks?

488
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,020
The one that keeps crackling.

489
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,060
(Luggage Storage)

490
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,180
(Luggage storage)

491
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,020
Hello.

492
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,100
Show me your ID.

493
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,900
How did it go?

494
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,990
Boss, we didn't see
anyone picking up the suitcases.

495
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,060
You didn't see anyone?

496
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,110
Yes.

497
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,980
Okay, got it.

498
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Mr. Wang.

499
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,860
You misbehaved.

500
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,700
You'll find out the consequences soon.

501
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,780
Hello?

502
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,180
I'll scare you to death.

503
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,380
What a petty trick.

504
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,320
Go, hurry!

505
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,170
Hurry up.

506
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,340
(Fireworks Are Strictly Forbidden)

507
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,080
Darn it.

508
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,370
Go to hell.

509
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,340
Go!

510
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,620
This is just a warning.

511
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,620
If you misbehaved again,

512
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,700
the situation
won't be so pleasant anymore.

513
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,540
Send him to the sea tomorrow.

514
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,060
We'll do the transaction

515
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,660
on the sea.

516
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,500
I'll give him the person and the ledger
as soon as I get the money.

517
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,900
Keep the cash in the locker tonight.

518
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,180
If you don't move,

519
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,580
I won't move either.

520
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,940
Remember.

521
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,540
Don't play tricks.

522
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,820
I'll be watching

523
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,260
your every move.

524
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,620
Mr. Cui.

525
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,340
You must help me again tomorrow.

526
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,300
And our master class will be finalized.

527
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,580
What do you think?

528
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,220
I have a condition.

529
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,680
Fire Gao Shuhua.

530
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,100
Who?

531
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,000
She's my wife.

532
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,780
Is that so?

533
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,940
Yes.

534
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,380
After the master class starts,

535
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,540
she doesn't have to be
in the public eye anymore.

536
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
Right?

537
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,980
Okay.

538
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,500
I'll take care of it.

539
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,460
It's me.

540
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,500
Here's the thing.

541
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,060
Tell HR

542
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
to give Gao Shuhua

543
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,060
three months' salary.

544
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,120
She doesn't need
to come to work starting tomorrow.

545
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,060
Yes.

546
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,660
Reason?

547
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,060
Make one up for me.

548
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,300
Okay?

549
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,860
Be polite.

550
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,300
This must be the game
we played last time.

551
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,460
This move

552
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,220
cut off my options and saved yourself.

553
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,060
Is that right?

554
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,260
Yes, resurrection.

555
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,660
Mr. Wang.

556
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,300
Do you remember

557
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,020
laughing at me for making a mistake
last time?

558
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,220
What if I put it down here?

559
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,300
Mr. Cui.

560
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,900
Turns out you already planted a bomb.

561
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,020
Mr. Wang.

562
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,500
I just want to tell you

563
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,020
that I can run this master class well.

564
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,980
This bomb is well placed.

565
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
Let's go.

566
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,140
Let's go play ball.

567
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,740
Now?

568
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,300
Yes.
