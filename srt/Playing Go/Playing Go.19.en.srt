=Don't Cry, My Beloved=

3
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,759
Hello.

4
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,439
I'm fine.

5
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,919
I'll wait for you at Mazu Temple.

6
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,319
Let's talk about it when we meet.

7
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,080
What did he say?

8
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,039
He's waiting for us at Mazu Temple.

9
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,199
Can I see the stuff

10
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,560
you hung up?

11
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,879
It's nice.

12
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Pull over.

13
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,199
What's wrong?

14
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,800
I have to pee.

15
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
You can't pee?

16
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
You like that pendant?

17
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,879
Where did you get it?

18
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,839
Did you see that pendant before?

19
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,279
Yes.

20
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,279
I didn't want to tell you

21
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,360
because I was afraid of the trouble.

22
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,519
I kidnapped his son

23
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,639
and wife.

24
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,199
This

25
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,519
is from his son.

26
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,879
This has nothing to do with you.

27
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,480
I've always been unlucky.

28
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,439
I just want to talk to him

29
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,240
to see if we can skip drawing lots.

30
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,990
You don't have to draw lots either.

31
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,639
Let him go.

32
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,319
When I get the money,

33
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,839
I'll send his wife and son back to him.

34
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,319
It's fair for all three of us

35
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,959
to draw lots.

36
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Even if you're picked,

37
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,040
he won't let anything happen to you.

38
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,360
You should trust him.

39
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,079
I only believe in myself.

40
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
Listen to me.

41
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,839
I introduced you to him.

42
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,959
You can't do this.

43
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,759
Where are you keeping them?

44
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,240
Before he knows it,

45
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,319
you let them go.

46
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,639
I won't say anything.

47
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,720
I'll pretend it never happened.

48
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,399
Nice lighter.

49
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,290
Let's go after this cigarette.

50
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
I have to tie you up.

51
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,840
What kind of a person is that?

52
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
He's got no conscience.

Hello.

73
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
Stop urging.

74
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,919
We'll be right there.

75
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,759
Cui Wei,

76
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
come in.

77
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,200
How's your mom?

78
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,559
Is she all right?

79
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,879
My mom had a bit of a shock

80
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,759
and was taken to hospital.

81
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,639
I'm glad she's all right.

82
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,279
Cui Wei,

83
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,080
finish the noodles

84
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,559
and hurry to the hospital.

85
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,879
Stay with your mom.

86
00:15:58,759 --> 00:15:59,759
Besides,

87
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,600
the autopsy report

88
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,200
won't be out soon.

89
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,840
Even without the autopsy report,
I know who it is.

90
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,639
It can only be Qin Xiaoming.

91
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Why was Qin Xiaoming's body

92
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,960
buried next to your dad's grave?

93
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,120
From the beginning of this case to now,

94
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,799
through all these happenings,

95
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,039
we think the most crucial person
is Qin Xiaoming.

96
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,240
But it's not.

97
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,799
He's the one hiding
behind Qin Xiaoming's identity.

98
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Cui Ye.

99
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,320
Who?

100
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,799
My younger brother.

101
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Cui Ye.

102
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,480
It can only be him.

103
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,480
If it's him, then it all makes sense.

104
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,759
Why couldn't we catch the culprit?

105
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,440
Because he knows me well enough.

106
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
It can only be him.

107
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,240
Cui Wei,

108
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,559
do you have any evidence
of his involvement?

109
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,799
I have no evidence.

110
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,799
You should know

111
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,759
that if he's identified as a suspect,

112
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,759
you'll have to recuse yourself.

113
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,960
I know.

114
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,400
I know.

115
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,440
I know.

116
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,960
- Cui Wei.
- I know!

117
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,640
I know it all!

118
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,000
Cui Wei, calm down.

119
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,440
At this point in time,

120
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,880
the more you have
to control your emotions.

121
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,079
Cui Wei,

122
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
listen to me.

123
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,160
You'd better go back

124
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,519
and spend some time with your mom.

125
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,720
Go back.

126
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,680
I know.

127
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,920
I

128
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,119
know it all.

129
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,519
Mom,

130
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,759
have an apple.

131
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,279
I don't have an appetite.

132
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,359
Mom,

133
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,319
you look much better.

134
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,359
Let me see.

135
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,000
Tell your mom to eat it.

136
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,640
You won't even eat the apple
Jiawen peeled for you?

137
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,759
I don't get that treatment at home.

138
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,839
Jiawen,

139
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,039
it's not that I won't eat it.

140
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,079
I really don't have an appetite.

141
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,160
If Mom says no, then no.

142
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
Jiawen,

143
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,079
please get me some water.

144
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,720
Okay.

145
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,279
Wei,

146
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,319
I've been

147
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,559
feeling panicky.

148
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,799
Who do you think

149
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,960
was buried on your dad's grave?

150
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,400
It has nothing to do

151
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,880
with our family, right?

152
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,240
No.

153
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,079
Why don't you

154
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,200
have a banana

155
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,559
or an orange?

156
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,799
You guys...

157
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,599
No matter what happens at home,

158
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,599
you guys always hide it from me.

159
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,079
It's like the family

160
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
is always at peace.

161
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,799
But I...

162
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,039
I just don't get it.

163
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,440
Why was this man

164
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,960
buried on your dad's grave?

165
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,000
The doctor said

166
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
that when we're in shock,

167
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,160
we tend to be paranoid.

168
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,759
Look, it's true.

169
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
Stop thinking about it.

170
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,640
Come on,

171
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,240
lie down.

172
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,480
I'll adjust the bed for you.

173
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,000
Lie down.

174
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,680
Stop adjusting it. It's good.

175
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,559
So that's good?

176
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,720
Is that comfortable?

177
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,440
Where is Ye?

178
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,160
Why didn't he come to see me?

179
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,640
You're thinking about Ye?

180
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,799
Wei,

181
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,799
your dad passed away a long time ago.

182
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,359
For everything

183
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,119
that happened in the family
over the years,

184
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,200
I've always listened to you.

185
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,440
With you around,

186
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
I feel reassured.

187
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,279
I know

188
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,720
when Yan has got this disease,

189
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,519
Ye

190
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,599
must be under a lot of pressure.

191
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,559
You need to help him.

192
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm his older brother

193
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,880
and he's my younger brother.

194
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,279
If you're fine,

195
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,519
nothing matters.

196
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,400
What took you so long?

197
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,559
Where is Xiasheng?

198
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,039
Xiasheng.

199
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,240
He is dead.

200
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,960
He...

201
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,119
He...

202
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,400
How did he die?

203
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,599
How did he die?

204
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,920
How did he die?

205
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,310
Do you believe me
when I say it was an accident?

206
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,359
I kidnapped your wife and son

207
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,400
because I was afraid you'd set me up.

208
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
So I got a bargaining chip.

209
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
But he found out about it.

210
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,200
I didn't want to do anything to him,

211
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,160
but he got hit by a car.

212
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,720
It's a car accident.

213
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
I've memorized the plate number for you.

214
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,599
I saw that he was in pain

215
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,799
so I knocked him on the head.

216
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,940
(Go for the deal)

217
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,920
I guessed right, didn't I?

218
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,319
He told me to trust you.

219
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
Isn't that funny?

220
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,519
In this situation,

221
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,000
we don't need to draw lots.

222
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
Next, you do the deal,

223
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,599
I'll take the money.

224
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,680
When I get all the money,

225
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,559
I'll tell you where
your wife and son are.

226
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,400
I didn't want it to come to this.

227
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,960
What's that you've got there?

228
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,640
Why do you bring so much money?

229
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,200
I think he's very loyal to you.

230
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,920
Bury him.

231
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,279
I picked it out for you.

232
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,160
I bought you breakfast.

233
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,559
Eat it.

234
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,360
Dig in.

235
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,330
Let's do the work after eating.

236
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,840
Your wife and son are still hungry.

237
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,840
I wonder how long they'll last.

238
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,559
I need to call my mom.

239
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,840
What are you trying to do?

240
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,840
You kidnapped my wife and son,

241
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,920
and I am not at home.

242
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
Everyone in the family is gone

243
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,760
without a word.

244
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,559
My mom will call the police.

245
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,920
Put it here.

246
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,039
Turn up the volume.

247
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,599
No one answered the phone.

248
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,639
Please leave a message after the beep.

249
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,000
Mom,

250
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,079
Shuhua

251
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,559
took Yan

252
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
to a friend's house.

253
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,119
I've gone to the province
for a competition.

254
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
I'll be back in a few days.

255
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,480
Yan

256
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,440
has made it to page 38 of his handbook.

257
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,239
Don't mess it up.

258
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,719
The thing under the Tianhou Cup

259
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,440
belongs to my brother.

260
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,000
Tell him

261
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,159
to get it.

262
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,079
What is the Tianhou Cup?

263
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,239
It's a trophy I won in go.

264
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,159
Is that enough?

265
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,480
Dig in

266
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,920
and get to work.

267
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,480
Go to the train station.

268
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,679
Yan.

269
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:32,880
Yan.

270
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,639
Mom.

271
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,440
Yan.

272
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,480
Yan.

273
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,679
Yan.

274
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Yan, are you all right?

275
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,239
Yan.

276
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Yan.

277
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,800
Mom.

278
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,679
What's wrong?

279
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,480
I want to throw up.

280
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,559
Breathe.

281
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,119
Take a deep breath.

282
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,159
Are you feeling better?

283
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,679
Are you feeling better?

284
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,519
Lean over here.

285
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,920
Lean over here.

286
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,440
Anybody there?

287
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,599
Mom!

288
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm fine.

289
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,719
Mom,

290
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,440
what is this place?

291
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,760
Anybody there?

292
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,840
Help!

293
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,840
Anybody there?

294
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,159
Help!
