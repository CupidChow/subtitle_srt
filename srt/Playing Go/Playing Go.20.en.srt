00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,000
Give me three minutes.

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,310
I'll tell you a story.

3
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,620
(Cui Ye)

4
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,310
When the credit cooperatives was robbed,

5
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,560
the robbers didn't initially

6
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,280
plan to escape down
the food serving hallway.

7
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
Someone warned them to do so.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,140
(Cui Ye)

9
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,590
(Hostage)

10
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,590
Cui Ye.

11
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,360
He showed up at the wrong place

12
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,280
at the wrong time.

13
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,750
So he was caught up in this robbery.

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,870
We found this in the security room.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,710
This is the game

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Cui Ye was playing with us.

17
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,280
He planned the robbers' escape.

18
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Later, he deliberately created
the illusion that Qin Xiaoming's

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
rental house caught fire
and left the city.

20
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,490
He's interfering
with the direction of our investigation.

21
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Why?

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,080
To protect a person,

23
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
(Jin Xiasheng)

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,030
Jin Xiasheng.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,910
After the credit cooperatives robbery,

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,600
Cui Ye and Jin Xiasheng,
who survived, got together.

27
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,470
They learned about Qin Xiaoming's special
relationship with Wang Hongyu

28
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,120
and decided to blackmail him.

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,290
That's why he showed up
at Wang Hongyu's office.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,750
He also borrowed Mr. Lin's boat

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,840
as a hideout for Jin Xiasheng.

32
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,880
And the person Du Chunpeng wanted
to deal with

33
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,080
was Cui Ye.

34
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,310
On the day we tailed Du Chunpeng,

35
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Cui Ye was probably
watching our every move

36
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,960
by our side.

37
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,280
He's the one

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,560
who lured us away
with Qin Xiaoming's phone.

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,630
If all these clues

40
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,150
work and make sense

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,080
in this story,

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,280
what does that mean?

43
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,470
Captain,

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
that's ridiculous.

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,310
Why would he do that?

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,240
He may have been held hostage
at the credit cooperatives.

47
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,190
Then, he got in touch with Wang Hongyu

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,590
because of his son,

49
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,680
Cui Yangao.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
You've all met him.

51
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,870
He has a disease

52
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,870
and needs a lot of money for treatment.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,630
Where is he now?

54
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,710
He can't be found.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
My mom told me

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,280
his wife took his son
and left without him.

57
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,080
Cui Ye didn't know.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,630
From what I know of him,

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
he won't leave his wife and son behind.

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,560
That's the end of my story.

61
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,270
It's time for my noodles.

62
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,000
The key to Jin Xiasheng is Xia Yu.

63
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,870
Keep looking for Xia Yu and Xia Haitao.

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,430
As to whether the story
makes sense or not,

65
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,070
we'll have to verify it.

And this.

Where did you find it?

72
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
In the bedroom.

73
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,830
Anything else?

74
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,830
No.

82
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,480
it seems your story is true.

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Where could he have gone?

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
We've looked

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,070
everywhere we can.

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,000

(Office Hours

129
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,270
I've done the math.

130
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
The total amount

131
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,870
on the IOUs is over 23.46 million yuan.

132
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,080
We'll give him a 25% discount.

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,460
It's 5 million yuan
after deducting the remainder.

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Can't we ask for more?

135
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I have learned about it.

136
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,390
In this business,

137
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
the loss rate is

138
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
more than 50%,

139
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
and the remaining 50% is profit.

140
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,240
We make half of his profit.
That's not bad.

141
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,550
So how do we do it?

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
You look at this and that every day.

143
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,480
You're making it mysterious.

144
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll go to Mr. Yi

145
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,870
and give him a day to raise the money.

146
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
I've seen the train schedule.

The front is a passenger carriage,

150
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,790
and the back is a coal carriage.

151
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,550
It'll come through the tunnel

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,270

153
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,000

throw the money down
like I just threw a stone.

155
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,810
You'll enter the platform at 11:20 AM
and get the money from the train.

156
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,270
Once you've got the money

157
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,840
and made sure it's safe,

158
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,080
tell me where you put the stuff

159
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,790
and I'll tell Mr. Yi.

160
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,790
You've thought of everything.

161
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,200
Until they get the stuff,

162
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,440
I'm his hostage.

163
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
It gives you both peace of mind.

164
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,630
How are you going to escape?

165
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,840

166
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,200
Don't worry about me.

167
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,720
As long as you let my wife and son go.

168
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,360
If it goes according
to your original plan,

169
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,870
tell me,

170
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,030
what if I'm

171
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,550
the hostage?

172
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Fine.

173
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,200
But tomorrow,

174
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,120
you'll have to turn up your phone volume

175
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,240
so I can hear you.

176
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,440
Make sure you tell them
the same thing you told me.

177
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,550
Got it?

178
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,910
Let's go.

179
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,150
Did you find out who did it?

180
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,240
I haven't found out who did it yet.

181
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,630
Could it be

182
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,200
someone who owes us money?

183
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,670
Use your brain.

184
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,670
Would they owe money

185
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
if they could do that?

186
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
No matter which idiot did it,

187
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
Uncle Yi,

188
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
I promise you

189
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,030
no one will dare not pay us back.

190
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,440
It's not the IOUs I'm worried about,

191
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,910
it's our account books.

192
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,030
Without these,

193
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,360
who's going to cover us?

194
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,440
Darn it!

195
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,440
If it's really some idiot

196
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,120
who owes money and does this,

197
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,030
it'll be a relief to me.

198
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,200
Uncle Yi, someone's here to see you.

199
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
He said he opened the safe.

200
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
You...

201
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,470
I...

202
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,670
I went to you for a loan before.

203
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,080
Darn you.

204
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,790
You're an odious piece of work.

205
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,590
You've got me in deep trouble.

206
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,030
Enough.

207
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,030
Everyone who comes to me is a friend

208
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,880
or a guest.

209
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,240
Young man,

210
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,880
sit down.

211
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,280
Tell me,

212
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,550
how are you going
to give me my stuff back?

213
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,350
What do you want?

214
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,200
Let's talk.

215
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Captain!

216
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,400
Cause of death

217
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,200
is severe blunt force trauma
to the head.

218
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,310
But the multiple organ injuries

219
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,240
and broken bones

220
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,400
in his body

221
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
suggest that he had suffered

222
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,160
severe impact injuries prior
to the blow.

223
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,560
Look at this.

224
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,110
The livor mortis

225
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,350
are from his death.

226
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,480
They're very uniform.

227
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,750
But it shows

228
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,680
that whoever handled him

229
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,240
was very careful

230
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,200
and didn't drag him too hard.

231
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,400
Otherwise,

232
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
there would have been

233
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,550
a lot of post-mortem bruises
on his body.

234
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,110
From the extent of the wounds

235
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,720
and the angle and strength
of the carvings,

236
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,960
it can be deduced

237
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,200
that he

238
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,750
carved them himself before he died.

239
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,540
(Jin Xiasheng)

240
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,400
I'm pretty sure
that message was meant for me.

241
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,310
My mom said Gao Shuhua
and Cui Yangao left home.

242
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,680
They left home? Where did they go?

243
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,880
He tried to tell me

244
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,750
that Gao Shuhua

245
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,110
and Cui Yangao

246
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,510
have been kidnapped.

247
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,550
He led me to Jin Xiasheng's body.

248
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,590
So what does this 930

249
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,640
on Jin Xiasheng's body mean?

250
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
Why did Jin Xiasheng die?

251
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,030
How did he die?

252
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,830
Could it be that...

253
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,720
It's not Cui Ye.

254
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,640
Cui Ye left me a message
in such a subtle way.

255
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,480
That means
he's probably being controlled.

256
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,160
He's not the murderer.

257
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,070
He probably buried Jin Xiasheng.

258
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,410
If this 930 was carved
by Jin Xiasheng himself

259
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,000
before he died,

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
(Jin Xiasheng)
what message was he trying to convey?

261
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,830
This pendant

262
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,510
was previously wearing by Cui Yangao.

263
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,640
Now, it's back to Jin Xiasheng.

264
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,030
It means Jin Xiasheng

265
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,880
might have found something

266
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,750
and wanted to convey this message

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,590
before he died.

268
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,110
That's what Cui Ye

269
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,510
wants us to know.

270
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,550
So I think it's probably

271
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,580
(Location)

272
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,640
(Gao Shuhua, Cui Yangao)
the information on the location

273
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,000
where the hostages were taken.

274
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,550
930.

275
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,070
The people controlling Cui Ye

276
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,960
kidnapped Gao Shuhua and Cui Yangao

277
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,440
and killed Jin Xiasheng.

278
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,110
Then who is this person?

279
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,680
The point is,

280
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,880
why did he do it?

281
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,580
What's his relationship with Cui Ye?

282
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,590
For money?

283
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,440
Those we found.

284
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,960
They're working together.

285
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
They're committing some kind of crime.

286
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,000
Just like they blackmailed
Wang Hongyu before.

287
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,750
It's possible
there's an internal conflict,

288
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
and Cui Ye is being controlled.

289
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,400
Well, that just means he's still useful.

290
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,550
Who are they targeting?

291
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,510
(Jin Xiasheng)
Whoever it is,

292
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,920
it's clear that Cui Ye is involved.

293
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,680
We can list him as a suspect.

294
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,790
I'm going to have to recuse myself.

295
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,910
Captain,

296
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,310
I've been looking all day

297
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,270
and haven't been able
to find the previous owner.

298
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,070
But an exchange slip

299
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,480
was found at the store.

300
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,830
It was signed by

301
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,000
Liu Qinglong.

302
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,310
I've checked
with several police stations.

303
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,480
Liu Qinglong

304
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
is a private lender.

305
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,440
His background isn't clean.

306
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,160
I checked the store's record
for the item he exchanged.

307
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,440
They've only sold one

308
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,110
of this model before.

309
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,240
This is the delivery address.

310
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,200
It belongs to a man named Yi Fosheng.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,350
We've been checking out Yi Fosheng,

312
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,510
but we've got nothing.

313
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,350
But near his house,

314
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,510
we found a suspicious rented house.

315
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,920
The landlord confirmed

316
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,270
that the tenant is Cui Ye.

317
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,510
By the way, Xia Yu has been found.

318
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,110
Dig in.

319
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,440
It's on me.

320
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,680
Some people are starving.

321
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,030
I don't have an appetite.

322
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,630
Who?

323
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,350
My wife and son.

324
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,720
It's only been a day.

325
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
They won't die of hunger.

326
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,030
They're tied up and can't move.

327
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,240
There's no consumption.

328
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,680
You're different.

329
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,400
You've got work to do tomorrow.

330
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,830
Here's the left leg.

331
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
The left leg is delicious.

332
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,920
Geese sleep on their left legs.

333
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,880
Their left legs

334
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,720
are firm.

335
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,440
You don't like meat?

336
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,640
Have some vegetables.

337
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,920
I said I'm not eating.

338
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,310
Do you feel bad and lose your appetite

339
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,400
when you think of them

340
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,030
or do you feel sorry for them if you eat

341
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,680
when they're hungry?

342
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,750
What are you feeling?

343
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,040
You

344
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,640
are sick.

345
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,440
You're right.

346
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm sick.

347
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,310
That's why I need money.

348
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,270
Let me tell you about me.

349
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,790
I'm from the countryside.

350
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,270
One year,

351
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,960
my parents went to work in the town

352
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,110
and never came back.

353
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,510
When I was 15,

354
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,110
my aunt said,

355
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
"Come on,

356
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,030
I'll take you to them."

357
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,480
So I went with her.

358
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,310
That night,

359
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,750
in town,

360
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,720
she took me out to dinner.

361
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,240
There was a pot set up in the yard.

362
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,680
My aunt pointed to the man
across the street

363
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,920
and said he'd be my dad.

364
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,830
You know what happened next?

365
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,440
He cut off my ear

366
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,590
and broke my arm.

367
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,240
He made me take a few others

368
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,270
with broken arms and legs

369
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,960
to beg for food.

370
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,680
Do you know why my aunt sold me?

371
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,030
Because I'm sick.

372
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,590
She doesn't like me.

373
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Since I was a kid,

374
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,000
I've never understood

375
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,110
what people think.

376
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,720
I don't get

377
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,270
whether people are angry

378
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,350
or happy.

379
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,500
(Jiuxian Restaurant)

380
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,640
Since then,

381
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,000
I've been extra careful every day.

382
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,480
When that guy laughed,

383
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,440
I laughed with him.

384
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,000
When that guy cried,

385
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,550
I cried with him.

386
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,070
But he still hit me.

387
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,960
Until one day,

388
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,880
I brought him money.

389
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,790
I finally realized

390
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,640
I didn't have to read the room.

391
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,160
As long as I had money,

392
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,550
they were happy.

393
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
In this world,

394
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
as long as I'm rich,

395
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,110
I'm not sick.

396
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
You're not a bad guy.

397
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,750
When I get the money,

398
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,480
I'll share it with you.

399
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,480
What are we going to do tomorrow?

400
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,030
We don't have to do anything.

401
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,830
Wait for them to prepare the money.

402
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,480
Why don't you go shopping
with me tomorrow?

403
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,400
Captain.

404
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,350
How is it?

405
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,720
She couldn't accept

406
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,240
Jin Xiasheng's death for a while.

407
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,850
At that time,
she was outside Tailai Hotel.

408
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,480
She fell into a coma during a fight

409
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,720
with Xia Haitao
over the money Jin Xiasheng gave her.

410
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,400
When she woke up, she called the police.

411
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:38,960
She said

412
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,400
she met Cui Ye twice before.

413
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,790
Once at the hotel

414
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
and once at the dock.

415
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,480
This also confirms

416
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,750
that Cui Ye was indeed working
with Jin Xiasheng.

417
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,000
That makes it all make sense.

418
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,790
According to the head of the clinic,

419
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,360
the person who sent Xia Yu in

420
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,740
with Cui Ye and Jin Xiasheng
is called Geng Xingui.

421
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,680
He was a driver
at the emergency department.

422
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,110
We found out

423
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,240
that he worked
in a security center before that.

424
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,830
He quit two days

425
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,410
before the credit cooperatives robbery.

426
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,830
He must be the one
who kidnapped and controlled Cui Ye.

427
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,920
We've applied for a public notice.

428
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,720
Cui Ye has simple social relations.

429
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,200
Jin Xiasheng just got here

430
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,440
and doesn't know anyone.

431
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,270
If Geng Xingui

432
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,310
was involved
in the credit cooperatives robbery,

433
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,400
then it all makes sense.

434
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Captain,

435
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,720
there's one thing I can't figure out.

436
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,750
You mean the message from Cui Ye, right?

437
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,760
Yes.

438
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,110
Why didn't he reveal

439
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,160
any information
about himself or this man

440
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,880
in his message?

441
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,350
When they play Go,

442
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,400
they think through

443
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,440
every move and every possibility.

444
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,550
I guess

445
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,790
he still wants the money.

446
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,720
Cui Ye only left me information
about Shuhua and Yangao.

447
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,030
If we successfully rescue the hostages,

448
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,410
the one who controls him
will have no more bargaining chip.

449
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,480
The money will naturally fall
into his hands.

450
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,790
If we fail to rescue the hostages,

451
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,400
once he gets the money,

452
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,720
he'll be able
to ransom the hostages with it.

453
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,070
He wants us to focus
on rescuing the hostages

454
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,270
and not interfere with his plans.

455
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,960
He wants to win it all.

456
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,590
He'd rather believe in himself

457
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,550
than in us.

458
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,400
If I'm right,

459
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,510
he'll make a deal with Mr. Yi.

460
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,680
I suggest you keep your eyes
on the perimeter of the building.

461
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,160
Make sure that when the time comes,
Cui Ye won't be out of your sight.

462
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,680
Anyway,

463
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,440
why does he think

464
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,920
he can get the money

465
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,550
when he's being controlled?

466
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,920
Since he left me that message,

467
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,880
his plan has been working.

468
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,350
(Enting, Zhucheng, South Lanshui)
I think we're all pawns in his plan,

469
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,310
going step by step according to it.

470
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,750
I don't know what he thinks.

471
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,790
But if he couldn't do it,

472
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,270
he wouldn't have left me that message.

473
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,270
So, should we get watchful now?

474
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,680
I suggest to hold on for a while.

475
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,310
For Cui Ye,

476
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,070
it's best

477
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,350
if he doesn't try to win it all

478
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,750
and cooperate with you

479
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,400
to free the hostages first.
