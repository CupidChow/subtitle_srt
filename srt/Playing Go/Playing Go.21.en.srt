(Provincial Public Security Bureau)

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,780
Cui Wei.

3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,960
Cui Wei,

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,300
Director Deng would like to talk to you.

5
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,750
Come in.

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,300
Director Deng.

7
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,260
Here you are.

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,420
Have a seat.

9
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,340
Comrade Cui Wei,

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,980
let's have a little chat today.

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,260
So I won't get you any water.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,900
It's all right.

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,260
Do you know

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,940
why we have a recusal policy?

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,980
To ensure that the police officers
in the process of law enforcement

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,620
is fair and lawful,
impartial and to uphold justice.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,740
Comrade Cui Wei,

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,820
is the recusal system in place

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,860
to prevent our comrades

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,520
from abusing the law
for personal reasons?

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,100
I believe our comrades will not do that.

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,020
It's actually

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,900
a kind of protection

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,820
in a sense.

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,340
People have feelings.

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,380
No matter how strong

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,980
our comrades' beliefs are,

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,180
when they really face
their friends and family,

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,940
their blood relatives,

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,940
they will be mentally stressed

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,980
and emotionally hurt.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,740
You need to understand this.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,740
Your request for recusal
has been granted.

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,420
You'll be assisting
in the investigation,

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,340
not working on the case.

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,340
Cui Wei,

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,180
you're a good police officer.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,660
I'm not a good brother.

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Being a good brother

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,420
doesn't conflict

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,180
with being a good police officer.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,620
You did the right thing.

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,380
But it's still hard for me to imagine.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,500
Your brother rings a bell.

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,820
He seems honest.

46
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,700
But what kind of man is he?

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,100
I used to think I knew him pretty well.

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,420
I know now

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
that we can never fully
understand someone.

50
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,620
He's very smart

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,660
since he's a kid.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm responsible for what he's become.

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,020
He used

54
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,820
to be so absorbed in his Go game

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,590
that he didn't care
if the world fell apart.

56
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,380
Now that I think about it,

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,380
that home

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,860
was just too strange for him.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,420
He's had a rough time of it.

60
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,460
What else can he do?

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,460
He has to hide in his Go.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,940
He's shut himself in

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,260
and I've added a lock for him.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,420
Cui Wei,

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,980
why did you add that lock for him?

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,940
I have no idea.

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,700
Cui Wei,

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
even though you've requested recusal,

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I think your proposal is a viable one.

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,100
As the suspect's family,

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,950
it's best if you can get him
to turn back.

72
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,700
If you can't,

73
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,710
you can still help us locate him.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,540
(Bole Sound System)

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,020
Pick one for me.

76
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,940
My old one is broken.

77
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,940
I don't know much about it.

78
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,620
Why don't you have one too?

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,100
It's really easy to keep.

80
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,220
If it's hungry and unhappy,

81
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,340
it'll tell you.

82
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,820
If it's full and happy, it'll tell you.

83
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,300
We don't even need to guess.

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,260
It's easier to get along
than to get along with people.

85
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,180
Sir,

86
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,540
you brought a friend?

87
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,020
I remember you.

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,300
Last week, you said
you'd choose one for your son.

89
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,460
Do you remember?

90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,740
Take your pick.

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,220
Pick one for me.

92
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,260
Miss Sun, are you ready?

93
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,660
Captain Cui, I'm a forensic pathologist.

94
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,780
I'm really bad

95
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,100
at dealing with the living.

96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,820
It's normal to be nervous.

97
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,620
Just read what I wrote for you.

98
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,260
Just say it.

99
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,900
It's ready.

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,260
Get ready, guys.

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,420
If you're not afraid of the dead,

102
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,780
why are you afraid

103
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,820
to talk to the living?

104
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,580
I'll try then.

105
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,500
A call from your home.

106
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,540
(Home, Line 1)
Your mom.

107
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,460
(Volume)

108
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,580
Ye,

109
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,660
how's the game going?

110
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,380
It was good.

111
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,860
Where are you?

112
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,940
Are you

113
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,620
with your Go buddies?

114
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,860
Your son is with me.

115
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,100
Don't worry.

116
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,660
Ye,

117
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm fine.

118
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,020
Don't worry about me.

119
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,340
Your brother came over
to help me cook today.

120
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,020
I gave him the stuff.

121
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,020
He wants to talk to you.

122
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,300
Let's talk when I get back.

123
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,420
Ye,

124
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,620
I'm your brother.

125
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
I was going to wait for you to find me.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,780
But I couldn't wait any longer.

127
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,100
Listen to me for a second.

128
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Don't hang up.
I know you don't want to listen to me.

129
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,500
Why do you play Go all day?

130
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,980
The family is in such a state.

131
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,380
Can't you forget about your Go

132
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,660
and think about your family?

133
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,860
Your wife, Shuhua,

134
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,460
and your son, Yangao,

135
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,900
are the most important people to you.

136
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Are they important or is it Go?

137
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,620
Ye, if one day...

138
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,900
I mean, if one day,

139
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,500
they leave you

140
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,580
because of this,

141
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,580
what's the point

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,380
of winning at Go?

143
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,300
Of course you can say
you're doing it for them.

144
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
I understand.

145
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,820
I blame myself too.

146
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
I didn't do enough

147
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,180
for this family.

148
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,460
We need to work together

149
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,220
to make the family better.

150
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,940
That's what we want,

151
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,020
isn't it?

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm begging you.

153
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,140
I beg you to trust me for once, okay?

154
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,260
Wei, I have to hang up now.

155
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,460
Take care of Yan and Shuhua for me.

156
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,780
Your brother's such a chatterbox.

157
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,980
He's nosy.

158
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,100
What is his job?

159
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,580
He works for the neighbourhood council.

If I were Geng Xingui,

164
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,220
I'd kidnap Gao Shuhua and Cui Yangao

165
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,740
to blackmail Cui Ye.

(Map of Lanshui City)

167
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,860
I had to make sure
the hostages were still alive.

168
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,300
I had to keep an eye on Cui Ye.

169
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,660
So I had to put them in a place

170
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,300
where they wouldn't be watched.

171
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,820
Even if they screamed for help,

172
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,500
no one would hear them.

173
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,270
The city would be completely
out of place.

174
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,300
The nearby state and provincial highways

175
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
don't start with 930.

next?

183
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,180
Tell them

184
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,380
to follow the road

185
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,140
west for a kilometer.

186
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,100

192

Why did you pick me?

203
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,660
You're rich

204
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,340
and it's safe.

205
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,980
You won't call the police.

206
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,420
It's a pity

207
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,180
we met in this way.

208
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,340
Tell me,

209
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,020
how did you set me up, step by step?

210
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,660
I've been watching you for a long time.

211

212

If you're not, don't mess it up.

213

I can't sell it

214
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,460
if it's all dirty.

215
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,340

224
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,940
Go to the top of the bridge

into the first coal hopper.

227
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Just drop it.

Drop.

229
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,700

230
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,780

There's a psycho entering the station
with a restricted knife.

253

He's lost an ear.

The train will stop for eight minutes.

270

I'll tell you a joke.

It's so funny, it's cracking me up.

272
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,380
Once upon a time,

273
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,460
there was a frog at the bottom of a well

274
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,060
and then a crow flew over.

275
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,060
The crow took a liking

276
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,580
to the frog in the well.

277
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,580
The crow and the frog saw eye to eye.

The crow

279

You... Listen to the rest of the story.

281
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,980
The crow tried to save it

282
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,460
and added stones

283
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,100
to the well.

284
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,620
When it had leveled the well,

285
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,500
a toad popped out.

286
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,900
Then, the crow asked the toad,

287
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,420
"Have you seen a frog?"

288
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,940

292
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,500
The toad said, "I'm a frog.

293
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,140
It's because of your efforts

294

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,620
My mouth is all right.

377
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,340
We need to save the power.

378
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,540
Yan,

379
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,780
get some sleep first.

380
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,100
Mom, stop biting.

381
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,700
I'm fine.

382
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,220
It's about to open.

383
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,260
Mom, I'm fine.

384
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,140
Anybody there?

385
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,340
Anybody there?

386
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,700
The key.

387
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,740
The key.

388
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
Mom.

389
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,940
It was on the 303
that the credit cooperative robbers

390
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,060
had their accident after they got away.

391
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,260
Where were they headed?

392
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,500
Were they headed
to their pre-prepared hideout?

393
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,820
If that's the case,

394
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,460
it's possible that Geng Xingui
knows about this place.

395
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,610
Zhou,

396
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,660
I need you to find out

397
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,260
if there are any more tunnels
on Highway 303 heading out of town.

398
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,220
Highway 303.

399
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,540
Let me think about it.

400
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,380
When I was a driver's assistant,
I went to an abandoned tunnel.

401
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,940
I think it's in this direction.

402
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,500
Well, let me check it out.

403
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,260
Okay, I'll wait for your call.
