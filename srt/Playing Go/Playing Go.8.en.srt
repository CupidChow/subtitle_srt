3
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,180
I told you.

4
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,180
If there's a chance
things could go south,

5
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,460
even if that chance
is just 0.0001 percent,

6
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,740
it will definitely happen.

7
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,100
If you had found him earlier,

8
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,510
would it have been this much trouble?

9
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,500
Just do what I said.

10
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,540
Get it done, fast.

11
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,700
Whatever you do,

12
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,340
I'll be...

13
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,380
watching you.

14
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,780
How does that feel?

15
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,900
Does it hit the spot?

16
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,220
I'm telling you,

17
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,500
I can already picture his face.

18
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,420
That's why

19
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
I'm not some useless move of yours.

20
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm your killing move.

21
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,020
Killing move?

22
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,780
Where'd you even hear that?

23
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,980
Found it online.

24
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,900
Killing move is a term from Chinese chess.

25
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,700
In Go, it's called tesuji.

26
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,980
How do you write tesuji?

27
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,860
Tomorrow,

28
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,180
make that call.

29
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,300
Make sure he tells me

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,780
to set out from South Bay Pier.

31
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,020
Your dock is right here.

32
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Pick me up at this spot.

33
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,020
Remember,

34
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,340
we can't mess this up.

35
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,220
Relax.

36
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,700
It all depends on tomorrow.

37
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,060
Are you sure the cops
won't be a problem?

38
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,500
Don't worry.

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,900
They're all watching Wang Hongyu.

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,380
He can handle them.

41
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,980
If you're this sharp,

42
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,140
then your brother
can't be any less capable.

43
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,660
But what if...

44
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,340
You know your brother.

45
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
Everything's part of your plan.

46
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,980
It'll be fine.

47
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,900
Just do your part,
and nothing will go wrong.

48
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,140
(Suspect Wang Hongyu's activity log)

49
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,100
(Played ping pong with Du Chunpeng)

50
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,740
Wang Hongyu is acting completely normal.

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,780
Absolutely normal.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,300
No calls either.

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,340
He just kept playing.

54
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,020
Not a single useful lead here.

55
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,660
He withdrew a ton of cash.

56
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
He's helping Qin Xiaoming flee,

57
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
or Qin Xiaoming is blackmailing him.

58
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
There's no way
it'd be this quiet right now.

59
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Another three-hour ping pong session.

60
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
Who was he playing with?

61
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,620
Du Chunpeng.

62
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,020
The guy you asked me to look into.

63
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,100
He used to be a blasting
team captain at the mine.

64
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,460
He quit two years ago.

65
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,940
Du Chunpeng played for three hours?

66
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,500
I thought his back was bad.

67
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,740
He didn't play the whole time.

68
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,740
He just fed balls to Wang Hongyu.

69
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,660
Wang Hongyu met him at a sensitive time.

70
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,060
That alone is suspicious.

71
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,980
Something is definitely off with him.

72
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,140
Call Zhou at Hongmao Rentals.

73
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,380
Ask him about this plate number.

74
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Keep watching them.

75
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,980
(Uncle. Danger.)

76
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
(Meet me at South Bay Pier.)

77
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,580
Captain, Du Chunpeng just walked out.

78
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,980
Zhou said

79
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,300
that the car isn't one of theirs.

80
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,420
It's a cloned plate.

81
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,820
How much cash do you think
could fit in a case that big?

82
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,580
Hello. Go ahead.

83
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,300
Help me calculate how much cash
two suitcases can hold.

84
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,620
How big are the suitcases?

85
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,140
Got it.

86
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,050
Captain.

87
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,180
Three million.

88
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,140
You can't do the math yourself?

89
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,580
Can't even do basic calculations?

90
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,940
Ma's family must be loaded.

91
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,660
Follow them.

92
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,580
Hello.

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,740
Fifty-seven.

94
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,940
Please show your ID.

95
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,420
Sir, take me to South Bay Pier.

96
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,500
Zhou.

97
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,780
I need another favor.

98
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,900
Can you reach out
to the driver at the train station?

99
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,060
I need him to find me a car.

100
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,180
Yes, the one with the fake plate.

101
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,300
Mr. Wang explained
everything to you, right?

102
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
Yes, he did.

103
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,580
He told me to drop off the suitcases

104
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,820
and bring someone back.

105
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,540
The notebook is the key.

106
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,700
Right.

107
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,900
The notebook.

108
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
We're too close.

109
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,300
Stay out of sight.

110
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,140
Got it.

111
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,460
(Swap to Qin Xiaoming's SIM)

112
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
(Wipe the phone and leave the dock)

113
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,300
(Dial 114 and discard the phone)

114
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,220
(Send text message)

115
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,420
(Xiasheng)

116
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,100
(Sending message. Confirm?)

117
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,420
Why did you have to
make the knot so tight?

118
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
(Why?)

119
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,900
Just do as I say.

120
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,380
My son is in a rebellious phase.

121
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
He won't listen to me.

122
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,620
Get closer.

123
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,580
Hello?

124
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,580
Uncle?

125
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,980
This Xiaolingtong has weak signal.

126
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,220
I can't hear you clearly.

127
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,980
Alright.

128
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,100
I'll bring it over now.

129
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,500
- Five hundred per unit.
- Five hundred?

130
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,100
This is daylight robbery.

131
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,620
(Convenience Store)

132
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Talk to me.

133
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,590
Captain.

134
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Qin Xiaoming's phone is active again.

135
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,380
He dialed 114,

136
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,620
but hung up quickly.

137
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,380
Then, he made another call right after.

138
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,620
We're tracking it now.

139
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,500
It's near the fishing boat dock.

140
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,100
Still on the move.

141
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,260
Who did he call?

142
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,290
We haven't found out yet.

143
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,660
Find it.

144
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
Let me know once you do.

145
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,100
Qin Xiaoming is moving around

146
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,620
near the fishing boat dock.

147
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,980
Captain, he's really close to us.

148
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,460
Who should we follow?

149
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
Stop the car.

150
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,980
(For Rent)
Keep going.

151
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,820
Got it.

152
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
Speed up.

153
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,540
Hello?

154
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Where is he now?

155
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,510
He's about to reach
Longxing Seafood Market.

156
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,850
How long has he been on the call?

157
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,740
Five minutes so far.

158
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,680
He's still on the move.

159
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Then, he's probably not Qin Xiaoming.

160
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,140
Qin Xiaoming never stays
on the phone this long.

161
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,060
Hello, Uncle.

162
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,340
I've been super lucky
these past few days.

163
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,340
Just days ago,

164
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,340
I sold two yellow croakers
for a thousand bucks.

165
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,980
Business is booming!

166
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,140
Remember that crappy
Xiaolingtong I told you about?

167
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,220
Its signal was trash.

168
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
But guess what?

169
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,340
I found a Nokia on the ground.

170
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,100
Call Ding right now.

171
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,740
Step on it.

172
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,820
Faster.

173
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,860
I've been driving since
the old yellow cab days.

174
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,220
Never had a single accident
in all these years.

175
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,740
Do you know why?

176
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,550
Because I don't speed.

177
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,460
- You hear me?
- I'm a police.

178
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm on duty.

179
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,460
I need your full cooperation.

180
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,460
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

181
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,020
You drive.

182
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,300
Go straight to the end of this road.

183
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,860
- Is that South Bay Pier?
- Yes.

184
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,340
It's South Bay Pier at the very end.

185
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,300
But you'll need to go around a big loop.

186
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,140
You'll pay for the damage.

187
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,300
My car!

188
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,140
It's busted!

189
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,060
Can you even drive this thing?

190
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,340
It's not that different from a car.

191
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,900
Ignition.

192
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,900
Throttle.

193
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,060
Steering.

194
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,100
Do we have enough fuel to get back?

195
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Don't worry.

196
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,180
Once you leave the port, head south.

197
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,380
Find the notebook
and pick up the person.

198
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,340
Use this phone

199
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,980
to call Mr. Wang.

200
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,540
Don't use it before you finish the job.

201
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,820
(Unlocking)

202
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,380
(Don't even think about
stealing that suitcase.)

203
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,580
(I'm nearby, watching you.)

204
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,060
(Try anything funny and you can
forget about staying in Lanshui City.)

205
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,780
Over here!

206
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,220
(Line 1)

207
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,340
(Du Chunpeng)

208
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,420
(Outgoing call)

209
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,260
(Calling Du Chunpeng)

210
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,500
(Wang Hongyu)

211
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,380
(Three days later)

212
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,140
(The police arrested the wrong people!)
Let our people go!

213
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,380
- Let them go!
- Let them go!

214
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,550
You think the police can just
arrest whoever they want?

215
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,420
It's been days!

216
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,900
You owe us an explanation!

217
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,580
Yeah! We need a proper explanation!

218
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,660
Folks!

219
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,380
I already explained this to you.

220
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,580
We don't want your explanation!

221
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Give me back my husband!

222
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,100
My nephew was just
delivering fish and you took him!

223
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,140
If we did the same to you,

224
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,460
would you hear us out?

225
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,100
- Right?
- Yeah, exactly!

226
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,660
Calm down, everyone.

227
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,140
Let's talk this out.

228
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,660
Officer, you'd better sort this quickly.

229
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
If this blows up,
it won't be good for anyone.

230
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,700
You better give us an answer.

231
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,220
If not, we're not leaving.

232
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,990
- We're not going anywhere.
- Yes. We're staying.

233
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,940
Let them go!

234
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,940
The police must follow protocols.

235
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,140
If you keep this up,

236
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,540
you're obstructing law enforcement.

237
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,380
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,980
Are you bullying us
because we're fishermen?

239
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,460
- Yeah!
- If you love arresting people,

240
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,590
why don't you lock us up too?

241
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,140
It's getting lively in here.

242
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,380
Arrest us if you dare!

243
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,760
Is this a Chinese New Year celebration?

244
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,380
Why don't you stay for a few days?

245
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,140
Sorry, officer.

246
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,380
They're not well educated.

247
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,660
Please don't take it personally.

248
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
Are you in charge here?

249
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,660
The village committee?

250
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,780
I'm the deputy director
of the fish market.

251
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,700
Are you planning to keep
making a scene with them,

252
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,900
or are you taking them away?

253
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,380
Of course I'll take them away.

254
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,300
Please sign here.

255
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,060
Let's go, people.

256
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,820
- Time to go.
- Let's go.

257
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,420
Move along.

258
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,620
Let's go.

259
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,540
This way.

260
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,360
Alright.

261
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,460
Hurry up.

262
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,620
Sorry about that.

263
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,460
Captain.

264
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,380
I think we should
lock them up for a few days.

265
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,620
They're gone.

266
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,300
Did you find Du Chunpeng?

267
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,540
Not yet.

268
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,620
We searched the area he went to.

269
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,940
During a door-to-door check,

270
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,660
we found one place completely abandoned.

271
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,500
We found a small amount
of materials used to make explosives.

272
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,260
Were those two cases full of explosives?

273
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,860
What did the tech department say?

274
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,940
There's nothing on Qin Xiaoming's phone.

275
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,340
But they did lift
a few overlapping fingerprints.

276
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
Restoration is underway.

277
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,500
But, it's proving pretty tough.

278
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,540
Is it possible that

279
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Qin Xiaoming blackmailed Wang Hongyu,

280
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,780
and Wang Hongyu
had Du Chunpeng blow him up?

281
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,100
Then, Du Chunpeng took off out of guilt?

282
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Didn't the coast guard report
an explosion at sea?

283
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,340
I heard the blast too.

284
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,140
Du Chunpeng realized
he was being followed.

285
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,940
He had someone use Qin Xiaoming's phone

286
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,100
to throw us off.

287
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,420
Then, who made the call?

288
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,020
Wang Hongyu.

289
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,900
Weren't you watching
Wang Hongyu the whole time?

290
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,420
Even if someone from his crew
made the call,

291
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,620
where did they get
Qin Xiaoming's phone?

292
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,860
Captain, I figured it out.

293
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,060
It was Qin Xiaoming and Wang Hongyu

294
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,780
who planned to blow up Du Chunpeng.

295
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
The case is solved.

296
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,780
But why did they want
to kill Du Chunpeng?

297
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,700
Du Chunpeng was carrying
two cases of explosives.

298
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,900
Did he blow himself up?

299
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,020
That doesn't add up.

300
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,220
(Interrogation Record)

301
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,420
That fish seller said

302
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,140
he stopped at the fishing boat dock.

303
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,200
He bought some cigarettes.

304
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,340
What if during that moment,

305
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,900
Qin Xiaoming's phone

306
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
was planted in his car?

307
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,420
If that's the case,

308
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,340
then the suspect's hideout

309
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,860
might be nearby.

310
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,260
We should check
around the fishing boat dock tomorrow.

311
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,580
What do you think?

312
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,400
A sound plan.

313
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
Yes.

314
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,140
Do you want me to drive?

315
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,860
I'll drive.

316
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,820
Leave it to me.

317
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
Let's go.

318
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,860
That red boat over there.

319
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,620
No one has touched it in years.

320
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,620
A few nights ago,
someone saw lights on it.

321
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,860
Who was on the boat?
Did they get a good look?

322
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
No.

323
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,260
Whose boat is it?

324
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,420
Look into it.

325
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,420
Please come with me.

326
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,140
Call in the tech department.

327
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,700
Yes, sir.

328
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,660
Captain.

329
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,660
We found something.

330
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,900
(Lin Zongyao)
This guy.

331
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Mr. Lin?

332
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,100
Mr. Lin?

333
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,180
Mr. Lin, don't you remember me?

334
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,860
Do you remember Cui Weimin?

335
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,340
I'm his son.

336
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,940
That kid who was lousy at Go.

337
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,660
Mr. Lin.

338
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,540
Did you lend your boat to someone?

339
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,940
I don't go into the sea anymore.

340
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,020
Mr. Lin.

341
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,060
I'm a cop now.

342
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,580
I'm chasing down scoundrels.

343
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,980
This is really important.

344
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,940
Who exactly did you lend the boat to?

345
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,420
Please try to remember.

346
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,180
Think hard.

347
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,820
Big yellow croaker.

348
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,180
Who's that?

349
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,980
Big yellow croaker is tasty.

350
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,140
Hello?

351
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,340
You've got a sharp instinct, kid.

352
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,340
Someone just reported
Wang Hongyu for smuggling.

353
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,660
And they handed over
a full set of evidence.

354
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
The anti-smuggling unit

355
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,780
just searched his smuggling warehouse.

356
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,790
And they are

357
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,420
bringing him in shortly.

358
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,100
Alright, got it.

359
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,990
Let's head back to the station first.

360
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,140
Mr. Lin.

361
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm heading off now.

362
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,620
I'll come visit again when I can.

363
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,260
(The day of the explosion at sea)

364
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,140
Why did you make me
throw away my phone?

365
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,540
Aren't you taking the money?

366
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,900
Don't move.

367
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,940
Don't get off.

368
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
What's going on?

369
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,500
Watch closely.

370
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,420
Grab the rudder.

371
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,820
Move the boat forward a bit.

372
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,220
Alright, stop.

373
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,460
Stop.

374
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,740
Are you nuts?

375
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,020
Why did you blow up the money?

376
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,940
Wang Hongyu planted
explosives on that boat.

377
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,100
He planned to blow us up with it.

378
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,580
How did you know
there were explosives in the cases?

379
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,780
Weren't they locked?

380
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,660
(Remember the night you saved me?)

381
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,500
(I woke up on
Wang Hongyu's smuggling boat.)

382
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,060
(I saw boxes full of explosives.)

383
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,500
(That's when an idea
started forming in my head.)

384
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,060
(Bit by bit, it became clear.)

385
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,260
(I was going to play a game at sea.)

386
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,420
(A game against Wang Hongyu.)

387
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,020
(Lanshui 058 Storage)
Just like that, we got the money.

388
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,580
Buddy, I still don't get it.

389
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,780
How did you pull this off?

390
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,220
Remember what I told you before?

391
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,100
Know the game, know the player.

392
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,060
Wang Hongyu would never
let Qin Xiaoming go.

393
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,540
And he'd never spare

394
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,300
anyone who used his secret
to threaten him.

395
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,580
He only cares about his own plan,

396
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,380
and he never sees
what others were thinking.

397
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,340
(The reason why)

398
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,340
(I chose to do it at sea in the end)

399
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,060
(was to force Wang Hongyu)

400
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,740
(to take a desperate risk.)

401
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,540
(That whole game I set for him)

402
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,220
(was a message.)

403
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,500
(I kept reminding him)

404
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,700
(the explosives are in place.)

405
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,780
(Judging by his personality,)

406
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,860
(once the situation turns dangerous,)

407
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,940
(he always tries to win in one blow.)

408
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,380
(And the sea was
the perfect place for that.)

409
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,060
But what he didn't expect

410
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
was that from the start,

411
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,700
I had prepared four suitcases.

412
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
How much is this?

413
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,180
Three hundred.
How many do you want?

414
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,540
Fill these two cases for me.

415
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,380
Such a filial son.

416
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
This one's a gift.

417
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,980
US dollars.
They work all over the world.

418
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,940
That way the old folks can travel too.

419
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,740
(I got the key for
locker no.57 in advance,)

420
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,140
(and stored the two boxes
of joss money inside).

421
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,780
(Then, I took the two empty cases)

422
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
(and left them
at the Hongyu Group front desk.)

423
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,740
(Hongyu Group)
(He used those to pack real cash.)

424
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,100
(On the day of the first drop,)

425
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,860
(I put the real money
into locker no. 58.)

426
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,020
(But I showed his guys
the number tag for locker no. 57.)

427
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,100
(During the second drop,)

428
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,340
(I took out the joss money cases
from locker no. 57.)

429
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,220
(The real money was
still in locker no. 58.)

430
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,660
(I had a feeling)

431
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,180
(they'd try to swap the cases)

432
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,340
(with one filled with explosives)

433
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,580
(before I got on the boat.)

434
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,220
(They wanted to take the money,)

435
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,900
(then take us out too.)

436
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,660
(Every step of the plan)

437
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,340
(I made him think)

438
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,900
(he was gaining something)

439
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,980
(and had it all in the bag.)

440
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,180
That's why

441
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,260
he lost everything in the end.

442
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,500
Those two boxes of joss money
sat at the station for a whole day.

443
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,180
Weren't you afraid they would realize

444
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,780
the money had already been swapped out?

445
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,900
No.

446
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Because...

447
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,940
you were watching him the whole time.

448
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,020
What if he rats you out
once he's jailed?

449
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,740
With all the dirty things he's done,

450
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,500
telling on me won't help him.

451
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,980
Wow, that's brilliant.

452
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,220
Of course.

453
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,060
Maybe I should learn how to play Go too.

454
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,580
You're not cut out for it.

455
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,980
Fair enough.

456
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,900
Me?

457
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm only good enough
to be your killer move.

458
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
No.

459
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,980
Your tesuji.

460
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,380
I still have one question.

461
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,060
If he'd agreed to your master class
in the beginning

462
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,660
and never tried to kill you,

463
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,220
would you still go after him?
