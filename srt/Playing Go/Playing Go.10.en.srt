to all my colleagues.)

Captain.

8
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,870
Over there.

9
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,190
I should have come out earlier.

10
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,870
When I got out,
the fire was still burning.

11
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,180
(Move Only When the Time Is Right)

12
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,630
That's all for today's class.

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,470
Class dismissed.

14
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,600
- Let's go.
- Fang Chengdong.

15
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
- Come on, let's go.
- Hurry up!

16
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,670
Bye-bye.

17
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,270
- Class dismissed.
- Hello, Mr. Zhang.

18
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,110
Hello, sir.

19
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,640
- Class is over.
- Hello, Mr. Zhang.

20
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,510
Alright.

21
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,510
Mr. Zhang.

22
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,510
Mr. Cui.

23
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,430
Good news.

24
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,950
I've already found a place.

25
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,070
Go see if it works for you.

26
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,580
Alright.

27
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
I'll wait outside.

28
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,780
Don't take too long.

29
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,940
Chen Xiaoguang, why are you still here?

30
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,660
Mr. Cui.

31
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,100
Are you really not going
to teach us anymore?

32
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,820
Who told you that?

33
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
If you want to learn,

34
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,860
I'll always be here to teach you.

35
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,380
Once the master class starts,

36
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
I'll take you there.

37
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,780
- Sound good?
- Okay.

38
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,460
Alright, head on home now.

39
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,860
Goodbye, Mr. Cui.

40
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,900
What do you think of this place?

41
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,140
Isn't it beautiful?

42
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,940
Far from the noise of the world,

43
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,300
basked in the charm of nature.

44
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,980
Totally worthy of a master.

45
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,500
This place

46
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,180
is quite nice.

47
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,580
Alright.

48
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,500
Let's go with it.

49
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Great.

50
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,980
That's all I needed to hear.

51
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,420
I'll go negotiate the deal.

52
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,020
I'll get it.

53
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,020
I should get going.

54
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
Hello?

55
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,660
What?

56
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,860
Why are you still here?

57
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,140
I want to bring my brother home.

58
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,700
Can you help me?

59
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,780
Your brother?

60
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,660
What do you mean?

61
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,540
His ashes are still at the funeral home.

62
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,220
I thought about it all night.

63
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,700
I can't go back alone.

64
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,220
How would I explain it to my dad?

65
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,020
How did you find out about all this?

66
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,140
The radio.

67
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,380
There was a show on yesterday.

68
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,060
A cop mentioned it.

69
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,220
What show was it?

70
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,580
Listen to me.

71
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,980
Tell your dad

72
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,780
you and your brother

73
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
got separated.

74
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,180
You had no idea where he went.

75
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,340
Think about it.

76
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,980
If you really brought him back,

77
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,730
how would you explain it to your dad?

78
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,520
That he fell to his death?
Died from illness?

79
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,140
You'd only break his heart.

80
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,380
But, I can't let my brother die
without a proper burial.

81
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I don't want him to become a lost soul.

82
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,140
Don't you think
it's strange this radio show

83
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,340
aired that story?

84
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,500
Maybe that cop arranged it

85
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,020
to lure you out.

86
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,180
So, I need your help.

87
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,220
How am I supposed to help?

88
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,540
You'll think of something.

89
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,980
You always do, don't you?

90
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,340
Alright.

91
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,500
Cui Ye.

92
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,260
You're not going to help me?

93
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,900
Fine. I'll go on my own.

94
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,660
I have to bring my brother home.

95
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,020
Go back for now.

96
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,220
Don't go anywhere.

97
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,020
If you trust me, wait for me to find you.

98
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,780
Figure out what to tell your dad.

99
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
Hello?

100
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,860
I'd like to ask something.

101
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,980
Do you have the contact number
for that city radio show?

102
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,380
I heard you had a police officer
on the show yesterday.

103
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,940
It was a really good episode.

104
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,300
But, I didn't catch the whole thing.

105
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,500
Will there be a replay?

106
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,700
What time?

107
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:32,100
(Lanshui City Funeral Home)

108
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,820
(IC Card Phone)

109
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Uncle.

110
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
It's me, Xiasheng.

111
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,380
Well...

112
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,620
I just called home but no one picked up.

113
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Where's my dad?

114
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,380
What's wrong?

115
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,060
What happened?

116
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,340
I...

117
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,100
I just lost my dad.

118
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,740
Brother...

119
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,540
I brought my brother home.

120
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,900
Stop crying.

121
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,860
Stop crying.

122
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,420
Stop crying. That's not ashes.

123
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,060
Open it and take a good look.

124
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,300
That's not ashes.

125
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,300
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,060
Why?

127
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,860
Why did you lie to me?

128
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm sorry.

129
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
The police are watching everything.

130
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,620
I can't show up.

131
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,660
If this turns out

132
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,460
to be a trap,

133
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,460
then I'm done for if I show up.

134
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,820
If they catch me,

135
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,420
even if I say nothing,

136
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,540
they'll still find you.

137
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,700
And then, it's game over for you too.

138
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,940
So what?

139
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,900
I have nothing left anyway.

140
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,740
Get up.

141
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,900
Your brother gave his life for yours.

142
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,460
You want to get caught that badly?

143
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,060
Go ahead and get caught then.

144
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,900
Might as well call the police yourself.

145
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,260
Turn yourself in.

146
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,620
What do you mean
he gave his life for mine?

147
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,620
They were going to pick you.

148
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,780
You brother went in instead.

149
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,180
Think about it.

150
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,660
You haven't lost everything.

151
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,780
Then, what do I still have?

152
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,260
You have money.

153
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,820
You have plenty of time.

154
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,740
You have a second chance.

155
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,420
Seriously?

156
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,780
Despair

157
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,980
is what my son went through.

158
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,540
No one could cure him.

159
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,580
He just suffered until the end.

160
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,620
Do you see the difference?

161
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,220
We should

162
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
live for the people who care about us.

163
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,060
They're already gone.

164
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,620
Then, live on for the dead!

165
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,460
Have you thought it through?

166
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,580
I want to be alone for a while.

167
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,220
I'm fine.

168
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,780
Go home and start over.

169
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,500
You have a long road ahead.

170
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,660
Dad.

171
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,580
When is Mom coming home?

172
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,260
Soon.

173
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,740
What happened to your face?

174
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,820
It's nothing.

175
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,220
I just bumped into something.

176
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,020
Today, we're honored
to have a special guest with us.

177
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,540
Detective Cui Wei from
the city's Criminal Police Division.

178
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,460
It's Captain Cui.

179
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,500
Yan.

180
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,540
Did you tell Lin she was going

181
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,220
to the Experimental Middle School?

182
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,660
What exactly did she tell you?

183
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,220
Tell me about it.

184
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,980
She said she doesn't want
to go to Experimental Middle School.

185
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,380
But Uncle and Aunt contacted someone

186
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,740
and insisted she go.

187
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,060
(Many of our listeners)

188
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,180
(have shared valuable feedback with us.)

189
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,900
(I would like to thank all of you.)

190
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,340
(Your support helps us
keep getting better.)

191
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,420
(After the music, we will bring you)

192
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,900
("Big Things in a Small Town.")

193
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,260
(For the citizens of this city,)

194
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,060
(no issue is ever too small.)

195
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
Hello, everyone.

196
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,940
I am the host

197
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,580
who care about your issues
like they are my own, Le.

198
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,900
As always on our show,

199
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,660
we are ready to take calls
from our enthusiastic listeners

200
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,860
and help solve problems
you face in life.

201
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,420
(Lanshui City Radio)

202
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,780
The signal light in front of me
is already on.

203
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,420
Let us listen

204
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,540
to what this caller is dealing with.

205
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,620
Hello, caller.

206
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,860
I think

207
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,060
your radio station
is being very irresponsible.

208
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,540
Yesterday,

209
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,140
your show "Life On the Line"

210
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,540
invited someone from
the city police department,

211
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,220
Captain Cui Wei of
the Criminal Police Division.

212
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,260
How could you let someone like that
be on your show?

213
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,140
He is two-faced.

214
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,540
He talks like a decent person on air,

215
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,860
but off air, he abuses his power.

216
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,260
He used his power to get
his child into an elite school.

217
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,300
That means other students

218
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,620
will lose their rightful

219
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,860
school spots.

220
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,860
This is despicable.

221
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,820
You need to investigate him.

222
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,140
Alright, caller.

223
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,740
We have noted what you reported.

224
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,900
Captain.

225
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,940
Captain.

226
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,290
The cigarettes and liquor we found
outside the funeral home.

227
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,500
The tech team said

228
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,300
the fingerprints matched one set
from Qin Xiaoming's phone.

229
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,980
We traced the origin
based on the labels on the items.

230
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,700
Both came from Dantong, Liaojiang.

231
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,140
(Miner)

232
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,100
Dantong...

233
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,220
Check if there are any mines in Dantong.

234
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,620
Any kind of mine will do.

235
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,380
There are quite a few.

236
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
More than ten.

237
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,620
Look into any
that have been restructured.

238
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,300
In the past few years, four mines
have gone through restructuring.

239
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,900
Only one of them still requires

240
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,300
underground operations.

241
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,160
Dongfeng Coal Mine.

242
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,660
One year ago, they changed ownership.

243
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,140
It went from a collective-owned entity
to a private business.

244
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,580
See for yourself.

245
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,620
A student's parent

246
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,980
reported you through that radio station.

247
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,900
They said you abused your power

248
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,620
to pull strings
for your child's education.

249
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,860
You abused your power

250
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
for personal gain.

251
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,460
This has tarnished our reputation.

252
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,060
Be honest with me.

253
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,780
Is it true or not?

254
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,300
It is not happening anymore.

255
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,740
Not happening anymore?

256
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,500
So you actually attempted it?

257
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,100
You are the captain of the Criminal Police,

258
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,700
how could you make
such a rookie mistake?

259
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,820
Chief Wang called me last night.

260
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,340
We had a long talk

261
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,980
about how to handle this matter.

262
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
In my opinion,

263
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,940
you should take

264
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,700
a short break for now.

265
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,780
Once we get everything cleared up,

266
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,060
you'll get an explanation.

267
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,820
You cannot pull me off now.

268
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,100
Cui Wei, this is about discipline.

269
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,420
No one is allowed
to work while under investigation.

270
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,300
You know that.

271
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,620
I just found a new lead.

272
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,020
We could crack the case,
and you want to sideline me?

273
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,780
Do not waste any time dealing with me.

274
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,940
I'll accept my punishment.

275
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,140
I can write a self-criticism.

276
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,620
But, do not pull me off now.

277
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,900
Stop right there.

278
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,820
So, you do know
this is a critical time for the case.

279
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,540
And you just had to

280
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,180
mess it all up now!

281
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,780
You think we want this?

282
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,340
You think this is what we hoped for?

283
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,820
Your father-in-law...

284
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,300
Enough.

285
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,300
Not another word.

286
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,500
This decision was made

287
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,260
by the party committee of the bureau.

288
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,780
It must be enforced.

289
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,700
Captain, what happened?

290
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,580
Where are you going?

291
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,580
Window shopping.

292
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
Mr. Cui.

293
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,380
Someone brought you a Go board.

294
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,180
(Your son is sick.)

295
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,500
(This might help.)

296
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,220
(He got it for me when I was a kid.)

297
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,660
(He said if I carried it,)

298
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,820
(I would be safe from harm.)

299
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,020
(It could heal anything.)

300
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,740
Keep it.

301
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:31,860
(May your son be safe,
from Handkerchief)

302
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,180
How much longer?

303
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,020
My shift is ending.

304
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,340
Just a bit longer, sir.

305
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,900
Almost there.

306
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,340
Is this all?

307
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,860
Let's go. Get in the car.

308
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,100
Mom's back!

309
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,740
Mom!

310
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,340
Mom!

311
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,980
Look at my new fish tank!

312
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,580
Dad just bought it for me.

313
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,580
Shuhua, welcome back.

314
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,740
Mom.

315
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,460
Shuhua just got back.

316
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,860
How can you make her
go straight into the kitchen?

317
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,700
Mom.

318
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,380
Come here.

319
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,740
Seriously?

320
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
Mom.

321
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,340
Look.

322
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,140
So many fish!

323
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,380
Dad bought them all for me.

324
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,780
I told you he has changed.

325
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,380
Mom...

326
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,700
You'd better

327
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,980
cherish her.

328
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,220
Shuhua is a wonderful person.

329
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,020
Mom.

330
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,460
I think Shuhua's cooking tastes amazing.

331
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,260
She has always been a great cook.

332
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,700
No, I should go help her.

333
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,140
Hungry?

334
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,620
It'll take a while
until the food is ready.

335
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,540
Mom got you some snacks.

336
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
I wasn't hungry until you mentioned it.

337
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,500
Wash your hands first.

338
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,940
Go wash up. Come on.

339
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
Be careful.

340
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,660
Want some cake?

341
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,420
Feeling hungry?

342
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,300
- Come on, then.
- Yan.

343
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Are you happy?

344
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,660
If you want anything, just tell Mom.

345
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,420
Dad.

346
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,700
You came.

347
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,700
Zhao told me everything.

348
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,420
Jiawen brought me

349
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
up to speed.

350
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,660
I'll go whip up a few dishes.

351
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,140
- Stay for lunch.
- Let Jiawen do it.

352
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,500
I'll do it.

353
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,060
You did  the right thing.

354
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,380
Jiawen wasn't careful enough.

355
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,340
Let this be a wake-up call for her.

356
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,500
I've already spoken to her about it.

357
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,740
But that being said...

358
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,660
Listen,

359
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,420
you're on the front line.

360
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,660
You and everyone around you

361
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,900
are under the spotlight
regardless of what you do.

362
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,980
There's no way around that.

363
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,940
So,

364
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,380
don't rush anything.

365
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,660
You can trust Zhao's judgment.

366
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,340
I know.

367
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,900
Jiawen is totally

368
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,340
bad at cooking.

369
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,660
I'd better go help her in the kitchen.

370
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,580
I have some free time anyway.

371
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,700
Feel free to watch some TV.

372
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
Wei.

373
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,020
I told him

374
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,140
we wouldn't do it anymore.

375
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,500
I didn't think it'd get this ugly.

376
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,820
This necklace isn't as exquisite.

377
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,420
But, it suits you better.

378
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,820
It looks good.

379
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,020
I'll get it.

380
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,340
Who is it?

381
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,740
I'll go take a look.

382
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Coming.

383
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
Ye.

384
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,620
Jiawen, where's my brother?

385
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,420
I texted him, but he didn't reply.

386
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,860
You heard about Wang Hongyu, right?

387
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,300
Yeah.

388
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,420
I heard

389
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,180
that someone

390
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
snitched on you on the radio yesterday.

391
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,260
How did you know?

392
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,580
Someone at work told me.

393
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,780
It didn't affect your work, did it?

394
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,580
Why did you come here anyway?

395
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,020
Wei.

396
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,300
You said this before.

397
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,700
Life would pull me back eventually.

398
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,420
Did you know Yan fractured a bone?

399
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,660
And that's not all.

400
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,940
It is ALS.

401
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,980
What did you say?

402
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,620
What is ALS?

403
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,860
The doctor said there is no cure for it.

404
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,260
It might affect him
for the rest of his life.

405
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,540
At first, I felt like my world collapsed.

406
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,180
But, I've been thinking lately.

407
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,860
I have to face it.

408
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,140
Wait, where did you even read that?

409
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,060
Who says it is incurable?

410
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,740
Did you take him to Guangzhou?

411
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,220
If not, go to Beijing then.

412
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,420
Do not worry about the money.

413
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,100
I did not come to borrow money.

414
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,460
I wanted to tell you something.

415
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,220
You know what?

416
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Sometimes,

417
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,420
hardship in life is not all bad.

418
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,020
It might push you forward.

419
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,940
It might motivate you.

420
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,660
In just one night,

421
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,020
it could change how you see life.

422
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,900
Do not worry about Yan.

423
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,380
I will take him and Shuhua

424
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,540
to Hong Kong, China.

425
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,820
Oh right.

426
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,860
Shuhua is back.

427
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,100
You were right back then.

428
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,940
Go shouldn't be my whole world.

429
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,780
My Go masterclass starts tomorrow.

430
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,620
You have to come.

431
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,660
(Jingwei Go Master Academy
Opening Ceremony)

432
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,220
Then, let us welcome Mr. Cui

433
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,860
to give the opening speech.

434
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,700
Great.

435
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,700
Come on, hurry.

436
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,940
Have you seen my brother?

437
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,460
I just saw him a moment ago.

438
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,900
Give the speech.

439
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,300
Everyone's waiting for you.

440
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,180
Come on.

441
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,300
This is the script I wrote for you.

442
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,540
Just read from it.

443
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,460
Quick, over here.

444
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,260
Why are you only just getting here?

445
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,380
Are we late?

446
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,440
Not really.
The speech hasn't started yet.

447
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,180
Grandma, where's Yangao?

448
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,470
Inside. Go on.

449
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,420
There's food and drinks.

450
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,260
Mom.

451
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
Go on.

452
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,300
Wei, listen to your brother's speech.

453
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,620
He's still talking.

454
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
This game of Go...

455
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,860
See? Your brother
is doing well now, right?

456
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,740
If your dad could see this,

457
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,340
he would be so proud.

458
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,900
If Dad could see this,

459
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,980
he'd be so proud.

460
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,700
Comrade Cui Yangao.

461
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,580
Captain Cui.

462
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,260
Give us a report.

463
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,220
How's your leg injury healing?

464
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,620
Reporting, Captain Cui.

465
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,380
My leg is fine now.

466
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,740
Keep it up.

467
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,940
Thank you, Captain Cui.

468
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,820
Go have some fun.

469
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,780
Let's go.

470
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,380
Hold your brother steady.

471
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,220
Be careful.

472
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,100
Mr. Cui.

473
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,260
This class of yours is really something.

474
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,380
I have good connections
with the City Go Association.

475
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,180
Ye is here.

476
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,260
Should the opportunity come,

477
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,620
I'll recommend you.

478
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,460
Over there,

479
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,500
the position of the Vice Chairman

480
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,940
is still open.

481
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,620
It's a great opportunity.

482
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,900
Of course it is.

483
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,380
See you in a bit, Mr. Cui.

484
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,460
Mr. Zhang!

485
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,580
Long time no see.

486
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,860
How's Lin doing lately?

487
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,100
It's her math.

488
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,980
She just can't seem to

489
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,300
get it. Her grades are terrible.

490
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
Jiawen.

491
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,900
Have something to eat.

492
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,980
Come, let's grab some water.

493
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Were you late?

494
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,740
How did you manage to start this class?

495
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,860
With support from city officials.

496
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,540
When are you guys leaving?

497
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,940
In the next few days.

498
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,660
The password is Yangao's birthday.

499
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,580
It's from my wife.

500
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,660
Look at this master class of mine.

501
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,660
Like I said, I have...

502
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,180
Come on, let's take a family photo.

503
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,860
Sure.

504
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,180
Gather around.

505
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,540
- Mr. Cui and everyone, over here.
- Yan.

506
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,580
Let's take a family photo.

507
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,360
- Yan, come on.
- Let's use this background.

508
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,220
- Cui Wei.
- Coming.

509
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,140
Lin, over here.

510
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,340
Wei, you're not getting in the photo?

511
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,100
- Hurry up.
- Captain Cui, give us a smile.

512
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,060
One, two, three.

513
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,380
- Wishing you a great opening.
- Got it.

514
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,900
Very nice.

515
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,980
Come on, take a look.

516
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,380
Looks great.

517
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,830
- It looks great.
- Not bad, right?

518
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,340
Thanks.

519
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,580
Mom, let's take one more.

520
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,540
- Sure.
- Take one of me and my mom.

521
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,420
Alright.

522
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,420
Slow down, Yangao.

523
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,620
One, two, three.

524
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Hey, let's get a table
and play a few rounds.

525
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,220
Sounds good.

526
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,260
Let's go.

527
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,360
Play something to kill time.

528
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,040
But the three of us
don't make a full set.

529
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,900
Didn't we have another bunkmate above?

530
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,980
Hey, top bunk buddy, come down and play.

531
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,940
Hey, top bunk.

532
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,300
Since he got on yesterday,

533
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,940
he hasn't said a single word.

534
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,580
Forget it.

535
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,420
The three of us can play something else.

536
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,340
