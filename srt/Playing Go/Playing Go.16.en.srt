(Welcome to Tailai Grand Hotel)

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,140
Here is the check-in information.

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,260
This is the duty manager.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,100
Hi.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,020
What does it mean?

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,820
My brother knows about her now.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,500
I just went to see him.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,620
He's on a mission.

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,180
I saw the direction of his car.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,700
He's heading for the hotel
where you guys stayed last time.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,940
Does this person ring a bell?

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,620
Her?

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,140
She checked into a room here.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,340
At night, she got into a fight

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,940
with a guy for some reason.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,140
She went out after him.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,020
After a while, an ambulance came.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,220
So I guess something

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,380
must have happened to her.

26
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,900
Check with the ambulance.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,300
- Yes.
- You called an ambulance

28
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:18,620
at the hotel.

29
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,700
He'll soon trace the hospital

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,980
and find Xia Yu.

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,340
Let's go out and talk.

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,500
Quick.

33
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,540
What are you doing?

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,660
Boss.

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Do you remember the man's
physical description?

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,540
I didn't get a good look.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,900
Can you show me the CCTV footage?

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,020
It's not on.

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,020
It's just a deterrent.

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,860
What about the room?

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,180
It hasn't been checked out yet,

42
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,300
and we haven't cleaned it.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,340
Show me.

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,300
No way.

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,540
I can't do this.

46
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,740
She must be moved away.

47
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,380
She's still in a coma.

48
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,180
Even if your brother finds her,

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,380
it's fine.

50
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,530
What if...

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,020
What if Xia Yu wakes up?

52
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,826
You and I will be done for.

53
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,300
You'll never see her again.

54
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,020
That guy...

55
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:13,740
What's his name again?

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Give him a call.

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,620
I think she's the only one
who checked in.

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,340
The person you're talking about

59
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,700
shared a room with her, right?

60
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,300
We have too many guests here.

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,460
I can't remember.

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,460
You should think about changing your job.

For my sake,

157
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,060
he only charged 1,000 yuan more.

Well,

159
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,060
he doesn't usually accept

160
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
your friend's case.

161
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980

165
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,180
Yes.

166
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,700
So there's an extra charge
of 1,000 yuan.

167
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,060
For the 5,000 yuan,

168
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,980
it's because I used
the emergency department's van.

169
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,580
They won't let me drive it out.

170

171
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,460
I'll have to find another job.

172
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380

184
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,900
to end the game?

186
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,060
why don't we just forget about it?

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,620
Here, in case she...

190
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,100
Xia Yu is like this now,

191
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,900
what should you do
if you don't have money?

192
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,620
You said we needed one more person.

193
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,260
Him.

- Captain.

Our opponent

198
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,900
didn't sleep well yesterday either.

199
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,900
It's so close.

200
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Just half a step.

201
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,820
Half a step and he's ahead of us.

202
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,780
I didn't ask for your opinion.

204
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,820
So far,

205
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,020
I've got

206
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,340
a good feeling about this case.

207
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Stand up, everyone.

208
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,780
Move your body.

209
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,220
Move your body.

210
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,300
Shake your body.

211
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,420
Move it.

212
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,100
Raise your hands higher. Touch...

213
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,500
Touch the ceiling.

214
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes, yawn.

215
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,260
Look at me.

216
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,500
Laugh. Be happy.

217
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,140
(This man)
Laugh harder.

218
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,340
Here. Open your mouth wide.

219
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
Lift it up. Look, so beautiful.

220
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,100
Laugh, come on.

221
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,340
Laugh it up, guys.

222
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,300
Give this laugh to our opponent.

223

(This man is very close to us)

224
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,860
(News Room)
According to the reporter's report,

225
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,860
the day before yesterday, a worker

226
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,500
of Yueshi Textile Factory
in the city fell to her death.

227
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,620
The victim was a middle-aged woman,
Ms. Li.

228
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,620
It's learned that Yueshi Textile Factory
is on the verge of closure

229
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,900
due to the production accident

230
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,060
caused by Ms. Li's work mistakes.

231
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,420
Ms. Li repeatedly attempted suicide

232
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,540
and were stopped,

233
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,380
and ultimately in the fall
into a tragic accident.

234
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,100
- She can't commit suicide, anyway.
- Here's the image our reporter

235
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,580
- How can her family stand it?
- captured at the crime scene.

236
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,100
Ye.

237
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,460
Ye.

238
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,860
Why is there less money in the cabinet?

239
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,620
What's wrong?

240
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,380
Isn't that money for Yan's treatment?

241
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,340
Send Yan to school first.

242
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,580
What have you been up to?

243
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,540
You came home late again last night.

244
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,860
Why haven't you left yet?

245
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,620
Yan is going to be late.

246
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,540
We're leaving now.

247
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,060
We're talking

248
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,100
about Yan's birthday celebration.

249
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
It's on the day after tomorrow.

250
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,660
Okay.

251
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,020
I'll let you decide what to do

252
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,860
for Yan's birthday.

253
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,700
Send him to school now.

254
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,780
Don't be late.

255
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,260
Mr. Zhang.

256
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,060
Mr. Cui, you're here.

257
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
You're just in time.

258
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,380
Take a look. How's it?

259
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,250
Not bad, right?

260
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,380
The bosses love it.

261
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,380
They want a tea room

262
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,580
where they can burn incense
and drink tea.

263
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,380
Where do the students learn to play go?

264
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,380
No more go classes.

265
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,860
Something's happened
to Chen Xiaoguang's family.

266
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
He won't be coming.

267
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,420
He has to take care of his dad.

268
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,460
What a pity.

269
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,420
You didn't know?

270
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
Chen Xiaoguang's mom

271
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
committed suicide.

272
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,340
It was all over the news this morning.

273
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,940
I heard

274
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
her factory closed down

275
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
and she went into street prostitution.

276
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,420
Someone gave her 30 yuan,

277
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,660
she couldn't think straight

278
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,860
and jumped off the building.

279
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,020
When she jumped, she was shouting about

280
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,500
30 yuan.

281
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,340
Mr Cui, I suggest

282
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,260
you can stop coming here if you're busy.

283
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,540
This is just a platform.

284
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,620
Once it's set up,
it'll operate on its own.

285
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,420
As you said,

286
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,260
those who come here
don't really want to learn go.

287
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,140
Mr. Cui.

288
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,860
Mr. Cui.

289
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,260
Where does he live?

290
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Mr. Cui.

291
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,100
Dad, Mr. Cui is here.

292
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,820
Dad, wake up.

293
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,500
Mr. Cui is here to visit us.

294
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,300
Mr. Cui.

295
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,540
Ye.

296
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,900
Did you read what I gave you?

297
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,740
Yes.

298
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,700
I didn't think

299
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,100
I'd learn a skill doing this.

300
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,100
This safe

301
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,420
(Repair Manual for Dunquan Safe)
uses a dial-type

302
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,100
mechanical combination lock.

303
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,820
All we need to do is

304
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,940
set the password ourselves

305
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,260
and cut a slot

306
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,580
in the corresponding position

307
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,620
to open the locking latch.

308
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,900
It means

309
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,660
no matter what code is set,

310
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,060
we can open it with the key.

311
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,260
It's actually quite simple.

312
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,180
That's good.

313
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,540
How's Xia Yu

314
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,180
doing?

315
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,500
As usual.

316
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,100
But I think she's going to wake up.

317
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,220
Don't worry.

318
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,340
When we get the money,

319
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
we'll send her to Hong Kong, China.

320
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,140
The hospital I took my son to

321
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
is good.

322
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,340
Let's go together.

323
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,180
I'll introduce the doctor to you.

324
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,420
Thanks, Ye.

325
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,220
I've bought the safe shop.

326
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,580
I even bargained the price.

327
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,660
The voice is recorded too.

328
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,740
Listen to it.

329
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,900
It's very convincing.

330
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Where's the sales book?

331
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,620
(Liu Qinglong)

332
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,340
Call this number.

333
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,940
Just read what it says.

334
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,660
Dear valued customer,

335
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,140
hello.

336
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,180
Here is Dunquan Safe Exclusive Store.

337
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,700
Due to some product quality issues,

338
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,020
we provide you
with free replacement service.

339
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,860
We are very sorry

340
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
to bring you...

341
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,220
He hung up the phone.

342
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,180
It's okay.

343
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,180
That's enough.

344
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,370
It's done.

345
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,470
Yan,

346
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,420
did you feed the fish?

347
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,700
Not yet.

348
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,620
Why did you come back so late?

349
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,060
My class ended late.

350
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,660
I asked Mr. Zhang.

351
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,260
He said you left a long time ago.

352
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
I went to pick out
Yan's birthday present.

353
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,100
It went well.

354
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,860
One more time,

355
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,940
and they will probably take action.

356
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,860
It's up to you then.

357
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,820
She's my wife.

358
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,860
She's my wife.

359
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,140
Shuhua.

360
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,660
Shuhua, it's me.

361
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,420
Shuhua, it's me. You... It's all right.

362
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
- Don't touch me.
- Shuhua, it's me.

363
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,050
Come and give me a hand.

364
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,780
Shuhua, don't be like this.

365
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,180
Shuhua, don't be like this.

366
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Shuhua, it's me.

367
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,860
Shuhua, don't scream.

368
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,940
Don't scream. It's me.

369
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,580
Shuhua, it's me. Don't scream.

370
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,020
What are you doing with that?

371
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,860
We don't need it.

372
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,860
He works with his brain.

373
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,340
I've had a bad brain since I was a kid.

374
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,060
You should have more walnuts.

375
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,340
How long have you been

376
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,420
working with him?

377
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,860
A while.

378
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,420
Did you make any money?

379
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,340
How did you split the money?

380
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,820
Half each.

381
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,100
He gave you half?

382
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,620
He's a pretty honest guy.

383
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,140
He's a good man.

384
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,060
He wouldn't be doing this

385
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,620
if it wasn't for his son.

386
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,020
What about you?

387
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,020
What do you do this for?

388
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,540
For that woman?

389
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,060
No.

390
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,780
For my dream.

391
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,140
Why are you laughing?

392
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,020
I was just feeling better.

393
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm doing all this

394
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,620
to cure Yan.

395
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,620
I don't want any compromise plan.

396
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,220
I want to give him the best treatment.

397
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,900
Cui Ye,

398
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,740
can you tell me the truth

399
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,340
about what you're doing?

400
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,580
I was just about to get beaten to death.

401
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,500
Don't ask me what I'm doing.

402
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,020
I can only tell you

403
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
that I have no choice

404
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,780
but to do all this.

405
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,940
I have no choice,

406
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,220
you have no choice,

407
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,700
no one has a choice.

408
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,100
Did you get all the money at home

409
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,180
by the way you made it
when you had no other choice?

410
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,420
The story about Wang Hongyu
and the master class

411
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
are all fake,

412
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,260
right?

413
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,060
Wang Hongyu gave me the money

414
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,660
because I know his dirty work.

415
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,580
I thought the money

416
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,340
would be enough
to pay for Yan's treatment.

417
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,940
I oversimplified things.

418
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Shuhua,

419
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,580
believe me, I'm not a bad person.

420
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,580
I'm doing this for you,

421
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,780
for Yan,

422
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,260
for our family.

423
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,100
You're too horrible.

424
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,980
You're too horrible.

425
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,620
You haven't told me the truth so far.

426
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,900
Cui Ye,

427
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,380
you'll ruin our family.

428
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,580
I'm going to tell your brother
about this.

429
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,420
Shuhua.

430
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,860
Shuhua, listen to me.

431
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,340
Just pretend you don't know anything,

432
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,900
that nothing happened.

433
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,220
- Shuhua.
- What are you doing?

434
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,620
You're the one who's going
to ruin our family.

435
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,940
Listen to me.

436
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,590
Shuhua,

437
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,680
listen to me. You...

438
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,740
What are you doing?

439
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,060
Think carefully.

440
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,100
Without this money,

441
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,500
Yan would be paralyzed for life.

442
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,180
Just let me finish this one.

443
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,580
One last time.

444
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,260
By then,

445
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,180
if you want a divorce,

446
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,180
tell my brother,

447
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,980
report me,

448
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,340
I'll accept it all.

449
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,340
I'll accept it all.

450
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,340
Shuhua.

451
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,060
Yan's birthday is tomorrow.

452
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,980
Believe me.

453
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,220
By this time next year,

454
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,740
everything will be fine.

455
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,460
Believe me.

456
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,860
If my brother

457
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
comes tomorrow,

458
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,900
you...
