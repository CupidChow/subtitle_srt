what should I do?

57
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Why?

58
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,760
Have you gotten a bit too proud

59
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,240
after winning the championship?

60
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Don't forget.

61
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,480
Even though you won,

62
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,700
it's only at the amateur level.

63
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
I can't believe you.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
It's not that.

65
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,880
His level is not up to it.

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
Yeah, you're good enough

67
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,520

got it?

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,120
But we had a deal.

I want to show it to my son.

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
I can't give it to you.

80
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,640

81

The prize money is for the school.

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,640
It's for the collective honor.

what time is your father arriving?

- Captain Cui.
- Hello, Ms. Zhao,

it's me again.

94
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,330
What did he do this time?

95
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,080
Didn't you say
your dad would definitely come today?

96
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,680

97
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,000
you trouble.

98
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,560
I want to have a good talk

99
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
with his dad.

100
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
You can talk to me,

No.

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
So, why did you fight?

106

107
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
But I didn't feel like it.

108
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
So he scolded me.

109
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,680
Well, it's wrong of him to scold you.

110
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
But you're also wrong for hitting him.

111
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,400
So,

112
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
what should I do

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,960
if he scolds me
when I don't want to play Go?

114
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600

115

What if he hits me?

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,160
Well,

117
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,480
that's different.

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,160

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
Yan?

188
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,520
Criminal investigation methods
and technologies.

189
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
Just like the fraud case
in the province,

190
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,480
can you guess how it was solved?

191
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Madam,

192
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,440
Captain is dragging it out again.

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
It's not that.

194
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,000
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

195
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
We have signed off

196
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,980
on this technology.

197
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,750
It will arrive at the team later
this afternoon.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,350
It's parked right here in the yard now.

199
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,200
Captain Cui,

200
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,240
did they reward you with it

201
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,640
because you've done a great job?

202
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
That's right.

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,560
You're incredible.

204
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,560
Captain, show it to me.

205
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,040
Mr. Cui.

206
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
Mr. Cui.

207
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,320
Dad.

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
- Hello, Uncle.
- You're here.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
Why are you so late?

210
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
You're back.

211
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
Have you eaten?

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,000
Come.

213
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,280
The food is a little cold now.

214
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
I've already eaten.

215
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,360
I won the provincial tournament.

216
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
It's a celebration banquet arranged
by the school.

217
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,480
It's a learning machine.

218
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,680
Who is that?

219
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,640
Are you for real?

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,320
The earth could explode,

221
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
and you would still be indifferent.

222
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
This is Jackie Chan.

223
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,480
A pun used to wish for success,
am I right?

224
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,560
Captain Cui, you didn't finish talking
about that new technology.

225
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,360
Are you really that curious?

226
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
Then you'll have to study hard.

227
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,750
When you get
into the Public Security University,

228
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,480
you'll understand.

229
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,880
Yan was in trouble at school today.

230
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,520
He said he couldn't reach you.

231
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,570
So I had to go again.

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
What happened?

233
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
He didn't like to play Go.

234
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,000
Why do you have to force him?

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,090
The more you push him,
the more rebellious he gets.

236
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
Lin recently joined a tutoring class.

237
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,840
She has been improving.

238
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,120
I'll ask Jiawen to talk to the teacher.

239
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,680
You should send Yangao there too.

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
He's doing quite well.

241
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
He's doing well?

242
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,960
Do you know

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,760
he's at the bottom of his class?

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,600
He's the only male heir in the family.

245
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,300
He must be successful in the future.

246
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,760
If you care so much,

247
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,080
you can always have another child.

248
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Are you really that dense?

249
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,560
He has potential.

250
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,760
If he doesn't learn now,
it'll be too late.

251
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,240
He's already at the bottom of the class.

252
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,920
Why did you buy him that game console?

253
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,940
It's a learning device.

254
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Mom,

255
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,760
let him cycle home.

256
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
I'll send you guys home.

257
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,560
It's okay. Just listen to him.

258
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,280
Besides, it's already late.

259
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,960
You should send Lin home soon.

260
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
Captain Cui,

261
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,240
the technology you mentioned earlier,

262
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
is it the wiretap command vehicle?

263
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,610
Whatever the bad guys say on the phone,

264
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,560
it's all clear through the wiretap?

265
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,640
How did you know that?

266
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
I saw it in the movies.

267
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,600
I wondered why one was missing.

268
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
Yan, hop on.

269
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,200
If you're free,

270
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,520
stop watching all those useless things.

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,040
- Mom, let's go.
- Mom,

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,200
I have to report back
to the team tomorrow.

273
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,960
So I won't go to the grave today.
I've already bought everything.

274
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,880
Okay, work is important.

275
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
We're going now.

276
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,680
He has excuses every year.

277
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,840
As if he ever visited at all.

278
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,740
(Subor)

279
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,620
(Works Everywhere)

280
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,560
Grandpa,

281
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
here's some money.

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,720
Cui, your money is here.

283
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,720
Yan, pay respect to your grandfather.

284
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
Grandma, I'm going to play over there
for a while.

285
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,880
Okay, go ahead.

286
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,140
(Tomb of Beloved Father Cui Weimin
and Mother Lu Qiuping)

287
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,880
Ye,

288
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,680
don't blame your brother.

289
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
Why would I?

290
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
A Captain

291
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,440
wouldn't visit the grave in person.

292
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,120
Don't say that.

293
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,840
He really is busy with work.

294
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,960
If his wife's father passes away,
let's see if he shows up.

295
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,680
The money for offerings is quite big.

296
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,800
He's more successful than I am

297
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,680
so he thinks he should control me.

298
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,800
(Tomb of Beloved Father Cui Weimin
and Mother Lu Qiuping)

299
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,120
Listen to what you're saying.

300
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
He's your brother.

301
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,040
When he wants to control me or my son,

302
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
that's when he remembers
he's my brother.

303
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,400
Grandma!

304
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,120
Yan!

305
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,340
(Orthopedics Department)
These minor fractures

306
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,360
weren't caused recently.

307
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,760
Does he often fall?

308
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,240
Look at this one right here.

309
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,200
Multiple fractures in the right tibia.

310
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,080
We'll need to wait for the swelling
to go down

311
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,910
before performing surgery
to insert surgical pins.

312
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,160
It's that serious?

313
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,800
Will it affect the child later?

314
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,400
If the recovery goes well,

315
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
the impact won't be significant.

316
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,480
How much will the surgery cost?

317
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
It mainly depends on the surgical pins.

318
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
Domestic ones are over 6,000 yuan,

319
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,110
while imported ones cost 30,000 yuan.

320
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,840
Yan is asleep.

321
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,440
What did the doctor say?

322
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,360
It's just a fracture.

323
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
A few days in the hospital

324
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,040
and a minor surgery, and he'll be fine.

325
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
A surgery?

326
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
That serious?

327
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
It's not serious.

328
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll go and take care

329
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,560
of the admission process.

330
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,320
Excuse me, can I make a call?

331
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,130
- Okay.
- Thank you.

332
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,880
Mom, what are you doing?

333
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
We need your brother here.

334
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,670
Why would you call him here?

335
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,520
Something huge like this happened,

336
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,960
we must tell him.

337
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,200
That's my son, not his.

338
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,080
I don't need him to meddle.

339
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,540
(Please verify your transaction records
before leaving the counter.)

340
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,080
How much will the surgery cost?

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,720
It mainly depends on the surgical pins.

342
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,400
Domestic ones are over 6,000 yuan,

343
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,700
while imported ones cost 30,000 yuan.

344
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,880
I'll stay with him
at the hospital tonight.

345
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,520
You need to work tomorrow.

346
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,720
By the way,

347
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,200
don't let Shuhua know

348
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
about Yan's injury.

349
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,040
You two haven't really decided on
your divorce yet.

350
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
If she finds out Yan is hurt,

351
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,680
she'll say we didn't take care
of the child properly.

352
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,560
Then she'll take Yan away again.

353
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
I need to go out for a while.

354
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,460
(Jinglingchun)

355
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,020
(Jinglingchun. Price: 500 yuan)

356
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,070
Are you selling them?

357
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,440
I'll buy them for 1,500 yuan.

358
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
What? 1,500 yuan?

359
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,880
But

360
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,920
you're selling your liquor at 500 yuan.

361
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
I don't know where you get these from.

362
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I won these prizes from my Go tournament.

363
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,520
How about 2,000 yuan?

364
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,150
Then, 1,800 yuan?

365
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,600
I will only pay 1,500 yuan.

366
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,960
Today we will continue
discussing the last five

367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
of Wang Jixin's ten rules of Go,

368
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,960
"Abandon when in danger."

369
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,360
This means

370
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,560
when the situation

371
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,670
is dangerous,

372
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,940
you can't dwell in a losing position.

373
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,520
You need to decide.

374
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,920
(Abandon when in danger.)

375
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,560
Let's take a look

376
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,840
at the shape of this board.

377
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,680
Mr. Cui.

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,600
Mr. Zhang.

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,160
I wanted to see you.

380
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,640
I want to show you something.

381
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
Look at these two trophies.

382
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,080
They're identical.

383
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,800
Well, I made another one

384
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
like this.

385
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Here, take it.

386
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,160
You can let your kid have it.

387
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Mr. Zhang,

388
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,320
when...

389
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
When are we going

390
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,680
to have a meal with Mr. Wang?

391
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,160
You should have had this attitude
from the start.

392
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Like, seriously.

393
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,240
I'll give him a call.

394
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,680
Mr. Cui,

395
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
just as I said,

396
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,120
you have to know how to lose at Go.

397
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,440
When you lose,

398
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,840
that's when you win.

399
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
It's just a hobby of mine.

400
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,640
Director? So what if it's the Director?

401
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Let them wait for a bit.

402
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,040
All right.

403
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,120
Sorry about that, Mr. Cui.

404
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,360
Where did you stop

405
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,640
just now?

406
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,520
Mr. Cui,

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,800
you're not taking me seriously.

408
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,960
If that's how we're playing,
why would I need you?

409
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,120
I could just play with you directly.

410
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,520
How about we start a new game

411
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,600
and play seriously,

412
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
okay?

413
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Shuhua,

414
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
pour the tea.

415
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,880
No need to start over.

416
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,960
It's your turn.

417
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:03,020
(Trash Bin)

418
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,480
Mr. Cui,

419
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,320
just as I said,

420
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,800
you have to know how to lose at Go.

421
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,200
When you lose,

422
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
that's when you win.

423
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Mr. Cui,

424
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,000
did you slip up?

425
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,500
(Money has been transferred, Shuhua.)

426
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,080
Good.

427
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
Mr. Wang,

428
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,160
your Go skills

429
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,360
are truly a level above.

430
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Still, Mr. Cui lost brilliantly.

431
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
Let's do this again next time.

432
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,680
Okay?

433
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,920
Definitely.

434
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
Shuhua,

435
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,000
get Mr. Cui's account info

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,560
and transfer the tuition fee to him.

437
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,580
(Trash Bin)

438
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,660
(Urban Credit Cooperatives)

439
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,960
Withdraw everything.

440
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,520
There's a total of 11,800 yuan.

441
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,960
Are you going to withdraw them all?

442
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,760
How much?

443
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,200
The amount is 11,800 yuan.

444
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,360
Yes, withdraw everything.

445
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,560
Count them.

446
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,320
Okay, thanks.

447
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
Close the door now!

448
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,000
Hurry!

449
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,480
Quick!

450
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Why are you closing?

451
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Let me out!

452
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,960
You can't leave now.

453
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
It's dangerous out there.

454
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
Open the door and let me out.

455
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,780
- You cannot leave now.
- Don't open the door!

456
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,640
You can't leave.

457
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,800
They will come back.

458
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Up ahead is the police station.

459
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,760
When they encounter the police,

460
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,040
they can only turn around.

461
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,240
Up ahead

462
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,000
is the east side of Zhongshan Road,
and Yuquan Road is on the east side.

463
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,480
The west side is Danshui Road.

464
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,160
The police will be here soon.

465
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,560
Watch out ahead!

466
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,360
Move!

467
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,160
- Hold him.
- Open the door and let me out.

468
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,000
Why don't you get it?

469
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,760
Stay still!

- Don't move!

Come here!

474

Get up!

475
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,320
Move over!

476
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,960
To the robbers inside!

477
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
You are surrounded!

478
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,640
Don't resist!

479
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,760

480
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,000
Turn around!

486
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,200
they stabbed a hostage.

487
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,990
We've sent him to the hospital
and not in danger for now.

488
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
The main entrance is the only exit.

492
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
Get down!

493
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
Listen, everyone inside.

494
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,800
I'm the Captain
of the City Criminal Police Division.

495
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
My last name is Cui.

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,520
If you have any demands,
you can talk to me.

497
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,400
Stop harming the hostages.

498
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,440
I can fulfill your demands.

499
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,480
Okay, I'll come over to talk to you now.

500
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't come any closer!

501
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,000
Then how can we negotiate?

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,840
I don't want to negotiate
with you. Go! Get lost!

503
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,240
I have no weapon on me.

504

00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,960
Don't do anything reckless.

507
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,320
I will kill another hostage!

508
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,560
I can take you guys out of here.

509

If you want to live,

510
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,280
listen to me.

511
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,240
I'll take you guys out of here.

512
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,280
- What did you say?
- Don't do anything reckless.

513
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,560
I know you don't intend to hurt anyone.

514
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,060
- If you follow my instructions,
- Make sure the hostages are safe.

515
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,280
you will live.

516

(Security Room)

519
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,600
You need to go to the third floor
to leave this place.

520
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
There isn't even a second floor.

521
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
How can there be a third floor?
Are you messing with me?

522
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,080

Let me go first.

524
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,200
Let me go.

525
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,640
Let go first.

526
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Let him go.

527
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160

529
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,000
Over here.

530
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
This place used to be a restaurant.

531

It's the food delivery passage
reaching the third floor.

532
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,240
From the third floor,
you can get to the north exit.

533
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,280
There's a car right outside.

534
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,150
It belongs to the manager.
I've seen him in it.

535

Why isn't
the Special Police Unit here yet?

536
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,160
Wait.

537
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,200
They'll definitely figure it out too.

538
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,120
No signs of movement inside.

539
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,480
They could try to break out
at any time.

540
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,520
Take two officers with you

541
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,960
and guard the building's north exit.

542
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,280
Both of you, come with me.

543
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
Who would figure it out?

544
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,640
Figure out about what?

545
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,480
We need to sacrifice a pawn.

546
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
(One of you needs to go out
through the main entrance)

547
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
(to draw their attention.)

548
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,880
(The rest can climb to the third floor
through the delivery passage.)

549
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,480
(The police will definitely be waiting
at the north exit.)

550
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,640
(As long as we distract them,)

551
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,320
(we can use that time gap
to go downstairs)

552
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,160
(and find the manager's car.)

553
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,720
What do you do for a living?

554
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,520
I teach Go.

555
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Go?

556
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Don't move!

557
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
He can't do it.

558
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,660
Who should we pick?

559
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
Buddy,

560
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,640
listen to me.

561
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,600
He's useless.

562
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,640
He will only drag us down.

563
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
Get it?

564
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,520
I'll go.

565
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Don't worry.

566
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,640
If I die, take good care of him.

567
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
Listen to me.

568
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,120
If they can't leave alive,

569
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,320
I will not let you go even if I'm dead.

570
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,720
Drive toward north when you leave.

571
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,040
Who's the manager?

572
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,910
Your car keys!

573
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,320
Give me your car keys!

574
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,840
Take the money to the Security Room

575
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,000
and leave with Li.

576
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,520
Leave with them.

577
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,960
Take the money back home.

578
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
Be tougher.

579
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,160
Be bolder!

580
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,010
Go.

581
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,160
Take him with you!

582
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,880
Go!

583
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Now!

584
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
Don't move!

585
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,560
Buddy,

586
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,520
spare me.

587
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
- Ding, take over the robbery scene!
- Yes, sir!

588
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,480
The rest, come with me!

589
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,400
Ma, do you copy?

590
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
They're heading in your direction.

591
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,760
Stop!

592
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,880
What are they up to?

593
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,240
Block them at Guangming Road!

594
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,920
Get down!

595
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,440
Go.

596
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,640
We'll divide the money
when we get there.

597
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,000
After things settle down,

598
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
we'll split up.

599
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,160
Give Chunsheng's share to Xiasheng.

600
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,720
Chunsheng's share
should be evenly divided among us.

601
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
What did you say?

602
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,990
If it weren't for Chunsheng,
you'd have been caught long ago.

603
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,920
Cheng is right.

604
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,600
Li.

605
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
We're risking our lives

606
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,920
for this kind of job.

607
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,440
Life and death are up to fate.

608
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,120
We can't blame anyone

609
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,240
if he's dead.

610
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,360
Xiasheng,

611
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,440
what do you think we should do?

612
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,000
My brother is still alive.

613
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,160
Why are you saying he's dead?

614
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,440
He will come back.

615
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,040
Have all the hostages been found?

616
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,240
Not yet.

617
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,780
The situation was too chaotic back then.
It was out of control.

618
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,880
I'm still following up.

619
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,120
All right, you can go now.

620
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,840
Captain, there's one more thing.

621
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,280
We just got a call from the hospital.

622
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,760
The robber who drove
the cash delivery truck is dead.

623
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay, like that.

624
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,180
(Lanshui City Youth Center)

625
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,800
How did you end up here?

626
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,800
Give me the money.

627
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,640
I...

628
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,160
I lost my 11,800 yuan

629
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,680
along with the car.

630
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,680
That money
was for my son's leg treatment.

631
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,440
I only take what's mine.

632
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,200
You can take the rest.

633
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,900
(Employee Pass)

634
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,480
My brother is here.

635
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,400
He's a police.

636
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
What do you mean?

637
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
Did you call him here?

638
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,080
No, I didn't.

639
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,960
Captain Cui, what can I do to help you?

640
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,520
Were you at the credit union
on Zhongshan Road?

641
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,840
I went there to withdraw some money.

642
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,710
Were you at the scene when it happened?

643
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,000
After that?

644
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,440
Answer me!

645
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,880
After that, I got down on the floor.

646
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,520
When they left, I left too.

647
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,480
That's all?

648
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,680
Yes.

649
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,720
Are you hurt?

650
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,640
No.

651
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,640
No?

652
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,960
This is a huge case.

653
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,120
Do you realize this is a major robbery?

654
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,800
And you're here...

655
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,590
I'm just anxious about being late

656
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,720
to play Go with my buddy here.

657
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,520
You’re really unfazed, huh?

658
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,990
Wait...

659
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,680
Instead of going after the criminals,
why are you interrogating me?

660
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,040
Wait.

661
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,680
Hello?

662
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,800
Okay, got it.

663
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,560
Go to the station tomorrow

664
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,800
to make a statement.

665
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,760
Don't say a word to Mom

666
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,200
and make her worry.

667
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,280
Where's the money?

668
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,360
My brother traded his life for that!

669
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,680
He died because of it.

670
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,400
Where's the money?

671
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,400
Training vouchers?

672
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,360
My brother put everything

673
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,600
on the line for this.

674
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,440
Our police are actively pursuing
the fugitive robbers.

675
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,920
We will continue to provide updates
on the case.

676
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,120
What now?

677
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,840
Forget it.

678
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,880
If...

679
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,280
If you get caught...

680
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,920
I won't rat you out.

681
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,200
Come on.

682
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
Are there any more
passengers heading to Taizhou?

683
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,160
Get your tickets checked here
and board your bus.

684
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,280
Captain,

685
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,600
we received news

686
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,000
and rushed over right away.

687
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,220
The features of the three bodies
in the vehicle show

688
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,680
that they're likely part of the gang
that robbed

689
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,840
the Zhongshan Road credit union
this afternoon.

690
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,880
We still need further reports
to confirm.

691
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,000
Just three bodies?

692
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Yes, just three.

693
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,320
What time
were the three bodies discovered?

694
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,200
At 7.39 PM.

695
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,640
The timing matches.

696
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,280
We also found a lot of ash
from plants and trees at the scene.

697
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,240
It's likely from the burning
of stolen money.

698
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,520
One person got away.

699
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,800
He probably has burns on him.

700
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,240
Focus on checking hospitals,

701
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,120
pharmacies,

702
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,000
train stations, and bus stations.

703
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,840
Yes, sir.

704
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,400
I just remembered one thing.

705
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,480
When we were robbing the credit union,

706
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,160
my brother kidnapped an employee

707
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,400
to get information from him.

708
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,280
He saw our faces.

709
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,600
He's still locked up there.

710
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,960
If you don't help me,

711
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:52,200
I'll tell the police you're my accomplice
when I get caught.

712
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,740
Didn't you say you wouldn't rat me out?

713
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,600
