00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,360
I'm Rice Rolls.

190

I'm here to deliver the medicine.

191

He's in Room 308.

192

Captain Cui.

193
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,480
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

194
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,840
Is this place yours?

195
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,960
Yes. How many people are there?

196
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,000
It's on the house today.

197
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,880
No, I'm here to find someone.

198
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,480
How is that appropriate?

199
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,390
Since you're here,
I must take good care of you.

200
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
You're too kind.

201
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,920
Let me know if you need anything then.

202
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,350
Go upstairs
and tell everyone to leave immediately.

203
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,750
A policeman is going upstairs.

204
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,350
Don't let him find out the truth.

205
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,950
Okay.

206
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,070

What about you, Captain?

210
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,240
I have something else to do.

211

Captain Cui.

212
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,640
I've checked everything inside.

213
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,070
There's nothing else.

214
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,240
I'll leave first.

215

I will remember your favor.

221

Do you have yellow croakers?

231
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,080
Do you have big ones? This is too small.

232
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,920
This is the only one I have.

233
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Uncle.

234
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,960
Aunt asked me to pass you the house key.

235
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,830
This guy wants yellow croakers.

236
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
- Do you have any bigger ones?
- Big ones?

237
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,670
- Captain.
- Captain.

238
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,750
He hasn't confessed yet?

239
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,590
He keeps repeating the same thing.

240
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,270
Sir.

241
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,000
Every word I say is true,

242
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,240
but you don't believe it.

243
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,390
Okay.

244
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,330
No need for further interrogation.

245
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,000
Sign the papers and take him away.

246
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,550
We arrested Qin Xiaoming.

247
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,790
I have to thank you

248
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,110
for arresting him.

249
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,400
Thank me?

250
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,830
You're funny.

There are six anonymous call

in your phone's call log.

253
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,510
We found the owners of five of them.

254
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
Only the last one is a little strange.

255
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,720
Don't you recognize this number?

256
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,310
Sit back down.

257
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,660
We located Qin Xiaoming
based on this number.

258
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,750
He's next door right now.

259
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,000
Thank you.

Yes.

I want to buy fish.

265
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,680
If you have it, name a price.

266
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,310
500 yuan each.

267
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,150
500 yuan?

268
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,160
One stupid...

269
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
You might as well just rob us.

270
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,870
Mr. Lin.

271
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,310
I came to see you.

272
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,550
Do you still remember me?

273
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,400
Lend me your boat.

274
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,310
I don't sail anymore.

275
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,670
Mr. Lin.

276
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,070
These are your favorite
deep-sea yellow croakers.

277
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,270
Where are the keys to your boat?

278
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Keys.

281
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,350
We're doomed.

282
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,000
We spent money for nothing.

283
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,110
The old man is confused.

284
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,240
Who was that old man just now?

285
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,510
No, this boat is older than me.

286
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,720
Can you sail it?

287
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,080
When I was a kid,

288
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,270
my dad often asked Mr. Lin
to take me out to sea.

289
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,110
I learned Go and reviewed game records
on this boat.

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,840
He said

291
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,480
this way I wouldn't be able to run around.

292
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,590
Your dad is quite ruthless.

293
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,270
You're quite good.

294
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,030
You're sleeping here tonight!

295

This feels great!

When are we taking action?

297
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,480
You will know when the time comes.

298
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,070
Buy some daily necessities.

299
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,270
Spend it sparingly.

300
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,310
Just stay here.

so that we can keep in touch.

302
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,550

Don't delete the messages it contains.

304

I still need it.

What are you doing?

306
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,110
Look at how scared you are.

307

308

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,350
So it was with you.

320

Your name is really nice.

My dad randomly gave me this name.

335
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,240
I was born during the summer storm.

336
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,190
What a coincidence.

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,750
summer is the best season.

isn't this nonsense?

00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,110
Do you need help?

378
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,000
No.

379
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,510
Can I go in and take a look?

380
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,920
There's nothing to see here.

381
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,350
So you live here.

382
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
We agreed on just one trip.

383
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,720
Sure.

384
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
One trip.

385
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,880
Who is she?

386
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,310
Who is he?

387
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm his friend.

388
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,590
Who are you?

389
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,590
What friend?
How could you bring her here?

390
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,320
Ask her to leave.

391
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,790
Who is he?

392
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
He's the captain.

393
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,240
Ask her to leave immediately.

394
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,440
No. Can't I just take her on a boat ride?

395
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
I told you to let her leave.

396
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,160
You said you would listen to me.

397
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,030
What's so great about a broken boat?

398
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,350
What are you doing?

399
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,490
You can't tell me what to do.

400
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,680
I can!

401
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,110
Do you know what we're doing?

402
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,000
Listen well.

403
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,590
If it's done,

404
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,640
we can get three million yuan.

405
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,110
We'll start tonight.

406
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

407
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,350
You won't tell me anything!

408
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,640
Listen to me.

409
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,890
I don't want to interfere with you.

410
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,790
Once it's done,

411
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,440
you can do whatever you want.

412
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,510
I brought you some clothes.

413
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,590
Can't you buy two nice ones?

414
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,710
What are you looking for?

415
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,710
I'm looking for a turtle.

416
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,240
Give it to me.

417
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,350
You...

418
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,190
Why did you throw my turtle?

419
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,510
My son raised turtles.

420
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,360
He never kept one alive.

421
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,440
Why are you here?

422
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,920
Clear your schedule for tomorrow.

423
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
What's the matter?

424
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,000
Don't you want a divorce?

425
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,760
See you at Civil Affairs Bureau

426
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,230
at 2 PM tomorrow.

427
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,510
You'd better

428
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,550
take tomorrow off today.

429
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,550
I hope you sign the divorce agreement

430
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,840
and let Yan go.

431
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,480
Lend me your phone.

432
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,480
I want to make a phone call.

433
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,640
Thank you.

434
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,300
Hello. I'm here to pay the bill
for the table upstairs.

435
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,720
Hello?

436
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,400
Please call 1825 for me.

437
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,190
Please leave a message for me.

438
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,400
Let's get a divorce.

439
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,550
You can have Yangao.

440
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,760
Sorry, I'm late.

441
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,990
You must have waited for long.

442
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,000
It's fine. I just got here not long ago.

443
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,150
Waiter.

444
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,030
Serve the wine first.

445
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,440
Why are you still playing this Go game?

446
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,320
What's so great about it?

447
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,630
There's nothing great about it.

448
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,230
I just find it interesting.

449
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,110
Look at this move.

450
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,110
If it were you, how would you play?

451
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,230
In the actual game, he played here.

452
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,400
Did he not see his isolated piece?

453
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,480
What if white flanks it?

454
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,070
Yan.

455
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,880
You play chess steadily.

456
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,510
This guy is too greedy

457
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,550
and will never surrender.

458
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,710
He only thinks about his own plans,

459
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,440
but don't consider other people's ideas.

460
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,280
(Hongyu Group Cooperation Contract)
They only lack a leader.

461
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,510
Mr. Wang.

462
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,840
I...

463
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,670
Are you still hesitating?

464
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
He put a piece here,

465
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,110
thinking White have no chance of survival.

466
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,400
So he took a risk

467
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,760
to kill the opponent.

468
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,510
Few people play Go this way.

469
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Shuhua.

470
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,710
You're a smart woman.

471
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,440
Why did you join our company?

472
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,320
Because you're ambitious.

473
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,280
Right?

474
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,360
Because you want to prove your worth.

475
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,440
You also know

476
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,320
how rare it is
to have the chance to go abroad.

477
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,670
As a smart person,

478
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,280
you won't hesitate
when you have a chance.

479
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,680
Mr. Wang.

480
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,480
I haven't discussed

481
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,550
going abroad with my child yet.

482
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,400
Why discuss it with him?

483
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
How old is he?

484
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,280
What does he know?

485
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,960
If you follow his moves,

486
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,110
you will be passive.

487
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,550
But if the opponent is a little stronger,

488
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,440
knowing his behavior,

489
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,510
if someone show him their weakness,

490
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,320
he'd go after it.

491
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,280
Not only will he go after it,

492
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,280
but he will kill them.

493
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,760
Let me tell you.

494
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,600
Shuhua.

495
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,630
The chance
to change the course of your life

496
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,400
may come only once in a lifetime.

497
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm not just talking about you.

498
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,630
Including your son.

499
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,480
Who won this game?

500
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,920
Black won.

501
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,710
White isn't that good either.

502
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,590
I played white.

503
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,550
I let him win.

504
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,590
Don't you never give handicap stones?

505
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,550
Go play your game.

506
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,500
(Incoming Call, Qin Xiaoming)

507
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,760
Hello?

508
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,280
I have Qin Xiaoming.

509
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Who are you?

510
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,550
He said you could save him.

511
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,920
I don't get it.

512
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,480
He told me some things about you.

513
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,630
There's also a book.

514
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,920
There are a lot of things written in it.

515
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,800
I can tell you

516
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,480
those figures.

517
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,630
I can also tell the police.

518
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:10,910
You get choose

519
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,600
what I'll do.

520
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,590
What do you want?

521
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,870
Prepare three million yuan in cash.

522
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,590
Wait for my call

523
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,840
at 2 PM tomorrow.

524
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,480
Hello, the number you dialed
is switched off.

525
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,370
Sorry.

526
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,950
How did it go?

527
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,190
Did I sound like a robber?

528
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,150
Not bad.
