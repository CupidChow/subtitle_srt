(Big Three Games Arcade)

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,640
This new phone is in high demand.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,670
Someone even tried to order one
from me yesterday.

4
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,600
Get me two more this time.

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,710
Yours is the only shop that has stock.

6
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,270
It's not easy to get.

7
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,350
Don't be blabbermouth

8
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,040
and just make money.

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,280
Don't invite trouble.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Hurry up!

11
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,910
Hey, buddy.

12
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Let's go.

13
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,680
Guys, unload the goods!

14
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,590
- All right!
- Okay!

15
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,630
Come on! Move it!

16
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,960
We still have a lot of stock.

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Pal,

18
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
do you have it?

19
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,460
I have one more batch.

20
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,630
They're rushing us.

21
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,640
- So we must ship this batch out tomorrow.
- Okay.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Move it!

25
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,310
Captain, you were right.

26
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,200
There was no sign

27
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
(Kuanyun Dim Sum Restaurant)
of Qin Xiaoming along the railway.

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,910
We only found a set of clothes
that might be his on the train.

29
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,470
Send it to forensics for analysis.

30
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,550
Got it.

31
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,560
I'll report back
as soon as I have the results.

32
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,240
Listen, can we talk?

33
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,600
Can you stop showing up at my workplace?

34
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,600
It makes things difficult for me.

35
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,530
A workplace? You have one?

36
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,600
What do you mean?

37
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
The place where I earn a living.

38
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,190
His name is Qin Xiaoming.

39
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,800
Find out who he's been
in contact with recently.

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
The time, place.

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,930
The more detail, the better.

42
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,360
Hold on.

43
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,950
I'll do this for you.

44
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,720
But you have to do me a favor too.

45
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Wait a second.

46
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's walk through today's mission.

47
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,720
You need to make

48
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,720
my mom recognize me as her son.

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
Close the door.

50
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Mom,

51
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm home.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
Wasn't she fine before?

53
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,950
Why is she suddenly confused?

54
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,870
I don't know.

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
She suddenly doesn't recognize me anymore

56
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
and insists her son is a cop.

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
Isn't that you?

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,750
It's your fault
for taking good care of her

59
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,750
- after you sent me to jail.
- Mom.

60
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't you recognize me anymore?

61
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm Kuan.

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,870
You don't look like Kuan.

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
If I'm not Kuan, who am I?

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm your son.

65
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,390
Are you sure this will work?

66
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,270
At this point, I'm just trying anything

67
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,680
that might work.

68
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,270
Or else I'll lose my mom for good.

69
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,070
Look at my ridiculous look.

70
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
I look like an undercover cop.

71
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,790
Right.

72
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,040
It should work.

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,070
Look at what you're wearing.

74
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,800
You look like a thug.

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm the thug, Kuan.

76
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm the worst.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
I've let you down.

78
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,830
Get out.

79
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
My son isn't an ex-con.

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
- Get out.
- Madam Hong.

81
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm here to visit you.

82
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
He was the one who arrested me

83
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,950
and changed me.

84
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,270
That's Captain Cui,

85
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,360
Wei.

86
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,800
No matter how I see it,
you don't look like Wei.

87
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,720
Mom,

88
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,950
he's Wei.

89
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,040
See how handsome he is.

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,390
I'm really your son,

91
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Kuan.

92
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,040
Look how useless he is.

93
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Tell him to get out.

94
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,110
Get out.

95
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,270
Then who am I?

96
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,160
Wei?

97
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
I'm Wei.

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Son.

99
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,800
My son.

100
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,480
- Yes, Mom.
- Son.

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,950
Mom, don't forget me again.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm home now.

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,800
- I'm home now.
- Son, you're home.

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Son...

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
My son...

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
Thanks, man.

107
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,950
The guy you're looking for met
someone last week.

108
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
His name is Kuang Zhiguo.

109
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Where?

110
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Great World.

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,390
The kid you're after is young.

112
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,920
But he hangs out in high-end places.

113
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,600
They're always hanging out together

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,270
and throwing money around.

115
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,160
Do you have the address?

116
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
It's on the back.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,020
(No. 302, Lane 4,
Taishan Road, Xinen District)

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,390
You've progressed.

119
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,920
He's the driver for Wang Hongyu
of the Hongyu Group.

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,830
When I was released, things were tough.

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Nobody would hire me because I did time.

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,070
Didn't I even borrow money from you?

123
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,070
When I was at my lowest,

124
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,680
Wang Hongyu took me in.

125
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,950
He's a pretty nice guy.

126
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,360
Take off your clothes.

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,390
Make time to visit your mom more often.

128
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Stop knocking already!

129
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,600
He's already dead.

130
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,820
(Happiness)

131
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
What do you want?

132
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,980
Mister, can I ask you some questions?

133
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,140
I'm a police officer.

134
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,660
Officer,

135
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,500
how can I help you?

136
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,580
Is he dead?

137
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,300
It would be great if he is.

138
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,180
Is this the guy?

139
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,370
Yes.

140
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,540
Before, he used to bring a bunch
of shady friends over

141
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,900
to drink, gamble,

142
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,340
and make a racket.

143
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
Now, there's none of those.

144
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,700
It's quiet now.

145
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,060
How long has it been quiet?

146
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,660
I think

147
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,340
the noise stopped since the day

148
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,180
before yesterday.

149
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,300
Kuan,

150
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,700
the guy is not home.

151
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
I wouldn't know.

152
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,020
Call up all his friends

153
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,220
and gather them.

154
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,140
You're putting me in a tough spot.

155
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,620
None of my old buddies want

156
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,100
to sit down with you.

157
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Is there anything you can't handle?

158
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,500
Just set it up.

159
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,980
Let me know the time.

160
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,100
Wang Hongyu?

161
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,340
Qin Xiaoming was in contact
with him before he disappeared.

162
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,460
His name is Kuang Zhiguo,
Wang Hongyu's driver.

163
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,620
I say we investigate Kuang Zhiguo
and Wang Hongyu.

164
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,940
We looked into
Qin Xiaoming's connections.

165
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,980
By logic,

166
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,980
he and Kuang Zhiguo

167
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,340
shouldn't even cross paths.

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,860
One is a driver,

169
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,220
the other is an accountant.

170
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,460
Yet they're liberal with money.

171
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
No way this isn't linked to Wang Hongyu.

172
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,380
My gut says something's off.

173
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
Your gut?

174
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,220
Listen.

175
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,380
The Hongyu Group

176
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,620
is one of the city's biggest investors.

177
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,940
Going after him so easily

178
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,860
would have serious consequences.

179
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,820
It could set off a chain reaction.

180
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,860
I know you're all
under a lot of pressure,

181
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,460
but the most important thing right now

182
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,340
is to stay calm.

183
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,700
As for Wang Hongyu,

184
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
my advice is to put

185
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,620
that thought on hold for now.

186
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
You haven't had much rest
these past few days.

187
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,060
Go home early today.

188
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,100
Wei, we're having
a high school gathering tonight.

189
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,300
Can you pick me up
after you leave the station?

190
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,580
Mister,

191
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,620
I'm the one who called

192
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,020
to reserve the phone.

193
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,540
Has the shipment arrived yet?

194
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Great.

195
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,980
(Professional Cellphone Repair)
I'll wait for your call.

196
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,380
Mister,

197
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,300
how long have you been doing this?

198
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
Well, over twenty years.

199
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,980
You can take your time.

200
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,100
Why are you shaving?

201
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,340
Mister, give me one after you're done.

202
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,900
- Okay.
- Put it on his tab.

203
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,820
Okay.

204
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,460
Look, can you give me a straight answer?

205
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,260
Are you in or not?

206
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,220
Be gentle.

207
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,460
Talking to you is exhausting.

208
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,220
Mister, he already paid you.

209
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,580
Mr. Cui!

210
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,140
(Big Three Games Arcade)

211
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,620
If you're not playing, let me have a go.

212
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,860
I'm playing.

213
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,100
You need to insert the token to play.

214
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,620
So go and buy some tokens for me.

215
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,860
I'll take half,
and you can have the other half.

216
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,940
I quit.

217
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,500
Since you're already here,
why not play two more rounds?

218
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,940
Just having some fun is enough.

219
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,220
It's over an hour's drive back to Xiguan.

220
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,980
Only six people

221
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,400
are on shift tonight.

222
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,990
We have another batch coming in tonight.

223
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,620
Make sure to set some aside for me.

224
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,380
These phones are selling like hotcakes.

225
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,060
This batch of shipments

226
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,340
is about to be sold.

227
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,700
I have no idea
when the next one will arrive.

228
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,540
I'm leaving.

229
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,460
Did you leave in such a rush

230
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,340
just to play games?

231
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,340
Do you know how to play?

232
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
King of Fighters '97?

233
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm pretty good.

234
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,340
How about a match?

235
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,980
Go and get two tokens.

236
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,290
If you win, I'll do what you say.

237
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,460
You said it yourself.

238
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't say I didn't warn you.

239

(Xiguan Dock)

240
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,050
We have arrived in Xiguan.

241
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,020
Time to get off.

242

(Xiguan Dock)

243
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,580
A stable government job?

244
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,380
You think you're holding the bowl?

245
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,580
In reality,

246
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,260
someone else is holding it
and letting some crumbs fall into yours.

247
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,580
Bin, you've got it good running
a business.

248
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,300
Lots of money and plenty of freedom.

249
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,300
Well, business

250
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,660
is all hard-earned money.

251
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
Not like you guys

252
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,540
who never have to plead with anyone.

253
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,540
Jiawen's the lucky one.

254
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,500
The police captain
has a bright future ahead.

255
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,260
She never has to worry about a thing.

256
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,580
Jiawen,

257
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,740
where did you find such a great husband?

258
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,140
Four words.

259
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,580
Knight in shining armor.

260
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,620
That's incredible.

261
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,740
So, when's our hero arriving?

262
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,300
I can't wait to meet him.

263
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,340
Eight Dots.

264
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,900
Mahjong.

265
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,220
Bin,

266
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,780
you keep discarding winning tiles.

267
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,980
It's been a while.

268
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,060
So I'm getting rusty.

269
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,820
Took you long enough.

270
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Hello, I'm Cao Youbin.

271
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,300
A friend from high school.

272
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,060
It's nice to play
with old high school friends again.

273
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,140
Well, it's common.

274
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,060
Sorry, I'm late.

275
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
You can call me Bin.

276
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,620
- Returned from Australia?
- Yes.

277
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,480
Not like in Australia.

278
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
It's hard to gather for the Mahjong.

279
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,580
I brought some late-night snacks.
Eat while it's hot.

280
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm heading home to sleep.

281
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,340
Please stay and have a drink with us.

282
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,120
Why are you leaving
when you just got here?

283
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,980
I haven't slept in 30 hours.

284
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,340
Do you still want to keep playing?

285
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,620
I was dozing off on the way here.

286
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,980
Can you drive me home?

287
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,500
You guys don't mind, right?

288
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,100
Not at all.

289
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,820
Sorry about that.

290
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
Let's go.

291
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,010
Wait.

292
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
You always forget your handbag.

293
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,420
I almost forgot about this.

294
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,340
Thank you.

295
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,300
Open it up.

296
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,820
Here's yours.

297
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,660
Thank you.

298
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,700
Bin, why did you spend so much?

299
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
What are the odds?

300
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,380
I bought the exact same one.

301
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,780
I wasn't gonna say anything.

302
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,140
But great taste.

303
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,550
I got it as an anniversary gift.

304
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,250
You're not gonna fight me for it,
are you?

305
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,220
You're a little sensitive.

306
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,020
He only wants to get to know you.

307
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,300
He's not asking you for anything.

308
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,220
Besides, he has connections
at the Experimental Middle School.

309
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,820
We need him for Lin's enrollment.

310
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,300
I got it.

311
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,020
You like that necklace.

312
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,100
Stop joking around.

313
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,060
If Lin can get into that school,

314
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,860
it'd be great.

315
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,500
Look,

316
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
I think

317
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,300
Lin is doing well on her own.

318
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,660
Whatever school she gets into,
it's a good thing.

319
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,100
I'm not saying the whole thing

320
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,420
is complicated or anything.

321
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,580
But this just

322
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,820
isn't the way to do it.

323
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,460
I don't see it that way.

324
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,580
That school is hard to get into.

325
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,540
As parents,
we have to plan ahead for her.

326
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,660
No.

327
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,060
Why not?

328
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,300
As long as I'm a cop, it's a no.

329
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,660
You don't get it at all.

330
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,740
I'm going to bed.

331
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,340
Dad called earlier.

332
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,820
He wants you to go fishing with him.

333
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,740
Get ready and go.

334
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,140
Dad.

335
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,060
It's cold out.

336
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,390
So have something warm to drink.

337
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,820
Sanhe Street?

338
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
From Huangji?

339
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,820
Pork kidney congee, huh?

340
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,980
You must have waited

341
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,540
a long time in the line to buy this.

342
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,980
There weren't that many people.

343
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,900
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,290
How long has it been
since you last went fishing with me?

345
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,820
A while, I guess.

346
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,260
Sit down.

347
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,060
Cast a few lines first.

348
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,740
Fishing comes before drinking.

349
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,620
Did you adjust the float for me?

350
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,660
I don't know what kind of fish
you're after.

351
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,020
So I couldn't adjust it for you.

352
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,540
When you go fishing,

353
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,100
you need a target.

354
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
So you know whether
to fish shallow or deep.

355
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,100
The water is deep.

356
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,140
I'll raise the float a bit and try.

357
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,300
I'm telling you

358
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,460
that your rod is too thin.

359
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,060
It can't handle a big fish.

360
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,780
If I do hook a big one,

361
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll just let it tire itself out.

362
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,220
His status is sensitive.

363
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,100
In the city,

364
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,420
his connections are complicated.

365
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,220
You never know
which powerful figure he's tied to.

366
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,500
Right now,

367
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,820
the waters are murky.

368
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,500
Who knows which big fish

369
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,060
is stirring up the mud below?

370
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,900
What you lack right now

371
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,060
isn't another case on your record.

372
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
What do more commendations

373
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,380
really do for you?

374
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,380
I heard

375
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,580
the province is opening
another leadership training session.

376
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,780
What do you think about it?

377
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,260
Why?

378
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,460
Is it uncomfortable sitting here?

379
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,500
You think going up makes it easier?

380
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,540
When climbing,

381
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,860
don't just stare

382
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,060
at your feet.

383
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
You need to look ahead.

384
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
One wrong step

385
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,100
at a critical moment,

386
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
and the road ahead changes completely.

387
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,300
Being a cop

388
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,780
isn't just about solving cases.

389
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,820
Do you get it?

390
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,340
You're right, Dad.

391
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,340
I know

392
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,580
this is exactly

393
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,620
what I'm lacking.

394
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,260
It got away.

395
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,580
Let's try again.

396
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,780
(Bole Audio)

397
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,300
Mister, buy a camera.

398
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,480
We have a promotion now.

399
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,490
If you buy a camera,
you get a free roll of film.

400
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:27,060
(Shanghai Warrior)

401
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,140
We have arrived in Xiguan.

402
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,460
Time to get off.

403
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,140
(Hongyu Group)

404
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,900
Captain's looking into Wang Hongyu.

405
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,460
Why didn't you knock?

406
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,300
Captain,

407
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
I heard

408
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,500
Wang Hongyu often plays ping pong

409
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,620
at a place on Huatian Road.

410
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,820
Chief Zhao already said
not to investigate Wang Hongyu.

411
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,190
Why are you still looking into him?

412
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,740
It's my dad.

413
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,420
He always runs into him there.

414
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,700
Your dad?

415
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,820
When exactly does he see him there?

416
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,900
You really want to know?

417
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,420
I can ask him.

418
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,340
Your back needs treatment.

419
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,820
Any luck?

420
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,260
Did you find him?

421
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,300
I think he got wind of something

422
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
and went into hiding.

423
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
Find him fast.

424
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,580
He knows too much.

425
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,820
How is the search for the "white gloves"

426
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,940
in Canada going?

427
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,580
That's not your concern.

428
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,100
But if we still can't find Qin Xiaoming,

429
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,220
I can't leave with my hands clean.

430
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,060
Got it?

431
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,900
If I can't get out, neither can you.

432
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,300
What about your driver?

433
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,220
Mr. Wang?

434
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Mr. Wang.

435
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,060
Mr. Wang.

436
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,060
I didn't think it was you.

437
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,820
Are you here to play ping pong?

438
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Who are you?

439
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,060
I'm from the Criminal Police Division.

440
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,740
We all appreciate you

441
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,340
for giving

442
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,740
an ex-con a second chance.

443
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,220
It's a charitable act.

444
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm just doing my part.

445
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,820
Criminal Police Division, huh?

446
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,300
What's your position there?

447
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,260
Captain.

448
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,540
My last name is Cui.

449
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,580
Nice to meet you, Captain Cui.

450
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,420
Nice to meet you too.

451
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,220
Are you resting in between rounds?

452
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,580
Yeah. So, are you here

453
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,460
to play too?

454
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,780
Yeah, to let out some sweat.

455
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,990
I dare not say I'm good at it.

456
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,140
Come on, let's play a couple of rounds.

457
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,100
I'm not that good.

458
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,540
I just started to play.

459
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,810
People who can play
always pretend they can't play.

460
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,300
- Don't you agree?
- Fair enough.

461
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,620
Then I'll play with you for a bit.

462
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,420
You can rest on the side.

463
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,300
Guys, time to eat!

464
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,700
You must be pretty busy lately.

465
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,180
Did you hear it from the news?

466
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,060
Do I even need to?

467
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,990
The two of us were talking
about it just now.

468
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,540
You have business there, right?

469
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,580
Some.

470
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,060
I know their higher-ups.

471
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,260
I was helping them boost

472
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,660
their performance.

473
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,940
Which higher-up?

474
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,380
Not exactly a higher-up.

475
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,260
Did it affect your businesses?

476
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,740
Why would it affect my business?

477
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,060
They didn't even rob real money.

478
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,860
Captain Cui, are you taking me for a spin?

479
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,580
Is there something you wanted to ask me?

480
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,460
I can tell you.

481
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,740
Just ask away.

482
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,540
I told you I'm not good at this game.

483
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,140
Just playing like this isn't fun.

484
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,660
Since we run into each other,

485
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,990
we might as well chat while at it.

486
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
I'll serve.

487
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,700
You're right.

488
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,300
Hello?

489
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,860
Speak.

490
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,340
Then take care of it.

491
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,340
You're sweating a lot.

492
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Have some water.

493
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,300
Captain, who won?

494
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,820
His steps look pretty steady.

495
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,500
Guess he won.

496
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,740
Who says I'm sweating?

497
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,820
I'm barely even out of breath.

498
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,180
Captain,

499
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,100
do we keep digging into this guy?

500
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
Find Kuang Zhiguo first.

501
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Mr. Wang, we'll meet up another day.

502
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,820
- Sure.
- See you.

503
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,020
This guy is fishy.

504
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,020
I've been watching
Wang Hongyu's reactions.

505
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,140
He didn't let anything slip
when I was testing him.

506
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,060
But the moment I shifted my focus
to this other guy,

507
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,160
he tensed up.

508
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,980
That might be our lead.

509
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,820
How about eating something?

510
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,740
Don't just drink.

511
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,100
Is that funny?

512
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,940
That batch of successful goods
is getting shipped across tomorrow.

513
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
What?

514
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,060
Yeah, the ones
that are selling like crazy.

515
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,900
Yes.

516
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,940
Move it inside.

517
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,540
After that, drag him out.

518
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,180
Faster.

519
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,660
Stop wasting time.

520
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,060
Bring him out here.

521
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,540
Well, my boss gave us the order.

522
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,580
So don't blame us.

523
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,620
Pick him up!

524
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,020
I want to take Yan to Canada.

525
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,540
Did Wang Hongyu tell you to go?

526
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,140
There's nothing
between Wang Hongyu and I.

527
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,540
He sent me because I'm capable.

528
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Still, Mr. Cui lost brilliantly.

529
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,580
Well, our boss gave us the order.

530
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,460
So don't blame us.

531
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,940
What kind of person

532
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,380
can't see a future for themselves?

533
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,420
Is it someone like Wang Hongyu?

534
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,380
Why are you here?

535
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Do you think you can ditch me?

536
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,620
Good thing I was following you.

537
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,100
I told you the money wasn't clean.

538
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,380
If it weren't for me, you would have...

539
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,540
What?

540
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,860
Are you here
to check out the place alone?

541
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,060
I'm not here to do that.

542
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,020
If you were not,

543
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,340
why did you come here?

544
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,100
I only want to prove

545
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,940
that he's not a good guy.

546
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,740
But I changed my mind.

547
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,080
Let's mess him up.
