00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,060
(Xin'an Primary School)

2
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,280
- Goodbye, teachers and friends!
- Mom.

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,159
Mom,

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,439
I've got a lot of cards

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,200
and gifts today.

6
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,679
Mom.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,640
If others remember your birthday,

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,520
you should remember theirs too.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,960
When it's their birthday,

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,519
I'll go gift shopping with you.

11
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,840
- Shuhua.
- Hi, Aunt.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
Mom.

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
- Lin.
- Grandma.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,920
You're back.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Birthday boy.

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,680
Hi, Uncle.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
Yangao,

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,400
this is a birthday gift for you.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
This cake must be expensive.

20
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,319
Not really.

21
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,400
My friend

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,290
- who has a bakery taught me to make it.
- Yangao.

23
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,560
Did you make it yourself?

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
Look,

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Jiawen's such a virtuous woman.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,920
Mom, this chicken is very fresh.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
It's straight from the market.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,759
Saves us a lot of work, doesn't it?

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,680
He can't clean it up, can he?

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,479
Just stew it.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,479
Please have a seat.

32
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,759
Your leg is weak,
but you can move your hands, right?

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,919
Don't blink.

34
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,759
How is it?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
It's the latest.

36
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,039
It's so interesting.

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,319
Play it now.

38
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,759
Connect the power.

39
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,599
What a coincidence.

40
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,039
Batman has a brother.

41
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,759
Your dad bought this for you?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,719
Who's there?

43
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,479
Who's it?

44
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,360
Let me take a look.

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,990
Your parcel has arrived.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,719
Please sign here.

47
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,680
- Come on.
- This is...

48
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,639
Come on, I'll sign it.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,759
Okay.

50
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,520
Be careful.

51
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,759
Yan.

52
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,759
Come on.

53
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,039
Look, I got you a birthday gift.

54
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,520
What is this?

55
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,800
Come on, Yan.

56
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,199
Okay.

57
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,360
Look.

58
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,759
Look what I got you for your birthday.

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you like it?

60
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,759
Yan's leg isn't even healed yet.

61
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,599
Why did you buy a bike?

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,879
To ride.

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,520
He'll be able to ride
when his leg heals.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
As long as I am here,

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,639
Yan's leg will definitely heal.

66
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,199
Good.

67
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,319
Do you like it?

68
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,920
This bike isn't cheap, is it?

69
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,240
How much money are you short of
for Yangao's treatment?

70
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,120
Not much.

71
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,439
How's your case going?

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
Get plenty of rest.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,439
Yangao,

74
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,759
try it.

75
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,040
Come on,

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
I'll help you.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Yan, go.

78
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll support

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,879
this leg for you.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,319
Let me help you.

81
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,360
Shuhua,

82
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,439
don't you feel like you're in a trance?

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,560
The kids have suddenly grown up.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
I haven't even matured yet.

85
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,360
Shuhua.

86
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,319
Are you not feeling well?

87
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm fine.

88
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,000
Maybe I didn't get
enough rest yesterday.

89
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,680
Are you and Ye okay?

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
How have you two been doing

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
since the last time?

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Jiawen,

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,199
if you're faced with something

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
you can't control

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,560
or decide

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
or change,

97
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,040
what would you do?

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
How do you feel about it?

99
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,000
Nice.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
You're something.

101
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,199
You can even ride it this way.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,240
Come on.

103
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Keep going.

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,759
Are you tired?

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,800
No.

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,570
- Take a break when you're tired.
- You have to ask me if I'm tired.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,560
You're not going to hold it?

108
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,879
Something like this...

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
I... I've probably never faced before.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,560
Shuhua.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Do you have something on your mind?

112
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't keep it to yourself.

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,319
You can tell me.

114
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,879
I won't tell them.

115
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm fine.

116
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,879
Really?

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Come on, let me help you.

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,879
Come on.

119
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,680
- Is your leg okay?
- It's too hot.

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,360
Put it on.

121
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,680
Or you will catch a cold.

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,040
Let me take it off for a minute.

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
What is this?

124
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,439
Which one?

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
This one?

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,879
I have no idea.

127
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,360
My dad told me it's an amulet.

128
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,120
A friend of his gave it to him.

129
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
Let me take it off for a minute.

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,120
Just a minute.

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,639
Put it on.

132
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,560
Grandma.

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,360
You're back. Go and wash your hands.

134
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,759
Let's get ready for dinner.

135
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,360
- Okay.
- Go.

136
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Go and wash your hands.

137
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
We're back.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,480
All right.

139
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
Take it off.

140
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Let's take a family portrait

141
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
with this table of food.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,560
- Wash your hands.
- Again?

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Didn't we just take one last time?

144
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,439
Last time was different.

145
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,800
Last time was to commemorate
Ye's glory moment.

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,780
- This time it's about Yangao's growth.
- Come on.

147
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,240
Okay.

148
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,879
Come on.

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,199
Today... Look.

150
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,920
Get closer.

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
The whole family's here.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,439
Your dad must be really happy

153
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,800
if he were still alive.

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,680
Don't bring that up.

155
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,439
Let's take a photo.

156
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,390
- Come on.
- Stop talking.

157
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,240
Okay, come on.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
- All right, ready.
- Let's take a photo.

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Get ready.

160
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,680
Say happy birthday
on the count of three.

161
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,800
Say happy birthday.

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
One, two, three.

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,120
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday to me!

164

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
We're home.

167
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,759
Mom.

168
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,000
Why do I get the feeling that Yangao
doesn't like the bike very much?

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,639
How could he not like it?

170
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,759
When his leg gets better, he'll like it.

171
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,480
I can see you like it.

172
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,879
Don't you already have a bike?

173
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,279
Mom,

174
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,480
I want to see the photos on your camera.

175
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,279
My girl,

176
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,120
you'd better get on with your homework.

177
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,000
You haven't finished your homework
for tomorrow.

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Help me pick out a nice photo, then.

179
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,480
Sure.

180
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,879
Wei,

181
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,240
help me pick out a nice photo.

182
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
Let me take a break.

183
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,000
No, just pick one out for me.

184
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,240
I'll send it to Shuhua tomorrow.

185
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
Hurry up.

186
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,080
What to do?

187
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,480
Pick one out for me.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,840
I don't want to pick.

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,879
You decide.

190
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
Come on.

191
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,120
This is quite nice.

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,759
No. Pick one out.

193
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
How is it?

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,519
Where are you going?

195
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,759
I'm going to the police station.

196
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,480
Wait. What are you taking the camera for?

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Dad,

198
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,399
can I really be cured?

199
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,159
Yan,

200
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,399
don't worry.

201
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,279
You can be cured.

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,399
I promise you.

203
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240

30 yuan.

207
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,639
This thing is worth 30 yuan.

208
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,720
That's half a month's salary.

209
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,879
I'm actually trying to tell you

210
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,120
to do something practical.

211
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,360
Don't focus

212
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
on your broken go board

213
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,000
all the time.

(Lanshui City Urban Credit Cooperatives)

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,399
You were right then.

216
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,240
I couldn't just focus on the go board.

217
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,880
Why are you sitting here?

218
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,880
What time did you get back?

219
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
What's wrong?

220
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,039
Where's my fishing stuff?

221
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,359
Help me find it.

222
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,720
Why do you need it?

223
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm meeting Dad for fishing.

224
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,440
Dad.

225
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,839
Let me carry it.

226
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,359
You're in good shape.

227
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
You rode all the way here
without panting.

228
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,799
Dad,

229
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,119
you're riding at a steady speed.

230
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,720
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to keep up.

231
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
I wonder why

232
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,359
you think of me today.

233
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,880
You go pick a spot

234
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
and I'll unload it.

235
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,880
You brat.

236
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,920
Have you prepared

237
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,330
all the materials
for the advanced training course?

238
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,880
Time waits for no man.

239
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,920
Why did you suddenly ask me
to come fishing today?

240
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,200
Didn't you figure it out?

241
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,640
Wei,

242
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,599
you're a smart guy.

243
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,680
You should know

244
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,880
what's the most important choice
for you.

245
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,440
Dad, I know I got lucky.

246
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,640
I met Jiawen

247
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,720
and have become your son-in-law.

248
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,200
At every intersection,

249
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
you've shown me the right way.

250
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,839
I grasped very opportunity.

251
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,480
I know you're doing it for my sake.

252
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,640
But this time,

253
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
I'll stop for a while.

254
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,359
I'll do a good job on the current duty.

255
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,680
Dad,

256
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
you've been working
on this job your whole life.

257
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,640
You must know me very well.

258
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,319
All right.

259
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,260
Let's not talk about it.

260
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,079
Come on.

261
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,279
Let's fish.

262
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,880
Dad,

263
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,200
I asked you out

264
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,519
for advice on fishing.

265
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm trying to catch

266
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
a fish that's very well hidden

267
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,599
and very smart.

268
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,160
Do you know what the smartest fish
in this lake is?

269
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,960
Chinese ink carp.

270
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,319
It's also called Black Fish.

271
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,039
It's a carnivorous fish.

272
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,640
Look over there.

273
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
The smarter the fish,
the better they hide.

274
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,039
If you want to catch a fish like this,

275
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
you can't make it come out to you.

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
You have to take the initiative
to find it.

277
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,559
Take this.

278
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,319
I'm using this rod?

279
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,279
Yes.

280
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,079
Come on, here you go.

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,880
Try it.

282
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,920
Fake bait can be used to fish too.

283
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,880
Fish are like human beings.

284
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,400
No matter how smart he is,

285
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,599
he can't tell the difference

286
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,980
between what's real and what's fake
when his eyes are focused

287
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,880
on what he wants most.

288
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,160
Yan,

289
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,119
come on.

290
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,400
Have some water.

291
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,839
Be careful. It's hot.

292
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,920
Mom, my go friends want to see me.

293
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,119
I'm going out.

294
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,160
Yan,

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,519
have an early night.

296
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,079
You're going out this late?

297
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Shuhua,

298
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,119
are you okay?

299
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I'm fine.

301
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,200
done something wrong

302
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
to make you angry again?

303
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,839
Mom, I'm fine.

304
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,880
Tell me.

305
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,119
I'll talk to him.

306
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,119
Mom, I'm really fine.

307
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,960
Take action now.

308

309
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,079
I think I got a call

310
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,519
from the exclusive store.

311
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,200
They said

312
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,680
we can exchange it if it's faulty.

313
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Didn't I just buy it?

314
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,400
Go and check it out.

315
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,980
(Dunquan Safe Exclusive Store)

316
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,079
Hello.

317
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,680
Tell me

318
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,359
what model,

319
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,599
when you bought it,

320
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,200
and what's wrong with it.

321
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
How about this?

322
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,440
Tomorrow,

323
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,799
I'll get a technician over there
to take a look.

324
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,519
Not now.

325
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,640
It's late.

326
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
Our technician's off duty already.

327
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,400
Only the helpline operates all day long.

328
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Okay.

329
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,319
Sure.

330
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,960
I'll arrange it for you.

331
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
Bye.

332
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,079
You remember how to say it, don't you?

333
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,160
Don't worry.

334
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,720
Who am I?

335
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,039
Your hamstring.

336
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,799
I'll get going now.

337
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,119
Why do you take it with you?

338
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,720
Come in.

339
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,799
When did you buy this?

340
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,640
Let me see the invoice.

341
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,359
It can't be fixed.

342
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,319
There's something wrong with this batch.

343
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,559
Didn't you get a call?

344
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,599
I did.

345
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,279
That's right.

346
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,400
What's the problem?

347
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Faulty sensor

348
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,160
causing alarms to go off all the time.

349
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
It's a problem with your quality.

350
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,319
Isn't there a repair warranty?

351
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,640
Why can't it be fixed?

352
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,319
Ask our boss.

353
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,079
I'm just a worker.

354
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,352
Young man,

355
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,880
think of a way.

356
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,640
How about this?

357
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,319
You'll have to pay for the repair.

358
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,400
I'll talk to my boss

359
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,599
and register for you.

360
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,200
We'll replace it for you by tonight.

361
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,120
It took me quite some effort
to come here at this hour of the night.

362
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,680
How much is it?

363
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,839
200 yuan.

364
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,599
50 yuan for a visit.

365
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,640
100 yuan for expediting.

366
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,279
Hello, Boss.

367
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,960
It's me.

368
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
It's that batch.

369
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,519
Why don't we replace it
for them tonight?

370
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,839
They need it urgently.

371
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,200
Okay.

372
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
I'll bring this to the store later.

373
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,559
Here you go.

374
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,279
This is it.

375
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,160
They took the bait.

376
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,279
That's for sure.

377
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,359
They're hooked.

378
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,599
Sir.

379
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,599
Come on,

380
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,640
put it over there.

381
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,960
Take this.

382
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
Sir,

383
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,160
please sign the papers.

384
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,880
You

385
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
aren't the same boss as before.

386
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,160
I'm his cousin.

387
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,359
(They took the replacement)

388
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,079
How is it?

389
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,279
So far,

390
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
our plan is working out well.

391
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,119
Our target

392
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,559
is the stuff in his safe.

393
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,200
Uncle Yi

394
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,880
is a moneylender.

395
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,279
All the big IOUs

396
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,680
are in his safe.

397
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,160
I've learned about this safe.

398
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,880
If you don't know the password,

399
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,319
it's hard to open it

400
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,640
without being discovered
through ordinary means.

401
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,559
Only if he

402
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,400
(Dunquan)
solves the problem for us

403
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,359
can we have a chance.

404
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,440
We bought the store

405
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,920
for this purpose.

406
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,300
(Dunquan Safe Exclusive Store)

407
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,360
Before,

408
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,840
I showed up

409
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,639
at his lending place.

410
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,679
That's why

411
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,639
I needed a stranger.

412
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,960
The alarm was recorded

413
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,000
to make him think the safe is broken.

414
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,480
It can't be fixed.

415
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,159
There's something wrong with this batch.

416
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,920
Didn't you get a call?

417
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,480
We set it up.

418
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,440
For security, he'd replace it.

419
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,760
Be careful.

420
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,639
But we replaced it

421
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,119
with a tampered safe.

422
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,639
Take this.

423
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,000
The safe's taken care of.

424
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,559
What about next?

425
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,199
How do we do it?

426
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,079
That place

427
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,280
is always guarded.

428
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,960
We still don't have a chance.

429
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,119
I've got an idea.

430
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,800
(Coughing for a while before stopping
and telling his men he's okay.)

431
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,719
What does it mean?

432
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,039
I thought there was something strange
about him.

433
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:24,800
He's got a garden

434
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,440
in the house for flowers,

435
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,480
but he never goes in there himself.

436
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,119
My boss

437
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,320
is good at everything,

438
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,280
but he's allergic to pollen.

439
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,119
If he gets allergic,

440
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,719
it'll scare everyone out of their wits.

441
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,000
He has to carry medicine
with him at all times.

442
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,599
The garden

443
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,639
was built when his wife was still alive.

444
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,199
He's too sentimental to tear it down.

445
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,159
We're putting him
in the hospital tonight.

446
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,519
His men will follow.

447
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,039
What should we do?

448
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,639
He cooks for himself every day.

449
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,480
We can just take advantage of that.

450
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,039
I've already

451
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,960
told Xiasheng how to do it.

452
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,639
If it works out,

453
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,519
they'll call an ambulance.

454
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,320
You'll have to confirm

455
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,679
if there's anyone left in the building.

456
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,639
Tell Xiasheng

457
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,119
how many of them

458
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,559
and where they are.

459
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,320
It's up to Xiasheng then.

460
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,199
No problem.

461
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,920
You're really something.

462
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,920
What did you do before?

463
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,280
Any problems?

464
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,320
No.

465
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,440
What?

466
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,800
I have a question.

467
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,079
Even if we get what's in that safe,

468
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,960
it's all IOUs,

469
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,320
not money.

470
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,159
We'll get them

471
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,199
to buy back the IOUs at a discount.

472
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,760
Who's going to buy them back?

473
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,719
We'll draw lots.

474
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,559
Whoever is drawn will go.

475
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,519
Don't worry.

476
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,639
I won't put anyone in danger.

477
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,599
Yes.

478
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,000
Just believe him.

479
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,400
It's surely no problem.

480
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,119
Cut the crap.

481
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:52,920
And last but not least,

482
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,199
we'd better...

483
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,119
We'd better have a car.

484
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,159
I have a car.

485
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,920
I bought a new car.

486
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,800
I'd like to talk to him alone.

487
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,639
It'll be fine after tonight.

488
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,800
Yes.

489
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,039
After tonight, there will be tomorrow.

490
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,559
Before we do it tonight,

491
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,079
we'll meet again.

492
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,039
Okay.

493
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,000
(I found some evidence)

494
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,280
(of your involvement)

495
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,880
(in the credit cooperatives robbery.)

496
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,639
(It's sent to Jingwei Go Master Academy.)
