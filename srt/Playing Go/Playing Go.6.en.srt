=Episode 6=
=The Fool=

3
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I didn't understand.

4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,950
There's a number

5
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,120
on Kuang Zhiguo's phone.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,920
I think it might be Qin Xiaoming's.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Why do I think that?

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,840
Because that number

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,560
has only contacted two other numbers.

10
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
One is Kuang Zhiguo.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,470
The other is

12
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,400
Wang Hongyu.

13
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,310
I think it's a number

14
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,840
just for the three of them
to stay in touch.

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,520
If that's the case,

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560
then Qin Xiaoming

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,080
is very likely to call Wang Hongyu again.

18
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,910
That's just your own speculation.

19
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,120
Where's the evidence?

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,560
How can you prove

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
that this number

22
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,240
really belongs to Qin Xiaoming?

23
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,870
I wasn't finished talking.

24
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,800
Where are you going?

25
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,520
See that?

26
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,750
His reaction changed
the moment I brought up that number.

27
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,310
What do you think?

28
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,630
Same way you did.

29
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,910
Does that count as evidence?

30
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,550
Captain.

31
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,750
That number just made a move.

32
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,430
Who did it call?

33
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,280
Wang Hongyu.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,150
Just moments ago.

35
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,470
The call lasted thirteen seconds.

36
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,710
Where was it made from?

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,750
Right here in the city.

38
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,630
What now?

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
Bring out the tools.

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,750
Captain, what tools?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,190
What do you think?

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
The surveillance van.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,240
I didn't think we'd be using it so soon.

44
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,310
Tomorrow, I'll send Wang Hongyu
a big gift.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
That peddle of yours is nice.

46
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,470
I'll get you another one.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
The kind the national team uses.

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,590
What are you listening to?

49
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,520
Lifestyle channel.

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
A legal show is next.

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Turn it off.

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,630
How'd you know
to ask him for three million?

53
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,390
I did the math on his goods.

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,310
All that smuggled stuff of his?

55
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,600
I went to the mall

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
and looked at the prices.

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,630
That warehouse of his

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,950
has about that much worth.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
He can afford it.

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
Around 2 p.m. tomorrow,

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,750
I'll send you a message.

62
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,360
When it shows up

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,920
on your pager, call him.

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,910
Alright.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
You sure this will ll work?

66
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,480
I mean, how are you so sure?

67
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,000
(Go Record Book)
Know the game, know the man.

68
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,560
Take a look at this script.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,630
Rewrite it the way you guys talk.

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,870
But don't change the meaning at all.

71
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,240
You need to make him feel

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
like you're right there with him.

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,430
Like you're watching his every move.

74
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,560
Read it for me. I want to hear.

75
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay.

76
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Mr. Wang,

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
are you ready?

78
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
I'll tell you the time and place

79
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
of the meeting later.

80
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,430
Don't bring anyone with you.

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
Anyone around you right now?

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,240
Who's that fool sitting across from you?

83
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,750
I think that sounds a bit too...

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,870
Right about now, he'll start to panic.

85
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
He won't be able to speak.

86
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,870
Continue.

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,510
Don't bother to look.

88
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,750
You won't find it.

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
What is his name?

90
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
He will say it's Cui Ye.

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,360
Send him in for the exchange.

92
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll be in touch.

93
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,230
Well?

94
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,240
I think it's about time.

95
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,240
Alright, I'm heading back.

96
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,870
Get some rest.

97
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,870
Tomorrow...

98
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,680
Relax. I won't run off.

99
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Everything is going
according to your plan.

100
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,240
Huh?

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,430
How did we drift out here?

102
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,750
Who told you to untie the rope?

103
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,310
You didn't tell me to keep it tied.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,720
We're out of gas.

105
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,950
You tossed away both barrels
that I bought!

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,920
You just blew our cover.

107
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Now what?

108
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,560
Sorry for what?

110
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,240
I shouldn't have snapped at you today.

111
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,430
It's okay.

112
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
It was my fault anyway.

113
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,870
Sometimes,

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,430
I can be kinda clueless.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,510
What exactly is your son sick with?

116
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,240
Why are you risking your life?

117
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,080
There was a scientist
in the UK named Hawking.

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Have you heard of him?

119
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Is he the one...

120
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
You know,

121
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
like this?

122
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,680
And his hands...

123
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
Sorry.

124
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,440
Didn't mean to.

125
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,960
That's actually a mild case.

126
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,390
They call it

127
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,270
motor neuron disease.

128
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Bit by bit, every muscle in the body

129
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,480
starts to slowly

130
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,000
freeze up,

131
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,960
one part at a time.

132
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
It goes numb.

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
The doctor said

134
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,600
the treatment would cost a fortune.

135
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,790
Once we pull this off,

136
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,960
we'll have the money.

137
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,750
Once we get the money,

138
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
you can get your son treated.

139
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,000
What else do you have in mind?

140
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,270
My son's name is Cui Yangao.

141
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,720
I like

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,080
a Go player from the Tang dynasty

143
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,670
named Wang Jixin.

144
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
"Jixin"

145
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
means

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,120
a pile of firewood.

147
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,670
So I named my son Yangao.

148
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,550
The former builds the firewood,

149
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,360
the latter ignites the flame.

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,910
I had hoped

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
he would be more ambitious than I am.

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
But now,

153
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
I just try to give him and my mother

154
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,600
a good life.

155
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
What about you?

156
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
I am paying off my father's debt.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
My dad

158
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,200
used to run a factory.

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Then, he got scammed.

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,910
Once the debt is paid off...

161
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,240
I don't know what I'll do.

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
I used to just follow my brother.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,630
Whatever he told me to do, I did it.

164
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
But he is gone now.

165
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,080
He only left me this.

166
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,960
He got it for me when I was little.

167
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
He said if I wore it,

168
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,600
it would ward off bad luck

169
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
and cure everything.

170
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,390
Here, take it.

171
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,390
Your son is sick.

172
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,550
Maybe this will help.

173
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,630
Your brother gave it to you.

174
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,360
You should really keep it.

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
Take it.

176
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,030
It is powerful.

177
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,150
- Powerful.
- Your brother gave it to you.

178
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,320
You must take care of it.

179
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,910
- I want you to have it.
- Listen to me.

180
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,320
I can't take it.

181
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,270
Just take it.

182
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,750
No, it's from your brother.

183
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,590
Lights!

184
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,630
Yan.

185
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,120
Do you know about
Ocean Park Hong Kong, China?

186
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,440
You like fish, don't you?

187
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,670
Over in Hong Kong, China,

188
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,630
there are all kinds of fish

189
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,960
you've never seen before.

190
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,240
I'll take you there, okay?

191
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,870
Dad.

192
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,910
You're like a different person now.

193
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,390
Am I?

194
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,670
How so?

195
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,750
Hard to say.

196
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,840
Come on, eat up.

197
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,940
(Lanshui City Civil Affairs Bureau)

198
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,840
Is there anyone around you right now?

199
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Then, who's that fool
sitting across from you?

200
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,030
Then, who's that fool
sitting across from you?

201
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
(Why haven't you come yet? Shuhua)

202
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,340
(I've been waiting for you. Shuhua)

203
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,380
(Xiasheng, one more chance. Meet me
at the gate of Yushan Lake Park. Xia Yu)

204
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,540
(Yushan Lake Park)

205
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,240
Yesterday...

206
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,120
Sorry.

207
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,480
I actually checked the time

208
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
and planned it to the minute.

209
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,270
But then

210
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,840
something urgent came up.

211
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,030
And then, he came back.

212
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Well,

213
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
like a pig

214
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
with a straw hat.

215
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
It was all too insane.

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,840
The moment you left,
I gave him an earful.

217
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,920
It's mostly because

218
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,270
his brain isn't all there.

219
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,390
He can't control his emotions.

220
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
Still mad?

221
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,910
Come on, don't be mad.

222
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,910
But if you're still mad,

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
what can I do for you?

224
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,920
I can...

225
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,240
Go ahead and be mad, then.

226
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,720
The point is,

227
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,870
what he did was wrong.

228
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,320
What really happened

229
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,480
at the time was...

230
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,790
- Later I...
- Apologize.

231
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
I am sorry.

232
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
I've reflected on it.

233
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
I promise

234
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,030
this won't happen again.

235
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,600
Roller coaster or pirate ship?

236
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,840
Pick one.

237
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,670
You decide.

238
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
This time,

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,440
you get to decide.

240
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
Well?

241
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Is the signal good enough?

242
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,550
Signal strength is good.

243
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,830
We've studied his phone.

244
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,310
As long as we find that message

245
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,310
and open it, we're in.

246
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,830
Give me the stuff.

247
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,830
You're not even going to wrap it?

248
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,160
Ding, why didn't you wrap it.

249
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,920
Please follow the rules

250
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,400
for all amusement
facilities in the park.

251
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,070
Line up in an orderly manner for tickets.

252
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,310
Parents, please keep an eye
on your children

253
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,070
while they are playing.

254
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,000
Are you serious?

255
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,030
Are you scared?

256
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,200
Ride it with me, and I'll forgive you.

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,840
Come in.

258
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,010
Mr. Wang.

259
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,400
Gao Shuhua took the day off.

260
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,750
She said you'd be aware.

261
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,870
Alright.

262
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,350
Tell the front desk I'm not

263
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,440
seeing any visitors for now.

264
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,310
Understood.

265
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,070
What about an uninvited guest like me?

266
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,430
Captain Cui.

267
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,790
What brings you here today?

268
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,160
Busy day, Mr. Wang?

269
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,350
- Come on, please, have a seat.
- Then I won't stay long.

270
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,240
No.

271
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,090
I'm not busy.

272
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,640
Just busy for nothing.

273
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,680
I was just passing by.

274
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,030
Someone gave me a peddle.

275
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,000
They said it's what the pros use.
Take a look.

276
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,310
What do I know?

277
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,960
Nice paddle.

278
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,000
It's a defensive paddle.

279
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,200
But you're more of
a smash player, Captain Cui?

280
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,790
Can you get used to this?

281
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,110
Yeah, I like smashing.

282
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,750
You use it.

283
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,640
You play penhold.

284
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,830
I use shakehand grip.

285
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,880
Sure.

286
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
Thank you.

287
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,440
Captain Cui, you know me so well.

288
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,350
Let's set up a match sometime.

289
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,590
Definitely.

290
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,000
You got my number?

291
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,400
Let me give it to you.

292
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,630
It's coming in.

293
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,640
- Save it.
- Got it.

294
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,510
Saving it now.

295
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,760
Good. Let's set up that match.

296
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,830
Alright, I'm off.

297
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,670
See you.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,480
- Take care.
- See you.

299
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,590
Thanks for the paddle.

300
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,950
You're welcome.

301
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,630
Mr. Cui.

302
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,070
Mr. Wang is not in today.

303
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,200
I can help you
make an appointment instead.

304
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,070
No need.

305
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,750
Mr. Wang told me

306
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,110
to come pick up a fee

307
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,350
for playing Go with him.

308
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,720
Is Mr. Wang in?

309
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,270
Yeah, he just said
I did a poor job mopping.

310
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,640
Page 1825.

311
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,550
Take him out.

312
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
We can't send that word?

313
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,750
Well, make a move.

314
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,430
Okay.

315
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,790
Captain Cui.

316
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,880
That tech you mentioned earlier

317
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
is a surveillance command van?

318
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,110
You can hear exactly

319
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,270
what the bad guys say
on their calls through it.

320
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,550
Brave pirates,

321
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,070
are you ready?

322
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,270
Our adventure is about to begin.

323
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,590
Let us sail the pirate ship

324
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,350
and raise our sails.

325
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,550
Let us seek the legendary treasure.

326
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,030
Press forward.

327
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,510
Fear nothing.

328
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,540
(Make a move)

329
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,800
It's connected.

330
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,510
Link established. Signal is stable.

331
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,150
Incoming call.

332
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,550
Same number as before.

333
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
Is the money ready?

334
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,440
I will send you
the time and place later.

335
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,030
Do not bring your people.

336
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,830
Is anyone around you right now?

337
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,830
No, no one near me.

338
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,960
Then, who is that fool across from you?

339
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,910
He...

340
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,000
He fainted.

341
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,430
Hello?

342
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Hello?

343
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,110
Play that part again.

344
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,310
Turn up the volume.

345
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,750
Is the money ready?

346
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,200
I will send you
the time and place later.

347
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,310
Do not bring your people.

Yushan Lake Park.

351
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
Call Yushan Police Station.

352
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,350
Have them help seal off the park.

353
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Quick.

354
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,480
Ding and Ma,

355
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,680
follow that ambulance.

356
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,520
Stick close.

(Dear visitors, due to a safety incident
in the park...)

366
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,000
Slow down. Don't rush.

367
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,510
- Please show your ID.
- Did you bring your ID?

368
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,880
Is there any other exit?

369
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,240
Why are you hiding from them?

370
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,430
Is there?

371
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,590
All good.

372
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,000
If you are awake, get up.

373
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,840
You're okay.

374
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,590
Why were you climbing the wall?

375
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,070
Well...

376
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,240
We didn't buy tickets.

377
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,070
I told you to buy tickets.

378
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,100
This is so embarrassing.

379
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,280
Yeah.

380
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,070
I was too ashamed to say it.

381
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,150
It's embarrassing.

382
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,240
Take them to buy tickets. Let them go.

383
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
Come with me to get the tickets.

384
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,070
What are you doing, sir?

385
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,880
You are not allowed
to stop here without permission.

386
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,200
Relax. He is fine.

387
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,110
The park is closed. Please leave.

388
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,750
I need to use the bathroom too.

389
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,240
Don't sneak in next time.

390
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Got it.

391
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,950
Hello?

392
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,750
Change of plan. Power off now.

393
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,020
(Search name: Qin Xiaoming)

394
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,300
(Yushan Lake Park)

395
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,400
The number you dialed is powered off.

396
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,000
Qin Xiaoming!

397
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,630
Mr. Cui?

398
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,280
Mr. Cui.

399
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,720
It's me.

400
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,630
Ding.

401
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,110
I took the statement.

402
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,630
Right.

403
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,310
What are you doing here?

404
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,070
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Cui.

405
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,510
Are you sure you're okay?

406
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,910
I'm fine.

407
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,990
Captain said he'll give you
a ride home later.

408
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Wait here for me, okay?

409
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,090
I need to file a statement.

410
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,350
Mr. Cui's statement.

411
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,720
(Criminal Investigation Division Office)

412
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,830
Log it right away.

413
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,380
(Qin Xiaoming)

414
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,350
(Kuang Zhiguo, Wang Hongyu)
I'll walk Mr. Cui out.

415
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,350
(Missing since April 9)
Alright, go ahead.

416
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,260
(Macau, China Bathhouse)

417
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,000
Mr. Cui, you can't go in there.

418
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,180
Then you...

419
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,820
(Criminal Investigation Division Office)

420
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,510
Where is your restroom?

421
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,940
(Men)

422
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,030
Why were you looking for Wang Hongyu?

423
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,510
Didn't your people already question me?

424
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,880
Ask them.

425
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm asking you.

426
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,680
I ask, you answer.

427
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,840
We were

428
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,830
supposed to run
a Go master class together.

429
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,310
He promised to help me.

430
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,830
But, when I went to his office today,

431
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,400
he was constantly on the phone.

432
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,510
He said right in front of me

433
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,000
that no one else was there.

434
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,310
What was that supposed to mean?

435
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,240
Did I not count as a person?

436
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,070
I was so angry

437
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,030
I couldn't breathe.

438
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,160
ThenI woke up in the ambulance.

439
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,200
Then, I was brought here.

440
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,880
Is that enough for you?

441
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,510
There was just a call
to Qin Xiaoming from a number.

442
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,110
Did we trace the owner?

443
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,720
It's an unregistered number.

444
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,620
(Qin?)

445
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,270
Time to switch cars, buddy.

446
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,240
The phone's dead.

447
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,550
When did you get a phone?

448
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,510
What else are you hiding from me?

449
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,960
What's the number?

450
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,000
What is it?

451
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,960
It's 13903800983.

452
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,440
I am not asking for myself.

453
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,790
I am asking on Mom's behalf.

454
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Did you tell Mom?

455
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
I live with her every day.

456
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,750
How could she not know?

457
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,550
Then, why didn't you tell me?

458
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,160
She was too busy and forgot.

459
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,960
Where are we going?

460
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,790
This is not the way home.

461
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,440
Where are we driving to?

462
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:53,540
(Hongkang Health Center)

463
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,190
Go get a checkup when you have time.

464
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,280
You are not young anymore.

465
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,070
Mom told me about Yangao.

466
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,560
I know you didn't want me to find out.

467
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,710
So, I won't say much.

468
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
He is just a little boy.

469
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,630
At that age, he is a handful.

470
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,360
You need to pay more attention.

471
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,160
This is for you.

472
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,510
Emergency heart pills.

473
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,300
(Emergency Heart Pills)

474
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,590
Let me walk you up.

475
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Never mind. You go do your thing.

476
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,110
You just got off an ambulance.

477
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,230
Mom went to pick up Yan.

478
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,150
She will be back soon.

479
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,760
How did your awards end up in the box?

480
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,630
Yan has been taking care of the fish.

481
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,110
He treats it like a treasure.

482
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,840
Is that the one I bought?

483
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,230
I don't have to cook
for you tonight, do I?

484
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Keep this on you.

485
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,360
It might save your life one day.

486
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,760
Come with me to the Youth Center now.

487
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,510
Wang Hongyu?

488
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,960
This ledger belongs to Wang Hongyu.

489
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,230
No doubt about it.

490
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,670
Are you heading back to the office?

491
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,110
I lost my ID.

492
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,600
Could I have left it at your office?

493
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,590
You are always losing things.

494
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,880
How do you even lose your ID?

495
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,710
What is going on in that head of yours?

496
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,630
I'll ask my colleagues to check.

497
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,920
Can you swing by and pick it up for me?

498
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
I am not going back.

499
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,320
We are already on Yulan Road.

500
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,400
Don't worry.

501
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,180
If it is really at the office,
it won't get lost.

502
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,920
Alright then.

503
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,960
Driver, to the Youth Center.

504
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,510
Avoid Yulan Road.
Take the detour through Huatang.

505
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,350
To the Youth Center?

506
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,440
Yulan Road is the shortest.

507
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,920
School just let out. It is jammed.

508
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,290
Take the detour through Huatang.

509
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,950
Step on it.

510
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,800
I just wrapped up a case.

511
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,280
I was passing by.

512
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
I wanted to check in on my brother

513
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
and see how he is doing lately.

514
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,440
He told me

515
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,710
someone has been working with him

516
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,840
on a master class.

517
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,190
Yes, a master class.

518
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,840
As for the master class,

519
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,670
I have been planning it for a while.

520
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,360
My goal is to apply Go's strategies

521
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,280
to the business world.

522
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,960
We can help entrepreneurs
improve their cultural literacy.

523
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,710
Thank you, Principal.

524
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,110
I will take a look in his office.

525
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,150
Don't tell him I was here.

526
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,990
Don't worry.

527
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,460
(Teachers' Office)

528
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Within the board,
we map the course of life.

529
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,280
We still need a stable investor.

530
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,280
Captain, this is way too detailed.

531
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,960
Mr. Cui was just a fluke.

532
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,360
How could he be involved?

533
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,960
Watch your mouth.

534
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,800
Understood.

535
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
What is the number?

536
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,710
What is it?

537
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,590
It's 13903800983.

538
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,480
The number you dialed
is not in service.
