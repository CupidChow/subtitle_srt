1
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Come on.

2
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,560
What do you think of this place?

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,760
After the robbery,

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,079
we'll hide here for a few days.

5
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,879
Come on.

6
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
Take it.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,239
Come on.

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,439
Lei.

9
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,479
Have an orange.

10
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,479
Let's smoke.

11
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,879
Light my cigarette.

12
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,199
Light my cigarette.

13
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,759
Nice lighter.

14
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
Go.

15
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,439
Go.

16
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,319
There are several police stations

17
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
around the credit cooperatives.

18
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,680
I don't think it's safe.

19
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,879
Talk to Li

20
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,490
and tell him consider the one
on the west side of the city.

21
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
We've been scouting
the place a few times.

22
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,199
We even kidnapped a guy
from the credit cooperatives.

23
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,720
We've put in the effort.

24
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,079
Just drive the van safe, you hear me?

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:30,300

27
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,959
Sir, what do you need?

28
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,839
I need a hammer.

Captain Cui,

32
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,240
you've lost weight in a few days.

33
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,120
You don't look so good,

34
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Captain Cui.

35
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,000
Thank you.

36
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,560
You didn't get much sleep?

37
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,700
The corrections officer
said you were behaving well.

38
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,519
That's why I came to see you.

39
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,439
I want to give you one last chance.

40
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,079
Tell me something useful.

41
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,720
Who were the people blackmailing you?

42
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,639
Look, I'm in good shape now, right?

43
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm finding

44
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,039
that I'm living

45
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,120
on a regular schedule

46
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,840
and eating healthier in here.

47
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
That's good.

48
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,039
It's pretty much the same actually.

49
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,639
Look, when I was outside,

50
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,759
my secretary

51
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
arranged everything for me, right?

52
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,159
In here,

53
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,799
you guys arrange it for me.

54
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,879
I just do what I'm told.

55
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,559
This place suits you.

56
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,039
I've realized

57
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm good at nothing else

58
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,039
but dealing with myself.

59
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
When I was having good times,

60
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,159
I enjoyed them.

61
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,279
But when I'm down,

62
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,440
I just jump out

63
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
and look at myself

64
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,480
like I'm reading a story
from Story Collections.

65
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,320
You want to read stories?

66
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,000
Is it that good?

67
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,919
Yes.

68
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,279
The most important thing

69
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,440
is that it depends

70
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,799
on what you can realize.

71
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
Looks like I've come to see you today

72
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,200
for nothing again.

73
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,039
You're right.

74
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,159
But I can tell you
what I've just come to realize.

75
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Actually,

76
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,919
I used to think

77
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,600
that society

78
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,919
was no different from nature.

79
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,440
Everyone

80
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,480
has their own ecological niche.

81
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
So does nature.

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,759
Right?

83
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,519
There are wolves

84
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
and there are sheep.

85
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,960
It's only natural

86
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,080
for wolves to eat sheep.

87
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,240
But now I realize
it doesn't seem right either.

88
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,399
In human society,

89
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,399
both wolves and sheep

90
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,679
eat money.

91
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,639
And

92
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,799
when you think you're a wolf,

93
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
you end up finding out

94
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,639
you're a sheep.

95
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,039
Both wolves and sheep

96
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,559
are in cages.

97
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,559
From my point of view,

98
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,759
you're in a cage too.

99
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,360
Interesting, isn't it?

100
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,799
You're a sheep?

101
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,519
Yes, I am.

102
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,919
Who's the wolf then?

103
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,559
I don't know.

104
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm not a cop.

105
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,919
I'm warning you,
don't beat around the bush.

106
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,159
Try to get some credit.

107
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,919
Don't give me that.

108
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,919
I know the law.

109
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,519
I know exactly how many years

110
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,639
to serve for my crimes.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Now, I

112
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,440
just want to watch the story.

113
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,519
Okay.

114
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,559
Just you watch.

115
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,159
The interesting one

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,480
will begin soon.

117
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,200
Okay.

118
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm watching.

119
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,759
It's actually a pretty
good story right now.

120
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,559
You're

121
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,080
part of it.

122
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,440
(Lanshui City Detention Center)

123
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
Captain,

124
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
Wang Hongyu must know something.

125
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,440
Why won't he tell us?

126
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
It's time to end it.

127
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,480
Mr. Cui.

128
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,240
Didn't I tell you not
to come here so often?

129
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,559
You have to trust my management skills.

130
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,039
Be gentle,

131
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,879
they're all in meditation.

132
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,279
What are you looking for?

133
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,759
Has anyone been here today?

134
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,399
Everyone's here.

135
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,120
Did anyone come to deliver anything?

136
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,360
No.

137
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,080
Ask the receptionist.

138
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
Mr. Cui.

139
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,919
The printing fee is 24 yuan for one set.

140
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,330
Get it the day after tomorrow.

141
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,519
I need it fast.

142
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,159
Tomorrow.

143
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I need it by today.

144
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
I can't make it.

145
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,620
There are many orders in front of you.

146
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
I can't believe we're here to meet.

147
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,000
What brings you here?

148
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,639
I'm here to take a photo for my ID.

149
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,399
Look at me,
after taking the photo, I feel like

150
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,879
I'm getting old.

151
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,039
What do you think?

152
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
Old or not, you're still the same.

153
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
What are you doing here?

154
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
Me?

155
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,559
To take a photo.

156
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
You need to tidy it up.

157
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,840
Why is there a gap here?

158
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
It's like a dog bite.

159
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,639
Taking a photo

160
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,759
captures the moment of your life.

161
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,320
It can't be changed.

162
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,480
It's good now.

163
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,039
I'll wait for you.

164
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,159
Are you done?

165
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,080
Let's have a meal.

166
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,799
No, I have a game date tonight.

167
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
I knew you'd say that.

168
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,279
Forget it.

171
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,799
Hello.

172
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,599
You...

173
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,359
Who are you?

174
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,920
(Meet me at 6:30PM later
at Zhongshan Road with the hush money)

175
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,519
Cui Yangao.

176
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,160
Mom?

177
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,359
Why are you here?

178
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,200
Yan, can you come back
to Grandma's house with me later?

179
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,440
Mom,

180
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
what's wrong with you?

181
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm fine.

182
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,300
We're going to Grandma's
to spend a few days with them.

183
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,550
I've asked your homeroom teacher
for a leave of absence.

184
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,680
Pack your bag.

185
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,559
We're leaving.

186
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,920
You haven't seen your grandparents
or a long time, have you?

187
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,359
Don't you miss them?

188
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:30,880
I do.

189
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,640
Mom,

190
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,200
does Dad know about this?

191
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,000
He does.

192
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,359
Mom,

193
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,759
did Dad

194
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,200
make you angry again?

195
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,400
Dad says

196
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
I'll be cured,

197
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,000
but I know he's just trying
to reassure me.

198
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Mom,

199
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,359
did my illness

200
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,279
cause you to fight?

201
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,880
Yan,

202
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,559
I'm fine with your dad.

203
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,680
You'll be fine too.

204
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,200
Ye, where have you been?

205
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,119
I called you and you didn't answer.

206
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,759
Shuhua left with Yan,

207
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,599
leaving behind a note.

208
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,400
She said she'd take Yan away
for a few days

209
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,079
and asked us not to look for her.

210
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,200
But Yan has to go to school.

211
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,279
Why did she suddenly
take Yan away with her?

212
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,880
Have you done something wrong to her?

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,710
You've been coming home
so late these days.

214
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,510
You're still out
in the middle of the night.

215
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
You think I don't know?

216
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,370
That night you went out secretly,

217
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,759
and Shuhua went out with you.

218
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,440
When she came back,
she didn't look right.

219
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,119
What's wrong with you two?

220
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,079
Mom,

221
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,119
we're fine.

222
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,680
Fine?

223
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,559
Then go and find them.

224
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,359
Mom, don't worry.

225
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,880
They'll be back.

226
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,640
Mom, what are you doing?

227
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,039
I'm calling Wei.

228
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,440
I'll tell him to find them.

229
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:43,279
I told you!

230
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,359
They'll come back!

231
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,119
Ye,

232
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,559
what have you been doing out there?

233
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,440
Are you hiding something from me?

234
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,640
Tell me.

235
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,519
Mom, come here.

236
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,440
I don't care where Shuhua goes,

237
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,880
she has to come back.

238
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,200
She must come back

239
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,119
because Yan is sick

240
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,170
and will be paralyzed
for the rest of his life.

241
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
It's going to cost a lot of money
to cure him.

242
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm the only one who can get him cured.

243
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,279
Mom, do you understand?

244
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,920
Mom,

245
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,759
don't call my brother again.

246
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,319
He knows everything about Yan.

247
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,480
(Tomb of Beloved Father Cui Weimin
and Mother Lu Qiuping)

248
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,440
Cui.

249
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
Can you see everything

250
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
from over there?

251
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,759
Did you already know

252
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,279
that Yan's sick?

253
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm the only one who didn't know?

254
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,039
When you were here,

255
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,279
you always

256
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,960
hid things from me

257
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,359
and didn't tell me

258
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,920
what was on your mind.

259
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,279
Now the kids

260
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,440
are hiding everything from me too.

261
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,359
Sometimes,

262
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,119
I'd like to switch with you.

263
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Let me lie in there

264
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,839
and I wouldn't have
to worry about anything.

265
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,319
When I'm done with my business,

266
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,359
I'll take you to Hong Kong, China.

267
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,480
The conditions there are good.

268
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,079
I'm sure you'll wake up.

269
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,599
When you wake up,

270
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,200
if you like it,

271
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,759
we'll stay there

272
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,319
and open a shop

273
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,839
or a factory

274
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,440
or anything.

275
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,759
If you don't like it,

276
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,200
I'll go with you wherever you want.

277
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
As long as you wake up,

278
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,319
I promise you

279
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,680
that no matter what happens tomorrow,

280
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,359
we'll just look ahead

281
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,319
and never look back.

282
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay?

283
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,559
I've never accomplished anything.

284
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,310
Getting you to be my girlfriend

285
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,480
is the proudest thing I've ever done.

286
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,039
When you wake up,

287
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,759
we'll get married.

288
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,359

handling the crime scene.

345

we haven't found any valuable clues.

She's a little shocked,

349
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,239
but she's fine.

350
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,599
Calm down, Aunt.

351
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,800
It's all right.

352
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,159
Don't worry.

353
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,199
Keep an eye on her.

354
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,120
Tell me if there's anything.

355
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,800
Okay.

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,440

360
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Hello.

361
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,800
Okay.

362
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,840
What did he say?

363
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,960
He's waiting for us at Mazu Temple.
