00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,760
Captain, you're back.

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,670
Captain, you're back.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,000
You didn't bring back any

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
local specialities?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, we did.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,320
But we ate them on the way back.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,520
We were worried you hadn't eaten.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,470
Have some.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,880
Have you found Xia Yu?

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,520
Not yet, Captain.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,670
We've confirmed

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,320
that Xia Yu is an employee
of Yueshi Textile Factory.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,430
She lives in 402, Block 3,
Village Two, Heping District.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,670
Her mother died young,

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,070
and she's been living
with her father all her life.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,510
But now, not only can't Xia Yu be found,

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,430
even her father,

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,920
Xia Haitao, has disappeared.

21
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:10,046
We also visited the factory
where Xia Yu works.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,310
There was an incident
at the factory a few days ago,

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,000
and it seems to have something
to do with Xia Yu.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
The factory workers said

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,640
they last saw Xia Yu

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,680
three days ago.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,680
At that time, one of the factory workers
was going to jump from a building

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,230
and was saved by a young man.

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,510
Xia Yu left the factory
with this young man.

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,680
It's Jin Xiasheng.

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,950
He's really back.

32
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,590
Zoom in on this photo later.

33
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,790
Yes.

34
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,710
(Criminal No. 2, left of the backseat)
Jin Chunsheng and Jin Xiasheng,

35
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,700
a year ago, due to family tragedy,

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,060
came to our city from Dantong, Liaojiang.

37
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,060
From the bloodstain on the fishing boat,

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,140
we can deduce

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,060
that it was Jin Xiasheng
who lured us away

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,420
with Qin Xiaoming's phone.

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,780
I also went to his aunt
and uncle's house to find out more.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,580
His physical description generally matches

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,220
that of the hostage's confession.

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,060
We can deduce

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,260
that the fifth robber

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,780
in the credit cooperatives

47
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,260
robbery is Jin Xiasheng.

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,860
Reward me with a bowl of soup, please.

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,860
(Integrity and Righteousness)

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,700
Du Chunpeng

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,420
died at sea,

52
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,860
killed by another accomplice.

53
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,980
But the box next to him

54
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,420
contained hell money.

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,980
So now we have reason to deduce

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,940
that Jin Xiasheng hooked up

57
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,660
with Qin Xiaoming after he escaped.

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,540
They conspired

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,300
to blackmail Wang Hongyu.

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,260
Wang Hongyu

61
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,260
asked Du Chunpeng to send them money.

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Exchanging bombs for real money

63
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,980
to kill them.

64
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,380
But Qin Xiaoming and the gang
had already guessed Wang Hongyu's plan.

65
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,740
They replaced the real money
with hell money in advance.

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,700
The real money was already taken
by Qin Xiaoming and Jin Xiasheng.

67
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,860
You have a point.

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,500
But I have a doubt.

69
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,980
I went to the dock

70
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,500
after I got back from the Northeast.

71
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,140
No one ever saw Qin Xiaoming.

72
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
According to the fishermen
in the neighbourhood,

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,860
there's someone else with Jin Xiasheng.

74
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,820
He didn't show up much.

75
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,540
They can't even tell what he looks like.

76
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,980
If you can't understand

77
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,640
your opponent's moves in a game of go,

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,770
there must be some hidden message

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,380
that you haven't discovered.

80
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,820
This...

81
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,460
That's not what I said,

82
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,880
that's what my younger brother said.

83
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,140
That Qin Xiaoming

84
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,420
might not be this Qin Xiaoming.

Why don't we change our target?

89

When I was back home,
I knew all the guys in this business

90
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,980
were gangsters.

91

A friend of my brother

92
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,540
got into trouble with them

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,540
and lost his arm.

94
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,520
That's why my dad didn't dare
to mess with them

even though he was broke.

96
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,100
We don't borrow money from him.

97
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,220
What are you afraid of?

98
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,980
They're the prey now,

99
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,660
we're the hunters.

100

of what you're going to do?

101

Pretty much.

102
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,900
If we're going to do it the way I plan,

103
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,220
we'll have to find another person.

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,540
The two of us aren't enough.

110
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,340

who's a driver.

At that time,

135
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,540
he was robbed

136
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
the day before

137
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,660
and got his head bashed in,

138
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,300
so he quit.

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Tell me more.

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,020
No. Where's the guy
who got his head bashed in?

142
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,540

he's not very tall,

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,860
and he's got long hair

148
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,670
that's always covering this side
of his head.

149
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,180
You mean the one-eared guy?

150
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,280
Yes.

151
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,220
He quit his job.

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,980
Well, do you have

153
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,500
any contact information of him

154
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,620
or where else can I find him?

155

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,860
Well,

166
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,980
do you want

167
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,580
to do something big with me?

168
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,580
What's that guy

190
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,460
been doing there?

191
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,980
He's been playing
with his electronic pet.

192
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
What is it?

193
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,860
The one

194
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,300
that beeps

195
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,670
and clicks in his hand.

196
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Anyway, it's just

197
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,740
a game.

198
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,940
Kittens and puppies in a game.

199

A lot of kids play them.

200
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,980
What does it mean?

201
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
It means

202
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,260
kittens and puppies in a game.

203
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,860
Is there any other candidate?

204
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
No, I'm from out of town.

205
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,820
You're a local.
Don't you have any friends?

206
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,980
Okay, let me think about it.

Sir,

209
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,100
choose one.

210
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,380
Is this

211
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,980
an electronic pet?

212
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,380
Yes.

213
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,140
This is a second generation product.

214
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,260
It has all kinds of pets,

215
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,500
and they won't die.

216
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,740
I'll buy one for my child.

217
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,740
Is it a boy or a girl?

218
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,340
A boy.

219
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,540
Take a look over here.

220
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,060
These.

Mom's making soup today.

224
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,700
She has to keep an eye on it.

225
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,980
What about you?

226
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,460
I have something to do today.

227
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,340
Just near home.

228
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,820
I might be home a little late.

I could handle it.

Yeah.

Is there a protosalanx chinensis
from Dantong for sale here?

269
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,060
You cops are really particular.

Sit down.

316
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
All right.

317
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,940
Don't take it off.

318
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,260
Come on,

319
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,780
taste

320
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,340
the Mingqian tea

321
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,340
an old colleague of mine gave me.

322
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,340
I brought it especially for you.

323
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,860
Try it.

324
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,380
This old comrade of mine said

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,420
that many people

326
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,100
are now competing for spots
in this advanced course.

327
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,780
What do you really think?

328
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,540
It's really good tea.

329
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
I've been

330
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,060
reinstated.

331
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,780
I'll do what I have to do.

332
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,700
It doesn't conflict with your work.

333
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,580
It's better

334
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,780
to think things through early.

335
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,060
There are very few courses

336
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,780
at this level.

337
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,020
Few opportunities,

338
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,420
but many people want to get in.

339
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,780
You know

340
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,860
that Zhao took a lot of risks for you

341
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,580
when you went
to the Northeast this time.

342
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,620
Do you know why?

343
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,260
He didn't defend you

344
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,420
just because

345
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,660
you're good at solving cases.

346
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,900
More importantly...

347
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,100
Your honour.

348
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,260
My honour

349
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
has retired as long as I have.

350
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,900
I don't think so.

351
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,660
He thinks

352
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,620
he should

353
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,820
keep you as a good talent.

354
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,100
He thinks you should go higher.

355
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,060
Climb the hill, you know?

356
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,900
Climb the hill.

357
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,020
I got it.

358
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,100
Well,

359
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
these two days...

360
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Are you done?

361
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,140
I have to help her,
or we won't be able to eat.

362
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,700
I'm coming.

363
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
I'll get you some help.

364
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
It's time for dinner.

365
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,700
Dad.

366
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,020
You're pretending to study, huh?

367
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,860
No.

368
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,340
When did you come back?

369
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
I never left.

370
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,100
Why are you wearing this...

371
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,420
Nothing.

372
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,340
Are you okay?

373
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,540
What happened?

374
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,340
You can see it?

375
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
It's healed.

376
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,700
It's okay. It's just a bump.

377
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,360
Doesn't that make me look more handsome?

378
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,330
What is this?

379
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,020
You've been studying hard.

380
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,780
Eat this for your health.

381
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,780
Fierce fish from Yinglu River.

382
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,220
I thought it was much bigger.

383
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,180
It's called protosalanx chinensis.

384
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,580
And you're my big baby.

385
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,620
Are you a size large?

386
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,780
I'll eat with Yangao tomorrow.

387
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,490
He even brought me a present
when he came back from Hong Kong, China.

388
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,544
They're back?

389
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Shall we go to their house

390
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,420
and see them for dinner or something?

391
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,580
Okay.

392
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,740
No problem.

393
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,410
All right, let's have dinner first.

394
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,260
Dad,

395
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,140
- it's time for dinner.
- Let's eat.

396
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,180
Who's it?

397
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,340
Mr. Cui,

398
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,740
you haven't gone home yet.

399
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,900
Why haven't you left yet too?

400
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,740
I just talked to the two bosses.

401
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,460
I didn't know you were here.

402
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
If I knew you were here,

403
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,140
we could entertain them together.

404
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
All right.

405
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,140
Have an early rest.

406
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
I'll be going.

407
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,020
Do you know

408
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
about electronic pets?

409
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,860
I do.

410
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,580
My daughter

411
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,380
always asks me to feed her pet.

412
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,500
What?

413
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,900
You'd like to buy one for your son?

414
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,140
Boys

415
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,660
probably don't like it.

416
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,220
What kind of man

417
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,740
do you think he'd be

418
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,660
if he was a man,

419
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
an adult,

420
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,180
who liked to play this?

421
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,940
Mr. Cui,

422
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,380
it's not you, is it?

423
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,620
No.

424
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,580
It's one of my go buddies.

425
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,060
I'm just curious,

426
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,260
that's all.

427
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,620
Then he's

428
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,060
probably a psychopath.

429
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,380
I'm leaving.

430
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,860
Good morning.

431
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,880
You're going to visit the sick?

432
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,820
Here you are.

433
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,940
She was fine last night.

434
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,780
Don't worry.

435
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,980
Here's your money for yesterday.

436
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,180
Thank you.

437
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,380
The extra 20 yuan

438
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,140
is for your special care for her.

439
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,980
Okay.

440
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,260
That's what I should do.

441
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,940
Here are some

442
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,180
clean clothes for her.

443
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,740
Okay.

444
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,550
Does her body need to be cleaned?

445
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,620
You don't have to worry about that.

446
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,260
I'll just clean her up later.

447
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,380
Thank you.

448
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
If you have time,

449
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,900
talk to her more

450
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,420
or play her some music.

451
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,740
Just the usual stuff
she likes to listen to.

452
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,940
It might work.

453
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,820
I'll get some water.

454
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,740
Don't listen to her.

455
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,620
It's useless.

456
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I've tried everything.

457
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,740
Every day, my son and I

458
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,180
talk to him.

459
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,820
I even let him listen
to his favourite commentaries.

460
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,900
See, this old man

461
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,340
doesn't respond at all.

462
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,220
Don't worry.

463
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,700
I asked Mazu.

464
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,580
She said you'll be fine.

465
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,820
(Dunquan Safe)

466
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,700
(Dunquan Steel Safe)

467
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,460
Sir,

468
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,740
how can I help you?

469
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,620
For company or private use?

470
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,660
Just take a look.

471
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,700
Do these things sell?

472
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,260
Of course they do.

473
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,140
It's branded.

474
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,900
It's quality assured.

475
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,900
There are more rich people now.

476
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,740
They all have to use this.

477
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Boss, how much does it cost
to buy all this stuff in your shop?

478
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,580
Is this available

479
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,180
anywhere else in the city?

480
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:52,586
It's exclusive to us.
We don't have any branches.

481
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,340
Come on, sit down.

482
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,860
Let's eat.

483
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,440
It's been a long time
since our families got together.

484
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,620
We have time today.

485
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,100
You're not busy, are you?

486
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,620
It's good news
that there's a cure for Yangao.

487
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,860
You should've told us
about the good news first, right?

488
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,110
I've been so busy, I didn't get to it.

489
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,340
When are you not busy?

490
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,140
The medical expenses

491
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,980
are expensive, aren't they?

492
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,340
We're family.

493
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,060
If you're in trouble,

494
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,100
we'll work it out together.

495
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,820
Don't get involved
in our family's business.

496
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,960
If you call her sister-in-law,
how can she not care about you?

497
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,220
What kind of attitude is that?

498
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,060
What's my attitude?

499
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
What kind of attitude am I supposed
to have?

500
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,140
I don't get it.

501
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,140
Everyone in our family
has to come to you for everything?

502
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,340
Don't you think about your own problems?

503
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,420
Okay.

504
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,580
Up next...

505
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,860
I'll borrow the shortfall from you.

506
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,860
Listen to what he's saying.

507
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,820
He's a jerk, isn't he?

508
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,580
Ye,

509
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,980
in your brother's mind,

510
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,060
Lin is as important

511
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,340
as Yangao.

512
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,580
All of us here are Yangao's
closest family members.

513
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,740
We're family.

514
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,860
He doesn't think so.

515
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,380
I said that's my son.

516
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,620
Don't worry about it.

517
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,100
Is he just your son?

518
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,660
Isn't he Shuhua's son?

519
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,260
Isn't he my nephew?

520
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,020
Why are we four adults

521
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,340
eating here?

522
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,140
It's for the kid's sake, isn't it?

523
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,860
No. I'm doing it for his sake too.

524
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,980
So is he well?

525
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,100
It'll be settled soon.

526
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,780
So what are we worrying about?

527
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,620
As I said, that's our family business.

528
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,020
Stay out of it, okay?

529
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,260
I'm doing this for your sake.

530
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,060
Look at how worried Shuhua is.

531
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,100
- I'm doing it for the kid's sake.
- For the kid, got it?

532
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,500
- I don't need your help.
- I'm doing this for your sake.

533
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,420
Don't you just want to prove
that you're better than me?

534
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,380
I just don't get it.

535
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,740
- Stop it.
- I lent you the money.

536
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm not asking you for money.
Am I begging you?

537
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,140
Does that make you prideful?
I don't need your money.

538
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,540
You're nothing
but trouble in this family.

539
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,820
- Stop it.
- How dare you talk to me so rudely?

540
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,460
- Stop it.
- Cui Ye.

541
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,620
What kind of an older brother are you?

542
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,500
You...

543
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,900
You two have the same personality.

544
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,340
You both like to play the hero.

545
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,880
Look at the wound
on your brother's forehead,

546
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,860
he's covering it with bangs.

547
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,780
He's so childish.

548
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,580
Just like when he saved me.

549
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,060
He loves to be a hero.

550
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,300
Why are you saying this?

551
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,100
Dig in.

552
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,180
Don't answer the phone now.

553
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,580
Hello.

554
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,620
I'm not on the team now.

555
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,540
Jiawen,

556
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,540
sorry.

557
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,220
Jiawen,

558
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,780
isn't my brother off work?

559
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,860
He's been reinstated now.

560
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,180
Since he's busy,

561
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,140
we have something to do,
so we'll be back.

562
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,380
Shuhua.

563
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,940
That's my brother.

564
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,980
Just bear with him.

565
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,980
Why did you go to them?

566
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,820
I hope this is the last time.

567
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,220
What do you mean?

568
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,900
I'm struggling enough to get money

569
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,620
for Yan's treatment.

570
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,390
I don't want to be distracted
by other things.

571
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
And...

572
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,700
Forget it.

573
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,180
Ye,

574
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,220
we're trying to help you.

575
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,420
If you want to help me,
just do what I tell you to do.

576
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,340
If I say I can settle it, I mean it.

577
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
I told you to take good care of Yan,

578
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,140
so take good care of Yan, okay?

579
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,220
I don't know where you're getting
all this anger from.

580
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,820
I couldn't sleep all night.

581
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,460
I thought about how I could
get through this with you.

582
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,500
Your brother just came back
from the Northeast.

583
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,300
He knew about Yan's situation
and came to help us.

584
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,660
But why does it seem to you

585
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,380
like we're meddling?

586
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,060
What did you say?

587
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,980
I said...

588
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,300
My brother went to the Northeast?

589
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,900
Jiawen said it.

590
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,340
He just came back yesterday.

591
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
What did he do?

592
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,820
How do I know?

593
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
Cui Ye.

594
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,940
Cui Ye!

595
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,340
- What's the matter?
- Come here.

596
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,300
What's the matter?

597
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
Let me ask you something.

598
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,180
Who did you meet and what did you do

599
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,380
when you went back?

600
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,820
Who did you meet?

601
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,940
I met my uncle.

602
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,140
I rebuilt my dad's grave,

603
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
then I bought a gun

604
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,700
and kidnapped Hu Kuiyong.

605
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,620
Don't tell me roughly.
Tell me in detail.

606
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,340
Before I left,

607
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,860
I went to a noodle shop
for a bowl of noodles.

608
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,860
How did you get rid of the gun?

609
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,940
I threw it in the river.

610
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,820
How did you get in touch with your uncle?

611
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,420
Did you use your mobile phone?

612
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,820
No.

613
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,180
I called him from a public phone.

614
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,540
He doesn't know my phone number.

615
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,780
What else?

616
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,020
And... Well,

617
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,940
I sent a letter to Xia Yu.

618
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,260
I told her I'd left

619
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,980
the money at the train station.

620
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,860
I also posted her the card.

621
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,620
Does anyone know

622
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,260
you're back this time?

623
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,380
No.

624
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,780
But I told my uncle

625
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,980
I was going south.

626
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,540
Have you told anyone about me?

627
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,380
No.

628
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,660
Are you sure?

629
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,780
Yes.

630
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,780
What's wrong?

631
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
What's going on?

632
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,380
My brother went to the Northeast.

633
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
What does it mean?

634
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,340
It's me who's tense.

635
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
I don't think

636
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,990
my brother went to the Northeast
because of you.

637
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,860
Maybe I was overthinking it.

638
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,660
He came back to have a meal with me,

639
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,820
so he must not have found out anything.

640
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,100
Don't worry.

641
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,340
I was overthinking it.

642
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,380
Yes.

643
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,580
You're overthinking it.

644
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,540
Let's not scare ourselves.

645
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,700
I'm sure we took every step
the right way.

646
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,660
All right, go and look after her.

647
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,980
Believe in ourselves.

648
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,140
Go.

649
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,780
Captain.

650
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,980
Mr. Cui wants to see you.

651
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,780
He's downstairs.

652
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,340
Didn't you guys just have a meal?

653
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:15,580
(Public Security)

654
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,620
You've got a bump on your head.

655
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
Here's some medicine for you.

656
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,340
That's it?

657
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,460
I've got bigger problems than that.

658
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,580
Wei,

659
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm sorry

660
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,660
about today.

661
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,620
I shouldn't talk back to you.

662
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,740
When Yan is in this state,

663
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,860
I shouldn't have taken it all on myself.

664
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,340
I can't do it alone.

665
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,980
You're my older brother.

666
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,460
I should take your money.

667
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,660
Do your words still count?

668
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,500
If you're saying that,

669
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,140
I think there's something wrong with you.

670
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,540
You're irrational.

671
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,180
Have you had some kind of a shock?

672
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,140
No shock.

673
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,540
I've been lectured.

674
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,340
Well, congratulations.

675
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,990
I heard from Shuhua
that you went to the Northeast for fun.

676
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,990
If I can't mess with them,
I can't hide from them.

677
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,980
I went for a break.

678
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,780
Where have you been?

679
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,820
I'd like to go there
for a break too sometime.

680
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,420
What else do you want to know?

681
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
It's in front of the police station.

682
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,740
Ask away.

683
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,100
- Captain,
- I heard that you...

684
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,460
we've got a lead on Xia Yu.

685
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,140
Could you be any louder?

686
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,340
Sir, where are you going?

687
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,380
Drive ahead.

688
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,540
Mister, go straight.

689
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,820
Hello, where are you?
