Xiasheng,

5
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,030
you know

6
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,310
everything you need to know.

7
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,240
That's

8
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,310
what happened.

9
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,750
Uncle,

10
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,630
please tell me the truth.

11
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,590
Did that scumbag, Hu Kuiyong,
cheat my dad?

12
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,910
There's no proof.

13
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,910
Stop causing trouble.

14
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,310
I failed to stop your dad,

15
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,710
but I must stop you.

Look what a nice place you've got

17
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,000
for your dad.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,310
It's a gesture

19
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,750
of filial piety.

20
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,030
You'll be able to make a living
in the South.

21
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,080
Go home.

22
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,070
Pass on a message to your brother.

23
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,160
Tell him...

24
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
Tell him to live a good life.

25
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Uncle,

26
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,680
I wonder how my dad
was doing these days.

27
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,800
I'd like to check it out.

This way, please.

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sir, this is the car.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,760
It's suitable
for both family and business.

40
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,430
It's new, it's only traveled
50,000 kilometers in two years.

41
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,000
This mileage is considered
to be a good break-in for you.

42

Feel free to check it out.

Yan,

44
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,920
come on. Get in and try it.

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Dad,

46
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,630
this is much better
than Captain Cui's car.

47
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,920
We'll buy this car, then.

48
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,870
Dad, when did you learn to drive?

49
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,870
I learned with your mom,

50
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,870
years ago.

51
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,800
Mr. Cui,

52
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,630
take me for a ride.

53
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,870
Give me the key.

54
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,430
Right, the key is with me.

55
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,310
The key.

56
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,400
Here you go.

57
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,190
Mr. Cui, sit properly.

59
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,170

We've got the target.

61
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,830
It's time to take action now.

62
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,000
Shuhua, take all the necessary medicine
with you.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,630
Remember, never leave your money behind

64
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,800
when you go out.

65
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,870
I'll go wash some fruit
for you to eat on the way.

66
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
Mom,

67
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,190
do you know when Cui Ye

68
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,040
started that master class?

69
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,560
I have no idea.

70
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
He's always away from home

71
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
these days.

72
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,800
I thought he was...

73
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,190
Thought he was what?

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,190
He works hard everyday for this family.

75
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,750
Do you have all your documents?

76
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
What's with all the money?

77
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,550
Pretending to be a rich man?

78
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,790
You should be careful

79
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,890
when you're out and about.

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,240
Don't let anyone rob you.

81
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,670
Seriously. Did you hear me?

82
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,120
Mom, I know what to do.

83
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,990
Come on.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,870
Put it in front.

85
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,870
Yan's not down yet?

86
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,960
Get him down.

87
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,150
We have to leave now.

88
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,600
Ye, let me ask you something.

89
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,360
Are you hiding something

90
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,000
from Shuhua?

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
No.

92
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,630
Since she came back,

93
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,120
I've seen you two not talking much.

94
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,120
You two need to communicate more
when living together.

95
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,480
Go out and have a heart-to-heart
with her.

96
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
She can't just come back physically,

97
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,630
her heart has to come back too.

98
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
Get in the car. Come on.

99
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Yan,

100
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,080
I want to give you something.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,370
Come on, wear this.

102
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,120
This is a gift from my friend.

103
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,630
Wear it for protection.

104
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
What kind of friend?

105
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,120
It's a friend who admires me.

106
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,800
Come on, get in the car.

107
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,750
What's going on?

108
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,480
- What's the jam up ahead?
- How long will it take?

109
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
What's going on?

110
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,240
What's going on up ahead?

111
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,360
Mister, what's going on up there?

112
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,360
It's so congested.

113
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,510
There's a traffic accident
up ahead. Just wait.

114
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
There's an intersection here.

115
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
We'll just go out here

116
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,150
and make a detour.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,120
Let's wait for a while.

118
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,720
If it's an accident in the front,

119
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,680
it will be fine after it's dealt with.

120
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,000
If this road is bumpy,
it'll take too long.

121
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,270
I told you we should
have taken the train.

122
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,150
Let's make a detour.

123
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,960
Let's wait for a while.

124
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,150
It's...

125
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,480
It's a nice day.

126
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,480
I've checked the weather
in Hong Kong, China

127
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,000
and it's fine.

128
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,750
Dad,

129
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,510
where are we?

130
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,600
We're almost there.

131
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,450
You're not going to sleep anymore?

132
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,270
It's too bumpy

133
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,600
to sleep.

134
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,120
You look different

135
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
after your trip.

136
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,630
What a stylish look.

137
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,450
You've been hitting
on a lot of girls, huh?

138
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,520
I heard that the girls
in the South are very fashionable.

139
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,360
Is that true?

140
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,180
Aren't all the girls from the South

141
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,150
very pretty and gentle?

142
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,240
That's all you think about every day.

143
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,600
You haven't made any progress at all.

144
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,000
Keep the money if it's too much.

145
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
You must do a good job for me.

146
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,630
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

147
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,150
Well, I won't ask.

148
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,480
But if something happens to you,

149
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,200
it's none of my business.

150
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,240
You brat.

151
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,080
You're the same as when you were a kid.

152
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,390
If anything happens,
I'll turn you in first.

153
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,630
Why are you so humorless?

154
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,670
I was just kidding.

155
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,640
Come and give me a hand.

156
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,510
This road is not accessible.

157
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,220
I told you to wait,
but you didn't listen.

158
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,440
No, don't keep saying what you told me.

159
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,960
Are you always right?

160
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,110
I'm just... I'm just trying
to get there fast.

161
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,510
Cui Ye,

162
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,680
you always do what you want.

163
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,640
You never listen to what I say.

164
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,910
No.

165
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,110
It's on this map.

166
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
Is there a way out here?

167
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,510
No. Can't we just move it and go?

168
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,400
Move it?

169
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,790
How?

170
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,350
Do you think about the consequences
of your actions?

171
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm trying to solve the problem.

172
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,640
Otherwise?

173
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,830
How long are you going to wait here?

174
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,350
That's called resignation to fate.

175
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,680
I don't resign myself to fate.

176
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,350
Are you solving the problem?

177
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,510
The big question is why you had
to drive here.

178
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,510
That's sick.

179
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,070
I'm sick?

180
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,310
You're saying I'm sick?

181
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,960
Do you know how much I've done

182
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
for this family?

183
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,590
You're saying I'm sick?

184
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,950
Yes.

185
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm sick.

186
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,200
If I wasn't sick,

187
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
could I take Yangao to Hong Kong, China?

If I wasn't sick,

189
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,990
you'd be waiting to leave the country
with Wang Hongyu's smuggling money.

190
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Are you saying I'm sick or are you?

191
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm going to lie down outside
in the car.

192

I'm going out to check on Dad.

199
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,510
come with me.

200
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
Come on.

201
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
Do you know how much I've done

202
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,840
for this family?

203
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,550

Why are you yelling at our son?

214
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,830
Is this fun?

Come and get it tomorrow morning.

222
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,170

Okay?

Miss,

229
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,750
I need a king-size bedded room.

230

Please register first.

233
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,240
All right.

00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,510
We want a standard room.

235
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,750
You and Yan have had a long day.

236
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,920

Let Yan sleep between us.

It's not a good idea

239
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,270
for the kid to sleep in that gap.

240
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,440

He just borrowed a torch and went out.

You wait here. I'll go find him.

246

I'll go with you.

Have you found it?

254
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350

It's...

259
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
It's over there.

260
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,750
Here? It's probably gone.

261
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,350
Yan,

262
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,550
do you want to be a cop that badly?

263
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,750
Why?

264
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,200
Because of your uncle?

265
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,310
Because I don't want to play Go.

266
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,110
I want to catch the bad guys.

267
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,440
Let me ask you.

268
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,110
If I were a bad guy,

269
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,350
would you arrest me?

270
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,880
I mean if,

271
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,110
hypothetically.

272
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,830
I'll have to think about that.

273
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,550
Do you think

274
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,590
I'm a bad guy?

275
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Anyway, Dad,

276
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,880
you've changed lately.

277
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,400
How?

278
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,350
At first,

279
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,160
I thought you started

280
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,790
caring about me.

281
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,960
You stopped forcing me to play Go,

282
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,960
bought me game cards,

283
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,790
got a new aquarium

284
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,030
and brought Mom back.

285
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,310
These are all good things.

286
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,790
However,

287
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,110
I don't know how to put it.

288
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,640
You were never this fierce before.

289
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,750
I didn't recognise you

290
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,790
when you yelled at me today.

291
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,640
You looked

292
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,830
a lot like a bad guy.

293
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,440
Do you think

294
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,400
so now?

295
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm sorry.

296
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,310
From now on,

297
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,070
I won't yell at you anymore.

298
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
You can't yell at Mom either.

299
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,640
No more yelling.

300
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,350

301
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,550
I'll play any game you want with you.

302
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,830
Come on, I'll carry you.

303
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,240
Come on.

305
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,190
Come on.

306
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,350
Why did you run out
in the middle of the night?

307
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,030
It's all my fault.

308
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,680
Let's talk about it when we get back.

309
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,270
Let's go.

310
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,840
Yan,

311
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,760
go back to bed.

312
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,190
I'll talk

313
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,190
- to your mom.
- Okay.

314
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,920
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

315
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
Shuhua,

316
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,840
I'd like to talk to you.

317
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,760
Go ahead.

318
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,880
I won't eavesdrop.

319
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,760
What do you have to say?

320
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm sorry, Shuhua.

321
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,230
Today,

322
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,320
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

323
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,210
I'm sorry I decided on my own

324
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,630
to bypass

325
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,230
the main road to get here.

326
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,530
First thing in the morning,
we'll get the car

327
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
and drive back.

328
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,550
I know you blame me

329
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,670
for insisting on driving.

330
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,960
It's simple, really.

331
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,360
We didn't have a honeymoon

332
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,880
when we got married.

333
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,000
I've never forgotten that.

334
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,920
I just want

335
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,230
our relationship

336
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,550
to go back to the way it was before

337
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,630
so that Yan can feel

338
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,550
that the family

339
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,320
is still complete.

340
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,360
Yan has been living

341
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,320
as a child of a single parent

342
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,920
for the past few years.

343
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,670
I've noticed

344
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,360
that he's learning to read the room,

345
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,550
and I feel terrible about it.

346
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,360
I want him to have

347
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,920
what other kids have.

348
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,630
I even want to try my best to give him

349
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,280
what other kids don't have

350
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,670
just so he doesn't think

351
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,360
he's different from other kids.

352
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,670
Yan's illness...

353
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,320
Yan's illness

354
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,280
will slowly worsen.

355
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,840
I have no idea when he's going
to have a slow onset of the illness.

356
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,280
It could be years from now.

357
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,800
It could be tomorrow.

358
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,960
In your words,

359
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,920
I've been too selfish before.

360
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,800
From now on, I just want

361
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,760
the two of us

362
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,960
to spend every day with Yan.

363
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,670
You should have told me this
from the beginning.

364
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,150
You just got back.

365
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,880
I'm not used to it either.

366
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,360
If you really want us

367
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,960
to be like we used to be,

368
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,760
why do you keep so many things from me?

369
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,070
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

370
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,400
All that money

371
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,320
is really the fees for the master class.

372
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,360
Wang Hongyu

373
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,880
helped me get students

374
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
because I knew he was smuggling.

375
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,030
Do you remember

376
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,440
my classmate, Dong Binghui?

377
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,480
He told me about it.

378
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,190
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

379
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,710
I had

380
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,550
to blackmail him with this

381
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,920
to get you fired.

382
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
I did it

383
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,630
to protect you.

384
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,710
Whatever I have to do for this family,

385
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,550
I'll do it.

386
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Gou,

387
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,030
he's here.

388
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,710
She's Gou.

389
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,892
She has what you want.

390
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,500
Her man left it behind
when he went to the mountains.

391
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Come here.

392
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,480
What are you going to hunt?

393
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,150
Human beings?

394
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,810
It's none of your business.

395
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,800
5,000 yuan.

396
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,030
You can't turn back

397
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,480
when you kill someone.

398
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,400
If you don't want to use it, give it back.

399
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,480
I'd like to post something

400
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,710
to Lanshui City.

401
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,070
Please fill out the address.

402
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,140
(To Xia Yu)

403
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,800
Keep the change.

404
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,920
Lin,

405
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,630
I'm reading the mission you left me.

406
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,760
What did you write here?

407
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,600
This..

408
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,480
What do you want me to buy?

409
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,840
I can't see it clearly.

410
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,070
Dantong

411
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,800
Big Ruthless Fish.

412
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,000
Wait a minute.

413
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,550
Dantong

414
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,680
Big

415
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,150
Ruthless

416
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,630
Fish.

417
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,880
I'm greeting you from the train.

418
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,710
You need to work on your calligraphy.

419
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,510
It's not clear enough.

420
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,840
Didn't Grandpa bring you
a calligraphy book?

421
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,800
Practice more.

422
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,280
I'll check it when I get back.

423
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,400
Okay?

424
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,550
All right.

425
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,230
Dantong Big Ruthless Fish.
