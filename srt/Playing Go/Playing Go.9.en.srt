(Last Spring, Dantong)

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
What's your problem?

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,960
Can't go a day

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,070
without making Dad angry?

5
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,240
Why won't Dad let me work
at the factory?

6
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,390
Work at the factory? You want to work
at the factory that badly?

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,520
If you work there like me,

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,840
and the only thing clean

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,280
about you will be your teeth.

10
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,790
What's so good about working there?

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Once you leave home
and enter the factory gates,

12
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,680
you'll never see a ray of light again.

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,920
You look up, and all you see is gray.

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,430
Then, why are you working there?

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,710
We only need one man in our family

16
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,710
working there.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,350
Have you thought about the future?

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,640
The future?

19
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,350
Have you thought about
what you'll be like in ten years?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,790
What's the point?

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,870
I just care about tomorrow.

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,730
All's well as long as the sun
comes out tomorrow.

23
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,870
Chunsheng, have some candy.

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,780
(Rat Poison)

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,190
Dad, what's the occasion?

26
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,430
Why the feast?

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
Are our troubles over?

28
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,750
I don't want you

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,150
to live like this anymore,

30
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,470
hiding and struggling.

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,590
It's all my fault.

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,560
I let you both down.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,590
We're doing fine, aren't we?

34
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,120
We can still have grilled meat.

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,420
Dad?

36
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,430
Why are you crying?

37
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,000
The smoke got into my eyes.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
This smells great.

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,870
Chunsheng, eat while it's hot.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,310
Chunsheng! Why did you do that?

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
Dad.

42
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,030
We can't just give up.

43
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,280
We'll get the money back

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
and we'll explain everything
to everyone!

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,310
Dad!

46

47
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,980
=Episode 9=
=The Fifth Robber=

48
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,190
Do you have any other requests?

49
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,310
Do you know

50
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,270
what a master class is?

51
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,830
No.

52
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,070
Please explain.

53
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,750
The people aren't signing up

54
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,190
for Go lessons.

55
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,190
It's a platform.

56
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,560
It's a place where people

57
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,510
can meet and network.

58
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,510
Got it?

59
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,350
Got it.

60
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,590
Got it.

61
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,000
So for the first session,

62
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,560
I need you

63
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,190
to invite Director Chen
from the city's investment office.

64
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
I can do that.

65
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,270
No problem.

66
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,190
Good.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
I have matters to attend to.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,070
I'll let you get busy.

69
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,750
If Director Chen can't make it,

70
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
will Vice Director Wu do?

71
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,070
It has to be Director Chen.

72
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,950
He likes chess.

73
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
You know this place well.

74
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,430
You order and I'll pay.

75
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,000
Two of your most expensive steaks.

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,870
All right.

77
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,430
What are you trying to do here?

78
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,510
Eat.

79
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,120
I want to know
what this fancy western steak

80
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,310
tastes like.

81
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,120
After this, we'll go to the civil affairs
office and get divorced.

82
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,390
You can go abroad.

83
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,270
For real this time.

84
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,630
But there's one thing.

85
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,630
You can't take Yan with you.

86
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,870
What do you mean?

87
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,700
The message you sent me.

88
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,680
(Let's get divorced.
You can keep Yangao.)

89
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,790
You said you didn't want
to take care of Yan anymore.

90
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,830
If this goes to arbitration,
how do you think the court will rule?

91
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,960
There's a lawyer's office next door.

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Feel free to get some legal advice.

93
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Cui Ye.

94
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
You scoundrel!

95
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,270
When did I ever send you that message?

96
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,870
Answer me!

97
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,870
After you found out

98
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,270
Yan was sick.

99
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,100
(Cui Yangao, Motor Neurone Disease)

100
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,150
You think you're better than me?

101
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,150
That you could give Yan a better life?

102
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,200
You misjudged me

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,790
and you misjudged yourself.

104
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,510
Now I can afford to treat Yan,

105
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,870
can you?

106
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,630
Think about it.

107
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,720
If you want a divorce,

108
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,360
I'll go along with it.

109
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,750
If not, come with me to Hong Kong, China

110
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,790
and get Yan treated.

111
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,750
Yuck!

112
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,150
This is still raw!

113
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,630
For Yan,

114
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,870
I'd do anything.

115
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,630
You're back.

116
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm going to pick up Yan.

117
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,590
Mom.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,390
Where's that old double blanket?

119
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,870
In the cupboard.

120
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,120
You don't even use it.

121
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,360
Why are you asking?

122
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,720
Shuhua is coming back
to stay for a few days.

123
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,790
She's coming back?

124
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,900
You're not getting divorced?

125
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,790
You talked to her?

126
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,120
That's wonderful!

127
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,870
What did she say?

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
She said

129
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,270
she wants us to continue being a family.

130
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,000
Really?

131
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,000
That's great!

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,510
I'll tell Yan when I see him.

133
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,150
He'll be over the moon!

134
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
You should get going.

135
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,690
All right.

136
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,120
I'm going to pick up Yan now.

137
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,240
This is wonderful!

138
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,870
Come in.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,910
Shuhua?

140
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,720
You're here early.

141
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,750
Is something the matter?

142
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,630
Ms. Wu,

143
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,150
I'd like

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,150
to drop out.

145
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,480
What about your oral lessons?

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,150
I won't need them anymore.

147
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,600
Captain.

148
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,630
You came in person.

149
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,480
It's a pity.

150
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,510
Looks like the game is off.

151
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,390
Aren't you going to question me?

152
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,750
I was going to ask.

153
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,360
Captain Cui.

154
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
I think you'd do better

155
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,390
than me in business.

156
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,630
You're calm.

157
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,120
Are you sure about that?

158
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,000
Tech department says

159
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
(Public Security)
the ship was cleaned.

160
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,600
No fingerprints left behind.

161
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,150
They're analyzing the blood samples now.

162
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
Did Wang Hongyu say anything?

163
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,630
Nothing at all?

164
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,630
I didn't ask him anything.

165
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,990
Even if I had,
he wouldn't have said a word.

166
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,630
I think he was set up.

167
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,480
He's probably as confused as I am.

168
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,120
We've been over all the details

169
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,390
too many times now.

170
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,120
So many theories.

171
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Each one feels like a lead,

172
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,390
but none of them connect.

173
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,980
We don't even know
which direction to go in anymore.

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,870
If Qin Xiaoming wasn't
one of the five robbers,

175
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,510
then who was the fifth one?

176
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,270
At the time of the crime,

177
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,390
they chose someone to be the decoy.

178
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,030
Why him?

179
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,480
Did this person

180
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,000
do it to protect someone?

181
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,150
Who was he protecting?

182
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
The one who wet his pants.

183
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,420
(The guy who wet his pants,
Qin Xiaoming)

184
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,340
(The guy who wet his pants)

185
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,110
Captain,

186
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,390
the prosecutor's review is complete.

187
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,390
They said the body
will be processed today.

188
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,180
(Lanshui City Credit Union,
Criminal No. 1, shot dead)

189
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,470
Captain!

190
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,270
What do you think that rat was
to the other rat?

191
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,000
Its mother?

192
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,270
Its wife? Child?

193
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,030
Its brother?

194
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,000
Who would you risk your life for?

195
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,790
Sun.

196
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,750
We've got the DNA results

197
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,120
from the blood samples taken
from the fishing boat's rope.

198
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,030
After analyzing the genetic markers,

199
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,830
we found that the suspect
and the deceased suspect

200
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,310
were biological brothers.

201
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,310
Biological brothers.

202
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,070
We can't even confirm
the deceased's identity.

203
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,960
What's the use of knowing
they're brothers?

204
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,270
I have an idea.

205
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,000
Run it through Chief Zhao first.

206
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,080
Come on!

207
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,260
(Youyi Department Store)

208
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,070
I'm off, Li.

209
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,720
See you, Chen.

210
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,750
Have a piece of melon.

211
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,750
Stop fussing with the schedule.
I'm in no mood to eat.

212
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,270
- I can't even make this shift work…
- Wei.

213
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,110
Li.

214
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,350
Xia Yu, you're here.

215
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,480
You're finally off the clock.

216
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,550
Here you go, Xia Yu.

217
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,550
You must be exhausted lately.

218
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,160
Just hang in there a little longer.

219
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,850
Once we ship this batch of goods,
the factory will be back on track.

220
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,510
I'm fine, Li. I can manage.

221
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,310
You've got the night shift tomorrow.

222
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,070
- Yes?
- Go home and get some sleep.

223
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,590
Xia Yu, it's for you.

224
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,910
Hello?

225
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,750
All right. I'll see you later.

226
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,510
Sweet melon.

227
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,270
That girl...

228
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,790
Has a date.

229
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,200
Xiasheng!

230
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,750
It looks great on you.

231
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,920
Who dresses like this?

232
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,590
This is how we dress back home.

233
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,120
What's this?

234
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,270
It's for you.

235
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,550
I don't need it.

236
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,960
You didn't need it before you knew me.

237
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,000
But now you do.

238
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,550
Just take it.

239
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,200
Come on.

240
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,000
I didn't take you out to sea last time.

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,270
I'll make it up to you.

242
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,480
Faster!

243
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,350
The weather's nice.

244
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,240
Xia Yu.

245
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,720
Choose your words carefully.

246
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
You only have one chance to explain.

247
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,270
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

248
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,790
My dad

249
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,160
used to run a factory.

250
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,160
The business was struggling.

251
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,830
He tried to save it,

252
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,070
but he got scammed.

253
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,000
The factory was taken from him.

254
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,750
My brother and I tracked the guy down

255
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,030
and beat him up pretty bad.

256
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,200
We thought we killed him,

257
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,070
so we ran.

258
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,680
That day when I saw the police,

259
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,000
I thought they were coming for me.

260
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,960
What about your brother?

261
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,750
We split up.

262
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,200
I have no idea where he is now.

263
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,680
He's probably somewhere

264
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,510
no one can find him.

265
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,510
You know what?

266
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,990
I'm making pretty good money
from this shipping job.

267
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,510
So what are you planning to do?

268
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,550
I want to go back home.

269
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,350
You should.

270
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,830
Would you come with me?

271
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,350
Why?

272
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,480
It's not like you're not coming back,

273
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,590
right?

274
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,240
I might not.

275
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,750
It's nice here.

276
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,830
You're doing well here.

277
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,590
You shouldn't leave with me.

278
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,440
It's nice here.

(Qianzimeng Garment Factory)

280
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
What are your plans for the future?

281
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,750
Plans?

282
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,270
Like,

283
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,270
what kind of life

284
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,510
do you want to have in ten years?

285
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
Ten years from now?

286
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Who knows what'll happen in ten years?

287
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
Right now,

288
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,590
I just hope we can deliver

289
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,000
this batch of orders on time.

290
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,440
That way, the factory can keep running.

291
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,510
Keep running for good.

292
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
You care a lot about the factory.

293
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,270
I grew up there with my mom.

294
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,240
When I was a kid and had
to write essays about "My Family,"

295
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,960
I wrote about the factory.

296
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,030
In the summer,

297
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,510
the whole factory would
watch movies outdoor together.

298
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,000
The movie stars
were fighting on the screen,

299
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
and we were having fun in the seats.

300
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,790
In winter, we'd all cram
into the conference room

301
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,750
to watch a tiny TV.
But it never felt crowded.

302
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,270
After my mom passed away,

303
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,830
I took over her job.

304
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,270
Even though I'm the youngest one there,

305
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,030
everyone still calls me Ms. Xia,

306
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,550
like they used to call my mom.

307
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,030
You're young,

308
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,200
but you rank pretty high, huh?

309
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,350
Ms. Xia.

310
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You can't call me that!
You make me sound old!

311
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,560
Anything else?

312
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,440
Well…

313
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,030
There's my dad.

314
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,750
You're close with your dad?

315
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,750
I used to wish
he'd disappear from my life forever.

316
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,550
Why are you looking at me like that?

317
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,310
You don't know
what kind of person he was.

318
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,920
But he's better now.

319
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,510
I hope things

320
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
can just stay good like this.

321
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,590
That would be nice.

322
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,550
This is my home.

323
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,920
Wait here.

324
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,510
What's this for?

325
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,590
It's for your dad.

326
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,200
He won't accept this.

327
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,270
Consider it my way
of showing respect to him.

328
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,200
You should head inside.

329
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm off.

330
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480

Who's that boy?

333
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,070
Your new boyfriend?

334
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,830
He bought this for you.

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,340
(Lanshui Lucky Welfare Lottery)
He has good manners, at least.

336
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,750
You bought lottery tickets again?

337
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,270
This is a welfare lottery.

338
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,750
It's not gambling.

339
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,750
thank you for tuning in
to tonight's "Life On the Line."

We're joined
by a very special guest tonight.

Captain Cui Wei
of the City Criminal Police Division.

344
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,720
Hello, Captain Cui.

345
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,000
Hello.

346
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,310
I'm sure you must be a fan

348
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,030
It's all right.

Let me guess
which event's your favorite.

I bet you like

354

to the Thatched Cottage.

355
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
Why's that?

356
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,550
Because this is the third time

357
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,270
we've invited you onto the show.

358
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,480
I see.

359
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,510
Just kidding.

360
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,590
It's an honor

361
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,000
to have you here.

362
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,160
So, Captain Cui,

363
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,750
what would you like to share
with our listeners tonight?

364
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,790
Good evening, everyone.

365
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,200
I'd like to talk about

366
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,070
the handling

367
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,790
of criminal suspects.

369
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,550
are you tuning in to 95.4 FM?

370
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,590
Why does the show sound different today?

371
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,550
Do I look like their boss?

372
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,030

373
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,590

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,000
these kinds of cases.

376
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,440
That was a hard pivot.

377
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,550
It looks like we already have
a caller on the line.

378
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,310
Let's take this call together.

379
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,480
Officer,

380
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,720
I have a question.

381
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,240
If you kill a criminal

382
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,790
in the line of duty,

383
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,500
what do you do with the body?

384
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,680
First, we verify the identity
of the deceased criminal

385
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,310
and notify their family.

386
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,310
If we can't confirm the identity

387
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,200
or no family members come forward,

388
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,440
we transfer the body to a relevant hospital
or research institute.

389
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,400
If no one claims the body
after a certain period,

390
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,270
we hand it over to
the local civil affairs department.

Captain Cui, I have a question.

392
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,030
What does

393
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,270
the civil affairs department do next?

394
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,810
To my understanding,
they will follow the standard procedure

395
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,000
and cremate the body.

396
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,920
Afterward,

397
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,440
the ashes will be stored
at a funeral home for a period of time.

398
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,800
If no one claims the remains,

399
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,990
the funeral home will handle them
at their discretion.

400
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,240
We'd like to remind our listeners

401
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,510
to follow the law.

402
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,920
Otherwise, not only will you

403
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,960
face legal consequences,

404
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,850
but you may also

405
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,350
never find peace, even in death.

406
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,830
That'll hit him where it hurts.

407
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,510
Let's take the next caller.

408
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
Hello, caller. You're on the air.

409
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,750
Hello, Xinwen.

410
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,270
I have some thoughts

411
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,550
about what the officer said.

412
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,200
Criminals are a threat to society

413
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,680
when they're alive.

414
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,160
They're just a waste of resources.

415
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,480
Why should they get a proper burial?

416
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,030
Why even bother keeping their ashes?

417
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,960
The state shouldn't waste money on that!

418
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,310
What nonsense are they spouting?

Hello?

423
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,750
Good evening, caller.

424
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you have a question for me?

425
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I can answer it for you.

426
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,830
I was just gathering my thoughts.

427
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,550
Some callers may have

428
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,510
their own views,

429
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,270
but this policy reflects

430

the state's humanity

431

a government official.

434

Can you replay this for a few days?

441
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,550
Of course.

442

If more calls come in,
please keep a record for me.

We're taking a risk here.

448

This really is a gamble.

449
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
Do we have another choice?

450
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,670
Keep an eye on the funeral home.
