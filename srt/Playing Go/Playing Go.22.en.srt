00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,270
Hello,

2
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
there's a shot fired

3
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,350
at the abandoned tunnel

4
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,510
two kilometers eastbound at the end
of Highway 303.

5
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,900

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,380

=Everything's Not As Bad As We Thought=

7
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,360
Yan.

8
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,190
Mom.

9
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,720
Your dad's worried you're starving.

10
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,190
What do you want?

11
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
I haven't eaten yet.

12
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,430
Be quiet.

13
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,480
I was going to exchange you with him
for money.

14
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,630
If he hadn't been so dishonest,
you'd all be home by now.

15
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,430
Your dad's a bad guy.

16
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,870
He's very bad.

17
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,750
My dad's not a bad guy.

18
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,680
Look.

19
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,630
Your dad cut it.

20
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,630
You're a liar!

21
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,080
Yan,

22
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
what are you doing?

23
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
- My dad's not a bad guy.
- Yan.

24
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,120
You're a liar.

25
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,680
What are you doing?

26
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,950
You brat.

27
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,360
Stop it!

28
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,040
Yan.

29
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,120
It's all right now.

30
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,560
We can go home now.

31
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,480
Go home.

32
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
Mom!

33
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,870
Mom!

34
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Mom!

35
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Mom!

36
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,430
Mom!

37
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,480
Mom.

38
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Your whole family is bad!

39
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't touch my mom.

40
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,720
Don't make me shoot you!

41
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,720
Who's there?

42
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
Is it you?

43
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,720
Your wife and son are here.

44
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,390
Don't move.

45
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,630
Uncle.

46
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,230
Run!

47
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,960
Yan,

48
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,910
come on.

49
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,200
Don't run.

50
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,120
I'll kill you if you run.

51
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,550
Come back!

52
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,030
Come back.

53
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,360
Uncle!

54
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,480
Uncle!

55
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
Uncle!

56
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,870
Uncle!

57
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,000
He's a cop.

58
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,360
Stop it!

59
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,910
If you shoot him,

60
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,670
I'll burn the money.

61
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,550
He's a cop.

62
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,840
He's my brother!

63
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,480
Doesn't your brother work
for the neighbourhood council?

64
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,240
Does he know you broke the law?

65
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,600
Do you know your younger brother
broke the law?

66
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,870
You drop the gun and take the money.

67
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,360
And leave with the money.

68
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,630
He can't arrest you in this state.

69
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,560
You drop the lighter first.

70
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,990
Okay.

71
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,440
On the count of three,

72
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,440
let's drop them together.

73
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,800
One,

74
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,040
two,

75
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,360
three.

76
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,000
You've fooled me twice today.

77
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,270
Do you believe I'll break your hand
with one shot?

78
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,120
Shuhua,

79
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,630
leave now. Go.

80
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
No.

81
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,150
Dad, you have to go back and save Uncle.

82
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,600
Shuhua.

83
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
Go.

84
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,870
Leave now.

85
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,960
You're a liar.

86
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,000
Liars.

87
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,080
You're a family of liars.

88
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,830
Wei!

89
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,790
Liars.

90
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,870
Liars.

91
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,960
Money.

92
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,040
Money.

93
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,110
Money.

94
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,110
My money.

95
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Money.

96
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,200
Money.

97
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,270
Money.

98
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
Why is the sun

99
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,440
so blinding?

100
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,400
Summer

101
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,720
is coming.

102
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,920
I didn't expect you to come back for me.

103
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,510
I expected

104
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,070
you to come and arrest me.

105
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,870
Wei,

106
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,880
Shuhua and Yan

107
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,270
are safe, right?

108
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,000
The Go I've learned

109
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,920
is really something.

110
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,510
I've had a taste of it.

111
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,000
There's something

112
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,480
special about you.

113
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,590
It's been there

114
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,310
since you were a kid.

115
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,160
It's amazing.

116
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,510
I saw it.

117
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,440
But I was afraid of it.

118
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,070
It made me

119
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,310
look ordinary.

120
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,030
Even when I became a cop,

121
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,240
I was still ordinary.

122
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,270
I was afraid of that feeling.

123
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,880
I didn't want to admit it.

124
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,790
I was jealous of you.

125
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,350
I wanted to make you

126
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,920
as ordinary as me.

127
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,070
Seriously.

128
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,480
It's ridiculous.

129
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Wei,

130
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,780
do you remember

131
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,100
when you gave Yan a fish?

132
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,300
He asked me to take care of it

133
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,860
when he was in the hospital

134
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,820
and the fish died.

135
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,620
I bought another fish

136
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,780
and put it in there.

137
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,060
He still doesn't know.

138
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,140
Now that I think about it,

139
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,180
I couldn't

140
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,020
turn back then.

141
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,420
I still love spring.

142
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,380
(With the testimony
of the criminal, Cui Ye,)

143
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,040
(the credit cooperatives robbery case
was finally solved.)

144
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,690
(Wang Hongyu, Yi Fosheng,
other suspects,

145
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,090
(and the hit-and-run driver)

146
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,130
(have also explained their crimes
to the police,)

147
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,540
(and received
the appropriate legal sanctions.)

148
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:21,140
(One Year Later, Spring)

149
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,230
Cui,

150
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,720
Wei is here to see you.

151
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,540
In the past,
I used to be accompanied by Ye,

152
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,260
but now it's Wei.

153
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,260
(Tomb of Cui Weimin and Lu Qiuping)
The two of them

154
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,900
never come together.

155
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Mom,

156
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,740
there's still a chance.

157
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,500
Wei,

158
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,820
Yan's temper

159
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,060
is like his dad's

160
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,460
and his grandpa's.

161
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,460
He's stubborn.

162
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,460
He won't listen

163
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,100
to me or Shuhua.

164
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,020
Please talk to him.

165
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,660
He'll listen to you.

166
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,100
(End-of-term Parent-teacher Conference)
Our class did well in this final exam.

167
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,580
Overall,

168
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,060
we ranked second

169
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,620
in our grade.

170
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,940
- Good!
- Good!

171
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,220
Now, I'll hand out

172
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,580
the papers.

173
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,780
(Cui Yangao, Fourth Grade
Chinese Exam Paper, 90 marks)

174
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
Captain Cui.

175
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,180
- Ms. Zhao.
- Why

176
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,380
isn't Cui Yangao's mom here today?

177
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,700
I had to come for such a good occasion.

178
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,500
Look, Cui Yangao did well

179
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,980
in the final exam

180
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,180
and made a lot of progress.

181
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,740
But lately,

182
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,060
he's been reading

183
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,260
some extracurricular books

184
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,740
at school.

185
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,020
I've checked them out.

186
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,260
They're all about Go.

187
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,940
I can't really comment on it.

188
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,860
It's mainly

189
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,460
up to you parents

190
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,900
to guide him.

191
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,980
Don't let him

192
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,500
get distracted

193
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
by unnecessary stuff.

194
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,780
Did he read it in class?

195
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,540
No, not really.

196
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,460
That's good then.

197
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,100
Look, his result is getting better.

198
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,300
- Yeah.
- Ms. Zhao, thank you.

199
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,620
Okay. Bye.

200
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,020
Well done on your exam.

201
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,300
You've gone from second last

202
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,980
to second best.

203
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,140
It's not much of an improvement.

204
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,260
You're so humble.

205
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,420
Your teacher told me

206
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,380
that you read Go books at school.

207
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,380
When I'm done with my homework,

208
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,420
I can read whatever I want.

209
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,460
I think you're right.

210
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,340
I'm all for it.

211
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,940
How come you're the one here today?

212
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,850
Where is my mom?

213
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,000
Your mom told me to come.

214
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,370
She gave me a very difficult task.

215
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,900
Your grandma told me to talk to you too.

216
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,180
I know what you're going to say.

217
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,700
Did you read the letter he wrote you?

218
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,620
Some things can't be changed.

219
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,180
No matter what he did,

220
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,420
he's your dad.

221
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,940
Just like he'll always be my brother.

222
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,740
I'm not here to force you.

223
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,620
You're a big boy.

224
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,180
I respect any decision you make.

225
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,620
I just want you to know

226
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,460
that he knows he's wrong now

227
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,620
and he misses you very much.

228
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,460
I just want you to think about it.

229
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,420
Give them some time.

230
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,380
It'll be all right.

231
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,070
Mom...

232
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,420
How's Mom doing?

233
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,220
She's fine.

234
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,420
She just talks about you all the time.

235
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,860
How are you settling in?

236
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Wei,

237
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,220
thank you for convincing Yan to come.

238
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,860
I'm sorry for the trouble.

239
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,260
Jin Xiasheng's family came

240
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,260
and took him back for burial.

241
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,860
I think I should let you know.

242
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,020

243
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,260
if there's nothing,

244
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,060
I'll go back in now.

245
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,340
Don't worry

246
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,460
about Yangao.

247
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,180
I'll do whatever it takes to help him.

248
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,420
You must do well in there.

249
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,700
I told Mom

250
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,500
we'd go see Dad together

251
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,220

and were temporarily suspended.

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,260
But you

255
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,900
resigned and changed your profession
to become a director.

Well,

259
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,740
aren't you going to Beijing

260
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,980
to get your nephew treated?

261
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,100
It's a token of my regard.

262
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,940
Take it.

I can do it.

270
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,460
Yes, you can.

- Be careful.

You can't sleep down here.

274

Let her sleep down here.

275

It's okay. I'll switch with you.

276
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,500
I'll sleep up there.

are you sure?
