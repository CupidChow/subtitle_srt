00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
021.

3
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,590
Count the exact amount.

4
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,950
I'll send it to the factory

5
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,710
first thing in the morning.

6
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,590
There's really that much money.

7
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,870
I wouldn't lie to you.

8
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,210
Where did you get so much money?

9
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,710
My brother left it to me.

10
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,470
Don't just stand there.

11
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,430
Count it now.

12
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
It's all right.

13
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,870
Your business is my business.

14
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,240
When this is over,

15
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,910
everything will be fine.

16
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,190
What's wrong?

17
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,660
Do you think

18
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,220
I can become the factory manager

19
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,540
by giving so much money

20
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
to help the factory?

21
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,220
All right, come on.
Let's count the money.

22
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,940
Who's there?

23
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,940
I need to talk to you.

24
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,940
I'll wait for you downstairs.

25
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,820
I'll be right back.

28
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,140
Ye,

29
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,260
the money...

30
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,020
I'm not asking you for money.

31
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,140
The money is yours.

32
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,020
It's up to you how you spend it.

33
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,660
I was wrong.

34
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,140
What's going on these days

35
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,820
reminds me

36
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,460
of an idiom I used to tell my son about

37
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,020
called watching the sky from a well.

38
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,740
I am the frog at the bottom of the well.

39
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,740
I used to think

40
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,220
I was different from people
who only had money in their eyes

41
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,340
because I thought
I was superior to them,

42
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,720
that I had a better understanding
of life than they did.

43
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,140
Now I know

44
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,780
they weren't wrong,

45
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,020
I was.

46
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,900
What do you mean?

47
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,140
You know what I did wrong?

48
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,580
I was wrong

49
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,820
because I was watching the world
from a well.

50
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,260
I was wrong
because I didn't know the world.

51
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,700
I was wrong
because I'm too narrow-minded.

52
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm just like

53
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,900
those who missed the train.

54
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,020
I missed it.

55
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,220
The train went away.

56
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,020
I was left behind.

57
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,820
I want to catch up.

58
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,060
Let's do it again.

59
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,580
Let's do something big.

60
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,180
Ye,

61
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,260
I can't do it this time.

62
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,140
You once told me

63
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,580
that we have to live our lives
for the people we care about.

64
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,660
No matter what happens now,

65
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,020
at least you'll still have your son

66
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,020
and a home.

67
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,820
A home is more important
than anything else.

68
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
Listen to me.

69
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,140
Forget what we did before,

70
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,260
and start over.

71
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,020
We still have a chance.

72
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,740
So you turned me down for her?

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
Sorry, Ye.

74
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,980
What are you doing here?

75
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
Go away!

76
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,210
No wonder you gave me
the passbook so easily.

77
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
You can't take this money.

78
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,420
It's the factory's life-saving money.

79
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,020
Xia Haitao.

80
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,380
It's my life-saving money.

81
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,900
- Let go!
- Xia Haitao, you'll be retributed.

82
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,180
Will you let go or not?

83
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,660
Will you let go or not?

84
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,940
The sky

85
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,860
is blue.

86
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,620
(That morning, Dantong)

87
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,380
(That morning, Dantong)
The river

88
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,893
is as green

89
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,800
as the neck of a male duck,

90
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,620
unusually green.

91
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,020
That's why they

92
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,420
call it Yinglu River.

93
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,300
Why does it pronounce as "lu"?

94
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
It's in this place,

95
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,340
it's pronounced as "lu".

96
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,660
What's produced here

97
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
at the mouth of the sea?

98
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,300
Protosalanx chinensis.

99
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm not reading a book.

100
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,760
There's no such thing in books, right?

101
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,500
My knowledge is vast.

102
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,620
I'm right here on the bank

103
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
of Yinglu River.

104
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,060
Look at this view.

105
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,100
It's so...

106
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,380
That's all.

107
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
I'm going to catch protosalanx chinensis
for you.

108
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,140
Tell Mom

109
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm fine

110
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,380
and don't put her on the phone.

111
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,380
Remember to practice your handwriting.

112
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,590
Okay.

113
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,860
All right.

114
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Yinglu River

115
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,380
is really amazing.

116
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,620
It's unusually green.

117
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,690
I...

118
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,500
What are you doing here?

119
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,020
Everybody's business is nobody's business.

120
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,260
Aren't you hurt?

121
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,660
I have to take you back.

122
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,420
Take it out.

123
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,300
Letter of introduction

124
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,380
from Public Security Bureau.

125
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,580
(Letter of Introduction
from Lanshui Public Security Bureau)

126
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,220
What about disciplinary action?

127
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,780
Chief Zhao said

128
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,260
that he will save it up for you.

129
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,800
He'll decide what to do
when you're back.

130
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,300
That's really what he said.

131
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,660
How thoughtful.

132
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,980
We still don't have any leads
on who hurt you.

133
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,560
After carefully examining the cellar,

134
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,180
we found traces
of at least three people,

135
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,140
including you.

136
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,740
Besides, we found a lead bullet

137
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,020
at the scene.

138
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,060
The lead bullet
shattered the light bulb.

139
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,060
We assume

140
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,540
it was a shot from a clay gun.

141
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,420
Because some of the old hunters

142
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
who used to go to the mountains

143
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,660
have hidden guns in their homes.

144
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,780
In the past two days, we've done
a detailed investigation.

145
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,280
We've basically confirmed the source.

146
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,980
It's long gone.

147
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,060
When did you lose it?

148
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,620
When my husband was alive.

149
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,900
Go and ask him.

150
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,780
Some people

151
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,220
said they saw someone leaving your place

152
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
with a long object

153
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,500
wrapped in a cloth.

154
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,700
That's a gun, right?

155
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,020
You call a rolling pin a gun?

156
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,380
Don't talk rubbish here.

157
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,500
He must be blind.

158
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,500
Whose rolling pin is wrapped in a cloth?

159
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,380
Mine.

160
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
Did you sell the gun already?

161
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,580
Who did you sell it to?

162
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,980
Who could I sell it to?
Would you buy it?

163
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,620
I just put it in the kitchen.

164
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
Find it if you can,

165
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
but if you can't, forget it.

166
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,380
Who do you think you're talking to?

167
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,460
Do you know how many years
of imprisonment you'll get

168
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,340
for illegal possession of a gun,
buying or selling a gun?

169
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,620
How many years?

170
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
Come on,

171
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,620
just put me in prison.

172
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,620
What do you want?

173
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,940
Listen here.

174
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,140
My husband is dead,

175
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,700
my child is dead,

176
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
and I have long since given up on life!

177
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,390
If you really want to go to them,

178
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,820
come at me now with the knife.

179
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,590
Otherwise, you're just
telling empty words.

180
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,820
Sir, it hurts.

181
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
Come on.

182
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,860
Your noodles are ready.

183
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,740
There's one
without chopped spring onions.

184
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,850
Captain Cui, there are
no spring onions in your bowl.

185
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,220
This is our local specialty.

186
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,820
It's very delicious. Dig in.

187
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Is getting injured a specialty here too?

188
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,580
Our captain's had it twice

189
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
at the same place.

190
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,780
Captain, you're really something.

191
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,980
You don't want to have your noodle?

192
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,050
Give it to me if you don't.

193
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,620
I want it.

194
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,940
Have some meat.

195
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,100
Captain,

196
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,860
based on the brat's statement

197
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,580
and your attack yesterday,

198
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,820
it's possible that Jin Xiasheng

199
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,140
took the guy into the cellar

200
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,020
and released him for some reason.

201
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,260
That guy injured you later.

202
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,380
He heard something

203
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,330
and thought Jin Xiasheng had come back.

204
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,460
You have improved.

205
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,290
Can you tell me something I don't know?

206
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,940
The point is,

207
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,740
where is Jin Xiasheng right now?

208
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,340
Who's the man he's trying

209
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
to kill?

210
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,500
That guys must have clues
about Jin Xiasheng.

211
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,700
Jin,

212
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,340
it's not easy being a factory manager.

213
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,700
Your brother should know best.

214
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,220
But then he did something like that.

215
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,100
I understand

216
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,820
he's upset.

217
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,860
But he shouldn't have got out
of his head

218
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,940
and gone down that path.

219
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,770
He didn't live a life of understanding,

220
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,500
but you should know better, right?

221
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Jin,

222
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,980
I heard your youngest nephew is back.

223
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
He's young

224
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,180
and impulsive.

225
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,540
I'm afraid he's got
some misunderstanding

226
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,020
and resentment

227
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,940
about something.

228
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,420
You need to advise him more.

229
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,220
You know what I mean?

230
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,500
(Dongfeng Coal Mine)

231
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,340
Han.

232
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,900
This is Han,
who's in charge of this area.

233
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,020
He's familiar with the area.

234
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,180
We know each other.

235
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,740
I knew you're here on duty.

236
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,580
All right, leave it to me.

237
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,140
Don't worry, I'll take them in.

238
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,860
Okay, bye.

239
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,500
Mr. Hu.

240
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,860
Han.

241
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,820
This is Officer Cui

242
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,900
from the South.

243
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,180
There's something

244
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,780
he wants to talk to you about.

245
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,700
Officer Cui.

246
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,820
Jin,

247
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,500
why are you here?

248
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,220
Who is he?

249
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,180
He used to work in this factory.

250
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,700
Jin Chaohai.

251
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,580
Jin Chaohai?

252
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,900
Who is Jin Chaoshan to you?

253
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,300
My older brother.

254
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,380
- Jin,
- You...

255
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
if there's nothing else,
you can go home now.

256
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,700
Let's go. Let's talk next time.

257
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,260
Let's go. Let's talk next time.

258
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,980
Officer Cui,

259
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
unfortunately,

260
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,580
I have something to do later.

261
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,260
Unfortunately, I need to see you
about something.

262
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,220
Let's have a talk.

263
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,930
Okay.

264
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,060
Come to my office then.

265
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,900
Let's go.

266
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,340
Okay.

267
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,140
(Dongfeng Coal Mine)

268
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
I've been wanting to replace
this painting for a long time.

269
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,060
I kept it

270
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,140
to show my employees

271
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,460
that they could do better under me.

272
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,900
Safe production.

273
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
You guys

274
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
do radio calisthenics here, don't you?

275
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,980
You have to relax to be productive,

276
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,940
don't you?

277
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,460
What's with the bruises on your face?

278
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
I fell.

279
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,980
That's a lot of powder.

280
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,060
It doesn't cover it.

281
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Officer Cui.

282
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Later,

283
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,260
I have to go to the city

284
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,740
to have a meeting with the secretary.

285
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,540
Whatever you want to know,

286
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,580
I'll tell you.

287
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,290
It's just
that I don't have a lot of time.

288
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,140
You don't have a lot of time?

289
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,740
How can we talk?

290
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
You fell too,

291
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Officer Cui.

292
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,980
I was attacked while I was here.

293
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,140
Here?

294
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,820
I was so unlucky, huh?

295
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,500
Don't let me catch this guy.

296
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,820
Wednesday night,

297
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,980
why were you in the cellar
of Jin Chaoshan's old house?

298
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,540
That's impossible.

299
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,500
Jin Chaoshan is long dead.

300
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,300
Let me think about it.

301
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,420
Wednesday night...

302
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,460
I drank too much at home that day.

303
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,940
With whom?

304
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,500
Alone.

305
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm under a lot of pressure.

306
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,060
I'm in charge of several factories,
hundreds of people.

307
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,780
What?

308
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,460
It's okay for people
to drink on their own,

309
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,900
isn't it?

310
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,980
Let me straighten it out for you.

311
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,020
A year ago, you set up a scheme

312
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,060
to take over Dongfeng Coal Mine.

313
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,980
Jin Chaoshan knew

314
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,540
you were behind it

315
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,260
and hanged himself
in front of your office building.

316
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,980
His son, Jin Xiasheng, came back

317
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,940
and found out about it

318
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,420
and wanted to avenge his dad's death.

319
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,270
On Wednesday night,

320
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,220
he tied you up in the cellar
of his old house

321
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,140
and tried to kill you with a shotgun.

322
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,940
Am I right?

323
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,020
Officer Cui,

324
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,500
you're really good at making up stories.

325
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,940
Is this a story?

326
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,420
Go on making it up.

327
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,220
Don't worry, I won't bother you
about my head injury.

328
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,220
I'm afraid you'll do something stupid.

329
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,740
You're a sensible man.

330
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,900
Today, you wanted to settle this

331
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
with Jin Chaohai with money.

332
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,540
When Jin Xiasheng kidnapped you,

333
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,580
didn't you want to use money
to buy your life?

334
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,780
Jin Xiasheng didn't want it,

335
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,660
that's why he fired the shot.

336
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,260
You're lucky

337
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,740
to be alive this time.

338
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
Will you

339
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,500
be that lucky next time?

340
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,980
Think about it.

341
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,220
You're in the open,

342
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,220
and Jin Xiasheng is in the dark.

343
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
He can kill you anytime.

344
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,700
If Jin Xiasheng can't be caught,

345
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,700
this painting will be replaced
with your portrait sooner or later.

346
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,020
(Dongfeng Coal Mine)

347
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,500
Am I right?

348
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,740
Is this a story?

349
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,740
(Police)

350
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,820
Captain,

351
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,260
is Jin Xiasheng in Dantong now or not?

352
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,460
According to Hu Kuiyong,

353
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,980
he posted something.

354
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,060
Hu Kuiyong said he didn't hear it,

355
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,140
his hearing went bad
at the crucial moment.

356
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
The key is who he posted it to.

357
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,500
Go to the post office with the comrades

358
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,740
from Dantong and find out.

359
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,260
Captain, what about you?
What are you going to do?

360
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,260
Where are you going?

361
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,300
Are you controlling me?

362
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,500
No, you're just hurt.
I'll go for you if you need anything.

363
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,540
Are you controlling me too?

364
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,380
Go now.

365
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,020
Tell me if there's anything going on.

366
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,420
Yes.

367
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,980
Why did Hu Kuiyong
give you so much money?

368
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,420
He said it was a small token
of his goodwill.

369
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,020
Is he such a nice guy?

370
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,020
Did Xiasheng

371
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,660
really go to him?

372
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,180
Jin.

373
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,740
Who's it?

374
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
Han.

375
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,260
Which Han?

376
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,660
Officer Han.

377
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,140
I've brought someone over
to talk to you.

378
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,180
Jin.

379
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Sorry to bother you.

380
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,260
Have a seat.

381
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,420
She's Mrs. Jin, right?

382
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,420
Yes.

383
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,300
Pour some water.

384
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,180
Don't bother.

385
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,700
It's okay. No.

386
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,780
I'll be leaving in a minute.

387
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,380
Well...

388
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,580
Jin,

389
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,300
I believe in your brother,

390
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,220
Jin Chaoshan.

391
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,500
I'm here

392
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,460
to tell you

393
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,700
that Jin Chaoshan's case

394
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,260
may be reopened.

395
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,020
I'm sure when the time comes,
there will be an explanation

396
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,900
for your brother and the old staff.

397
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,940
That's great.

398
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Yes.

399
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,740
You two families are quite close.

400
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,820
Jin Chunsheng, Jin Xiasheng.

401
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,900
Tell me about these two kids.

402
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,980
What are they like?

403
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,740
Why don't you tell me, Mrs. Jin?

404
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,760
I'd like to get to know them.

405
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,220
How should I put it?

406
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,140
They're both good kids.

407
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Chunsheng is opinionated

408
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,500
and Xiasheng isn't.

409
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
He always

410
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,940
follows his brother's lead.

411
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,380
Then,

412
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,300
something happened to Chaoshan's family.

413
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,140
They...

414
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,740
What's happened

415
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,300
to them?

416
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,420
Jin,

417
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,500
I won't beat around the bush with you.

418
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,220
Where is Jin Xiasheng now?

419
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,700
I know Jin Xiasheng came back for you.

420
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,940
You took care of his dad's funeral.

421
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,300
I visited the cemetery too.

422
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,020
You can't afford to pay

423
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,900
for that cemetery
in your family's condition.

424
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,540
Have you ever wondered

425
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,020
where this money came from?

426
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,460
I've talked to many old staff
of Dongfeng Coal Mine.

427
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,060
I've learned about the situation.

428
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,740
I heard that your brother listened
to someone's advice

429
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,540
when he bought the equipment.

430
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,940
They told me

431
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,970
that your brother doesn't usually listen
to other people's opinions.

432
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,500
You know what's going on, Jin.

433
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,780
Did something really happen to them?

434
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,540
Why else would I come to you?

435
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm the one who got my brother
and his family into trouble.

436
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,680
Jin.

437
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,560
- Jin.
- What are you doing?

438
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,900
- Jin.
- Get up.

439
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,580
What are you doing?

440
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,540
If I hadn't listened to Hu Kuiyong
and persuaded my brother

441
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,740
to buy the equipment,

442
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,060
my brother's family
wouldn't have come this far.

443
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,980
Those two kids are pathetic.

444
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,740
They're good kids.

445
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,500
If they've done anything outside,

446
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,980
they must have been tricked.

447
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
It's my fault.

448
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,300
- Officer Sir, I'll kowtow to you.
- Jin.

449
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,700
- Jin, you...
- It's my fault.

450
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,660
Calm down.

451
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,300
Jin, listen to me.

452
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,220
If you really care about your nephew,

453
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,260
tell me where he is now.

454
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,300
Is Jin Xiasheng still in Dantong?

455
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,060
Captain Cui,

456
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,660
let me send you back.

457
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm looking for a place to get some air.

458
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,500
The river breeze is salty too.

459
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,140
Look.

460
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,980
Look over there.

461
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,060
That's the city.

462
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,580
Can you see it?

463
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,300
We don't feel anything

464
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,980
when we're inside.

465
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,020
But when we look at it here,

466
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
we'll see

467
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,380
that the light

468
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,260
is really dim.

469
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,660
All the people

470
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,940
have gone to the South.

471
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,580
Speak.

472
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,780
Captain, I've got it.

473
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,980
Jin Xiasheng did send a registered mail.

474
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,180
(Name of Recipient: Xia Yu)
It's sent to Lanshui.

475
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,900
The recipient's name is Xia Yu.

476
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,660
Tell the men at the station

477
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,530
to find the recipient
as soon as possible.

478
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,590
We'll go back in the morning.

479
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,600
The patient suffered a severe
head injury. Try to keep her stable.

480
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
Be careful.

481
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,300
Be careful.

482
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,700
You can't enter.

483
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:06,980
What happened?

484
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,820
I have no idea.

485
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,000
Wasn't she just fine?

486
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,060
I have no idea.

487
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,900
It's all right.

488
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,460
Take your time.

489
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,820
I went back

490
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
and she wasn't there.

491
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,500
She didn't pick up the phone
when I called her.

492
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,800
I looked everywhere for her,
but I couldn't find her.

493
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,960
When I found her, she...

494
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
The doctor said

495
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,220
if she'd been sent here earlier...

496
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,900
Why?

497
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,460
Ye, tell me why.

498
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,980
It's all right.

499
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,940
Xiasheng.

500
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,750
The patient's family,
please pay the fee.

501
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,380
I'll go. You wait here.

502
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,700
Don't worry.

503
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,940
She'll be fine.

504
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,140
You stay here.

505
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,820
Ye.

506
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,460
Be careful.

507
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,380
I don't use this room much,

508
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,540
so I use it for storage.

509
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,940
Take a look.

510
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,420
The road below

511
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,500
is usually quite quiet

512
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,540
and not noisy.

513
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,700
If there's nothing,

514
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,140
don't bother me.

515
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,860
The amount is just right.

516
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,580
Why do you rent this place?

517
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,940
To play Go.

518
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,180
It's noisy with my kid at home.

519
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,940
You're a professional Go player?

520
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,460
What's your level?

521
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,860
I won't bother you then.

522
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,900
I'll leave you to it.

523
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,140
You knew the rules

524
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,460
when you took the money

525
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,820
from me.

526
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,020
You don't do things by the book.

527
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,660
But my business

528
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
is based on rules.

529
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,260
Yi,

530
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,820
I'll pay you back my debt.

531
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Look at all these.

532
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,500
I'll give you more, okay?

533
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,340
Xia.

534
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,420
Look at this fish.

535
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,180
It'll give up its life

536
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,300
for a bite.

537
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,140
Human beings can't be worse
than fish, right?

538
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,660
Let's do this.

539
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,140
Compete with it.

540
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,380
If you can outlast it,

541
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
I'll assume you haven't
broken any rules.

542
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,820
Yi.

543
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,220
Yi.

544
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,620
Yi!

545
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,250
♪Side by side♪

546
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,680
♪Set up a new tomb on the grave♪

547
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,080
♪Hoping to be reincarnated

548
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,020
Yi, the meat is all divided up.

549
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,620
Yi.

550
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,380
You're all here.

551
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,900
Deliver all these tea leaves

552
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,260
to them tomorrow.

553
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,860
Thank them

554
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,340
for their kindness for me.

555
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,020
Got it, Yi.

556
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,460
Why are you still standing there?

557
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,280
Go to the kitchen and serve the food.

558
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,700
Madam Tang.

559
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,140
It's time to water the flowers.

560
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,340
Okay.

561
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,820
(Dunquan Safe)

562
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,520
You're still thinking about it?

563
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,820
I can't figure out

564
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,660
what happened that night.

565
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,260
Which villain did that?

566
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,220
The doctor said her condition
wouldn't have been so bad

567
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,820
if she hadn't sent it so late.

568
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,100
Don't let me find that scoundrel.

569
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,540
Anything's possible.

570
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,940
Maybe the money was targeted.

571
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,540
(Xiasheng)

572
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
It's also possible

573
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,980
that she met

574
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,580
a hooligan.

575
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,500
Whatever happened happened.

576
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,340
Think about

577
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,500
what's most important

578
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,580
to her afterwards.

579
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,380
She needs money for her treatment.

580
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,060
We need to find a way
to make more money.

581
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,180
Did you see the money?

582
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
No.

583
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,220
It's okay.

584
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,660
We'll make them hand over

585
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,060
the money themselves.

586
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,340
Do you believe me?
