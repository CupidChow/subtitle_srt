=Episode 3=
=Two Bags of Sugar=

3
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
Qin Xiaoming.

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
A credit cooperative employee.

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,840
He hadn't show up for work
two days before the murder.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,880
He is suspected to have left the city

7
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,240
on train K3556

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,080
at 7.13PM last night.

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
He was probably headed for Kunming.

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,880
But so far

11
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,720
we haven't been able to locate him.

12
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,520
I think the key to this case

13
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,440
lies in the missing bank teller,
Qin Xiaoming.

14
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,520
They can not only

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,720
accurately grasp the time of handover,

16
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,440
but also swiftly subdue the escorts.

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
They know the camera's location

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
and the food delivery channel

19
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,520
of the credit cooperative
before renovation.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,440
This shows that the criminals

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,720
are very familiar with the place.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,440
But they stole training vouchers.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
This proves that Qin Xiaoming

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
had left his job

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
two days before the crime.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
He didn't know

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,600
the delay in settlement payment.

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
So I think

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
our top priority

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,880
is to catch Qin Xiaoming.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,720
He might have been a miner in the past.

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,280
Look at this hand.

33
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,120
It's rough,

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,160
but it's not tanned.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,680
He probably did manual labor

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,400
in a place where the sun never shines.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,480
He took hostages

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,120
and rushed out to distract us.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
He knew he couldn't escape.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Why you?

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,440
Is it okay to bury them there?

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,440
What place is that?

43
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,100
There are some rules
for offering incense. Don't take so many.

44
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,520
Three incense sticks for yourself.

45
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,760
Six incense sticks

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
to pray to two generations.

47
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,160
Nine incense sticks

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
to pray for complete merits.

49
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Where do we go next?

50
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
Bus station.

51
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,280
Once you're out the province,
you can change to a train.

52
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,600
I don't want to go anymore.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,400
If you don't want to go, just ride.

54
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
You're capable.

55
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,230
I will make money if I follow you.

56
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,020
What money are you talking about?

57
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,190
We're safe, right?

58
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,940
You need money. I need money too.

59
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,790
Let's rob again.

60
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,640
I asked her when I was paying respects.

61
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
I asked her
if we could make money together.

62
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,160
She agreed tacitly.

63
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,600
You're crazy to believe this.

64
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Why do you pay respects to her
if you don't believe in her?

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,840
You either leave now

66
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,600
or do whatever you want.

67
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
We have nothing to do with each other.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480
Hear me out.

69
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
Hear me out.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Grandma.

71
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Stop peeling.

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
I don't want to eat.

73
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,870
Let's go out for a walk.

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Look at you.

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,720
You're still worrying me.

76
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,320
You're just like

77
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,960
your uncle when he was a kid.

78
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,440
You're naughty.

79
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm like Captain Cui?

80
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,320
I thought you would say

81
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,520
I'm like my dad when he was a kid.

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
You're like all of them.

83
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
Grandma.

84
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,520
Between Captain Cui and my dad,

85
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,320
who do you like more?

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,080
Both of them are my children.

87
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
I like them both.

88
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,960
Grandma.

89
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,160
You're like my teacher

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
asking me whether I should choose

91
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
A or B

92
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,000
in this multiple-choice question.

93
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400
If I said A and B are both right,

94
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,160
my teacher will punish me
to stand on the podium.

95
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,380
Well...

96
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
Who do you like?

97
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
Captain Cui, of course.

98
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Captain Cui is impressive.

99
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,520
I think police are the coolest.

100
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
Unlike my dad,

101
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,760
who is always gloomy

102
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,520
and only asks me to play chess.

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,880
Your dad is doing it for your own good.

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
How is that for my own good?

105
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Alright.

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,080
Here, eat this apple.

107
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,080
I'll help you get down and move around.

108
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,640
There have been many new scams
in our city recently.

109
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,360
They scammed people under the guise

110
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,680
of computer fortune-telling

111
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,320
and caused people financial losses.

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
We remind the public

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
to raise their awareness of prevention

114
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and stay away from feudal superstition.

115
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's look at another news.

116
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Mr. Wang Hongyu,

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
chairman of Hongyu Group,

118
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,160
(News Live Room)
was recently awarded

119
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,080
the title of Lanshui City's Top Ten
Outstanding Private Entrepreneurs.

120
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,320
Over the years,

121
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
he not only
made outstanding contributions

122
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,500
to the city's industrial innovation

123
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,990
but also sponsored multiple
cultural and sports organizations.

124
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,180
Among them,

125
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,840
the Lanshui City Youth Center
Go class he sponsored

126
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,680
represented our city
in the provincial Go competition

127
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,140
and won the championship.

128
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,320
Mr. Wang Hongyu has long cooperated
with local policies to boost employment

129
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,140
and create more re-employment positions.

130
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,250
He has set a good example

131
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,200
for promoting
our city's stable development.

132
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,080
How many times have I told you this?

133
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
Stop slamming the door.

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
The door is about to fall off.

135
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
You came just in time.

136
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Here's a bunch of flyers.

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
You must finish this task today.

138
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,840
What's wrong?

139
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,080
I want to run a class.

140
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,440
A class?

141
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,360
Aren't you running a class now?

142
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,920
That's a child care center.

143
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,360
It's indeed a child care center.

144
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
What else could it be?

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,960
Besides, we're much cheaper
than child care centers.

146
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,400
I want to run a Go master class.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Master?

148
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
You...

149
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
What kind of master?

150
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,080
(Go and 36 Strategies)
I'll find Wang Hongyu

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
and give him a lecture

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
on Go and business

153
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
as well as Go and life.

154
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Don't company owners
like to cling to those in power?

155
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
Let's make money from them.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
Okay.

157
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
How about this?

158
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,840
Do what I say.

159
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
You only provide the venue

160
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
and take a share.

161
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Then what?

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,320
I just came here to inform you.

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Mr. Wang.

164
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
Mr. Cui.

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Mr. Cui, are you here

166
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
to play chess with me

167
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
or sell insurance to me?

168
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Come here. Please sit.

169
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,600
What do you need?

170
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,680
Mr. Wang.

171
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm here

172
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,480
to discuss some business with you.

173
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,800
Are you

174
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,720
going to start a business?

175
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,680
I think

176
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
we can do

177
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
a Go master class together.

178
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,280
You can take care
of operations and student recruitment.

179
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:27,990
I will teach them.

180
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
You will teach them?

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
My friends all know

182
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,720
you lost to me before.

183
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,240
I'm just kidding.

184
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
Tell me.

185
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,080
What do you have in mind?

186
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
I plan to enroll students

187
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,360
in four batches a year.

188
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,240
We'll recruit ten people this time.

189
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,680
5,000 yuan each.

190
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
We'll make 200,000 yuan

191
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
in one year.

192
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
Deducting the cost

193
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,190
for Youth Center,

194
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,390
we'll split the rest in half.

195
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
Are you done?

196
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,720
I have to work hard for a year

197
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
just to make less than 100,000 yuan?

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,800
Do you see my chessboard?

199
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Guess how much it is.

200
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Forget it. No need to guess.

201
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
You can't guess it right.

202
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
I don't want to tell you either.

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm afraid it'll shock you.

204
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,960
Master class?

205
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,920
If I were to do it,

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,720
you must first ask for 100,000 yuan.

207
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Tuition fee.

208
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,560
- How much?
- 100,000 yuan.

209
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,280
These people didn't come

210
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,080
for your Go chess.

211
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,080
They came to do business with me.

212
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,680
The so-called master class

213
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
is just a platform.

214
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
You can't hold it at Youth Center.

215
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
How embarrassing.

216
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
Hotel.

217
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
High-end.

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,120
The most expensive.

219
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,040
And it has to be a hotel with privacy.

220
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,680
You have to prepare massages.

221
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,080
You have to prepare cocktails.

222
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,800
Only then can it be worthy
of being called master.

223
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,640
Of course.

224
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
The price is another matter.

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,800
According to my calculations,

226
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,200
how much money

227
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,560
do you think you can make?

228
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,040
So

229
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,800
take my advice.

230
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,320
Just play your Go.

231
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,600
Those who failed their businesses
knew how to run one.

232
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
What's more,
you don't know how to run one.

233
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,040
What do you think?

234
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Take care.

235
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Actually, your idea for this master class

236
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
is possible.

237
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,600
You have the potential to succeed.

238
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
Whether this will work or not,

239
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
you have to help me play a game.

240
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
Alright?

241
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,080
This is a common opening.

242
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,680
(First round of the 13th "Fujitsu Cup")
Black made a mistake in the opening.

243
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,960
White plays two points in a row.

246
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,680
Black reached mini-Chinese fuseki
as they wished.

247
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,520
Hello?

248
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Are you sure?

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,360
I have no problem.

250
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,440
If I win, it's 60-40.

251
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
If your people win, it's 40-60.

252
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,960
Okay, we have a deal.

253
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,720
He doesn't want

254
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,360
to play a corner approach.

255
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,200
He wants to break up
this situation as soon as possible.

256
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,320
How were you riding?

257
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,120
You hit me!

258
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,960
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,360
So careless.

261
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,320
Don't be angry.

262
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,600
Young people nowadays...

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
What a lousy bike.

264
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200

277
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,800
What's the matter?
You don't recognize me?

278
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,940
I didn't expect you to keep this photo.

You remember me?

How did you become a teacher?

282
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,120
It's pretty good.

A toast to our hard work

290
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,730
during our youth.

291
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Do you still play Go?

292
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,920
I stopped playing a long time ago.

293
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,760
I'm a businessman now.

294
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
I sell this.

295
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,840
I know you're still playing.

296

You don't play anymore?
I just play for fun.

297

Can we not be like

298
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,080
when we were young?

299
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,320
All we talked about was Go.

and life.

303
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080

come to me?

we never stopped until we won.

to help him play a game of Go.

here to play Go with me

382
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
to start the master class this month.

383

Your idea of this master class

384

is good,

385
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,320

fulfill what he promised you?

402
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,120
No.

you want to win.

406
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,080
You don't know why you want to win.

407
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
Isn't it just a game of Go
whether you lose or win?

408
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
You don't see it yet?

409
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,520

412
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920

you can even join the national team.

Let alone the professional team.

416
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,840
But you lost.

417
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,800
Because you don't understand
human nature.

418
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,490
Do you remember that I paused the game
to go to the restroom?

My teacher tipped me off outside.

420

Let me tell you clearly.

421
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,760
I gave away a bag of sugar back then.

422

The Go you value so much

423
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,920
is just a transaction to others.

424

At least we have some history together.

425

I owed it to you.

Here's a piece of advice.

427
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,040
Making money is what's important.

428
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,640

if he follows you.

563
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,480
Think about it carefully.

564
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,320
You've already decided, haven't you?

565
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,840
I haven't decided yet.

566
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,880
I asked you here

567
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,760
so that you can be mentally prepared.

568
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,640
I didn't order anything.

569
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,840

573
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,760
Hello. I'm here to pay the bill
for the table upstairs.

574
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,840
Hello?

Please call 1825 for me.

576

Please leave a message for me.

577
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,640
What did the doctor say?

578
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,680
Can he have surgery now?

579
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,640
I'll get some water.

580
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,520
I'll peel an orange for you.

581
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,320
Is it sweet?

Boss.

586

I'm the one who reinstalled
the phone system with you last time.

587
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,120
Do you

588
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,080
still have

589
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,480
