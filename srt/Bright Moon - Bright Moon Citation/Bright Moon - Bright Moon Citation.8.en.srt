1
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,500
is like

2
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,040
he gave all his warmth

3
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,410
to the girl he knew since childhood?

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,790
In the dream, he...

5
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,870
Maybe he just took me as a substitute.

6
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,620
I really want to see that girl.

7
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,950
What kind of beauty

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,910
that made him so unforgettable?

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,039
Why is the wine gone?

10
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,789
You've had enough.

11
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,870
I'm not drunk.

12
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Give me the wine.

13
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm not drunk.

14
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not drunk.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,700
Senior Kang.

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,750
Senior Kang.

17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,410
Look what I brought you.

18
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,080
The top-quality "Nujiao".

19
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,410
Your favorite.

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,700
The willow is here.

21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,500
Come on.

22
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,410
Chan.

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,500
Look who’s here.

24
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
Brother Brothers Willow.

25
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,450
This kid.

26
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,620
Brother Liu.

27
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,290
The shadow puppet you gave me last time

28
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,829
the shadow puppet you gave me last time.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,829
Do you want to hear it?

30
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,620
Tell me.

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,829
It's such a good thing.

32
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,079
without me.

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,160
We're waiting for you.

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,870
Brother Xiao Seul.

35
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,870
Only Brother Fold Liu treats you well.

36
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,370
Don't you like

37
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,370
Don't you like it?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
Candied haws.

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,829
Brother Xiao Seul is the best.

40
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,870
Look how happy you are.

41
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,450
Xiao Seul.

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Mr. Jiang.

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,250
Look.

44
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:48,950
folding willow

45
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,790
It's a premium memorandum.

46
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,450
Let's get drunk tonight.

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,250
Yes, let's get drunk.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,040
I must have a few drinks with you today.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,790
No, no.

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,329
Smells good.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,370
Father.

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,660
Okay.

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,540
Well,

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,370
Just one sip.

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,750
After we finished drinking last time,

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,250
after drinking with me.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,200
Father.

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,910
I beg you.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,290
It’s the wind.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,290
Why do I know Feng Weimian?

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,870
Why is Brother Xiao Seul

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,410
appear in my house?

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,790
Who killed my father?

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,540
Why can't I remember anything?

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,450
You're awake.

66
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,040
You must be hungry.

67
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,500
I brought you some snacks.

68
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,290
Eat up.

69
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,750
Where are you going?

70
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,330
Back to Licha Pavilion.

71
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,580
What do you remember?

72
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,250
In my dream,

73
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,580
I saw my father

74
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,540
and you, Brother Xiao Seul.

75
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
Anything else?

76
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,250
Wind sleepless.

77
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,790
Wind sleepless.

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
It's folding willow.

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,790
So

80
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,080
you have found out

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,660
Wind sleepless is broken willow.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In my dream,

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,700
you were all nice to me

84
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,700
and care about me.

85
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,040
But I don't understand

86
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,040
why you don't tell me

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,330
without telling me?

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,909
After that incident,

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,159
you were sent back to the building.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,080
You seem to be in shock.

91
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,290
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,450
I want to tell you when the time comes.

93
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,290
But if I miss the chance,

94
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,620
if you miss the chance.

95
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,160
it'll be hard.

96
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,910
Are you talking about

97
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,870
that my father was killed?

98
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,290
Senior Kang.

99
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,700
is not a member of Licha Pavilion,

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,450
but I'm also your mother

101
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,160
is your mother.

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,790
are a perfect match.

103
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,040
Unfortunately,

104
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,700
Senior kite died

105
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,830
when he was on a mission.

106
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,250
After that,

107
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,620
Senior Kang

108
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,200
take good care of

109
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,250
my juniors.

110
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,950
Especially

111
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,870
Fo Liu and I

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,950
In my dream,

113
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,870
you were close to folding Ryu.

114
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,870
Yes.

115
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,950
We are the closest brothers.

116
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,620
If he hadn't insisted on leaving,

117
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,080
I think

118
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,200
we will still be the same.

119
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,790
But...

120
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,330
why did he leave?

121
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,330
I don't know.

122
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,870
Back then,

123
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,000
he left you in front of Licha Pavilion.

124
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,870
I want to chase him.

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I wanted to ask him.

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,120
But he left without looking back.

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,910
He sent me back to Licha Pavilion.

128
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,370
Who killed my father?

129
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,870
Who killed my family?

130
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,540
It's time to find him in the incense hall.

131
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,700
Here's your tea.

132
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,750
Do you know

133
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,830
why he asked Feng Weimian to go back?

134
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,910
I came late.

135
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,910
I only heard of the name of folding willow.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,250
I've never seen his real body.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,290
Back then,

138
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,290
was Xiao Seul's father.

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,000
took the wind

140
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,080
back to the building,

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,200
no one expected

142
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,500
he was gifted.

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,830
The old owner praised him.

144
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,870
There are even rumors that

145
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,580
the former owner

146
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,750
to pass the position to him.

147
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,950
Did he leave

148
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
because Xiao Seul became the master?

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Of course not.

150
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,410
He never cared about fame and fortune.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,250
They have different concepts.

152
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,750
I told you

153
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,580
people from Licha Pavilion are not welcome here.

154
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,750
She remembered everything.
