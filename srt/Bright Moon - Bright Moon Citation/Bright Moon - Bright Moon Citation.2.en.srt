1
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,410
Drink with me.

2
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,000
Why is there a woman?

3
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,160
Jiuniang.

4
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,870
Before entering someone’s room,

5
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,910
before entering someone's room.

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,910
Who would have thought

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,830
you’re hiding a beauty in a golden house.

8
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,540
My name is Jiang Chan.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Thank you for saving me.

10
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,580
I'll stay here for a while.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,370
Only Mr. Feng can help us.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,160
Then you should...

13
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:11,660
to repay her.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,750
She'll leave after she's fully recovered.

15
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,450
I won't disturb you then.

16
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,750
She knows martial arts.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,750
No.

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,039
The plan worked.

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,910
We can find another time.

20
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,830
What's going on?

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,950
My fan was ambushed.

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,500
If this gets out...

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,250
Look at him.

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,000
I think I can be the next head showgirl.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,750
Guards!

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Hold her down.

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,540
Take off your clothes and check.

28
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,750
The taste of balm.

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
shouldn't we

30
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,950
test on humans?

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,329
She knows martial arts.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,700
Is Jiuniang testing her?

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,450
Oh no.

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,910
This girl...

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,950
knows kung fu.

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,950
Murder!

37
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,870
I don’t even have enough people in this yard.

38
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,829
Jiuniang.

39
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,450
You’re good.

40
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,079
I didn't expect

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,540
So scary.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,790
Tell me.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Who sent you here?

44
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,250
I won't tell you.

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,000
Stay here.

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,250
And

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,700
Eat this.

48
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,120
What is this?

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,079
It's an amusement medicine for a courtesan.

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,579
If you eat it,

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,450
you'll lose your mind.

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,620
and ruin your reputation.

53
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,540
I can't expose my identity.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,579
Feed the medicine.

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,660
What should I do?

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,290
Let go of me.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,079
What should I do?

58
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,290
Let go of me!

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,450
Painting fan.

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,330
You're finally here.

61
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,540
I can't let you get hurt again.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,540
Why am I here?

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,159
since I came here?

64
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,200
Jiang Mansion?

65
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,040
Is Jiang Mansion my home?

66
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,000
What happened there?

67
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,040
I was wrong.

68
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,410
But her background is unknown.

69
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,790
I have to find out.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,540
Do you know who she is?

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,620
She is Chan Jiang.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,200
Jiang Rushan's daughter.

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,750
She's from Licha Pavilion.

74
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,950
I know what you want to say.

75
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,160
But I have my own plan.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,580
Fang Liu is the top assassin in Licha Pavilion.

77
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,580
He used poison all year long.

78
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,830
and behaves decently.

79
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,500
But he is a gentleman without sleep.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
They are not the same person.

81
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,120
You...

82
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,409
Are you okay?

83
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,620
But why did the clothes say

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,540
folding the willow in the Collecting Incense Hall?

85
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,160
The wind is sleepless.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,540
Interesting.

87
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,120
Amazing.

88
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,370
So pretty.

89
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,409
Brother,

90
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,040
can you play shadow puppets for me every day?

91
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,409
As long as Chan likes it,

92
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,950
I’ll play it for you every day.

93
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,080
Thank you, sir.

94
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,620
for preparing this shadow puppet play for me.

95
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,250
was prepared for you.

96
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,700
Chan.

97
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,750
If you’re fine,

98
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,370
I’ll leave now.

99
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,660
Jiuniang.

100
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,870
Is she your wife?

101
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,290
Of course not.

102
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,580
But I always feel

103
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,700
Jiuniang doesn’t like me.

104
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,500
I apologize on behalf of Jiuniang.

105
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,159
Jiuniang is half my sister.

106
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,410
I lost my parents when I was young.

107
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,120
and had a poor family.

108
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,580
The Hall

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,500
is just the two of us.

110
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,830
I'm counting on her

111
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,830
her hard work.

112
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,790
has no bad intentions.

113
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,620
I didn't mean to hurt you.

114
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,000
In terms of background,

115
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,160
I do look a bit like Jiuniang.

116
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,080
I lost my memory since I was young.

117
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,040
I don't even remember

118
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,660
what my parents look like.

119
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,950
whether they are fat or thin,

120
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,700
whether they are tall or short.

121
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,660
I don’t remember anything.

122
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,330
I really miss you.

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,750
I miss you so much.

124
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,290
I miss you so much.

125
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,620
Chan.

126
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,410
if you know the truth,

127
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,910
will you forgive me?

128
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,120
But I am a heartless man.

129
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,500
with blood on my hands,

130
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,700
have the right to go with you?

131
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,290
What did you say?

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Chan went to find out about Tiao Liu.

133
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,580
Yes.

134
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,160
You were hurt by the folding willow.

135
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,950
The fan wanted to catch the folding willow

136
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,160
to avenge you

137
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,500
and get rid of the big trouble in Licha Pavilion.

138
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,450
How silly.

139
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I told her not to interfere.

140
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,620
and not to kill Fo Liu.

141
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,200
Guiyuan.

142
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
If you need anything,

143
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,870
if anything happens.

144
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,290
Yes.
