1
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,910
1,01.

2
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,910
1,02.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,450
Sir, your class is finally over.

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you, sir.

5
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,290
What is it?

6
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,870
Sir.

7
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,830
Can I learn to make incense

8
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,080
like them?

9
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,450
Sure.

10
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,910
But you have to pass the test first.

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,330
OK.

12
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,500
Sir, please answer the question.

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,250
Yurong's loneliness and tears are dry

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,910
A pear blossom brings rain

15
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,039
Try to understand the meaning of this poem.

16
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,950
and meaning.

17
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,000
to make a fragrance.

18
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,000
Yurong's loneliness and tears are dry

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,830
A pear blossom brings rain in spring

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,450
Sir.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Why are you here?

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
What are you doing?

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,829
I...

24
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,579
Perfect.

25
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,160
Sir.

26
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,700
Smell it.

27
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,410
How is it?

28
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,120
Smell it again.

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,040
Are you crying?

30
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,200
Sir.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,910
You really shed tears.

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,910
Does that mean I passed the test?

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,250
Yurong's loneliness and tears are dry

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,290
A pear flower brings rain

35
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,450
You're not happy

36
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,660
Aren't you happy?

37
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,700
Sir.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,160
Did I pass?

39
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,540
Right?

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,250
Right?

41
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,829
I passed the test.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,160
Maybe

43
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,580
this is fate.

44
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,450
The Lunar Bind can reveal any secrets

45
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,950
and kill in the illusion.

46
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,540
and weaken one's power.

47
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,370
There are countless people

48
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,620
want to get the Lunar Beam.

49
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,000
Whether it's inside or outside,

50
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,450
many people

51
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,080
have broken the gate of our Jiang family.

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,370
Some people who can't wait

53
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,450
started to act.

54
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,750
Within half a year,

55
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,330
the toxin

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,659
will spread widely.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,950
Who did this?

58
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,450
Fold the willow.

59
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,750
The one who killed me

60
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,660
will eventually appear.

61
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,200
And you

62
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,450
the best assassin in Licha Pavilion.

63
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,370
No matter who placed the order,

64
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,950
in the building,

65
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,700
will definitely send you to do it.

66
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,120
By then,

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,750
don't worry about our relationship.

68
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,200
Kill me.

69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,950
kill me yourself.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,700
But...

71
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm the only one

72
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,909
is me

73
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,290
except me.

74
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,000
If people know our love,

75
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,659
I'm afraid

76
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,370
you will be killed too.

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,040
By then,

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,409
who should take care of Chan?

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,250
Only when I die,

80
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,000
can Chan be safe.

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,200
Chan has been clever since childhood.

82
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,790
Although she didn’t use the Lunar League well,

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,620
she was very prepared.

84
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,410
If I die,

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,330
I have three things to tell you.

86
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,120
First,

87
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,790
take Chan to Floral Fairy Valley

88
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,750
and get the owner to erase her memory.

89
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,370
I don’t want her to live in pain.

90
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,910
Second,

91
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,410
you want to take Chan into Licha Pavilion.

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,790
Licha Pavilion has strict rules.

93
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,409
No place is safer

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,750
Nothing is safer than there.

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,750
Third,

96
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,830
take good care of Chan for me.

97
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,250
Remember

98
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,040
what I said.

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,200
Jiuniang.

101
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,450
I know.

102
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,250
It's time to act.

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,700
Half a year ago,

104
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,870
she suddenly recalled her past

105
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,370
and delayed her schedule.

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,410
I'm afraid

107
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,410
who is the buyer behind the scenes.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Fortunately, Jiuniang understands me.

109
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,580
Although the leader

110
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,370
lost her memory for Chan,

111
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,540
But if she remembers it again,

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,830
Don't worry.

113
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,830
I will find out the truth

114
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,700
before she remembers.

115
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,870
The journey is still dangerous.

116
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,200
I want to see him again.

117
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,200
We finally meet again.

118
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,200
This time,

119
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,250
no matter what we say,

120
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,700
we can't be apart for so long.
