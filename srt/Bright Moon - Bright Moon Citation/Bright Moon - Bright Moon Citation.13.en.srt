1
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,000
Guiyuan. Jiuniang.

2
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,330
Have some tofu pudding.

3
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,700
Brother Xiao Seul.

4
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,580
Master.

5
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,790
The assassin of Licha Pavilion, Dubhe,

6
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,789
was killed

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,580
in Fengyu Pavilion.

8
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,250
Brother Xiao Seul.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,080
Brothers Willow.

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,250
He has been cooking tofu for me today.

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,500
Besides,

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,039
it takes at least half a day

13
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,120
to Fengyu Pavilion.

14
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,080
It can't be his.

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,620
When did I say that?

16
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,000
has something to do with folding willow?

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,830
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,000
I’m here to congratulate Chan

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,370
and folding willow.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Mr. Kang.

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,580
If he finds out that you're together,

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,620
If he knows you are together,

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,870
she would be very pleased.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,830
Chan,

25
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,660
You may not know.

26
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,160
Senior kite

27
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,750
is your mother.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,750
is best at picking flowers.

29
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,250
Kang is good at making medicine.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
When we were young,

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,120
on the way to pick flowers,

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,000
or on the way to make medicine.

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,079
your Brother Brothers Willow

34
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,000
are best at these two things.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,450
In the future,

36
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,790
you should learn from him.

37
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,160
as a consolation.

38
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,870
Mr. Jiang.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
and Senior kite.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Brother Xiao Seul.

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,079
I never thought of betraying the building.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,250
As long as I'm in Licha Pavilion,

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,079
you’ll be a member of Licha Pavilion forever.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,410
Chan,

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,370
You misunderstood me.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,079
When did I say

47
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,540
you're not from the building?

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,620
As your brother,

49
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm happy for you

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,410
I’m happy for you.

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,450
Chan, do you know

52
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,700
these are?

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,370
Angelica.

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,079
River.

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,620
White crisp.

56
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,579
Sanghua.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,250
Red Tony.

58
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,950
Exercising blood.

59
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,910
Chan is so smart.

60
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,329
OK.

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,500
Chan.

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,500
Father.

63
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,290
It's time to go up the mountain to collect herbs.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,660
But aren’t there guests coming?

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,910
I want to stay and help you.

66
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,250
Just do as I say.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,330
This is an order.

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,950
Father.

69
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,700
Why are you suddenly so fierce?

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,200
It's getting late.

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
If these pills are stained with morning dew,

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,200
it will lose its original effect.

73
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,330
Go.

74
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,500
Please.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,659
No.

76
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
No.

77
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,620
Fold the willow.

78
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,790
Who wants to kill Dubhe?

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,120
Fold Liu.

80
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,409
Fo Liu killed my father.

81
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,620
You're finally here.

82
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,450
Is the death of Dubhe

83
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,950
related to Feng Wumei's death?

84
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,790
I didn’t expect

85
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,620
he would be so cruel

86
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,120
and hurt his fellow disciples.

87
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,330
But why did he kill Dubhe?

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,450
Is it really because

89
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,870
I saw the person who killed my father.

90
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,330
It's folded willow.

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,660
I think

92
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,580
Dubhe was killed

93
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,120
he was killed.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But why did he kill my father?

95
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,500
My father was so good to him.

96
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,000
Because the moon

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,659
Lunar guide?

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,790
But why does he want the Lunar Drawing?

99
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,250
He's already the top assassin

100
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,750
in Lili Pavilion.

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,159
Everyone wants to be stronger.

102
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,909
You don't know the Lunar League

103
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,870
or folding willow.

104
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,330
Lunar Leadering is the unique skill of the Jiang family.

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,000
Although Mr. Jiang is not from Licha Pavilion,

106
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,450
but every time he went on a mission,

107
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,870
was drawn by the moon of Kang.

108
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,370
to numb their nerves.

109
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,200
to help your mother

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,330
the first female killer in Licha Pavilion.

111
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,540
Who doesn't want to have such power?

112
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,910
let alone folding willow.

113
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,580
He's always

114
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
who pursues the ultimate martial arts.

115
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,120
In front of desire,

116
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,620
in front of desire.

117
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Chan.

118
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:38,540
Chan, come down.

119
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,450
Father, am I tall?

120
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,040
I’m taller than you.

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Chan, it’s dangerous. Come down.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,950
I told you.

123
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,200
It's so dangerous up there.

124
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,159
Father is protecting me now.

125
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,790
I’ll protect you when I grow up.

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,830
Chan.

127
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Are you still feeling unwell?

128
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,750
Father.

129
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,330
In the future,

130
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,000
take care of myself.

131
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,080
I won't let you worry anymore.

132
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,200
Here.

133
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,040
Be good, Chan.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
Father, come and have a look.

135
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,830
How is it? Is Chan awesome?

136
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,289
Chan is awesome.

137
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,450
This medicine is not easy to make.

138
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,450
Chan actually succeeded the first time.

139
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,289
In the future,

140
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,450
I’ll learn to make more herbs.

141
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,750
and help me in the future.

142
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,000
Chan is really my little coat.

143
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:52,910
Father.

144
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,870
I made this specially for you.

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,870
Father, try it.

146
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,750
How is it? Is it delicious?

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,620
Chan’s cooking is really good.

148
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,950
If you like it,

149
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,700
I’ll cook for you every day.

150
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,040
Chan,

151
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,200
will get married.

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,160
You can't forget me

153
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,700
just because you have someone you like.

154
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,500
I won’t.

155
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,330
Sleepless wind.

156
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,410
I'm going to kill you.
