00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,100
   

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,230
   

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,220

 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ðŸ’“Friends or Foes TeamðŸ’” @ Viki.com 

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,860
Have you already found a place to live?

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,700
Yes. I happened to find a suitable place.

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,570
Sure. That's good.

12
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,170
Grandpa, when the chairman came here, he definitely had two suitcases.

13
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,830
Right?

14
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,970
I'll get going, sir.

15
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,160
But still, even after all this,

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,540
how can she not even say bye?

17
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,700
- Hey, Ji Won! 
 - Oh, wait.

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,670
It's okay.

19
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,860
Take care, Chairman.

20
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,380
It's late. Where are you going?

21
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,930
I'm just going for a run. I'll be back.

22
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,860
She runs when she feels unsettled.

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,860
She's strange today, right?

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,690
Yes, she hasn't eaten much, either.

25
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,580
Once the flowers died,

26
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,290
you said we wouldn't see each other again.

27
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,620
Let's...

28
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,690
Let's stop this.

29
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,290
- Seok Ji Won. 
 - I don't think I can do this.

30
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,670
So, let's forget the bet,

31
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,080
and...

32
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,230
go out with me for real, Yoon Ji Won.

33
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,330
Not seeing you anymore...

34
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,130
I can't bear that.

35
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,150
Even if you abandoned me a long time ago,

36
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,870
and even if everyone is against it, it doesn't matter.

37
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,770
So...

38
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,390
as long as you feel the same,

39
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,570
let's...

40
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,580
â™«  You're falling me down  â™«

41
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,290
â™«  You're raising me up  â™«

42
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,380
Thank you for coming back to me, Seok Ji Won.

43
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,510
â™«  Can't live without you  â™«

44
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,100
â™«  You can count on me from now on  â™«

45
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,120
â™«  As I'm moving on, you can come over to my mind  â™«

46
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,660
â™«  Now, I face you  â™«

47
00:05:51,370 --> 00:06:01,720
â™«  Today, I see you, and I won the bet, the flower has bloomed  â™«

48
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,710
No, Grandpa didn't notice at all.

49
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,080
I acted like nothing happened.

50
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,740
What did you say when you left?

51
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,860
That I was going for a run.

52
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,740
What about this one?

53
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,380
I like it.

54
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,950
- What about this one? 
 - I like it.

55
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,740
What about this one?

56
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,020
I like it.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,680
Come on! You like everything!

58
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,370
All right...

59
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,490
Hey, Yoon Ji Won! This is a defect.

60
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,480
 What? 

61
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,440
- Why is this... 
 - Wow.

62
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,710
You entice me into your room and blatantly turn off the lights?

63
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,100
No, it's not that...

64
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,440
Boo!

65
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,790
Boo!

66
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,930
What is wrong with this?

67
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,730
Hey.

68
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,960
We're here. You can go now.

69
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,120
Here already?

70
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,810
Just go!

71
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,690
Five more minutes.

72
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,410
â™«  Another day just like yesterday  â™«

73
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,780
â™«  Nothing's changed for us  â™«

74
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,210
â™«  Somewhere in memories, touch my heart  â™«

75
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,470
â™«  Some flowers bloom within my love  â™«

76
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:27,750
â™«  I guess you were still my green  â™«

77
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,930
Just getting home?

78
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,860
- Grandpa! 
 - Geez...

79
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,910
Grandpa, you should sleep in your room!

80
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,690
How far did you run? Your face is bright red.

81
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,840
I just ended up running for a while.

82
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,560
Gosh. You must be tired. Go to sleep.

83
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,420
You go to sleep, too, in your room.

84
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,620
Okay.

85
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,110
- Goodnight. 
 - Okay.

86
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,590
Go.

87
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,120
Hey, have you talked to Go Hye Soo in your class?

88
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,650
Hye Soo has never missed first place in the entire school.

89
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,850
I don't think she's okay, but I think she's pretending to be.

90
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,600
She doesn't talk much about herself.

91
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,680
No 18-year-old is good at talking to a teacher about herself.

92
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,410
But maybe she talks to Mr. Hong.

93
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,050
Why was she at the health office?

94
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,450
Well...

95
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,190
Mr. Hong is a little, you know.

96
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,900
Know what?

97
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,760
How do I say this?

98
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,730
He's stoic, sweet, but also sharp.

99
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,730
And it's kind of comforting.

100
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,250
I keep thinking about it even though it wasn't much.

101
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,530
Right.

102
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,780
Talking to Mr. Hong makes you feel warmhearted.

103
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,380
So, what is this vibe?

104
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,140
Why are you being so shy?

105
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,180
S-Shy?

106
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,700
Hey. You're leaving? I smell something.

107
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,050
The bell rang! Go to class.

108
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,290
Wow! I get why you make fun of me now.

109
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,080
Miss Yoon, what is up with you today? Why are you so happy?

110
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm not. I'm the same as usual.

111
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,610
You're taken aback.

112
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,640
Hey, let's go to class.

113
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,510
Hey! You don't have a class this period!

114
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,380
Hello.

115
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,620
   

116
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,270
   

117
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
 Let's have lunch together. Come to my office. 

118
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,490
   

119
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,480
 I'll wait. 

120
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,300
Go home. There's nothing more to edit.

121
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
It felt more like a diary than a journal before.

122
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,940
I don't want to go home.

123
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,200
Miss Yoon, want to see a movie after work today?

124
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,680
- Out of the blue? 
 - I have free tickets.

125
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,310
The friend I was going to see it with says something came up.

126
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,750
Is that a good enough excuse?

127
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,900
Mr. Gong, how about tonkatsu for lunch instead of a movie?

128
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,320
- Tonkatsu? 
 - Yes. My treat.

129
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,940
Sounds good.

130
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,860
Director, here's the sushi you asked for.

131
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,330
The chef's special...

132
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,300
Three orders.

133
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,790
Good work. You take one.

134
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,300
Wow, for real?

135
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,350
Thank you!

136
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,130
But not here. Outside.

137
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,010
Oh, yes.

138
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,560
Wait, are you flirting with the P.E. teacher using sushi?

139
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm against this. Sushi feels a little old-fashioned...

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,250
Enough, Gen MZ Lee Gi Ha.

141
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,380
You can go now.

142
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,130
Okay.

143
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,220
Thank you for the food.

144
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,980
   

145
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,590
   

146
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,510
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

147
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,780
Why isn't she answering her phone?

148
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,680
 I have plans. Enjoy your lunch! 

149
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,810
Darn it.

150
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,490
Darn it, what do I do?

151
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,700
Plans?

152
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,370
Yes, Mr. Choi. Yes.

153
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,760
Pardon?

154
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
The c-chairman? Me?

155
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,250
Right now?

156
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,450
Yes, I won't tell the director. Got it.

157
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,150
Got it.

158
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,030
It's always when I'm about to eat.

159
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,710
You were singing about tonkatsu.

160
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,900
Why did you eat only half?

161
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,290
Now that I think about it, my mom told me she'd buy me tonkatsu when I was little

162
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,420
and then took me to the dentist.

163
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,430
I thought you might have had an ulterior motive.

164
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,140
Maybe it was a root canal. It hurt so much.

165
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,370
But I didn't cry.

166
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,770
So you can just tell me.

167
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,090
I can't hide it from you anymore, Mr. Gong.

168
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,600
As far as my feelings...

169
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,780
No matter how much I try, I can't control them.

170
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,410
I...

171
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,950
like...

172
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,630
Châ€”

173
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,230
   

174
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,880
Mr. Byeon, this is a misunderstanding.

175
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
A misunderstanding? Got it. Let's go with that.

176
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,550
Let's not go with that. It's really not like that.

177
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,740
Why?

178
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,320
Ji Won doesn't do much for you, Mr. Gong?

179
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
No, no, it's not like that.

180
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,040
That's right. That's it.

181
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,920
How could I have not noticed till now?

182
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,630
Because it's not true.

183
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,200
Gosh! How cute!

184
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,350
Both of you are scared pale.

185
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm not that clueless, you know.

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,970
Secret romance? Okay.

187
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,350
Mr. Byeon, a secret romance?

188
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,250
Okay, okay. Then no romance, just a secret.

189
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,880
- Right! These are good times. 
 - No, no, no.

190
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,200
Reminds me of the good old days with my wife...

191
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,210
Just making eye contact in the office made me so happy...

192
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,810
Gosh!

193
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,000
 Come to my office right now. 

194
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,970
    
 Hello.

195
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,350
Mr. Byeon, what are you doing here?

196
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,550
Oh, you know...

197
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,150
It's a secret.

198
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,080
A secret?

199
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
Between us? Don't be like that.

200
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,050
But, Mr. Lee, you have to keep this to yourself.

201
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,490
This is a total secret.

202
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,660
Miss Yoon and Mr. Gong...

203
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,830
I find it unbelievable, but...

204
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,550
What?

205
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,640
What?

206
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
Guys! Miss Yoon's boyfriend isn't the chairman! It's the student teacher!

207
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,900
 What? 

208
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
No way!

209
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,150
Have you heard? Is it just me who knows?

210
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,290
Miss Yoon Ji Won is in a relationship.

211
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,550
With who? Mr. Gong Moon Su.

212
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,580
What?

213
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,510
   

214
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:09,180
   

215
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,050
   

216
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,600
T-The director isn't interested in anything else or anyone.

217
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,100
He only cares about work.

218
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,260
Stop being extra. He's not that bad.

219
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,980
No, I swear with all my heart, Chairman.

220
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,170
 He left the school residence. The bet seems to have been a joke. 

221
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,940
 I heard Ji Won, I mean, Miss Yoon Ji Won was struggling with having him around. 

222
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,810
Got it.

223
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,070
- You moved? 
 - Yes.

224
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,500
The bet was just you to mess with her?

225
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,010
Whoa, but why do I feel so uneasy?

226
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,850
Are you and his granddaughter reallyâ€”

227
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,940
I'm not interested in getting your permission to date, like,

228
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,780
or break up with anyone.

229
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,860
- What did you say? 
 - Also, don't barge into the school residence like that.

230
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,290
I can do whatever I want. What will you do about it?

231
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,310
Will you cut me out of your life or something?

232
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,690
Wow.

233
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,580
You're serious, huh? You want to cut our ties?

234
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,380
Please don't let it get to that, Father.

235
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,170
Geez. That bastard!

236
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,280
Not a single call after I left like that? Dang it. 
    

237
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,220
Yoon Ji Won is not asleep.

238
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,330
Geez, you scared me!

239
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,530
Seok Ji Won, I caught you red-handed.

240
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,020
No, it wasn't like that.

241
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,530
- Why wasn't it like that? 
 - What?

242
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,080
I said, why wasn't it like that?

243
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,650
This is crazy.

244
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,210
What the heck? I'm not doing this.

245
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,570
Why is this so awkward? It's not our first time.

246
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,530
Now that we're dating, I feel even weirder about it.

247
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,880
Hey. You used to be like this, and yet again so shamelessly...

248
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,820
I don't know. Just go. Go home.

249
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,190
Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!

250
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,100
Go away! Let go!

251
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,440
- Let go. 
 - Sorry!

252
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,230
You got up so late. You never do that.

253
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,150
Why are you so busy these days?

254
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,680
Me?

255
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,130
I'm not.

256
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,080
My alarm just didn't go off.

257
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,180
- Tomorrow is the workshop, right? 
 - Yes.

258
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,640
By the way, Grandpa, don't be alone.

259
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,200
I already told Gyeong Hoon we should hang out today.

260
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Good job.

261
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,610
Do you smell something burning?

262
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,650
I don't.

263
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,580
Oh! My crispy rice!

264
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,430
Gosh!

265
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,560
- Oh, my... 
 - Goodness...

266
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,420
- What a waste. 
 - It's all burned.

267
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,990
Don't eat this just because you feel wasteful.

268
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,230
I won't. Don't worry, just go.

269
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,500
I'll clean it up when I get back. Make sure you have breakfast.

270
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,160
I got it, I got it.

271
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,620
Geez, what a waste...

272
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,640
Isn't it crazy?

273
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,920
Yoon Ji Won has never been in a relationship, as far as I know.

274
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,000
Come to think of it, I have seen them together a lot.

275
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
I know!

276
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,800
I thought it was just because he was her student teacher, but that wasn't it!

277
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,410
Maybe that's why Miss Yoon was so upset at the chairman's bet.

278
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,890
The chairman went too far. So clueless.

279
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,770
Imagine how much it bothered those two.

280
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,970
You bought that, too, Mr. Gong.

281
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,520
Oh, you did, too! It was on sale, so I jumped on it.

282
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,140
Same. This was sold out.

283
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,850
Should we move them before class starts?

284
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,800
Yeah. It's the first period, right? Let's get going.

285
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,550
Got it!

286
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,700
Let's go.

287
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,510
One second, Miss Yoon.

288
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,490
Take your time.

289
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,330
What's wrong with this?

290
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,210
One second.

291
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,390
Maybe it's because it's new.

292
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,560
- Let me try. 
 - Okay.

293
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,270
It works. Nice.

294
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,750
A matching couple look?

295
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,650
Nothing stops young people these days.

296
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,610
Are they in matching outfits?

297
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,240
Yes. How daring in many ways.

298
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,370
Wow, they look so good together.

299
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,200
Yes, I understand everything.

300
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,530
- I don't think you doâ€” 
 - Let's say it was a misunderstanding.

301
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,450
That's what happens at schâ€” I mean, where people live.

302
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,010
But...

303
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,110
the zipper...

304
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,270
Why did you zip up his sweatshirt, Ji Won?

305
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,870
He was struggling with it. I wasn't thinking...

306
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,550
You should have been thinking, Ji Won.

307
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,090
Fine. I'm sorry.

308
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,610
What are you sorry for?

309
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,300
Just everything.

310
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,600
Wow. Also, what is this outfit?

311
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,130
We happened to buy the same one.

312
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,840
Don't ever wear it again.

313
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,910
- Why? What? 
 - I didn't know!

314
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,770
It wasn't a mistake. It was a coincidence.

315
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,680
You can't harp on little things like this.

316
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,590
- Harp on it? 
 - That's what you're doing.

317
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,740
Just imagine yourself in my shoes!

318
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,030
So, you don't trust me in the end.

319
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,640
Over a mere zipper?

320
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
There's no need to say that.

321
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Why? I can't get angry because of my zipper crime?

322
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,130
Are you angry?

323
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,960
Yes. Because I apologized, and you won't stop hounding me.

324
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,970
Sorry.

325
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,560
- What for? 
 - Huh?

326
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,590
Well, just everything.

327
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,610
Are you laughing?

328
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,420
No.

329
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,420
But hold on. This all started because of what you didâ€”

330
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,690
So? You want more? More?

331
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,270
Let's see...

332
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,390
250,000 won?

333
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,760
Welcome.

334
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,860
I'm looking for a gift.

335
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,100
It's for someone who can't sleep.

336
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,020
Seems stressed out, too.

337
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,720
How old is the person receiving the gift?

338
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,380
A high school student.

339
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,360
- One moment. 
 - Okay.

340
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,100
Mr. Hong.

341
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,360
Oh, M-Miss Maeng.

342
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,090
What's that? For your nephew?

343
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,560
Sure, yes. How about you?

344
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,000
My mom.

345
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,380
She's always tired around this time of the year.

346
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,710
You know, like at the dentist...

347
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,070
we keep running into each other...

348
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,490
So, we're meant to be or something?

349
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,360
I've thrown myself at you so much that you see right through me.

350
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,910
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

351
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,770
I didn't mean to make you feel like you can't joke around me.

352
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,990
I've come to a conclusion after much thinking.

353
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,320
I thought perhaps my true feelings might also sound like jokes to you.

354
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
Usually, that doesn't matter to me, but...

355
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,460
I don't want to come across that way to you.

356
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,190
That's why I don't want to joke around.

357
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,350
Pardon?

358
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,100
Here.

359
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,410
What is this?

360
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,110
I saw them on the counter.

361
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,550
Neither of us are good at buying things for ourselves.

362
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,300
Let's each have one.

363
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,610
Okay.

364
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,750
Bye now...

365
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,230
Or do you want to have dinner together?

366
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,160
Hong Tae?

367
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,910
Senior.

368
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,000
It's you!

369
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,220
You came to the hospital where I work a few days ago.

370
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,160
From what I heard, I thought it might've been you.

371
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,280
But I still wasn't sure.

372
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,430
You haven't changed.

373
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,860
Can we talk?

374
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,010
Sure. We have a lot to talk about.

375
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,380
I'm on my way home from work, too.

376
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,190
Miss Maeng, see you at school tomorrow.

377
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,880
Sure.

378
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,370
I left some stuff behind.

379
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,950
Sure. Have dinner while you're here, and take your time.

380
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,500
I'll help you pack up everything so you never have to come back.

381
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,830
- Thank you so much. 
 - Don't mention it.

382
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,460
Miss Yoon, for the workshop tomorrow,

383
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,830
do we need to bring our own hygiene kit?

384
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,040
A workshop? School teachers go to that?

385
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,930
- Every year. 
 - I think it'll be fun.

386
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,480
You're probably the only one who thinks that.

387
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,890
All the other teachers hate it. Another Saturday is gone.

388
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,130
Then don't goâ€”

389
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,860
Still, it's fun to grab a drink with like-minded teachers after training.

390
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,370
Oh, Mr. Gong, you need to prepare a song.

391
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,460
What? A song?

392
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,060
All the first-timers need to bring a song. That's tradition.

393
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,800
Gosh, stop teasing him. Moon Su might think it's true and be surprised.

394
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,970
Just leave before the vice principal gets drunk.

395
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,270
When she's drunk, Vice Principal Kang makes people sing.

396
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,750
That's right. There's no tradition. Just avoid the vice principal.

397
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm so, so excited right now.

398
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,640
I'll prepare a killer song.

399
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,490
Really?

400
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,290
I'll look forward to it.

401
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,620
Sure, sure.

402
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,640
Grandpa, you remember your time, right?

403
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,480
Of course.

404
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,360
What song did you sing again?

405
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,580
Are you really doing this to me?

406
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,560
I packed up even the tiniest speck of dust. You can go now.

407
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,620
Are you sure you can survive not seeing me for two days?

408
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,640
Yes. I'm sure, Chairman.

409
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:59,630
 Still, it's fun to grab a drink with like-minded teachers after training. 

410
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,410
 I'm so, so excited right now. 

411
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,170
 I'll prepare a killer song. 

412
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,690
Are you asleep?

413
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,030
 I'm awake because you woke me up. 

414
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,020
Sorry. There's something I need you to do.

415
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,970
I hope we get a new bus this year.

416
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,040
The cushions sucked last year.

417
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,780
We hire the same bus company every year.

418
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,680
What could be different?

419
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,090
I know. My back was killing me that day.

420
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,560
Miss Yoon!

421
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,530
Maeng, what's happening?

422
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,820
I know. We're curious, too.

423
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,640
â™«  You cross the winds like thunder to me  â™«

424
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,080
â™«  You have the strength to fly through the skies  â™«

425
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,910
â™«  Soar up high  â™«

426
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,720
Chairman!

427
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,580
What is all this?

428
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,450
I wanted you to go to the workshop comfortably.

429
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,530
We're riding in that?

430
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes. We also changed the location.

431
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,910
To where?

432
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,200
Oh, yes. It's a resort that Seokban Construction built for employee benefits.

433
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,660
It's ready but not open yet, so you can use it exclusively.

434
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,290
 Wow! Awesome! 

435
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,590
Here's the pamphlet.

436
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,270
Let's head out, then!

437
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,390
With me.

438
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,190
Excuse me. The four of you can ride in this car.

439
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,080
No, no. These two should be together.

440
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,260
Mr. Lee, get in. Mr. Gong, get in.

441
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,420
Ji Won, get in.

442
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,720
Here. Miss Jang, get in.

443
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,060
I'll ride with Ji Won.

444
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,040
Yes, yes, yes.

445
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,280
Excuse me, Mr. Byeon...

446
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,810
Let's go.

447
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,600
- Sure, sure. 
 - Let me get in first.

448
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,100
Gosh, this is nice!

449
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,250
I brought something. What could it be?

450
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,780
Okay. Let's each have one first.

451
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,030
Mr. Assistant! Here. Open wide. That's right.

452
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,080
Drive safe now. Go slowly.

453
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,330
Ji Won, have one. It's delicious.

454
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,670
It's good, right? It's organic. Make sure you chew well.

455
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,670
Gosh, this is so nice.

456
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,260
Why are you staring at me like that?

457
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,470
It's nothing.

458
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,390
A long time ago, you, Ho Seok, and I used to

459
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,580
get groceries like this, go fishing and camping...

460
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,950
I'm just reminiscing.

461
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,130
I'm sorry. I'll visit more often from now on.

462
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,980
Goodness, no thanks. You don't have a lot of spare time.

463
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,940
We can just have a drink on days like this when Ji Won isn't around.

464
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,070
Yes, Mr. Park.

465
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,090
What?

466
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,580
What do you mean?

467
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,850
You're stopping your reporting all of a sudden?

468
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,420
Hello. We've prepared everything per your instructions.

469
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,540
- Miss Yoon, should we go? 
 - Yeah?

470
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,550
Give me my bag, Mr. Gong.

471
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,560
- Let me carry it for you. 
 - It's okay.

472
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,890
Thanks.

473
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,840
Wow! Hey.

474
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,090
People who wanted singles got them.

475
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,290
The best way to be extra is to be extra with money.

476
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,630
That chairman...

477
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,000
But, Miss Maeng, why are you rooming with me? I was going to get a single.

478
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,440
I'm lonely.

479
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,370
I'm lonely these days.

480
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,990
I'm lonely. Please hold me.

481
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,370
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Please hold me.

482
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,000
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Please hold me.

483
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,790
Chairman?

484
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,230
Please sit over here.

485
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,830
- No, no. 
 - Come over here.

486
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,040
- Come over here. 
 - You don't get it.

487
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,480
Hello. Let me introduce myself.

488
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,240
My name is Kim Seon Yeong, and I will be leading you through the

489
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,010
Digital Integration in Education workshop.

490
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,160
Nice to meet you.

491
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,730
Thank you.

492
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,620
Thank you for such a warm welcome.

493
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,220
Take a look at the screen in the front and review case studies...

494
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,420
- Did you have plenty to eat? 
 - Yes, I have.

495
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:42,140
- Have plenty, Mr. Gong. 
 - I don't get why young teachers don't like workshops.

496
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,830
Isn't it nice to gather around and have a drink together?

497
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,120
If the chairman takes good care of us every time,

498
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,640
I don't mind if we do this every quarter!

499
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,750
The sedan cornering!

500
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,900
I'm happy that you're happy.

501
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,610
Let's do cheers.

502
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,200
Goodness.

503
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,760
All right.

504
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,700
Let's thank the chairman for his great generosity and love.

505
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:17,760
Let's drink all night tonight until we die!

506
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,640
Gosh, the vice principal got ahold of the mic.

507
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,630
When did she get so drunk?

508
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,750
This won't end until someone sings.

509
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,440
Then...

510
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,330
who's going to sing first?

511
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,770
Who's going to go first?

512
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,840
Who's going to?

513
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,700
Sing a song?

514
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,010
Over here!

515
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,140
- Thank you! 
 - It's so lonely to sing alone.

516
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,900
It's boring.

517
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,040
A duet by Miss Yoon Ji Won and Mr. Gong Moon Su!

518
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,590
What do you think, everyone?

519
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,990
Vice Principal, I can't sing...

520
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,070
It would be nice to sing a duet. Make some memories.

521
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,420
You're it!

522
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,840
Come on up. Over here.

523
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,840
Applause!

524
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,740
Miss Yoon, are you okay?

525
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,820
   

526
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,800
â™«  I don't remember when it was  â™«

527
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,050
â™«  Those days when my head was dizzy with you  â™«

528
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,690
â™«  A thought crossed my mind once or twice  â™«

529
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:07,100
â™«  Then they became longer, I was taken aback  â™«

530
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:16,150
â™«  Those feelings, maybe they're no big deal  â™«

531
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:21,300
â™«  Maybe they're merely passing  â™«

532
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:31,020
â™«  It's so awkward how I keep telling myself this  â™«

533
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,870
â™«  Perhaps it's love, if you feel the same way  â™«

534
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,580
â™«  Is this the beginning?  â™«

535
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,700
â™«  My heart keeps loving you  â™«

536
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:52,290
â™«  Shout it out loud so the world can hear  â™«

537
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:57,480
â™«  Why haven't I heard it until now?  â™«

538
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,960
â™«  Ooh, for us to be together  â™«

539
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,730
â™«  I'm finally looking for love  â™«

540
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,280
What? Why was that so sweet?

541
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
I like you a lot.

542
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,770
They would've been sad if I didn't make them sing.

543
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,360
They were so good.

544
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,650
Good for you for stopping the broadcast.

545
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,850
It's not easy these days.

546
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,840
Throwing money at it doesn't work.

547
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,730
What's the old man up to?

548
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,830
He's heartbroken.

549
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,930
I told him I'd look into it and that he should wait.

550
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,620
He had plenty of drinks but wanted more, so I came out to get some.

551
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:35,460
That proud man. It serves him right.

552
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,690
You could have called. You didn't have to come.

553
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,470
You think I came all the way here to compliment you?

554
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,300
I have something to do.

555
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,400
Get back inside. Let him have plenty to drink.

556
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,600
- Got it, Hyungnim. I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

557
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,770
I'll head to Seoul.

558
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,480
Okay.

559
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,280
Wait. Where did Seok Ji Won move to?

560
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,640
Let me check out where my rude son lives.

561
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,080
Yes. I'll look into it.

562
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,060
Let's go.

563
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,600
What? A workshop? Seok Ji Won?

564
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,620
He hates getting together with more than four people.

565
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,280
Except for when he started working,

566
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,900
he's never been to workshops or staff dinners.

567
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,620
I heard they went to the new resort.

568
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,560
To our resort? It's not even open.

569
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,830
Yes.

570
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,770
What's gotten into this bastard? Hold on.

571
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,570
Wait a minute.

572
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,740
He's there with all the schoolteachers?

573
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,730
Yes, as far as I know.

574
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,690
Something's going on.

575
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,590
I feel it in my gut.

576
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,440
Turn the car around. Head to the resort.

577
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,700
What are you doing here?

578
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,400
What do you mean?

579
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,610
I'm here to look at the ocean.

580
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,670
Why?

581
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,790
You think I'd jump in or something?

582
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,080
I didn't say that.

583
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,680
My shoes!

584
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,200
You haven't told Yoon Ji Won, right?

585
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,380
That I hid her phone.

586
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,650
Do you want me to tell her?

587
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,190
I think...

588
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,120
I'll just tell you one more thing.

589
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,510
A long time ago,

590
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:02,640
when you two broke up after the summer,

591
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,630
you called Yoon Ji Won from a new phone. Right?

592
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,540
Actually, I...

593
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,730
Don't tell me.

594
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,930
Tell Yoon Ji Won.

595
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,740
When you're ready to.

596
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,850
I've liked Yoon Ji Won so much

597
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,580
for a long time,

598
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,860
but I also hated her.

599
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,140
She's not like me.

600
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,270
Ji Won sees me with only one heart.

601
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,740
A friend.

602
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,060
Even when I like her or when I'm jealous of her,

603
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:00,120
or feel some kind of silly superiority over her,

604
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,040
she never felt twisted like I did.

605
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,750
I've always been a friend to her.

606
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:12,140
Even now, because of how she is,

607
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,100
I like Yoon Ji Won...

608
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,740
and hate her.

609
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,880
That's why I'm nervous...

610
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,420
about telling her what a bad person I am.

611
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,040
Like you said,

612
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,070
I will tell her when I'm ready.

613
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,560
I promise.

614
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,850
Wear them.

615
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,410
I just remembered.

616
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,480
- Back then, you... 
 - Back then?

617
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,440
When you found out that I liked you.

618
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,650
Back then, you...

619
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,480
Go ahead.

620
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,250
I'll stay for a bit longer.

621
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,660
Bye, Seok Ji Won.

622
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,040
You jerk.

623
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,400
   

624
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,250
Miss Yoon!

625
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:16,050
- You've had a lot to drink. 
 - I'm having more!

626
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,490
I caught you. Let's go.

627
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,560
- I'm not feeling well today... 
 - Zip it.

628
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,340
You didn't even sing earlier.

629
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,420
As long as you're within my sight,

630
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,930
I will not entertain cowardly excuses.

631
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,750
Let's go. Let's go!

632
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,010
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Hey, Mr. Gong.

633
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,790
Our student teacher! Let's go!

634
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,510
I have something to tell Miss Yoon.

635
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,260
Privately.

636
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,870
Oh, of course!

637
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:51,720
I'm usually not this clueless.

638
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,540
Go, go. The two of you, go.

639
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:00,040
Somewhere no one else is around!

640
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,230
Are you okay?

641
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:12,710
Thanks for saving me.

642
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,150
Everyone thinks I'm your boyfriend, so feel free to use me.

643
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,720
I'm sorry about earlier.

644
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,090
I've traumatized you on top of the whole misunderstanding.

645
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,150
Oh, the song?

646
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:28,460
I guess it could be trauma. I didn't have to work so hard on it.

647
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,650
No, Mr. Gong. You sang it so well. Really!

648
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,510
The chairman suddenly gave it his all, so I couldn't help myself.

649
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,200
I'm embarrassed in many ways.

650
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,240
I'll make sure to clear up the misunderstanding.

651
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,630
Honestly,

652
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,300
it doesn't matter to me.

653
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,730
It's only half a misunderstanding, anyway.

654
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,400
What?

655
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,600
- Are you going inside? 
 - Yes.

656
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,940
- How about you? 
 - Go ahead.

657
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,830
Okay. I'll get going.

658
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,140
You can still drink, can't you?

659
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,700
Of course.

660
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,590
That's why I snatched these!

661
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,300
So did I. Ta-da!

662
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,180
There was expensive alcohol?

663
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,290
I found it in a corner!

664
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,060
If we split something like this with too many people...

665
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,810
- You get too little. 
 - Bingo!

666
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,640
Ask him.

667
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,320
Don't ask him.

668
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,000
Ask him.

669
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,040
Don't ask him.

670
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,330
I'm going to ask him!

671
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,320
Miss Maeng?

672
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,470
- Who was she? 
 - Sorry?

673
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:09,170
The person who said was your senior.

674
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,620
The way you looked at her. Who was she?

675
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,780
I don't want to talk about it.

676
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,280
Pardon?

677
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,780
You don't need to know.

678
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,790
Miss Maeng,

679
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,420
by chance...

680
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:37,310
by any chance, do you...

681
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,670
Yes.

682
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,000
What you're thinking of is correct.

683
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,800
I...

684
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,970
I don't feel the same way.

685
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,420
I won't in the future, either.

686
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,740
How firm of you.

687
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,090
But...

688
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:12,010
you could reject me, but that was so...

689
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,220
Even the 38th parallel wasn't drawn so firmly.

690
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,880
I'll get going then. I understand what you're saying.

691
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,840
   

692
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,910
   

693
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,810
   

694
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,800
Shoot! He'll think I didn't pick up on purpose!

695
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,070
Want to come down?

696
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,180
â™«  I'm slowing down  â™«

697
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,520
- Were you in your room? 
 - Yeah.

698
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,840
All I have is you, Miss Yoon...

699
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,620
What the...

700
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,300
I'm alone in this life. So alone.

701
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,320
â™«  Don't know what it feels to be in love  â™«

702
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,560
â™«  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  â™«

703
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,660
- See? I was right, huh? 
 - Yeah.

704
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,600
I missed you like crazy.

705
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,210
â™«  I keep smiling awkwardly  â™«

706
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,550
â™«  Feels good to be in love  â™«

707
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,910
â™«  To be in love  â™«

708
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,760
Let's go.

709
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,200
Go in.

710
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,130
- By the way... 
 - Huh?

711
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,860
How much money did you spend?

712
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,370
We just overcame so many obstacles together.

713
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,300
We're about to drink champagne

714
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,220
overlooking the ocean, and that's what you want to say?

715
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,400
Then what?

716
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,580
Should we talk about your passionate singing?

717
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:04,110
Do you even know how shocked I was to see ten cars pull up to the field?

718
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,800
It was all to impress you. Don't you know?

719
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:13,480
Stupid. All I need are three stones.

720
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,710
Well, I still have one thing left.

721
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,760
What did you do?

722
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,000
It's almost time.

723
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,880
What is it?

724
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,620
You know. The thing that goes well with the night ocean.

725
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,580
The thing that's thrilling and ecstatic.

726
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,140
Are you crazy? Did we win a baseball championship or something? Fireworks?

727
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,640
Three...

728
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,150
Two...

729
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,870
One.

730
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,750
What? Nothing's happening.

731
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,840
Fireworks were logistically complicated.

732
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,890
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

733
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:15,930
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

734
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:23,600
â™«  I can't erase you, so I'm trying to protect you  â™«

735
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:31,670
â™«  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  â™«

736
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:38,600
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

737
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,730
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

738
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,290
   

739
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,390
Should I call the director?

740
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:05,440
What is it? I'm busy right now, so...

741
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,730
What?

742
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,120
What did you say just now?

743
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,230
Old man, are you drunk? This is Seok Gyeong Tae.

744
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:17,170
 I don't have time to entertain your drunken antics. I'm hanging up. 

745
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,560
How dare he spew nonsense.

746
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,270
Don't call him. Call the manager. I'll go straight to his room.

747
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,830
Yes, sir.

748
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,650
Hello!

749
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,360
You're Miss Cha?

750
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,080
Yes. I'm Ji Hye.

751
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,450
That's right.

752
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:36,130
You're here for the workshop, right?

753
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:37,440
Yes.

754
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,180
You're here to see Ji Won, right?

755
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,350
Let me take you. I know which room he's in.

756
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,000
Do you? Would you mind?

757
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,200
- Of course not. This way. 
 - Sure.

758
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,220
- Get the master key. 
 - Yes, sir.

759

01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,340
 Who's going to see? And if someone sees us here? 

767
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,460
 Then, it's just fate. 

768
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,790
 Who liked who first? 

769
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:45,960
 Me, of course. 

770
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,460
 Yoon Ji Won really likes me. 

771
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,410
 You're so cute. So cute! 

772
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,810
 Have you proposed to her? 

773
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:51,890
 Propose? 

774
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,030
 You look like you got a lot of stuff ready and want to brag. 

775
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:58,870
 I think the chairman and Ji Won are dating. 

776
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,450
 That bastard. 

777

 The place where I told you I liked you. Can you come right now? 

778
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,620
 - Grandpa! 
 - Get in, both of you.
