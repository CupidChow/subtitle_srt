â™«  Oh, my love for the first time in my life  â™«

17
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,910
What? So annoying.

18
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,440
 - Hello!  
 - Hi!

19
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,840
 Oh, Min Ji! 

20
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
 Hi! 

21
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,710
Hello!

22
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,670
Hello.

23
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,580
Hi.

24
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,310
   

25
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,370
I was ready to hand off the foundation and live comfortably, 
    

26
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,100
but Seok Gyeong Tae's holding me back.

27
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,760
Are the board members on their way?

28
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,790
Yes, they should be en route.

29
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,620
If Seok Gyeong Tae's company takes over the foundation,

30
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,290
he'll take the land, too.

31
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,600
He'll surely build the resorts and golf courses

32
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,140
he didn't get to build back then.

33
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,900
He won't care about the school.

34
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,100
I must stop that.

35
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,150
Although I'm now penniless and about to let the foundation go,

36
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,870
I can't let that happen, Gyeong Hoon.

37
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes, I know, Father.

38
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,020
Thank you for still calling me that.

39
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,120
You raised me like a son when I had nowhere else to go.

40
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,470
It makes me sad to hear you say that.

41
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,490
They're all gathered.

42
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,470
Okay. Let's go.

43
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,360
Our Dokmok High School shall not crumble as Seok Gyeong Tae, that idiot,

44
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
takes his revenge.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,700
Let's go.

46
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,220
Revenge?

47
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,100
When our foundation is about to get acquired?

48
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,480
The Seokban Construction CEO, who suddenly wants to

49
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,620
buy the foundation, when it was nearly acquired by Junha Construction, is from Yangseo.

50
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,450
They're mortal enemies with the chairman's family.

51
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,670
Mortal enemies?

52
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,480
The Seokban Construction CEO's family used to be the chairman's family's tenant farmer.

53
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,540
They served them for generations.

54
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,270
CEO Seok Gyeong Tae's father built a cement company and got rich.

55
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,330
- Then? 
 - Then,

56
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,380
something happened.

57
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,040
CEO Seok's father and the chairman went after the same woman.

58
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,530
It's been war ever since.

59
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,990
   

60
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,830
   

61
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,170
 Ban Hui! 

62
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,870
 Are you okay, Ban Hui? 

63
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,250
   

64
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,670
   

65
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,700
You can't go to war if you aren't on par with each other.

66
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,340
My mother was not interested in Yoon Jae Ho at all.

67
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,100
He got rejected after making a move and bears a grudge on our family.

68
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,080
Bear a grudge over that?

69
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,180
They constantly provoked us.

70
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,560
For example, when my Ji Won was born.

71
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,820
I hate that he was born on the same day and time as their granddaughter.

72
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,380
He even copied the given name.

73
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,910
I spent a fortune on famous naming experts for Ji Won's name.

74
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,190
How offended you must be.

75
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,710
And in the end, that old man ruined my business, too.

76
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,670
That vicious old man is determined to walk all over me.

77
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,470
But still, it's time for you to take sweet revenge.

78
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,260
Right.

79
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,340
You all know how I felt

80
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,230
when I bought land to stop Seok Gyeong Tae back then.

81
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,730
I can't let that greedy cockroach turn our school and hometown upside down.

82
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,630
Right, it's time for me to flip it around.

83
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,280
Of course.

84
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,070
I shall bulldoze over everything and build a

85
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,810
spectacular golf course, sir.

86
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,270
Hold off until my Ji Won returns.

87
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,690
Here you go again.

88
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,680
I understand Director Seok is busy in Dubai,

89
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,710
but I, Park Dong Jin, am an expert on golf courses and resorts.

90
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,930
You know that, sir.

91
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,200
By the way, is the rumor true?

92
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,860
Rumor?

93
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,160
I heard Ji Won totally wiped you out and made you cry.

94
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,260
I heard that's why you pushed for him...

95
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,480
to work overseas.

96
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,940
I-I-I did?

97
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,680
No way, sir. Director Seok should return.

98
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,830
Of course.

99
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,500
- Right? The rumor's false, right? 
 - Yes...

100
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,700
All right.

101
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,100
I hear you have the Businessman of the Year interview today.

102
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,390
Hey, don't be nervous and do a good job.

103
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,940
Yes. Thank you.

104
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,360
You should head to the board meeting now.

105
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,400
I should. To greet my dear Yoon Jae Ho.

106
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,790
   

107
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,410
What an ill-fated relationship.

108
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,560
So, the board members will decide which company acquires our school. Right?

109
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,740
It better go to Junha Construction, after all that our chairman did.

110
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,430
Miss Yoon must be in agony.

111
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,180
CEO Seok Gyeong Tae is ruthless.

112
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,420
Why all this after 20 years...

113
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,890
But some say they may come in and develop the town for the better.

114
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,250
As long as there are no legal issues, it's worth considering.

115
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,150
Wow.

116
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,380
I thought you were high school friends with Miss Yoon. Yet, you're so cool about it.

117
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,210
Pardon?

118
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,140
Shouldn't you argue for Junha Construction to take over if you're a true friend?

119
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,950
That'd be best,

120
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,070
but I'm just offering an alternative. Why are you making me look bad?

121
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,340
They're at it again.

122
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm just saying. You're all blaming Miss Yoon's father,

123
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,360
pushing off all the hard work to Miss Yoon.

124
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,210
You're supposed to be friends, but you're not on her side.

125
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,980
And all you do is gather and gossip.

126
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,240
 (Me? Why?) 

127
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,210
Of course, Jeongwon Daily is the best. 
    

128
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,520
- Congratulations, Director. 
 - Congrats, Director.

129
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,140
- You're awesome. 
 - Director!

130
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,470
Director! He's here. Him!

131
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,900
The people from the newspaper? Of course.

132
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,320
Not the newspaper.

133
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,440
Not the newspaper?

134
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,090
Then, is it the Grim Reaper instead of the reporters?

135
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,220
Wait, Director Seok...

136
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,010
How did you...

137
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,100
How...

138
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,060
So soon... How...

139
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,400
Thank you for the welcome.

140
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,190
Why don't we look at this while waiting for the interview?

141
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,390
Well...

142
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,740
What about it?

143
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,170
What about it?

144
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,760
"What about it"?

145
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,980
How can you say, "What about it?" after illegally subcontracting?

146
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,750
- This is... 
 - You've stashed away the rebar,

147
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,530
and poured water into concrete.

148
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,920
Wow, you poured cement on a rainy day without a care in the world.

149
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,180
Are you spying on me or something?

150
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,620
Yes. Because you do stuff like this.

151
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,340
This is standard practice.

152
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,880
It's not just us. This is normal.

153
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,390
You should know that.

154
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,260
"It's illegal, but everyone does it.

155
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,710
Because we've always done it. Because no one knows."

156
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,100
I thought we agreed not to embarrass ourselves, even if everyone else does.

157
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,680
So, must you embarrass me

158
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,140
on a day like this, when I'm your father's age, Director Seok?

159
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,200
 What's going on? 

160
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,500
 Please do not enter. 

161
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,200
We'll set another time later.

162
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,800
Unfortunately, I have more embarrassing news. Should I tell you?

163
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,800
The owner of the new subcontractor company is your...

164
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,100
brother-in-law, Director Park.

165
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,310
Something like that.

166
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,990
Please have mercy on me.

167
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,050
My kid is still in elementary school.

168
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,150
Director, hello. I'm Lee Gi Ha from the secretarial team.

169
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,440
I heard a lot about you. I'm here early, aren't I?

170
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,900
No, I'm honored to serve you, Director.

171
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,100
- Please speak comfortably. 
 - Sure.

172
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,070
Let's get along.

173
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes, I'll do my best.

174
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,070
And earlier, in the conference room...

175
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,330
Wow, you were so cool.

176
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,350
The best.

177
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,560
Director.

178
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,100
   

179
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,210
Miss Maeng.

180
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,560
Please give this to Miss Yoon while it's hot.

181
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,600
It's still chilly out,

182
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,240
and I'm worried she'll do that during the board meeting.

183
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,970
You're such a warmhearted man.

184
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,140
It would've been nice if you prepared an extra one for this messenger.

185
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,570
Gosh, I'm sorry. I'll...

186
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,980
Don't worry about it.

187
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,280
You're only cold toward me, and it's charming.

188
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,980
- By the way, did you fight with Miss Yoon... 
 - Yes?

189
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,690
during vacation?

190
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,750
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

191
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,160
Miss Yoon also stopped coming by the nurse's office...

192
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,740
Gosh, we didn't fight.

193
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,100
I need to attend to something. I'll get going.

194
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,800
Please give it to her before it gets cold.

195
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,670
Please.

196
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,130
By majority vote,

197
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:23,100
the Seokban Construction will take over our Dokmok High School Foundation.

198
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,160
You all...

199
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,350
Seok Gyeong Tae, how dare you show up here?

200
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,810
Is the voting not over yet?

201
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,300
It's over, right? I'm here to see my school.

202
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,550
Wow. It's so run down.

203
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,860
Goodness, you've aged a lot, too.

204
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,870
You're handing off the school to that planthopper*? 
  (An insect) 

205
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,850
- W-What? Plantâ€” 
 - Director Koo.

206
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,460
Did you give him the land you repurchased from me?

207
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,070
To build a golf course?

208
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,170
- Look here, old man. 
 - You money-hungry bastards!

209
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,300
Planthopper?

210
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,390
Do you know what year we're in? How dare you! Hey!

211
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,960
Planthopper is too good a name for a bastard out to ruin his hometown!

212
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,970
- Damn you! 
 - Come at me!

213
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,820
How dare you...

214
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,930
Father...

215
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,470
Sit down.

216
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,400
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Hey.

217
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,630
It's from Mr. Hong. He's worried about you these days.

218
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,220
What's going on?

219
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,770
Seok Gyeong Tae!

220
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,890
Seok Gyeong Tae...

221
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,420
Let's go.

222
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,590
I should've shown him hell, but he goes and falls ill.

223
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,360
Anyway, this old man is still the real deal, then and now.

224
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh, my god.

225
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,100
Good job.

226
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,260
Thanks to you, Director Park was hospitalized. He wrote a resignation letter.

227
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,200
Tell him to take responsibility and fix things before quitting.

228
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,430
Leave it. We got rid of Director Park, so you're in charge.

229
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,120
I signed the papers to acquire the foundation today in Yangseo.

230
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,880
Everything's on track for the golf course, so youâ€”

231
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,700
No, I'm not interested.

232
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,210
You bastard. Not interested in company business?

233
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,480
How is that company business? It's your childish revenge.

234
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,620
Childish? Revenge?

235
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,130
So, you're saying I'm being this petty for what happened 20 years ago?

236
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,770
- Yes. 
 - Who do you think I am, you bastard?

237
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,780
You know a golf course has no merit in that town. Maybe 20 years ago, it did.

238
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,450
Quit now.

239
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,690
Quit? I'm only getting started.

240
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,960
I will build an amazing golf course, make Yoon Jae Ho sit down,

241
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,690
and take spectacular revenge in front of the entire town.

242
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,760
I'll become chairman,

243
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,170
and once we build the golf course, I'll kick all the teachers out.

244
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,760
Just like we were kicked out.

245
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,160
You're petty in detail.

246
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,540
You...

247
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,710
Leave if you won't take on the golf course. Get out!

248
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,460
Father, does Grandma know you're acting like this?

249
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,100
Why are you bringing up my mom? Get out! Get out of here!

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,300
Get out, you bastard!

251
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,120
Grandpa, you shouldn't be drinking.

252
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm just angry and can't sleep.

253
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,550
Here.

254
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,760
Should I quit, Grandpa?

255
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,020
What?

256
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,530
Let's leave company housing. I'll find a place.

257
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,070
Somewhere far, Seoul or elsewhere. Let's just go.

258
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,890
There's nowhere to go right now.

259
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,120
Plus, you're a homeroom teacher.

260
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,940
Whatever. Leave it up to the new fancy chairman.

261
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,740
Fine.

262
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,690
Quit and leave company housing.

263
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,640
But I will not be leaving this town.

264
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,800
I may have handed over the foundation, but I must protect my hometown.

265
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,220
That's that...

266
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,970
You can leave if you don't want to see things go down.

267
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,010
How could I leave you behind?

268
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,320
Am I a kid? Leave.

269
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,970
Gosh, you finished it...

270
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,450
   

271
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,100
   

272
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,980
- So, you do care... 
 - No!

273
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,560
You nearly pierced my eardrums.

274
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,570
Why look him up if you don't even care?

275
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,690
In case he comes to his dad's inauguration ceremony?

276
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,920
He can't. He'd better not come.

277
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,880
I can't believe it's working out like this. So uneasy for you.

278
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,040
He's in Dubai, right?

279
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,820
He's staying there, right?

280
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,530
Well, I have no idea.

281
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,520
But even if he comes to Korea, I doubt he'll come here.

282
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,300
Ji Hye, should I just quit...

283
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,160
If you're uncomfortable, just transfer schools.

284
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,590
What?

285
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,650
The semester has already started,

286
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,730
but getting involved with him isn't ideal.

287
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,210
You think? You think I should quit, too?

288
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,260
Well, I'm just saying there's no need to overthink.

289
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,090
You hate that.

290
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,640
Your old self would've stood your ground and refused to run away.

291
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,010
You were no joke, you know.

292
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,370
Run away...

293
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,060
Ji Won, I gave it some thought...

294
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,520
I won't oversee the golf course.

295
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,540
Gosh, you're so rude. At least pretend to listen.

296
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,960
No, I will not go there.

297
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,610
You're my son, but...

298
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,180
You have no friends, do you?

299
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,100
None, right? Not even one, right?

300
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,330
It's not like that. I just don't like him.

301
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,870
So, you just hate him, the enemy's son,

302
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,120
with whom you share the same name and birthday.

303
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,140
He has always been a hindrance in my life.

304
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,810
You won't go because you can't stand someone?

305
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,380
Yes. Is that a poor reason?

306
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,040
No, you could if you can't stand the person.

307
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,990
But I heard you left a long time ago.

308
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,020
Still hating someone after all that time is... how should I put it...

309
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,920
True...

310
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,160
How relentless.

311
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,830
We fought relentlessly.

312
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,820
 Let go at the count of three. 

313
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,930
 One. Two. Three. 

314
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,310
 - Let go first. 
 - You let go first! 

315
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,000
 - Yoon Ji Won! 
 - Seok Ji Won! 

316
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,390
 - Yoon Ji Won! 
 - Seok Ji Won! 

317
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:27,350
 - Yoon Ji Won! 
 - Seok Ji Won! 

318
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,120
 What are you doing? 

319
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,850
 How can a boy lose to a girl? 

320
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,260
 What? 

321
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,340
Not really fights since I won them all.

322
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,870
By strength or smarts.

323
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,240
Yet you don't feel for him at all through thick and thin after all the fighting?

324
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,130
Feel? I have no reason to see him, and I don't want to see him,

325
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,250
but if we must run into each other,

326
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,610
I will smack his head and go to hell.

327
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,140
So, there's a social contract where we call that

328
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,500
"Feeling for someone through thick and thin."

329
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,900
What? I feel nothing.

330
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,550
I was completely unaffected by her barking,

331
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,680
but she always picked a fight and insisted she was right.

332
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,530
 - Yoon Ji Won. 
 - Seok Ji Won. 
   

333
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,220
 - Yoon Ji Won. 
 - Seok Ji Won. 

334
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,250
 - Yoon Ji Won. 
 - Seok Ji Won. 

335
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,620
 We elected Seok Ji Won as the class president this year. 

336
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,310
 Thank you. 

337
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,100
- That petty jerk. 
 - That petty jerk.

338
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,550
Go home now. Thanks.

339
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,730
Thank you, Director!

340
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,530
Get home safe.

341
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,440
Miss Yoon.

342
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,910
I don't know since I don't have enemies or their sons in my life.

343
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,890
Do whatever you want, Miss Yoon.

344
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,070
Run away cheerfully if you want.

345
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,280
And stay and dive in head first if you want.

346
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,300
Who cares what other people say?

347
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,240
Miss Maeng.

348
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm so cool. That was such a killer line, huh?

349
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,070
Well, you know, I think it's okay for you to do that.

350
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,430
To follow your heart.

351
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,450
You haven't been able to for a while.

352
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,610
I'm leaving.

353
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,410
Ji Won.

354
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,840
- Ji Won! 
 - Hey!

355
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,440
Hey, Yoo Hong Jae, what brings you here?

356
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,520
Listen to you talk, bastard.

357
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,810
I got curious.

358
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,300
Wondering if you were living a high life, cutting off all contact.

359
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,240
I came out to see you going through my military buddy's friend's cousin. Got that?

360
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,750
You guys went to the same high school? Why didn't you tell me?

361
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,570
Well, I didn't even graduate from there.

362
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,920
Good to see you.

363
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,080
You've really changed, you know.

364
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,200
You used to be talkative, laughed a lot, and cried easily.

365
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,030
You may pretend to be strong, but you were actually affectionate and kind.

366
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,560
Hey, that was a long time ago.

367
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,500
Wouldn't it be weirder if I still got all swayed and emotional at this age?

368
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,440
So, is that why you ignored all my phone calls?

369
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,220
I texted you 100 times about our reunion last month.

370
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm telling you for the 14th time that I just arrived in Korea today.

371
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,790
How about a reply? You could've sent me a reply!

372
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,500
Sorry.

373
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,930
The class president came out to the reunion for the first time last time.

374
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,070
- The class president? 
 - Yes, Yoon Ji Won.

375
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,530
Ji Won. You're Seok Ji Won, and she's Yoon Ji Won.

376
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,330
She was a teacher at our school. I was so surprised.

377
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,470
I heard that she worked for a start-up after getting an engineering degree.

378
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,950
How should I put it? I guess she became much milder.

379
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,390
She used to be called "Dokmok High School's Mad Dog." Remember?

380
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,260
I guess.

381
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,540
She was smart, snooty, and pretty. A lot of guys used to like her.

382
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,900
Well? I'm not too sure.

383
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,560
Can't remember?

384
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,230
You're supposed to be smart. What's wrong with your memory?

385
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,330
Well? Yoon Ji Won didn't remember you, either.

386
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,670
W-W-What? Didn't what?

387
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,540
I talked about you, and she didn't seem to know. She said she didn't remember.

388
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,430
Yoon Ji Won didn't remember me?

389
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,350
I asked her if she had kept in touch with you.

390
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,670
Wondering if she heard from you.

391
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,380
You'd better tell it to me straight.

392
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,640
Yoon Ji Won didn't remember me? Me?

393
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,650
She didn't remember me?

394
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,270
I-I asked her several times, you know. And she said she doesn't know you.

395
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,980
She said she didn't remember...

396
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,130
S-She seemed...

397
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,070
a little drunk that day, maybe?

398
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,250
Hey! He's totally losing it, right?

399
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,360
Are you done running?

400
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,110
I made my decision. I'm not quitting.

401
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
What?

402
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,470
Why should that bastardâ€” I mean,

403
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,410
why should I quit a perfectly good job and separate from you?

404
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,790
For whose benefit?

405
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,280
I'll stand my ground! I'll continue to work there!

406
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,080
Go take a shower.

407
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,010
I made some radish greens soup.

408
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,160
Tell him to come at me.

409
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,760
You think I'd be scared?

410
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,900
You bastard. What's wrong with you!

411
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll go, Father.

412
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,190
What?

413
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,550
As the Dokmok High School Foundation Chairman. I said I'll go.

414
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,430
What?

415
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,790
I said I'll take revenge.

416
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:41,220
â™«  Oh, my love for the first time in my life  â™«

417
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,270
â™«  My eyes are wide open  â™«

418
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:55,520
â™«  Oh, my lover, for the first time in my life  â™«

419
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,610
â™«  My eyes can see  â™«

420
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:09,900
â™«  I see the wind, oh, I see the trees  â™«

421
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:27,260
I'm going crazy from this ridiculous dream.

422
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,720
Where is it?

423
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,390
Will you be okay?

424
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,750
I'll be okay one way or another.

425
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Be sure to go to the hospital during lunch. Okay?

426
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,770
Okay. See you later, Grandpa.

427
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,540
Take more of this.

428
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,860
- Just one... 
 - More, more.

429
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,070
Take more!

430
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,370
Gosh...

431
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,610
   

432
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,970
Yu Mi, Yeong Jin, don't walk. Run!

433
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,340
Miss Yoon, if we're done running, can we play basketball?

434
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,280
Go ahead.

435
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,910
Hey! No starting before I blow the whistle!

436
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,120
Miss Yoon! Move!

437
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,420
Miss Yoon!

438
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,090
- Are you okay, Miss Yoon? 
 - Are you okay?

439
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,510
What do we do?

440
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,510
Pick her up.

441
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,210
Get on my back.

442
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,450
Why bother...

443
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,090
Hey, clean up and go inside.

444
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,870
Miss Yoon, I'll take you to the nurse's office.

445
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,720
Forget it, and just go eat, you guys!

446
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,990
You have a nosebleed.

447
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,220
Miss Yoon, nosebleed...

448
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,070
Your nose is really bleeding a lot.

449
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,430
 Â­Kang Hui Joon! 

450
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,970
Hello.

451
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,480
 Yoon Ji Won didn't remember you, either. 

452
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,960
 Yoon Ji Won didn't remember you, either. 

453
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,870
 Yoon Ji Won didn't remember you, either. 

454
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,110
That girl...

455
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,000
 Hey! Pass the ball! 
   

456
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,740
 Hey, hey! 

457
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,360
 Hey, hey! 

458
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,280
   

459
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,680
 - What are you doing? 
 - Speak for yourself. 

460
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,310
 I said come to the conference room right after lunch. 

461
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:59,400
 I was only going to play one game. You eat slowly. 

462
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,090
 Sure. Come, already. 

463
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,350
 It hurts! 

464
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,560
 Hurry up and come! 

465
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,500
 - Come! 
 - Why are you doing this? 

466
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,380
 - They never get tired of fighting. 
  - I'll go after one game!  

467
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,980
 I moved here when I was ten, 

468
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,150
 and they were fighting then and even before that. 

469
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,800
 I'm sure they'll keep fighting. 

470
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,430
 Love born out of hatred is the strongest kind of love. 

471
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,760
 That'll never happen to them. 

472
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,460
 Seok Ji Won, aren't you going to play soccer? 

473
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,260
 No, he's not! 

474
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,680
 I'll come right after this game! Five minutes. I'll be right there! Three minutes! 

475
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,400
 - Hey, hey! 
 - Let's go! 

476
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,820
 Seok Ji Won! 

477
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,700
 - Yoon Ji Won! 
 - Yoon... 

478
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,460
 - Are you okay? 
 - Hey! 

479
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,080
 - Yoon Ji Won, how embarrassing... 
 - That must hurt. 

480
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,980
 - She fell hard. 
 - Embarrassing... 

481
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,200
 Wait, wait, wait... 

482
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,180
 Did you break your arm when you fell? 

483
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,760
 Seriously. I'm in so much pain! 

484
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,820
 You'll never get to the nurse's office at this pace. 

485
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,800
 This is all your fault. 

486
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,680
 There is a way. 

487
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,440
 There is? 

488
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,300
 Carry her on your back. That's the fastest way. 

489
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,080
 No way! 

490
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,790
 How dare you... 

491
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,170
 Jeong Min Ji, want to die? 

492
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,410
 You guys go to the classroom. 

493
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,400
 - Follow me. 
 - Hey! Ow, ow, ow! 

494
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,030
 My foot's injured. My leg hurts. Let go. Let go of me. 

495
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,300
 Hey, let go! My foot hurts... 

496
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,110
 How come the nurse is never here? 

497
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,680
 Hey, hand me a band-aid. 

498
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,040
 Stick it on. 

499
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,730
 Stick it... 

500
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,280
 Gosh, so annoying. 

501
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,110
 Who's fault is it I'm hurt? 

502
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,350
 Why did you come at me when you can't even run? 

503
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,130
 Why didn't you come when you said you would? 

504
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,640
 I meant to after just one goal, but you insisted on coming to get me. 

505
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,300
 - Where do you think you are? 
 - The nurse's office! 

506
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,690
 Wow, really... 

507
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,320
 I can't believe this is the class president I have to work with. 

508
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,800
 It's all crumpled. 

509
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,980
 What did you want to meet about and nitpick today, anyway? 

510
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,110
 Right, the class T-shirt. Wait a second. 

511
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,420
 Did you join the student council after losing the election just to torture me? 

512
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,720
 Look. 

513
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,700
 The same fabric, the same quantity. I called them all... 

514
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,740
 I know the vice principal's family business is 300 won more. 

515
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,270
 Right, so let's change it so each class chooses its own. 

516
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,490
 Hey. Must we do this? 

517
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,460
 Will it kill you to just let it go as is and turn a blind eye? 

518
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,370
 I hate that so much. Why just let it go? 

519
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,000
 How could I let it go when it's at the cost of one side? 

520
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,020
 You make me regret running for class president. 

521
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,400
 Then, you should've just let me. 

522
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,900
 Did I stop you? 

523
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,790
 Because of your foul personality, 

524
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,360
 everyone knows it and voted for me. 

525
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,650
 Hey! Who cares if you're the class president when you ranked sixth in the midterms? 

526
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,150
 There you go again. It was my first time ranking sixth. 

527
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,120
 And I was first more than you last year. 

528
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,730
 The worst I did last year was second place. But sixth is so embarrassing. 

529
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,490
 Gosh, I'm sick of this! 

530
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,980
 Anyway, if you're indecisive about the class T-shirt... 

531
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,020
 Wait. 

532
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,880
 I'll... 

533
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,690
 confront the vice principal about it. 

534
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,110
 You should've done that sooner. 

535
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,400
 Don't be late for the council meeting later, or I'll blow up all the soccer balls. 

536
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,980
 Do you think people hate me more for being a few minutes late, 

537
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,180
 or you for always nitpicking and dragging on the meeting? 

538
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,330
 Me? 

539
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,990
 Wow, I hate you even more for knowing it. 

540
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,250
 Wow, Yoon Ji Won, I hate you more than anyone in the world. 

541
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,490
 Aren't you going? 

542
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,900
 The bell hasn't rung yet. 

543
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,190
 - I'm leaving. 
 - Okay. 

544
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,960
 Hey, come here for a second! 

545
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,710
 - What now? What, what, what? 
 - Over there, over there. The fan! 

546
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,870
 Nudge it in my direction. 

547
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,030
 Gosh, that dork... 

548
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,870
â™«  Be all right  â™«

549
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,960
â™«  No need to worry  â™«

550
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,620
â™«  It'll be okay once time passes  â™«

551
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,840
â™«  So bad. Day after day, night after night  â™«

552
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,760
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

553
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:34,210
â™«  Holding onto the time I couldn't fill  â™«

554
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:42,410
â™«  In case your heart wanders in pain  â™«

555
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:49,370
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

556
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,280
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

557
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,450
 Who did such a poor job? 

558
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,390
 It's coming off. 

559
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,710
 I just got water on it. Just stick it on. 

560
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,430
 This is a waterproof band-aid, so getting water on it is okay. 

561
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,950
 Thank you. 

562
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,660
 - Let's start the meeting. 
 - Yes. 

563
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,880
 - It's nice. 
 - Isn't it? 

564
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,300
 It was hard to find. 

565
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:45,410
 Okay. This way, we can save 20 percent compared to last year's sports day. 

566
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,540
 Why don't we report back to the next meeting as the general affairs department? 

567
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,500
 Okay. 

568
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,140
 Can we please end the meeting now, General Affairs Manager? 

569
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,260
 Yes. 

570
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,950
 Yoon Ji Won, you're incredible. 

571
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,510
 You fight with the teachers to advocate for fair treatment. 

572
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,770
 You fight, saying seniors lining up for lunch first is against the rules. 

573
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,520
 Now, you're redoing the sports day budget. 

574
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,290
 God saved us by not making Yoon Ji Won the president. 

575
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,090
 - Or we'd be dead. 
 - Really... 

576
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,450
 This is what the student council is for. 

577
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,380
 To fight on behalf of the students. 

578
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,840
 No? 

579
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,680
 Sure, right. 

580
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,920
 Why join the student council if you're not determined to do so? 

581
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,930
 I don't know. I'm just here as part of the student records team. 

582
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,610
 I'm disappointed. 

583
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:43,150
 Kim Dong Woon. Our General Affairs Deputy. 

584
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,450
 Did you join the council with impure motives, too? 

585
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,940
 No. I joined because of Senior Ji Won. 

586
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,900
 - Me? 
 - Me? 

587
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,380
 Senior Yoon Ji Won. 

588
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,100
 Are you in love with my charisma? 

589
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,980
 No. 

590
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,110
 Because you're pretty. 

591
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,950
 That's why I'm in love. 

592
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,860
 Try to date! 

593
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,260
 - It's been so long. 
 - Date! 

594
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,140
 Date! 

595
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,340
 Date! 

596
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,050
 Date! 

597
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,330
 Really? He said that? 

598
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,020
 Yeah, that's what I said. 

599
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,750
 "Because you're pretty. 

600
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,020
 That's why I'm in love." 

601
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,120
 What? He's no joke. 

602
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,970
 That's amazing. 

603
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,050
 Amazing! 

604
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,530
 He must've felt awkward in the beginning. 

605
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,740
 Kids these days don't have any manners. 

606
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,260
 In the middle of a sacred student council meeting. 

607
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,670
 Hey. He said it after the meeting ended. 

608
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,040
 - Are you getting off here? 
 - I'm headed to the bookstore. 

609
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,760
 To buy a workbook? Let me tag along. 

610
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,790
 Any plans for tteokbokki? 

611
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,500
 Perfect! 

612
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,500
 Ddol, are you coming, too? 

613
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,390
 No. Go away. 

614
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,100
 Let's go! 

615
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,900
 Let's go, let's go! 

616
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,500
 Thank you! 

617
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,980
 Why aren't you saying anything? You were so brave yesterday. 

618
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,700
 You asked me directly yesterday. 

619
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,530
 I'm a bad liar. 

620
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,450
 Did I upset you? 

621
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,120
 No. 

622
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,980
 In that case, what are you doing this weekend? 

623
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,190
 Why? 

624
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,780
 Want to go to Seoul with me? 

625
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,230
 - Seoul? 
 - Yes. 

626
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,180
 My brother at Seoul National University wants to give me a tour, 

627
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,250
 so I thought we could go together. 

628
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,930
 You're applying to that school. 

629
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:42,530
 I'm going to go there, too. I'd love to go to the same college. 

630
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,570
 You've already sketched out the distant future. 

631
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,640
 So, you'll come? 

632
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,200
 Yoon, hi! 

633
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,920
 Where did he go after inviting me to soccer? 

634
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,410
 Senior. 

635
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,040
 What's your answer? 

636
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,330
 Did you just say no to Seoul or to Kim Dong Woon altogether? 

637
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,360
 I said no to him. 

638
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,660
 Why? 

639
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,060
 Dating is annoying and boring. 

640
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,610
 Are you bored by the idea of dating Kim Dong Woon or dating in general? 

641
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,230
 You don't need to know. 

642
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,710
 You know Jo Myeong Seok in Homeroom 8? 

643
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:36,140
 He asked me if Yoon Ji Won had a boyfriend. 

644
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,720
 Who's that? 

645
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,830
 That's an idiot who cried after falling during soccer. 

646
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,820
 His thighs were destroyed. Makes sense he cried. 

647
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,510
 You should be guiding your dear friend, that idiotic bad soccer player Myeong Seok, 

648
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:57,450
 down a good path instead of pushing him off a cliff. 

649
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,170
 What? How dare you? 

650
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,630
 Come to your senses. 

651
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,200
 Finals are right around the corner. 

652
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,230
 "Who's that?" 

653
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,900
 Why do you care? 

654
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,350
 Is the sixth place worried about the first place's finals right now? 

655
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,950
 There you go again. Stop it. It was just that once. 

656
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:21,690
 I've never been there, not even once, ever since I started school. 

657
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,340
 This conversation is going nowhere and annoying. 

658
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,560
 I'm sick of the nerds. 

659
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,980
 Just wait and see. I'll crush you this final. 

660
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,330
 Thank you for sharing your wishful thinking. 

661
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,330
 But you can't win against me. 

662
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:42,230
 You're all the way in sixth place, not second or third. It means... 

663
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,430
 you're done. 

664
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,930
 - If I win? 
 - If you lose? 

665
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,380
 If I lose, I'll do everything you say. 

666
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,500
 Call me Big Sis for the rest of your life. 

667
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,860
 Want to see me for the rest of your life? 

668
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,800
 Until we graduate. 

669
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,610
 I'm down. 

670
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,920
 What if I win? 

671
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,410
 What should I do? If, by miracle, you win against me? 

672
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,930
 If I win, you date me. 

673
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,540
 You're a nutcase. 

674
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,200
 I will never call you Big Sis. 

675
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,020
 Wager something you'd rather die than do. Let's make it thrilling. What do you say? 

676
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,900
 I'd rather shave my head in front of the school and join a temple than date you. 

677
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,130
 Monk, what a sharp tongue you have. 

678
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,190
 So, is it on? 

679
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,330
 It's on. I'm not scared! 

680
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:01,630
â™«  I won't run away anymore  â™«

681
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,290
 - Here we go! 
 - I vote for Seok Ji Won! 

682
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,340
 I vote for Yoon Ji Won! 

683
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:12,240
â™«  You have been waiting for me  â™«

684
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:19,740
â™«  I have changed a lot  â™«

685
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:28,000
â™«  But my heart is still yours  â™«

686
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,010
â™«  Could this be a mere passing connection  â™«

687
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:35,500
â™«  If this turns out not to be love  â™«

688
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,760
â™«  Then it won't return again  â™«

689
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,180
â™«  I know it  â™«

690
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:53,470
â™«  Now, I look at you  â™«

691
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:58,440
â™«  Now, you save me  â™«

692
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,170
 Are you sleeping? 

693
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:11,420
â™«  Let go of the hatred  â™«

694
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,900
â™«  Embrace me  â™«

695
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,310
â™«  Hold onto me  â™« 
    

696
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:41,630
â™«  Make me forget fear  â™« 
    

697
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,300
 Hey, the score's out! 

698
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,900
 What? 

699
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,920
â™«  Now, I look at you  â™«

700
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,560
 Seok Ji Won, the score's up. 

701
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,240
 Who do you think won? 

702
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,250
 No idea. 

703
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:09,380
â™«  Let go of the hatred  â™«

704
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,430
â™«  Embrace me  â™«

705
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,630
 Yoon Ji Won's first place! 

706
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,940
 Yoon Ji Won... 
   

707
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,370
 I love it. 

708
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,310
 Of course. I don't know... 

709
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,970
 It keeps going back and forth. 

710
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:31,420
 - Get off. 
 - Did you just say "get off" to your big sis? 

711
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,040
 We need to talk. 

712
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,550
 Ji Hye, see you tomorrow. 

713
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,560
   

714
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:44,170
 Hey. 

715
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,060
 Wait, hey. 

716
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,750
 What's going on all of a sudden? 

717
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,860
 - Follow me. 
 - Where are we going? 

718
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,990
 Where are we going? 

719
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,370
Chairman.

720
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:51,280
I'm sorry. Take a seat.

721
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,330
I'm Dokmok High School's principal...

722
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:58,730
No, the vice principal who will soon become principal, Kang Yeong Jae.

723
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,630
It's an honor, Chairman.

724
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,550
Once the principal retires, the vice principal will need to undergo certification training.

725
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,170
Currently, she's serving as deputy principal.

726
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,250
Yes, why don't you take a seat?

727
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,900
Yes.

728
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,810
I heard the CEO fell ill this morning,

729
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,500
but I didn't expect you to come, Director.

730
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,740
I'm sorry to surprise you.

731
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,940
Gosh, not at all. It's our pleasure.

732
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,750
I'll do my best to be of service.

733
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,830
I told you to go to the nurse's office. You had a nosebleed.

734
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,800
Look how pale you are.

735
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,840
No, not the nurse's office.

736
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,890
Why not?

737
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:52,140
I can'tâ€” No, I won't go.

738
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,560
I don't have a fifth-period class.

739
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,010
Wake me up when the period's over.

740
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,430
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

741
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,800
   

742
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,840
Here's the paperwork you requested. Take your time.

743
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,490
Yes, thank you.

744
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,390
You mentioned you don't want an inauguration ceremony, right?

745
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,540
Yes, there won't be one.

746
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:59,280
I'm just amused. I hope I'm not out of line, but you're the son of a local elder.

747
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,520
Oh, yes. Feel free to speak comfortably.

748
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,740
You grew up well.

749
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,400
Directorâ€” no, Chairman, it's time to leave.

750
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,100
Oh, yes.

751
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,600
Are the teachers in class right now?

752
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,980
Yes, everyone is gathered during the morning assembly.

753
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,390
Come by in the morning next time for a formal introduction.

754
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,840
   

755
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,890
   

756
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,510
There must be no P.E.

757
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,160
Pardon?

758
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,030
It's nothing. Let's go.

759
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,270
 Yoon Ji Won didn't remember you, either. 

760
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:29,170
Director, it's that way...

761
01:01:54,280 --> 01:02:01,340
â™«  Oh, my love for the first time in my life  â™«

762
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,910
â™«  My eyes are wide open  â™«

763
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:15,550
â™«  Oh, my lover, for the first time in my life  â™«

764
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:21,530
â™«  My eyes can see  â™«

765
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:29,970
â™«  I see the wind, oh, I see the trees  â™«

766
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:35,450
â™«  Everything is clear in my heart  â™«

767
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:44,080
â™«  I see the clouds, oh, I see the sky  â™«

768
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:51,100
â™«  Everything is clear in our world  â™« 
  Miss Yoon... 

769
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,840
â™«  Oh, my...   â™« 
  Miss Yoon... 

770
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,590
Miss Yoon!

771
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,720
Our new chairman.

772
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,890
How do you do, Miss Yoon Ji Won?

773
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:37,800
â™«  I see the clouds, oh, I see the sky  â™«

774
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:43,530
â™«  Everything is clear in our world  â™«

775
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:51,860
â™«  Oh, my love for the first time in my life  â™«

776
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:57,830
â™«  My mind is wide open  â™«

777
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:06,700
â™«  Oh, my lover, for the first time in my life  â™«

778
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:12,190
â™«  My mind can feel  â™«

779
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:20,130
â™«  I feel sorrow, oh, I feel dreams  â™«

780
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:25,670
â™«  Everything is clear in my heart  â™«

781
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:35,300
Yoon Ji Won!

782
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,600
Hey! Yoon Ji Won!

783
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:47,640
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ðŸ’“Friends or Foes TeamðŸ’” @ Viki.com 

784
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:52,710
   

785
01:04:54,390 --> 01:05:01,330
â™«  All day, I think about you  â™«

786
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,090
â™«  Thinking about you  â™«

787
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:10,520
â™«  I don't see you  â™«

788
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:15,680
â™«  So, that's all I can do  â™«

789
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,400
 How did it feel to see me after 18 years, Yoon Ji Won? 

790
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,700
 Please don't bring up the past that meant nothing. 

791
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,870
 I'm very sorry for bringing up the past that meant nothing. 

792
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,680
 A teacher and the chairman? Amazing. 

793
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,990
 Miss, you don't remember me? 

794
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:33,020
 It's okay. We're meeting again now. 

795
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,740
 I'm ready to listen. 

796
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,760
 - A confession? 
 - Crazy lilacs?
