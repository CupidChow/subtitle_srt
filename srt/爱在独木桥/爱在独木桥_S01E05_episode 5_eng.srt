 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ğŸ’“Friends or Foes TeamğŸ’” @ Viki.com 

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,840
What an idiot.

9
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,250
He's so annoying.

10
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,180
Such a show-off.

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
Crazy.

12
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,420
Only three months?

13
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,720
That's what she said?

14
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,320
What is this?

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,710
What are you trying to do here?

16
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,180
Let's go inside.

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,530
I plan to live in the school residence. I told you. 
    

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,530
Stop with your puns and leave. This makes no sense.

19
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,960
Why doesn't this make sense?

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,920
Why is that student-teacher allowed but not me?

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,190
That's because Mr. Gong...

22
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,820
- lives far away and... 
 - I live far away, too.

23
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,600
- He commutes every day. 
 - I plan to do that, too.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,420
He doesn't even have a car.

25
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,990
Driving is tough these days.

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,070
Look, Chairman. You and I are...

27
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,640
You and I are...

28
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,810
You and I are what?

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,930
We barely dated for three months 18 years ago.

30
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,330
That's all.

31
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,110
- Right? 
 - Pardon?

32
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,820
So, unless you have lingering feelings for me...

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,860
You think I'm crazy?

34
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,300
Step aside if you're not crazy.

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me enter the school residence as a school official who lives far away.

36
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,170
Step aside!

37
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,660
That bastard...

38
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,430
Thank you for letting me stay, sir.

39
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,170
This school residence is technically yours, too, anyway.

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,420
Grandpa!

41
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,550
Shall I use the second-floor room?

42
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:00,570
Yes, but I only prepared one room, thinking Moon Su would be the only one.

43
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,490
In that case, the first person to the room gets it, and the other takes the other room.

44
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,970
Chairman, that's not fair!

45
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,630
You're so childish!

46
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,780
Move, move, move!

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,920
Give me strength!

48
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,300
Did he really just lose to Mr. Gong?

49
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,070
Our Moon Su is fast.

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,070
That's not the issue. You really want to live with him?

51
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,550
"This school residence is technically yours, too, anyway."

52
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,230
To make sure he knows that?

53
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,120
You really don't know?

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,130
Why he came here?

55
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,710
It's n-not because of me.

56
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,700
It's because of me.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,600
What?

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,480
He's in charge of the golf course.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,090
Moving forward, he'll have more to do here than in Seoul.

60
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,520
I bet he thinks of this as an opportunity to surveil me.

61
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,050
Right? That must be it, right?

62
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,240
Keep your friends closer.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,710
Keep your enemies even closer.

64
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,390
So, just accept it.

65
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,400
What are you staring at?

66
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Wow! This car is so amazing.

67
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,010
My son picked it out for me.

68
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,430
It's old, but it runs fine.

69
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,170
It used to run even better.

70
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,170
You want to die?

71
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,310
You're cheating! Cheating!

72
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,670
You're cheating!

73
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,480
I got you!

74
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,520
You stop it!

75
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,390
No, no. Really.

76
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,640
Miss, really...

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,980
Mr. Gong.

78
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,990
â™«  'Cause this feeling, I don't know what it is  â™«

79
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,800
â™«  Don't know what it feels to be in love  â™«

80
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,830
â™«  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  â™«

81
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,740
You're cheating.

82
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,730
â™«  Every time I see you, I keep smiling  â™«

83
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,380
â™«  Feels good to be loved  â™«

84
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,350
I'm getting back at you.

85
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,200
This is it!

86
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,600
â™«  To be in love  â™«

87
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,680
So, why did you provoke me?

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,840
I just sprinkled you with my fingers.

89
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,650
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,860
Done. Would you like a training suit? Our family's official uniform.

91
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,340
Sounds good! Give me one.

92
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,600
Sure. Let's go inside.

93
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,640
What should we have for dinner? Bossam?

94
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes, to kimchi salad? Yes, to makgeolli?

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,360
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

96
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,460
Let me go grocery shopping at the supermarket.

97
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,560
I'll run over after I get changed.

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,020
You don't know your way around here. I'll go.

99
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,780
I'll just look at the map.

100
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors, to be fair?

101
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,770
The loser goes to the supermarket, and the two winners set the table.

102
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,910
- I'm in. 
 - All right, let's do it.

103
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,550
Rock, paper...

104
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,430
 Scissors! 

105
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,170
Unfortunately, Miss Yoon and I lost.

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,050
Gosh.

107
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,370
Hello.

108
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,040
- Going somewhere? 
 - To the supermarket.

109
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,260
I said I'd go alone.

110
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,180
I'm just following the rules.

111
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,880
- Since when did you care about the rules? 
 - Huh?

112
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,910
- What are you saying? 
 - What do you think?

113
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,690
Let's take it easy, let's coast, stop obsessing.

114
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,180
What is good is good. Isn't that what you always said?

115
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,700
And at the same time, you looked down on people who followed the rules.

116
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,400
Oh, that.

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,630
"Not this, not that, never that, and no just because."

118
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,420
I suffered quite a bit dealing with a stickler who always argued with me.

119
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
It's all my fault?

120
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,370
I didn't say who.

121
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,380
- What? 
 - You haven't changed at all.

122
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,300
Always being a smart aleck. You used to get beat up for that when you were young.

123
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,540
You would come to me and sob, remember?

124
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,190
I didn't get beat up...

125
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Whoa, she keeps cutting me off.

126
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,250
Let's get it right. I didn't get beat up. We fought.

127
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,450
Let's say you fought. You still cried.

128
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,350
I was yawning. And that was in elementary school.

129
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,180
What? When we were in 7th grade. In May.

130
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,520
You got smacked playing soccer with Kang Dong Ju and got a nosebleed.

131
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,050
You wailed all the way from the yard to the classroom.

132
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,850
What's with an amazing memory for no good reason?

133
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,400
You always end up with almond anyway.

134
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
   

135
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,080
â™«  Another day just like yesterday  â™«

136
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,350
â™«  Nothing's changed for us  â™«

137
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,540
â™«  Somewhere in memories, touch my heart  â™«

138
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,780
â™«  Some flowers bloom within my love  â™«

139
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:56,530
â™«  I guess you were still my green  â™«

140
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,530
You still do this?

141
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,600
Be careful.

142
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,150
Ta-da!

143
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,890
Wow! Mr. Gong, you made all this by yourself?

144
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,480
I prepared something small to celebrate moving in.

145
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,100
We were supposed to do it together, but you didn't let me in the kitchen.

146
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,430
Gosh, I was fine handling it all myself.

147
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,960
Okay. Please dig in.

148
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,970
Chairman, do you like soybean paste stew?

149
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,250
Get ready and have a taste.

150
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,470
It's very delicious.

151
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,330
Yes. I do prefer kimchi stew, though.

152
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,810
What do you think? Delicious, right? Right?

153
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,140
Well, I guess it's decent, I suppose.

154
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,160
Dig in.

155
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,520
You're about to dig through the clay pot.

156
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,050
Where did your love for kimchi stew go?

157
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,040
Thanks for the food.

158
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,520
So, Moon Su, when it comes to dating,

159
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,120
it sounds like age doesn't matter to you.

160
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,910
- Of course, Grandpa. 
 - I see.

161
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,260
Even if she's seven years older than you?

162
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,550
That's perfect.

163
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,660
 Is that right? That's great. Great! 

164
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,050
Gosh, Grandpa, really.

165
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,690
That's great, my foot.

166
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,050
It could be great.

167
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,330
You like boys seven years younger than you?

168
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,920
Mr. Gong is an adult, not a boy.

169
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
Plus, what's wrong with someone seven years younger?

170
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,800
I love men who are seven years younger or older.

171
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,600
As long as they're not my age.

172
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,270
All this after calling me childish.

173
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,360
Speak for yourself.

174
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,700
- "Speak for yourself"? 
 - I was just talking to myself.

175
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,180
- Your shoulders are so tender. 
 - Really?

176
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,990
- Feels so nice. 
 - Relaxing, right?

177
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,390
- Right there. 
 - Here?

178
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,010
- Lower. 
 - Here?

179
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,640
- Relaxing, right? 
 - Yes. Go lower.

180
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,870
- Here? 
 - Yes.

181
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,200
 Gosh, feels good. 

182
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,900
It's old.

183
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,780
Yes, it is old.

184
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,900
This house is over 60 years old.

185
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,990
Okay...

186
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,530
What? What's going on?

187
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,210
The chairman is trying to earn his dinner.

188
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,890
Okay...

189
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,930
 It's done. Try turning on the light. 

190
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay. Shall we?

191
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,700
- There's nothing you can't do, Chairman. 
 - Don't mention it.

192
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,870
Thank you. Gosh, I love how bright it is.

193
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,990
Mr. Gong, please tidy this up.

194
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, my god!

195
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,830
A saw?

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
What's wrong with you?

197
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,530
Why make kimchi out of nowhere?

198
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,630
Did you move in here to get eczema?

199
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,740
Well, um...

200
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,670
I had my reasons.

201
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,400
   

202
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,370
Darn!

203
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,350
Gosh.

204
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,320
What's wrong with him?

205
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,740
- What is this? 
 - Stick one on me.

206
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,160
I already threw out ten in the last 20 minutes.

207
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,050
Here.

208
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,850
No one asked you to do any of that.

209
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,650
Be quiet if you don't get it, and just stick one on me.

210
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,600
- Here? 
 - A little higher.

211
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,410
- Here? 
 - No, to the right.

212
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,970
- Where? 
 - No. A little higher.

213
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,550
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,980
Here, right? Chairman?

215
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,170
What did you just do?

216
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,020
Feel free to ask me, your neighbor, for things like this in the future.

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,490
Fighting.

218
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,130
- Amazing. 
 - That's crazy.

219
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,210
So, both of them moved into the school residence?

220
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,970
Seok Ji Won has truly gone crazy.

221
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,010
- He is crazy. 
 - What is he thinking?

222
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,500
He's not thinking.

223
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,850
Is your grandpa okay with this? Are you okay?

224
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,470
I'm sure he hates it. But the school residence belongs to him at the end of the day.

225
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,260
Where are you going?

226
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,910
Leaving early to pack. There's a room for me in the school residence, right?

227
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,800
There's no room.

228
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,680
No?

229
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,130
Even better. Better!

230
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,530
Today.

231
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,600
   

232
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,030
Why did you suddenly want to look at the foundation's financial documents?

233
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,000
Since I'm responsible for the foundation,

234
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,550
I figured I needed to understand the foundation's full history.

235
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,300
When, how, and why did things get so bad

236
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,700
that the foundation had to be sold?

237
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,100
Okay...

238
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,400
So, are you really staying at the school residence?

239
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,940
Yes. I anticipate there will be much to do around here.

240
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,880
I could've secured a nice place for you if you told me.

241
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,500
- The school residence will do. 
 - But if the CEO finds out...

242
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,930
I can't help it.

243
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,260
You must've been close to my father, Director.

244
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,190
You are taking such good care of me.

245
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,000
No, it's just my job.

246
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,100
So, Director, which way do you lean toward?

247
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,070
- Pardon? 
 - The golf course.

248
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,690
It seems the town is divided on how they feel about it.

249
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,540
The golf course...

250
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm not sure. I'm just...

251
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,480
Well, putting aside your relationship with the former chairman and my father,

252
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,030
I'm curious how you feel as a resident here.

253
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,590
This is my hometown. I don't want to see Dokmok Mountain get ruined.

254
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,870
The residents who are against it feel the same way.

255
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,940
It is an important mountain, ecologically speaking.

256
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,270
But I heard you're trying to conserve it as much as possible...

257
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,880
Is that what my father said?

258
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,510
I should visit the mountain.

259
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,980
I grew up in this town, but except for going on a few picnics as a kid,

260
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,150
I never paid attention.

261
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,550
Yes.

262
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,510
But please let me know when you go.

263
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,530
The hiking paths in Dokmok Mountain are safe, but it can get suddenly steep

264
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,720
and there are dangerous cliffs, too.

265
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,330
Okay.

266
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,200
Please open your eyes when you walk around.

267
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,570
You took mine from the living room,

268
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,950
so I mistook yours in the kitchen as mine.

269
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,470
So, why did you buy the same color?

270
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,000
- I bought this a year ago. 
 - I bought this three years ago.

271
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,560
That's a long time. Why don't you get a new one?

272
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,950
You and your witty comebacks.

273
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,110
It's not my fault I'm witty. Not only that, there's not much I'm bad at.

274
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,420
It's not my fault I'm witty. Not only that, there's not much I'm bad at.

275
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,090
You've got some nerve.

276
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,320
- What are we eating for dinner? 
 - Are you a boarder?

277
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,620
Feed yourself!

278
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,920
Ask that guy who's a really good cook to make some soybean paste stew!

279
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,740
They're at it again with their antics...

280
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,940
He smiled? How ridiculous.

281
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,380
Why am I smiling?

282
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,250
Wait...

283
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,530
Ji Hye, I'm headed to class.

284
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,700
So, do you think a lot of people will gather?

285
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm reaching out as much as I can.

286
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,900
He's already sent his son to the school residence.

287
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,460
Looks like they will get started on the golf course soon.

288
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,140
Many of us should gather and make some noise,

289
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,710
so they might flinch a little.

290
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll keep gathering people. Please make sure there's a big turnout tomorrow.

291
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,590
Yes, I will, Father.

292
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,240
Sir, I...

293
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,490
I found it.

294
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,280
I knew I left it behind. Here it was.

295
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,490
   

296
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,020
I wrote it.

297
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,040
Take a look at the mountain

298
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,890
your father is trying to destroy, blinded by revenge.

299
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,690
Page 67 has information about the natural habitat of

300
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,580
Daeheung orchids, which are category 2 endangered species, and that's the best part.

301
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,370
They die so easily when you transplant them.

302
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,550
Stop staring out the window.

303
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,450
Take your time and read it.

304
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,900
Yes, I got it.

305
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,220
Okay.

306
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,320
See you at home.

307
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,200
   

308
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,770
- Miss Yoon! 
 - Huh?

309
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,900
- Going home? 
 - Yes.

310
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,070
What should we eat?

311
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,160
What should we eat?

312
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,130
How about the Gong Moon Su brand stew?

313
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm down.

314
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,430
So, those three live in the same house right now?

315
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,000
Along with the previous chairman.

316
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,830
Does that make sense for the school residence?

317
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,350
No.

318
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,840
The more I think about it...

319
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,710
It's love. A tragic love triangle.

320
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,200
But the Chairman and Ji Won shouldn't be doing that.

321
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,070
Don't you know love grows more as reality and circumstances get in the way?

322
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,380
But Mr. Gong trusts Miss Yoon as his mentor and...

323
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,430
It's hopeless once you grow feelings while doing that.

324
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,430
It's a dopamine bomb.

325
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,350
Hey, you punk.

326
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,170
How dare a student butt into a teacher's love story?

327
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,840
The teachers are talking,

328
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,700
and what are you saying? Bomb?

329
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,160
- Dopamine. 
 - He weaseled in somehow.

330
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,540
Get going. Go!

331
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,760
Gosh, seriously.

332
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,970
You're not making the bone broth, are you?

333
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,800
It's almost ready. So impatient...

334
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,850
He should focus on what he's good at.

335
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,380
Why did he volunteer to cook?

336
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,990
He says there's very little he cannot do.

337
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,300
- Wow. 
 - Wow, Chairman.

338
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,190
Looks good.

339
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,890
It's sweet.

340
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,840
Literally, it's sweet.

341
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,790
The stew is sweet, my man.

342
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,980
What? That can't be. I followed the recipe.

343
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,040
Did you put in sugar?

344
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,970
"Add a spoonful of sugar to neutralize the sour flavor when cooking with overripe kimchi."

345
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,600
What kind of spoon did you use?

346
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,690
Who'd like a hamburger?

347
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,360
He's quite stubborn.

348
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,590
He's like his father in that respect.

349
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,700
You got some on your face.

350
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,710
- Here? 
 - Just a second.

351
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,750
- Got it. 
 - Thank you.

352
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,490
Hot!

353
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,840
What should we eat for dinner tomorrow?

354
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,600
How about Mr. Gong's mistake-free soybean paste stew?

355
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,160
I have dinner out tomorrow.

356
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,920
- Why, Grandpa? 
 - I'm gathering people

357
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,120
to strategize against an evil company's environmental destruction.

358
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,580
- Should I come to? 
 - We're meeting during the day.

359
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,760
Sure, you can join us for dinner after work.

360
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,980
I had a tasty hamburger for the first time in a while.

361
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,030
Thanks to the chairman.

362
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,640
Gosh, thank you, Chairman.

363
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,800
Try this, too.

364
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,810
So glad we got hamburgers.

365
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,110
Should we order another hamburger? Or a pizza?

366
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,700
- Something else. 
 - Yeah?

367
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,220
   

368
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,790
Well, Father...

369
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,460
Is no one coming?

370
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,630
Chairman, I don't think this will work.

371
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,670
People think the land prices will shoot up if they make it happen.

372
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,740
Even the opposing people are now...

373
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,100
They're saying, "What's so important about a mountain?"

374
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,430
That could happen.

375
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,530
Most people get swept away, not knowing what to do.

376
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,210
So, let's keep spreading the word and convincing people.

377
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:47,710
Right, what if we make contact with citizens' groups?

378
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,180
 Okay! Cheers! 

379
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,860
All right, all right.

380
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,910
This is special Korean beef from Sangju, courtesy of CEO Kim.

381
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,630
Loosen your belts and fill up. Got it?

382
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,200
- All right, all right. Drink up! 
 - CEO Seok!

383
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,970
Give us a moment to fill our glass. You're so impatient.

384
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,200
We better speed things up to make things happen.

385
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,770
Asking questions and arguing only makes things complicated.

386
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,220
Leave the work to us, the experts.

387
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,950
So, trust me, and let's have fun and drink!

388
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,360
All right! To Yangso!

389
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,630
 To Yangso! 

390
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,170
If you don't go, he's going to storm into school with townspeople in tow.

391
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,440
It sounds like the crowd wants to see your face.

392
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,060
- Did Father drink? 
 - Yes, well...

393
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,930
A lot.

394
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,980
   

395
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,620
 All right! To Yangso! 

396
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,330
 To Yangso! 

397
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,060
 Nice! 

398
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,260
 Eat up. Eat up! 

399
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,500
 Eat up! 

400
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,290
Gosh, sir.

401
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,930
I forgot to invite you. I'm glad you came.

402
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,620
Take a seat. Let me pour you a drink.

403
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,190
Over here.

404
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,940
Where are they having dinner?

405
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,500
Hello?

406
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,300
Yes, Ahjussi. Grandpa's not picking up.

407
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,970
What?

408
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,430
So where is he right now?

409
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,640
He is who he is.

410
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,700
You all should be ashamed!

411
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,010
You all know what that mountain means.

412
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,090
Goodness! A mountain's a mountain. Nothing more.

413
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,500
You can't read the room.

414
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,840
You thought everyone would beeline to you upon beckoning? Like the old days?

415
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,460
You've been a toothless tiger for a while now.

416
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,130
Dragging your body around.

417
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,810
Gosh.

418
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,450
You're still here.

419
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,840
I thought you had left.

420
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,260
Grandpa!

421
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,300
Let's just leave.

422
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,900
Hello... Hello...

423
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,600
Hey, it's you. The P.E. teacher.

424
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,000
Ever since you were little, you strutted across town like you were so superior.

425
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,740
A teacher? You became a teacher?

426
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,440
Hey, Seok Gyeong Tae!

427
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,480
Hey! You didn't even greet me properly.

428
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,390
I'm the owner of your school.

429
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,400
- You cocky... 
 - You bastard...

430
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,950
- Come at me! 
 - Let go!

431
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm good, I'm good.

432
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,300
- Come at me! 
 - Punk!

433
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,570
You bastard!

434
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,810
Move!

435
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,780
- Come at me, you bastard! 
 - Hyungnim!

436
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,390
Let's talk.

437
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,440
Why come all the way here? It's spooky.

438
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,440
How did your father know exactly where to go?

439
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,820
Are you insinuating I told him where to go?

440
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,580
- Is that so? 
 - It's not the case.

441
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,810
Never mind, then.

442
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,250
I understand you're angry.

443
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,030
So, you understand everything.

444
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,600
If you really understand, couldn't you have left us alone?

445
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,980
We hit rock bottom like you wanted.

446
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,920
We lost our school. We are powerless.

447
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,680
Your father made a mockery of us, knowing that. Must you do more?

448
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,460
Must you wear my grandpa down and destroy that mountain

449
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,560
to feel satisfied?

450
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,230
Probably.

451
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,970
My father will take it to the end.

452
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,070
And you'll gladly help?

453
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,840
Look, I'm a businessman.

454
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,950
If the company needs a golf course and if it will make a profit,

455
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,170
ã„´o why not do it, as long as it's not against the law?

456
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,820
Whether it's because of some petty revenge or not.

457
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,370
It sounds so easy and simple.

458
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,970
It turns out that's how the world is. Eighteen years ago,

459
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,540
we crumbled so simply and easily.

460
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,800
- Back then, Grandpa... 
 - Even if it wasn't intentional,

461
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,620
even if there was something that couldn't be helped,

462
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,930
the one who crumbled was in so much pain and suffering that they could die.

463
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,190
That's why even after so many years,

464
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,870
even if you rebuild and fix what crumbled,

465
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,480
that petty revenge...

466
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,080
can't be tossed aside.

467
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,070
Let's leave. I think we've both expressed our perspectives.

468
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,190
I have no intention of meeting your request.

469
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,100
Are we talking about your father and my grandfather right now?

470
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,910
Then, do you think I'm talking about you and I,

471
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,190
who ended after merely three months?

472
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,050
How come you keep repeating "three months" and making eyes at me?

473
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,320
Whatever eyes I make with my eyes,

474
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,250
that's none of your business.

475
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,250
Take him to the hospital in the morning.

476
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,570
I think he sprained his ankle during the fight.

477
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,030
Mind your own business. I'll manage.

478
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,440
That...

479
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,590
Geez, really.

480
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,940
Me? Why would I leave the school residence?

481
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,360
You said you feel uncomfortable.

482
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,980
So, you're comfortable with me?

483
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,700
No, I'd rather die. Or be homeless.

484
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,160
Then, you leave and become homeless.

485
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
I don't want to. Who would I do that for?

486
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,560
Good. Let's try not to share space.

487
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,430
Let's ignore each other even if we're in the same space.

488
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,500
I won't even say a word to you, so please do the same.

489
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,870
- Careful. 
 - What are you still doing here?

490
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,680
What else? I was just watching you sleep.

491
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,470
You must be lonely after sending off

492
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,760
your wife and kids to the US.

493
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,670
That's what I'm saying. Don't fault me for visiting you.

494
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,030
I don't want you to suffer because of me.

495
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,380
You must be tight with everything.

496
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,620
If it weren't for me, you could get a better-paying job.

497
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,470
Stop saying something so sad like that, or I'll...

498
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,870
You'll what?

499
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,240
Or I'll move in, too.

500
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,140
There are no rooms left.

501
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,390
This is, what do they say,

502
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,370
a hot place these days.

503
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,760
A hot place...

504
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,480
What the heck...

505
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,170
So cold...

506
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,870
How come it's not working?

507
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,440
Gosh.

508
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,050
How come it's only broken in that room?

509
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,910
I called someone, but it'll be a few days.

510
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,390
It's okay.

511
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,630
It's okay. He won't freeze to death.

512
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,170
I'd be grateful if he froze to death...

513
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,380
Miss Yoon, join us.

514
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,390
I'll eat after he's gone. Can you ask him when he's leaving?

515
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,850
Chairman,

516
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,310
have you finished eating?

517
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,850
No, I have a long way to go.

518
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:10,360
Please let her know I'll be taking my sweet time getting ready for work.

519
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,650
Sounds like he won't be leaving anytime soon.

520
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,260
I'm the one who got in a fight.

521
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,620
Why are they acting like that?

522
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,640
And? Was it a bad fight?

523
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,300
We started fighting because we were mad about Grandpa's incident.

524
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,020
But in the end, we said all kinds of hateful things to each other.

525
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,840
But you know, Seok Ji Won is funny.

526
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,270
He called the CEO at that exact moment.

527
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,890
He said he didn't.

528
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,170
Of course, he'd say that.

529
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,560
But how else could he have gotten there?

530
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,100
He might be petty, stupid, selfish, and rude,

531
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,300
but he doesn't lie. I know it.

532
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,940
You don't know anything.

533
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,210
You haven't seen him in forever.

534
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,870
Don't stand down. Think of your grandpa.

535
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,580
- Do you have good news or something? 
 - Huh?

536
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,030
- Why? 
 - You look so giddy.

537
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,480
You were cold as ice yesterday.

538
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,350
No, well, nothing like that.

539
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,610
Let's drink beer after work today.

540
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,650
- Beer? 
 - Yeah.

541
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,340
You're upset.

542
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,740
Can I come over to the school residence?

543
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,870
- To my place? All of a sudden? 
 - Yeah.

544
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,020
I'll bring over drinks and snacks.

545
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,970
What in the world? A rare occasion where Cha Ji Hye cares about Yoon Ji Won's feelings.

546
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,210
I'll be there. I can come, right?

547
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,640
Sure.

548
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,520
- Sounds good. See you later. 
 - See you later.

549
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,610
- Miss Yoon, is Grandpa sleeping? 
 - Yes.

550
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,840
I said let's just go out, but Ji Hye is being stubborn.

551
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,350
Gosh, it's okay.

552
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,950
Give it to me.

553
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,020
Thank you.

554
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,490
Snacks are here.

555
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,670
- Come take a seat. 
 - Okay.

556
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,830
For real. For real, for real.

557
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,020
The two of you look so cute together.

558
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,340
I said stop.

559
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,110
You stop.

560
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,830
Mr. Gong, what do you think about my Ji Won?

561
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,760
Be honest.

562
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,370
What?

563
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,700
- Stop this and go home now. 
 - Why?

564
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,450
Let go!

565
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,310
I'm so curious. Let's hear it.

566
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,630
He won't answer, and he's getting red.

567
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,110
He must really like you.

568
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,940
He does like you. It's true.

569
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,440
- Hey, Cha Ji Hye. 
 - You like her, don't you?

570
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,770
Hey. Stop drinking.

571
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,930
Seok Ji Won.

572
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,650
Did you hear that? Mr. Gong Moon Su

573
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,380
has a crush on Ji Won...

574
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,030
Come here.

575
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,270
Gosh, Mr. Gong, come to your senses...

576
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,540
Gosh, really.

577
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,300
Hey! Don't throw up.

578
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,810
 Cha Ji Hye, come to. 

579
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,320
My purse.

580
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,040
 - Be honest. You like her. 
 - Hey, Cha Ji Hye. 

581
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,510
 You like her, don't you? 

582
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,520
 Stop drinking. 

583
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,360
I can't believe them...

584
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,010
Water...

585
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,200
- Ji Won. 
 - Huh?

586
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,100
Yoon Ji Won.

587
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah? What?

588
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,370
I need to go home, but I can't find my purse.

589
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,100
Just sleep over. It's late.

590
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,860
I need to go home. I'll get into trouble if I stay out all night.

591
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,570
I think it's in the second-floor living room.

592
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,730
What's this?

593
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,590
Geez!

594
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,420
What is this?

595
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,080
A ladder?

596
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,850
What? An attic?

597
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,730
Look.

598
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,590
What's that?

599
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,960
Scared me!

600
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,010
Seok Ji Won?

601
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:41,550
My gosh! What are you looking at? You!

602
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,600
Hey!

603
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,720
What...

604
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,340
It's okay. It was just his pants.

605
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,300
I saw.

606
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,560
He won't eat.

607
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,910
He must be in shock.

608
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,490
I understand.

609
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,440
Of course.

610
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,010
   

611
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,650
   

612
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,640
   

613
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,260
It's been over ten years.

614
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,480
So, why did he have to dig through someone else's attic?

615
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,750
Did he see it? Could he have seen it?

616
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:03,010
W-W-What? Why?

617
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,180
Why are you still holding onto this?

618
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,910
I wasn't holding onto it. I just forgot to throw it out.

619
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,220
Cherishing it in a box?

620
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,600
Yes. I wanted to burn everything at once,

621
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,130
but it wasn't even worth that, so I just stashed it away. Why?

622
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,660
So, this is nothing?

623
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,560
You see that? All good?

624
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,370
Director, right now...

625
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,770
   

626
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,630
Father.

627
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,400
Your father was physically assaulted,

628
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,530
yet not a phone call or a visit?

629
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,730
Please take a seat.

630
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,450
Are you okay?

631
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,610
Do you think I'm okay?

632
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,540
That old man is stronger than I expected.

633
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,320
He slapped me twice.

634
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,030
So why did you pull such a dirty move?

635
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,080
Shut it. Tell that old man loud and clear.

636
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,310
- What? 
 - If he doesn't come and apologize to me,

637
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,630
I'll tear down that decrepit school residence before I get to the golf course!

638
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,390
- Father. 
 - I thought I'd pull out an excavator,

639
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,370
but I happen to be a compassionate person.

640
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,040
Tell him I'm giving him one last chance.

641
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,550
Father, will you really do this?

642
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,810
I will.

643
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,670
Have you ever seen me not follow through?

644
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,200
Here.

645
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,430
Thank you.

646
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,090
I'm so annoyed.

647
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:28,920
It's cold, running out here. Spring nights are still cold.

648
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,330
Should we stop running? Is your ankle okay?

649
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,600
I told you so many times I'm good.

650
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,130
I barely slipped. Let's run two more laps.

651
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,880
Sounds good. Take it slow.

652
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:47,510
He practically lives in the chairman's office.

653
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,020
Is he eating?

654
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,490
Oh, why don't we send up an electric blanket?

655
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,230
Where's our spare one?

656
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,050
I don't know. It's gone. Leave it.

657
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,860
If you have a high fever,

658
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,640
you should go to the hospital, not the pharmacy.

659
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,380
It might be a tough night with a fever and body chills.

660
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,130
Okay.

661
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,500
The electric blanket was somewhere around here...

662
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,090
Chairman.

663
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,720
He should've gone to the hospital if he was sick.

664
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,200
Why is he being so foolish?

665
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,650
We don't even have fever medication.

666
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,750
I'm crazy. Why am I doing this for him?

667
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,550
 Will you take me? 

668
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,800
Gosh, what a hassle.

669
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:10,410
â™«  I'll be all right, no need to worry  â™«

670
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:18,320
â™«  It'll be okay once time passes  â™«

671
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:26,320
â™«  At first, your cruel words  â™«

672
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:34,110
â™«  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  â™«

673
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:37,990
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

674
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,920
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

675
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:49,680
â™«  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  â™«

676

â™«  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  â™«

677
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:04,570
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

678
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,240
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

679
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:17,780
â™«  I see it all, but it seems like things are getting forgotten  â™«

680
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:21,160
â™«  But the sound of your voice makes my heart ache  â™«

681
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,280
â™«  It makes me feel hopeless, but babe  â™«

682
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,240
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

683
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,230
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

684
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:40,970
â™«  I can't erase you, so I'm trying to protect you  â™«

685
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:48,900
â™«  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  â™«

686
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:55,840
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

687
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,210
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

688
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,430
Better.

708
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,260
 That crazy bastard. Why did he do that to me? 

709
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,540
 I hate you so much. 

710
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,740
 I feel the same. 

711
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:15,230
 We've been friends for over 20 years, but he doesn't know me very well. 

712
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:17,370
 Looks like you missed the bus. Get in. 

713
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,060
 How long will it take? Let's go home together if it works out. 

714
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,610
 Can I trust you, follow you, respect you, and cherish you? 

715
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:26,460
 The bet says we have to date if the flower blooms. 

716
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,420
 Why do you want to date me? 

717
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,940
 To dump you. Mercilessly. 

718
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:38,280
â™«  Then caring more, more  â™«

719
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,520
â™«  So much time has passed without you  â™«
