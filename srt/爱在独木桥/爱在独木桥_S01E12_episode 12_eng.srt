1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,660
   
   

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,660
   
   

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,170
   

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,690
   

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,940
   

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,200
   

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,770
   

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,200
 Ho Seok, wait. I can explain everything. 

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,090
 Bastard! 

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,940
 Explain what? 

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,350
 Embezzling the company's money? Or... 

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,900
 dragging my father's foundation into getting an illegal loan? 

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,970
 Or blowing all that money! 

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,530
 I was just trying to do my best. 

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,160
 I wanted to make the new business successful... 

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,540
 Do you think I knew it would go sideways like this? 

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,180
 Stop making excuses! 

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,230
 It's all over. 

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,890
 Life can be so funny. Right, Ho Seok? 

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,400
 Gyeong Tae... 

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 It seems like it was yesterday I messed up the company 
   

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,600
 and had to run off because of your dad. 

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 And now, his son is coming to me 

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,000
 and asking me for money to save his business. 

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,700
 Please help me this one time. If not, our company— 

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
 - Even the school foundation could... 
 - I... 

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,800
 have no intention of helping you. 

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
 Wait, Hyungnim... 

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,130
 Think of it as karma. 

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,740
 Your father did the same thing to me. 

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,450


32
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,930
 By the way, Ji Gyeong Hoon called. 

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,840
 Why did he call? 

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,410
 He was blabbering a little. 

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,590
 Saying, "If you trust me just this once and wait, I'll find the money." 

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,210
 That bastard. He couldn't have... 

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,810
   

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,250
 H-Hey, Ho Seok. 

39
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,650
 Gyeong Hoon, where are you? 

40
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,220
 Ho Seok... 

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,640
 Please just trust me this one last time. 

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,850
 Let's meet up. I'm on my way to you. 

43
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,700
 No, no! Don't come! It's no use. 

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,600
 Hey, Gyeong Hoon, please! 

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,680
 Don't come. 

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,720
 Oh, my god! 

47
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,540
  * 
 (Emergency number for ambulance in Korea) 

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,270
 Gyeong Hoon... 

49
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,880
Gyeong Hoon... please save Ji Won's mother... please?

50
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,570
Please, Gyeong Hoon...

51
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,960
Gyeong Hoon, please...

52
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,510
 I'm sorry. 

53
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,400
 I'll put everything back in its place. 

54
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,500
Give it to me.

55
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,420
My son, Ho Seok...

56
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Did you kill him?

57
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,270
Father!

58
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,550
Don't call me father!

59
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,770
Ho Seok was my son!

60
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,500
After all he did for you?

61
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,110
After all he did for you? You deserve to die!

62
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,170
I didn't kill him!

63
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,340
He died on his own!

64
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,390
- It wasn't my fault! 
 - You!

65
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,720
You bastard...

66
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,130
Bring Ho Seok back to life...

67
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,190
- Bring my son back to life! 
 - I didn't kill him!

68
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,010
   

69
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,570
Where are you going?

70
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,230
I wish you wouldn't go.

71
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,270
What?

72
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,190
Don't drive tonight.

73
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,530
I had a...

74
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,210
a really terrible dream.

75
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,890
Father.

76
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,600
So...

77
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,280
don't go anywhere.

78
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,200
Stay with me tonight.

79
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,420
What are you talking about?

80
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,500
I know I'm being overbearing.

81
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,160
I do, but...

82
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,090
I feel like if I send you away now,

83
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,220
I might never see you again.

84
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,350
Ho Seok,

85
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,390
don't go.

86
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,280
It's your father's wish.

87
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,750
Grandpa!

88
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,630
Grandpa!

89
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,510
He left.

90
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,800
Ho Seok...

91
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,590
left, Ji Won.

92
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,190
Grandpa!

93
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,210
Ho Seok...

94
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,430
It's okay, Grandpa.

95
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,170
It's okay.

96
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,140
It's all going to be okay.

97
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,050
It appears to be Mild Cognitive Impairment.

98
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,350
Is it different from dementia?

99
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,260
He doesn't have dementia yet but is at risk of developing it.

100
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,090
Still, we caught it early, so try not to despair.

101
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,430
What can I do?

102
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,190
Dementia is not curable.

103
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,720
You can use medication in conjunction with lifestyle habits

104
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,860
and try to delay the onset as much as possible.

105
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,710
The family needs to understand the situation and provide lots of help.

106
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,630
Does he have other family members?

107
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,170
No, it's just me.

108
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,070
Excuse me.

109
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,140
Who...

110
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,680
- He's... 
 - Well...

111
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,120
you could say I'm family, sort of.

112
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,020
- Sorry? 
 - I'm family.

113
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,820
How can we help?

114
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,790
Thank you for being here.

115
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,500
I didn't come because I wanted to see him. It just worked out that way.

116
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,070
I heard it's not even dementia, technically.

117
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,050
No need to make a fuss.

118
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,040
The old man tried hard not to let you find out, so act strong.

119
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,910
- Yes, I will. 
 - Gosh...

120
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,730
I feel like I've aged since yesterday, thanks to the old man.

121
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll head out, then. Take good care of him.

122
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,330
Don't you want to see Ji Won before you go?

123
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,150
I already did. He seems fine.

124
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,290
Geez...

125
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,510
Don't get up. Stay lying down.

126
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,470
How's your grandpa?

127
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,070
I watched him eat and fall asleep.

128
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,680
- How are you? 
 - Me?

129
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,720
Your face...

130
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,560
It looks like we need another hospital room.

131
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,930
I'll get some rest. Lie down and get comfortable.

132
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,070
Where?

133
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,890
There's a pull-out bed here.

134
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,390
Come here. Get some rest with me.

135
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,750
No thanks. You get some rest already.

136
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,530
Please? Let's get rest together. Come on.

137
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,430
What did the police say?

138
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,470
We'll punish him severely.

139
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,050
I know that won't make you or your grandpa feel better, but still...

140
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,750
Ji Won,

141
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,660
maybe not right away,

142
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,440
but we're all going to be okay.

143
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,530
So...

144
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,400
let's be upset just for today and get some sleep. Okay?

145
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,200
- Grandpa! 
 - Gosh, Moon Su.

146
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,380
Careful! Careful!

147
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,540
Stop it. I'm fine.

148
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,930
Gosh. Even from the hospital,

149
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,200
these two have been treating me like a child all the way here.

150
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,950
It's nice to see you healthy.

151
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,230
My limbs are strong, at least.

152
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,510
You all went through so much because of me.

153
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,360
And thank you.

154
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm going to eat well, sleep well, and get a lot of exercise.

155
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,630
Let's go back to usual. Got it?

156
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,240
Got it.

157
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,900
Especially you two.

158
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,890
Got it.

159
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,430
Okay.

160
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,700
- Why don't you get more sleep? 
 - Let's go for a run together, Grandpa.

161
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,070
Why are you up? It's early.

162
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,830
I was thinking of running starting today.

163
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,360
Open your eyes first.

164
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,810
Let's go.

165
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,060
Let's go!

166
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,140
You're up early.

167
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,990
It's nice that I don't have to run alone.

168
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,170
Let's go!

169
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,130
Let's go!

170
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,830
Are you okay, Mr. Gong?

171
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,440
One, two! One, two!

172
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,180
Well, while spending this past semester with you all,

173
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,850
I've had a lot of fun and learned so much.

174
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,970
Study hard and work out hard.

175
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,380
There's a lot I want to say,

176
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,120
but I'm sure everyone wants to go home early, so I'll end it here.

177
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,560
Have a good break, everyone!

178
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, this is the start of your break, but...

179
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,770
the second semester of your 11th year isn't really 11th grade.

180
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,700
 Twelfth-grade year! 

181
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,420
You all know. So, studying is good,

182
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,040
but have fun on your last summer vacation.

183
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,070
Then, class adjourned!

184
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,360
You're not going home?

185
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,830
I will go home, and...

186
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,130
a few more places.

187
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,670
Traveling?

188
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,560
I think I'll jump in.

189
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,620
Into where?

190
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,390
- Into water. 
 - Water?

191
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,270
Since I quit swimming, I've not gone into the water since.

192
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,100
Not even to play in the water.

193
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,990
But come to think of it, I used to love water so much.

194
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,260
When I was a kid, I never cried during bathtime.

195
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,790
I loved water that much.

196
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,990
Maybe I won't break records or win medals again,

197
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,260
but I want to swim again,

198
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,760
because it's something I love.

199
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,110
Make sure you warm up.

200
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,820
Got it.

201
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,460
- Miss Yoon. 
 - Yeah?

202
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,820
Can I use my wish now?

203
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,630
Your wish? Oh, basketball?

204
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,560
What is it?

205
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,310
I'll be back, Miss Yoon.

206
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,840
Jump in as much as you want, Mr. Gong.

207
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,580
Bye!

208
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,500
 Yes. 

209
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,960
Okay.

210
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you for everything.

211
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,520
Are you going home?

212
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,210
Yes. How about you?

213
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,400
I should go home, too.

214
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,720
By any chance, do you...

215
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,380
remember the meal I was supposed to buy you?

216
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,050
Do you have time today?

217
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,200
I'd-I'd like that.

218
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,020
What would you like to eat?

219
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,290
How about you?

220
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,090
Do you like boiled chicken?

221
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,960
Someone recommended a good place to me. Neungi Baeksuk?

222
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,850
Neungi Baeksuk... yes. Sounds good.

223
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,100
- Should we go? 
 - Yes.

224
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,210
Have you been there before?

225
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,200
It was recommended to me.

226
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,350
I hear it's delicious.

227
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,560
Are you sad that the nurse and Ms. Maeng are flirting?

228
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,800
What? I'm not a kid.

229
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,690
Isn't it frustrating?

230
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,430
To pretend like it's nothing, that you're fine, that you don't care?

231
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,990
I'm not pretending.

232
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,190
Aren't you tired of being so nosy?

233
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,780
Nosy?

234
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,870
I looked up what that means. It's not like that for me.

235
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,700
- Then what is it? 
 - I like you.

236
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,880
I like you. That's why I keep looking at you,

237
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,500
helping you, and wanting to be near you.

238
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm not being nosy.

239
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,260
Are you crazy?

240
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,440
So, you don't like me?

241
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,060
You're the last in our class. Why would I like you?

242
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,290
What if I'm not the last anymore?

243
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,630
I won't come in last for the second-semester midterms.

244
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,170
Then, go out with me, Go Hye Soo.

245
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,450
Hey, just say no if you don't want to. I won't bug you again.

246
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,300
Fine, you can try.

247
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,990
Do you think it's that easy to raise your grades?

248
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,350
Awesome.

249
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,440
At first, you seemed like a very odd person, Ms. Maeng.

250
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,620
What?

251
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,520
Then, you seemed a little rude.

252
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,040
I thought you just made a joke out of everything.

253
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,710
Why are you bringing this up?

254
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,280
But the more I got to know you,

255
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,660
you might act like that...

256
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,900
but really,

257
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
you know how to genuinely comfort someone.

258
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,140
You're a warmhearted person.

259
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,620
Well...

260
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,100
You don't have to say that...

261
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,000
And as you know, I'm Hye Soo's dad.

262
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,020
I'm going to keep trying to be a better dad.

263
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,220
You asked me to get boiled chicken.

264
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,500
What is this roller coaster ride I'm on?

265
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,150
What are you trying to say, exactly?

266
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,750
What I want to say is...

267
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,090
   

268
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,300
Ho Seok...

269
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,630
was stubborn.

270
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,540
When you were orphaned, and we brought you home.

271
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,390
After we held a funeral for your parents,

272
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,820
I planned on having you with us for a few months...

273
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,260
then letting you go.

274
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,510
But Ho Seok cried and begged.

275
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,670
Asking me not to send you away.

276
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,570
He said his friend had nowhere to go.

277
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,850
I shouldn't have...

278
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,020
I shouldn't have listened...

279
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,420
to that kindhearted kid.

280
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,460
Father...

281
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,980
Don't call me that.

282
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,780
I'm not your father anymore...

283
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,210
I'm so sorry, Father.

284
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,280
You gave me a proper life.

285
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,520
That's why I wanted to be good...

286
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,520
Ever since I was young,

287
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,710
I always felt...

288
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,850
guilty...

289
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,350
toward you and Ho Seok.

290
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,800
I knew I had to be grateful for life.

291
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,690
I didn't like that.

292
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,090
I wanted to be proud of myself

293
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,410
and be your real son, Father.

294
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,960
That's why I got greedy.

295
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,530
I wanted to be successful...

296
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,290
and hear you say...

297
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,920
"You did all this."

298
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,250
Not Ho Seok.

299
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
You fool.

300
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,950
Did you think I ever

301
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,090
thought of you differently

302
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,730
from Ho Seok?

303
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,810
I'm sorry.

304
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,010
Please don't forgive me, Father.

305
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,870
No.

306
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,900
I will forgive you.

307
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,170
That's why I'm here.

308
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,970
Hanging onto someone like you...

309
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,840
and hating you, despising you... what's the use of that?

310
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,920
It's not necessary. It's not worth it.

311
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,900
I forgive you.

312
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,980
I...

313
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,640
You know...

314
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,200
the person who I cannot forgive

315
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,090
is the one who kept you by his side so cluelessly.

316
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,570
The fool, Yoon Jae Ho.

317
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,320
That's me.

318
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,770
Never...

319
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,930
Never again.

320
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,170
   

321
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,260
Let's sit for a moment.

322
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,840
Thanks for everything.

323
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,370
If it wasn't for you...

324
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,960
I wouldn't be able to face

325
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,010
my son and daughter-in-law again.

326
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,910
Ho Seok had come to see me back then.

327
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,450
Ho Seok came to see you?

328
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,830
He asked me to lend him money.

329
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,990
I said no, of course.

330
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,990
When I heard Ho Seok got into an accident after seeing me,

331
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,520
I got scared.

332
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,730
And I was angry. Telling myself it wasn't my fault.

333
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,360
I wanted to believe that you made me that way.

334
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,310
That's right. It wasn't your fault.

335
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,580
I know it's too late,

336
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,710
but I'm sorry...

337
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,930
for sending Ho Seok away like that.

338
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,470
It's all in the past.

339
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,730
The young ones...

340
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,990
will end the cycle of hate that we couldn't.

341
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,310
A hotel, of course! What are you talking about, old man?

342
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,780
Is it really right to spend millions on a wedding?

343
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,440
- Well... 
 - I have social optics to consider.

344
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,460
I know you may not think of me highly,

345
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,550
but I'm a chairman of a corporation!

346
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,170
- We think... 
 - I have class.

347
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,200
I won't tolerate superficial vanity or useless overconsumption.

348
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,570
Geez! I told you we'll pay for everything!

349
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,360
Why would you pay for everything? It's my granddaughter's wedding!

350
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,790
Excuse me.

351
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,500
I'll take you dress shopping.

352
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,270
I already picked out a few dresses that would be perfect for you.

353
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,640
Do you know how many guests I have just on our side?

354
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,070
Cut them down!

355
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,490
Don't invite useless people. Meaningful acquaintances only.

356
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,220
We don't have a daughter, so...

357
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,070
I really wanted to pick out my daughter-in-law's dress myself.

358
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,560
It's my fantasy.

359
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,110
Excuse me, Father...

360
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,210
I...

361
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,070
understand what you're saying.

362
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:08,400
But for now, we will make decisions within our planned budget.

363
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,750
Yes, please don't fight.

364
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,440
We'll handle it.

365
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,100
For the wedding, I was hoping

366
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,030
it would be a quiet and small event with only close family.

367
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,720
What are you saying? Do you know how many money gifts I have given away at weddings?

368
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,340
Family only?

369
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,790
That's right. A wedding is a memorable event for a family.

370
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,330
Even if that's the case, for us...

371
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,990
Ji Won, you must have quite a few guests yourself.

372
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,850
That's right.

373
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,510
A small wedding...

374
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,260
is my fantasy.

375
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,610
I like it.

376
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,520
Then, forget it! I'm done.

377
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,100
This wedding isn't happening!

378
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,880
Forget what? Is this your wedding?

379
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,050
Su Ja?

380
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,830
You could have called...

381
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,750
She did call me earlier, but no one was listening to me...

382
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,990
Mother, I thought you were coming next week.

383
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,020
I moved it up.

384
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,620
These enemies are finally putting their feud to bed.

385
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,670
A historical occasion. How could I miss it?

386
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,810
Anyway...

387
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,980
Gyeong Tae!

388
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,250
Yes.

389
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,970
- Jae Ho. 
 - Y-Yes.

390
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,420
These two have made a great decision.

391
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,370
Old people should stop meddling and nitpicking.

392
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,630
Who cares where the wedding is or how many people come?

393
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,040
Let her walk down the aisle however she wants!

394
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,180
Got it, you two?

395
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,390
Yes.

396
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,260
Got it.

397
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,950
How can we be so exhausted after one meeting between our families?

398
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,860
How many more do we have?

399
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,660
Should we just skip everything and get a marriage certificate?

400
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,670
You have no sense of romance.

401
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,940
Do you, then?

402
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,000
Of course, I do.

403
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,420
What is it?

404
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,000
Our wedding photos. On a clear, bright day.

405
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,460
In a garden with lots of flowers and trees.

406
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,670
Sounds hot.

407
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,850
I mean, pretty. Outdoor photos are the best.

408
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,870
Of course.

409
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,710
 Did the sudden heat take you by surprise? 

410
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,720
 The high temperature in Seoul has reached 36 degrees, the heatwave across the... 

411
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,530
How far away are we?

412
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,280
30 minutes.

413
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
We're already 20 minutes late...

414
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,240
Your meeting ran late. Wouldn't she understand?

415
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,340
Okay, good!

416
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,850
Hold up the flowers.

417
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,920
Okay, good. Great.

418
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,710
♫  Another day just like yesterday  ♫

419
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,830
To the left. Looking good!

420
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,460
♫  Somewhere in memories, touch my heart  ♫

421
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,830
I'm sorry. So sorry...

422
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,120
It's fine. Let's talk after the shoot.

423
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,970
Look at each other, please!

424
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,670
Very good!

425
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,190
It's so nice outside today, right?

426
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,580
Ji Won, you're so, so, so pretty.

427
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,840
Smile a little!

428
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,520
W-What?

429
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,420
Why are you mad? I should be the one mad!

430
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm not mad at you.

431
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,000
Then why the long face all the way home?

432
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,360
How many times do I have to tell you?

433
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,370
I'm mad at myself! Not you!

434
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,100
See? You're still mad at me. You just say that.

435
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,140
I mean...

436
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,460
Let's stop talking for the night.

437
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,540
You always say that when you have nothing else to say. So petty.

438
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,000
- Petty? 
 - Petty!

439
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,380
Enjoy.

440
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,770
Wow, looks delicious!

441
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,650
Gosh.

442
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,600
- This place is always so good! 
 - Right?

443
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,180
Now that the food is here, let's raise a glass.

444
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,800
For Mr. Hong's future!

445
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,970
 Cheers! 

446
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,170
Thank you.

447
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,090
Gosh...

448
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,650
- This is good, too. 
 - Nice. Goodness...

449
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,660
Look at this one.

450
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,980
- So good. 
 - Have some octopus.

451
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,660
Delicious.

452
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,260
By the way, Mr. Hong, have you found another job?

453
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,550
No. I'm going to take a break for a while.

454
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,650
Wow, I'm so jealous, Mr. Hong. It'll be a long recess for you.

455
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,680
Seriously. I wish we had one more week, no, three more days of break.

456
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,690
That's exactly what my kids say when school's back in session.

457
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,460
The only moment where students and teachers understand each other.

458
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,490
Do you hate working that much?

459
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,400
- Isn't it better than staying home all day being bored? 
 - Excuse me.

460
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,050
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

461
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,420
I'm sorry.

462
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,830
Already? All of a sudden? But this is your last day!

463
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,800
Yes, something urgent just came up. Yes.

464
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,210
Please stay and drink plenty. Let me take care of the bill.

465
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,780
- No, no, no! 
 - Absolutely not.

466
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,040
Enjoy.

467
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,110
Oh, Mom? Really? Why?

468
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,060
Got it. I'll be right there.

469
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,110
Gosh, I'm so bummed. My mom wants to talk to me about something.

470
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,150
I'll be right— no, see you tomorrow.

471
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,670
What? Miss Maeng!

472
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,150
Her phone didn't ring.

473
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,560
What do we do about those two?

474
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,790
- It's so obvious! 
 - Goodness!

475
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,930
What?

476
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,510
You don't know?

477
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,070
How could you not know?

478
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,910
Know what?

479
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,700
 What I want to say is... 

480
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,730
 Are you okay with me as I am? 

481
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,020
 You can say no. Yes... 

482
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,390
 You might as well, of course. 

483
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,400
 But for once, 

484
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,710
 I wanted to be honest. Like you, Miss Maeng. 

485
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,190
 Does that mean you like me, too? 

486
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,880
 Yes. 

487
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,400
 I like you, Su Ah. 

488
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,000
 - Yes! 
 - Yes? 

489
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,630
 Yes? 

490
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,140
 I mean, I like you, too. 

491
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,660
 As for me, 

492
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,990
 it's no fun when things are too obvious. I know it won't be an easy path, 

493
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,430
 but it's not my style to get scared ahead of time. 

494
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,080
♫  Don't know how it feels to be in love  ♫

495
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,170
♫  Whenever I see you, it feels kind of odd  ♫

496
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,260
♫  But every time I see you  ♫

497
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,000
♫  I keep smiling awkwardly  ♫

498
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,980
Starting tomorrow, I won't get to see you often.

499
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:46,030
No one seemed to want to go home. I couldn't wait.

500
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,720
My acting was so awkward, right?

501
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,520
Maybe we should've just told them.

502
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,420
Your acting was great! No one noticed.

503
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,080
- Really? 
 - Yes.

504
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,480
You were so natural, Su Ah. It almost had me fooled.

505
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,660
What should we do now?

506
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,330
I don't know.

507
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,570
Let's walk slowly while thinking about it.

508
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,930
The night is young.

509
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,510
Okay.

510
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
You needed more alcohol, didn't you?

511
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,540
I know it's cowardly,

512
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,960
but I need some liquid courage to make a confession to you.

513
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,890
To me?

514
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,860
When you got sick after breaking up with Seok Ji Won,

515
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,640
remember when I came to see you?

516
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,200
Are you talking about back in high school?

517
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,800
Yeah.

518
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,930
Back then...

519
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,570
Seok Ji Won had called you,

520
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,960
and I erased it.

521
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,880
Ji Hye...

522
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,840
Because I liked Seok Ji Won.

523
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,190
I know it's too late.

524
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,630
I also know it's useless.

525
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,900
But still,

526
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,820
I wanted to ask for forgiveness.

527
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,360
I was scared of being found out

528
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,110
about what king of terrible person I am.

529
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,120
That's why it took so long.

530
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:04,020
I'm truly sorry, Ji Won.

531
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,760
You can be angry.

532
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,630
You can be angry.

533
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,800
I think you've been angry at yourself enough.

534
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,340
Why did you hold onto it for so long? We were young.

535
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,910
You should've just told me and gotten over it.

536
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,090
What is this? All this time...

537
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,530
Yoon Ji Won...

538
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,570
Ji Won...

539
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,660
Hey.

540
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,280
What's this...

541
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,480
Did you think I'd just stop being mad

542
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,340
like a spineless fool if you pounced on me like that?

543
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm not mad anymore.

544
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,650
We met again, and that's all that matters.

545
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,890
What are you talking about?

546
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,500
♫  Yellow sunshine rays  ♫

547
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,000
We're dead meat if we get caught like this.

548
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,720
Whatever. Let's just die.

549
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:26,210
I'm sorry I was mean earlier. I was just mad.

550
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,550
No, I was petty.

551
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,450
I ruined everything.

552
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,960
You didn't ruin anything.

553
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,650
The rainy wedding photos are not bad.

554
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,530
You're right. Even in the rain,

555
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,700
you're pretty.

556
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,590
We need to select the second-semester class president. Any volunteers?

557
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,410
If there are no volunteers, you may nominate someone.

558
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,980
- I have a nomination. 
 - Okay, Hye Su.

559
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,010
Jeong Yul.

560
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,000
Is there anyone else other than Yul?

561
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,800
- I abstain... 
 - You may not.

562
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,380
You're the only candidate.

563
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,980
No need for a vote. Our second-semester class president will be Jeong Yul.

564
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,700
Okay...

565
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,020
Eom Gi Seok, do you have time...

566
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,660
You're headed to soccer?

567
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,470
No, I have time. I have so much time. Time's all I've got.

568
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,660
Then, go somewhere with me.

569
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,250
Let's go. Of course. Where?

570
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,130
- The library. 
 - What?

571
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,830
A new library opened up behind my house, and it's clean and quiet.

572
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,340
I'll tutor you.

573
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,360
You're so nervous that

574
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,150
I'll stay the worst student in class, huh?

575
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,970
What are you saying? Forget it, then.

576
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,800
Hey, I'd like that. Teach me everything.

577
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,320
What will you teach me?

578
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,960
Take me with you.

579
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:52,120
- Go away, please. 
 - I won't forgive you if you hang out without me.

580
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,120
Don't you dare start dating.

581
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,690
It's not like that!

582
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,460
"Don't you dare." Go away.

583
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,890
Don't come.

584
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:10,260
Hey, class president. Want to join us?

585
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,120
Where?

586
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,840
Where are we going?

587
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,000
The library. Feel free to join.

588
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,040
I'm out.

589
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,510
Let's go together.

590
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,670
Why not?

591
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,780
- Are we really going to the library? 
 - Yes.

592
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,580
- How about we get some tteokbokki on the way? 
 - Nope.

593
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,530
I won!

594
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,780
Come here, come here. Brace yourself.

595
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,930
Brace yourself!

596
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,460
Gosh! Sorry, I got carried away.

597
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,860
Get carried away twice,

598
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,980
and you'll smash your first love's forehead after decades apart.

599
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,850
I guess it hurt.

600
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,230
You never knew how to read a room.

601
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,900
So, you dumped me and went to Seok Ban Hee?

602
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,250
Because he knew how to read a room and was quick?

603
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,770
More than that,

604
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,150
my Gyeong Tae's dad

605
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,980
was good-looking.

606
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,630
All I look for in a man is his face.

607
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,600
I mean, what's so bad about me?

608
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,400
Good-looking ones eventually cause you trouble because of their good looks.

609
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,850
Good-looking ones eventually cause you trouble because of their good looks.

610
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:52,240
You're right. But the ugly ones are such an eyesore.

611
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,370
Given a choice, I'd pick the good-looking one.

612
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,160
I'm not saying you're like that, Oppa.

613
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,440
Oppa, you were crazy about work rather than love.

614
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,060
Am I wrong?

615
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,420
Was I?

616
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,970
Oppa, why don't we stop flicking foreheads

617
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:16,110
and play some black-dot-white Go-Stop?

618
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,290
W-Well...

619
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,580
S-S-Shall we?

620
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,760
Why not.

621
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,970
We'll build this instead of a golf course.

622
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,130
- Ecological park? 
 - Yes.

623
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,600
We're talking to the forestry agency. Not to the extent of a golf course,

624
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,840
but it'll stimulate the local economy.

625
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,980
This is a notice. Look at you.

626
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,400
This is my business. I'll do my best, Father.

627
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,390
I plan to consult a Dokmok Mountain expert in the process.

628
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:50,330
Who's an expert on mere Dokmok Mountain?

629
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,300
I've prepared an agenda for you to tour

630
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,900
Albert Park and Arthur's Pass National Park in New Zealand.

631
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,850
Per your direction, I've scheduled meetings with concrete 3D printing companies.

632
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,500
How long will this take?

633
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,320
I estimate around a month.

634
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,040
It's just a month. Why are you so sad?

635
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,730
"Just"?

636
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,500
I'll call you often.

637
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,630
I don't want to go.

638
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,310
It's work. What can you do? You need to go.

639
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,670
Wait a second.

640
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,120
If you're gone for a month,

641
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,130
you'll miss our birthday.

642
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,150
And it's Christmas, too. How can you miss a big holiday?

643
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,650
Ji Won, that's...

644
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,890
It's okay. I'll just be lonely all by myself.

645
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,550
What if it snows?

646
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,600
I'll go to Namsan by myself like the old days,

647
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,280
and pathetically let the snow fall on me.

648
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,950
Wait a second. Right away, I'll...

649
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,310
I'm joking.

650
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:13,790
Our birthday comes every year. Go, work hard, and make tons of money.

651
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,990
Okay.

652
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,930
Thank you.

653
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,510
What? A business trip for an entire month?

654
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,610
Yes. That's how it worked out.

655
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:33,890
What? He'll miss the end of the year, including Christmas.

656
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,790
Miss Maeng, since it's come to this, how about the three of us spend Christmas together?

657
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,390
Huh?

658
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,890
Love it. I love it, but...

659
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:49,080
I heard you're supposed to spend Christmas with family.

660
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,600
Miss Maeng's about to cry.

661
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,120
I'm joking. Ji Hye, what are you doing on Christmas?

662
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,730
Are you secretly dating someone, too?

663
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,020
Nope. It's so crowded out on the streets on Christmas.

664
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,410
It's exhausting to meet someone and date.

665
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,330
It's pointless.

666
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:09,920
All right.

667
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,200
There are no takeaways in particular from today's staff meeting.

668
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,340
We have a new math teacher. Come on in.

669
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,850
He'll need time to get used to the place. Please give him a warm welcome.

670
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,120
I ask the fellow math teachers to take extra care of him.

671
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,770
- Will do. 
 - Please introduce yourself.

672
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,290
I'm Kim Ji Woong. Nice to meet you.

673
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,960
Hey, hey! Hey!

674
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,870
So, it's not so pointless after all.

675
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,970
   

676
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,140
- Did you sleep well? 
  - Who is this? 

677
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,780
It's been so long that I've forgotten your voice.

678
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,640
Gosh, I was busy. Sorry.

679
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,960
You must be stressed. Should we talk later if you're busy?

680
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,620
No, it's okay.

681
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,130
Sounds like you're the only one working. What's wrong with your company?

682
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,610
I know. What's wrong with this company?

683
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,850
We have a new math teacher at school.

684
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,780
 Director. 

685
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:44,070
Ji Won, I need to run to a meeting. I'll call you later.

686
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,300
- Got it. 
 - Okay.

687
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:52,970
 Yes. 

688
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,690
Then, on page 134...

689
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,020
 Hello. 

690
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,790
My grandpa's a hipster.

691
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:51,840
Right? Your grandpa's above-average handsome, right?

692
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,460
Of course. Why? Did someone say something?

693
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,420
Huh? No, just saying.

694
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,860
See you later.

695
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,230
Have a good time, advisory committee member.

696
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,790
Will do.

697
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,220
It's cold. No need to see me out.

698
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,740
What? Did you leave something behind?

699
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,920
There was something I wanted to tell you...

700
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,330
Gosh, I forgot during those few steps I took.

701
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,460
That happens. It happens to me sometimes, too.

702
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,870
Gosh, really...

703
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,620
Grandpa,

704
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,380
- were you going to say "I love you"? 
 - Gosh...

705
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,010
What? You don't love me?

706
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,030
Of course, I love you.

707
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:49,580
I love my granddaughter more than anything in the world.

708
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,330
Me, too.

709
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,380
Okay, let's say that's what I was going to say.

710
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,290
Even if I forget everything else,

711
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,930
I shouldn't forget that.

712
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,200
See you later.

713
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,100
   

714
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:41,320
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

715
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,460
 After the beep, there will be a charge. 

716
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,090
Look at him calling me less and less often.

717
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,640
After all that whining about not wanting to go...

718
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,460
The first snow of the year...

719
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,370
I wish it snowed after Seok Ji Won got back.

720
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,590
The weather report is usually so off.

721
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:53,460
♫  Inside lost time  ♫

722
00:59:53,460 --> 01:00:01,020

♫  So many seasons pass by  ♫

726
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,600
I'm so pathetic. Let's go home.

727
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,100
   

728
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,120
So, you're alive.

729
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,790
 What are you up to? 

730
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,850
Why do you need to know? You're in New Zealand.

731
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,510
 It's snowing here, Ji Won. 

732
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,240
You think I'm an idiot?

733
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,610
It's summer there. What snow—

738
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,040
 We missed each other so often.

 And there were so many days we missed each other in secret. 

742
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,620
 I like him, but I hate him. 

743
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,700
 I miss him, 

744
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:46,000
 but I don't want to see that bastard. 

745

749

01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:19,080

♫  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  ♫

755
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,570
How did you get back so early?

756
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:44,150
I lost some sleep.

757
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,230
I looked at the weather report, and it said it would snow.

758
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:52,400
I didn't want to make you wait for me again.

759
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:06,590
I wanted to give you this back then but wasn't able to.

760
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,860
 Our birthdays are in winter. Why are you asking about a gift so early? 

761
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,200
 A scarf, then. Knit a red one for me. 

762
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:16,720
 Fine. 

763
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,290
 A small promise from long ago 

764
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,930
 came back to me on a winding road. 

765
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,390
It snowed so early,

766
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:28,070
so it's a little short still.

767
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,910
 Hey. Do you remember us having a wedding in kindergarten? 

768
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:42,430
 I thought we didn't get through the wedding. 

769
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,460
 So, that's how you remember it. 

770
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,910
 Wasn't that it? 

771
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,550
 Whatever. 

772
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,610
 I don't want to marry Yoon Ji Won! 

773
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,450
 I want to marry Kim Ji Soo! 

774
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,800
 I don't want to. 

775
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,700
 - Idiot. Fool.  
  - I said I don't want to...
