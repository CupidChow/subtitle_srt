00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,580
   
   

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,230
   

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,620
   

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,060
   

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,300
   

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,930
â™«  I'll be all right, no need to worry  â™«

8
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:55,830
â™«  It'll be okay once time passes  â™«

9
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:03,820
â™«  At first, your cruel words  â™«

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:11,610
â™«  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  â™«

11
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,590
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,410
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

13
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:27,090
â™«  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  â™«

14
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,150
â™«  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  â™«

15
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,240
I remember.

16
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,100
- That night, I... 
 - You crazy...

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,240
You crazy tree! How dare you bloom!

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,760
You're completely crazy! Crazy!

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,190
What?

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,470
I remembered.

21
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,740
- What? 
 - That night.

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,840
Night? What night?

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,670
Your cold.

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,900
You got it from me.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,010
- I... 
 - D-Don't do it.

26
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,100
- Don't do what? 
 - Whether you remember or not, the kissâ€”

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,300
That wasn't anything special. It'd be silly to discuss it now.

28
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,670
I'll just chalk it up to bad luck and forget it. Let's not bring it up again.

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,150
Chalk it up to what?

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,020
Let's pretend it never happened. I'm doing you a favor.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,820
I told you. I don't want to talk about it again.

32
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,060
Oh, yeah? Let's stop talking about that, then.

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,220
But don't we have more to discuss?

34
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,360
We do.

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,700
You need to date me.

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,240
How could you say such an awful thing? Excuse me, Chairman.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,690
We had a bet. The tree bloomed, and I won.

38
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,630
That's true, but...

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,380
But how can we date? That makes no sense.

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,490
Whether it makes sense or not, a bet is a bet.

41
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,050
Please come to your senses.

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,060
Whether I come to my senses or not, a bet is a bet.

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,090
How can you say something like that so easily?

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,080
Should I make it even easier for you?

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,290
Today is...

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,600
our day one.

47

â™«  All day, I think about you  â™«

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,330
â™«  All day, I think about you  â™«

50
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,070
â™«  Thinking about you  â™«

51
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,470
â™«  Because I don't see you  â™«

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,680
â™«  So, that's all I can do  â™«

53
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,410
What in the world? I did not imagine it would bloom.

54
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,250
- Me neither. 
 - So...

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,910
the Chairman saw it bloom, too, right? 
    

56
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,490
He must've. Since he has eyes and all.

57
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,890
What did Ji Won say?

58
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,050
What do you mean? It was just a prank.

59
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,910
Why would grown adults actually date over a stupid bet?

60
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,470
Why not? What a waste. I wouldn't miss this opportunity.

61
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,490
Miss Maeng, do you think this is funny?

62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,980
Miss Yoon and the chairman are both reasonable, intelligent adults.

63
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
Of course, they won't date. What do you mean, waste?

64
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,910
I'm just saying I would. Since I lack reason and intelligence.

65
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,730
You two always end up fighting when we get together.

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,850
So, why don't we stop getting together?

67
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,250
What you're imagining will never happen.

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,090
I couldn't get a hold of you.

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,410
I lost my phone...

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,570
What are you doing after work?

71
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,290
Pardon?

72
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,180
Please forgive me, but why are you asking her that?

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,600
- Dayâ€” 
 - The report! Let me debrief you now. Let's go.

74
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,870
The document Miss Yoon took with her...

75
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,210
I saw it, too. It's this month's school lunch menu.

76
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,710
This means...

77
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,580
- Dopamine! 
 - Explosion!

78
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,820
Wow...

79
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,430
You must be crazy.

80
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,410
So, why don't you pick up my calls? I'd get hurt now that we're dating and all.

81
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,750
I said I lost my phone.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,200
When? When you went to Seoul by chance?

83
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,670
Yes.

84
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,590
Well, that's not important. What do you think you're doing?

85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,060
Don't you know? Starting yesterday...

86
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,300
You really want to date me or whatever?

87
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,500
From 10th to 12th graders.

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,000
In this school, where rumors spread like wildfire?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,420
In this town, where nearly everyone knows us?

90
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,480
Sure.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,300
What if I said I'd rather die?

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,810
You can't do that. You need to honor the bet.

93
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,010
The bet is beside the point if I don't want to.

94
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,090
What? You'll call the cops? Or will you fire me?

95
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,720
Never mind. Why don't you just slap me and call it a day?

96
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,690
How come you're so indignant?

97
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,060
You shouldn't have agreed to it in the first place, then.

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,650
You're hell-bent on cornering me.

99
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,330
You've always been so cunning.

100
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,310
What? Cunning?

101
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,730
To get technical, you didn't honor the bet we made back then.

102
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,030
You didn't call me "Big Sis."

103
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,970
Gosh, that was a long time ago.

104
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,090
Why are you bringing up "Big Sis" now? That's unreasonable.

105
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,100
You and I dating would be unreasonable.

106
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,620
I mean, since we made a bet...

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,740
Chairman,

108
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,700
we're not eighteen anymore.

109
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,920
Geez.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
My goodness...

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,890
- What are you doing? 
 - Well, this...

112
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,160
Director...

113
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,260
You want to date?

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,530
Miss Yoon, are you really dating the chairman?

115
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,490
- No. 
 - I heard you got a diamond ring. Is that true?

116
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,520
I did not.

117
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,310
- Come on. 
 - I heard you filed a marriage certificate.

118
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,860
Marriage?

119
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,170
Stop, stop. Line up already. Hurry.

120
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,990
Class is starting. Hurry!

121
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,820
Hurry up and go.

122
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,100
It was just a bet. That's what you're saying?

123
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,670
Of course. It's nothing more.

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,420
You sounded pretty desperate, consideringâ€”

125
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,130
What I mean is...

126
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,960
To date, no, I mean...

127
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,080
you can't show that you're desperate about the bet.

128
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,870
Then?

129
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,500
Pretend you don't care...

130
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,260
I mean, pretend not to care about the bet.

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
Act like you could care less.

132
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,030
Not a care in the world and aloof, but as if you're still hurt.

133
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,380
That's when the P.E. teacher will start to care about you.

134
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,400
She'll wonder what's up.

135
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,150
Once she starts caring, it's game over.

136
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,800
 Since when? Since when? 

137
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,970
 What do you like about the chairman? 

138
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,180
 What do you like about him? 

139
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,500
Whatever.

140
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,900
I don't need to get childish.

141
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,010
Check out the midterm results.

142
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,190
Midterms...

143
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,350
Thank you.

144
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,520
I'll be watching with my hawk eyes.

145
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,760
Geez, goodness!

146
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,950
Accept it.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,500
â™«  I won't run away anymore  â™«

148
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:08,910
â™«  Have you also been waiting for me?  â™«

149
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,680
â™«  Could this be a mere passing connection?  â™«

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,130
â™«  If this turns out not to be love  â™«

151
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,430
â™«  I know you won't ever come back to me  â™«

152
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,260
â™«  I know  â™«

153
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,340
â™«  Now, I look at you  â™«

154
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,440
â™«  Now, you save me  â™«

155
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Nice work. Have a great day.

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:43,770
â™«  Let go of the hatred  â™«

157
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,610
â™«  Embrace me  â™«

158
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,330
Excuse me.

159
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,940
Miss Yoon Ji Won, excuse me.

160
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
Honey.

161
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,180
Are you crazy?

162
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,750
So, you like stuff like this, Honey.

163
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,200
I got an immediate response.

164
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,670
Honey, I think I'm hurt.

165
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,740
Are you okay?

166
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,750
- It's ready to eat. 
 - It's ready.

167
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,130
Here comes Mr. Gong's meat wrap.

168
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,490
- Grandpa, try this. 
 - Me?

169
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,170
- Please try it. 
 - Thank you.

170
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,510
Thank you.

171
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,650
Here's one for you, Miss Yoon.

172
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,560
Mr. Gong, you eat.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
Just eat, Miss Yoon.

174
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,390
My arm hurts. Hurry. Say ah.

175
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,720
 Pretend not to care about the bet. 

176
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,150
 Act like you could care less. Not a care in the world and aloof. 

177
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,460
 But as if you're still hurt. 

178
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,370
Chairman, we got hungry and started eating.

179
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,750
Wash your hands and come join us.

180
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,430
No, thank you. Well, I...

181
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,950
- don't feel well. 
 - What?

182
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,330
You should still eat dinner.

183
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,060
What's up with him?

184
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,300
Want another wrap?

185
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,620
 - Should we have pork belly tomorrow, too? 
 - Should we? 

186
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,010
 It's good quality meat. 

187
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,360
He looks perfectly fine but gets sick all the time.

188
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,040
Making me worry...

189
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,630
Hey.

190
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,120
What? It's porridge.

191
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,690
I'm tender-hearted for no good reason.

192
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
You were worried about me because I skipped dinner.

193
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,290
Worried, my foot.

194
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,820
Consider this a common courtesy I extend to housemates.

195
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,800
You can leave that there. Looks delicious.

196
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
Forget it. Eat the ramen you secretly made.

197
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
- Ramen's not that good. I'll eat that. 
 - Forget it.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,790
- Let me have it. 
 - No!

199
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
Hot!

200
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,800
It stings...

201
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,660
It was pretty much cooled down.

202
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,330
The lilacs.

203
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,300
Did you know they bloom for two weeks at most?

204
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,550
What about it?

205
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,670
Let's break up once the flowers die. A compromise.

206
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,730
If I reject you, will you keep bothering me?

207
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,520
Probably.

208
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,990
Sure, let's date until the flowers die.

209
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,820
But I don't want to seem like someone fooled by childish pranks,

210
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,060
so keep it a top secret from everyone.

211
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,620
I'm down.

212
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,160
Tomorrow...

213
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,560
Let's go on a date after school.

214
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,750
All right.

215
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,190
Honey.

216
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,490
All right.

217
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,620
Teachers, how about a staff dinner today since it's payday?

218
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,840
I'll pick up the bill for round one.

219
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm going on a hospital tour with my mom today and blowing my whole paycheck.

220
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm a little tired today.

221
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,350
Ji Hye, you'll feel better once you drink. Goodness.

222
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,940
Miss Yoon.

223
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,720
I have p-p-p-plans.

224
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,830
With whom?

225
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,950
- A friend. 
 - A friend?

226
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,990
Miss Cha and I are your only friends.

227
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,270
W-W-What friend makes you s-s-stutter?

228
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,850
A college friend.

229
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,200
A college friend that no one knows about.

230
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,540
I've never heard you talk about meeting up with a college friend.

231
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,310
I can smell the scent of lilacs...

232
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,320
He's so cold toward you, Miss Yoon.

233
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,710
I know. I made things clear with him.

234
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,460
I told him to stop bothering me with a silly bet.

235
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,440
Really? You're ending things this anticlimactic?

236
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,690
You really hate the chairman that much?

237
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,900
I hate him. Totally hate him.

238
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,170
I'd rather shave my head and join a temple than to date him.

239
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,770
That'd be better.

240
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,240
I've heard that before.

241
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,320
Yoon Ji Won.

242
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,330
What do you want?

243
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,830
We didn't discuss when and where to meet.

244
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,710
So, you decided to pop out like this?

245
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,990
You said you'll keep it a secret.

246
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,620
That's why I'm speaking secretively.

247
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,640
Come to my car in the parking lot later.

248
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,560
Get into your car in the parking lot and leave together?

249
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,450
What an ironclad secret.

250
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,810
Wow, no one will find out. Huh?

251
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,610
Right?

252
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,560
Hello.

253
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,430
- You have plans tonight? 
 - Yes.

254
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,430
Director, is this really your best?

255
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,100
Debating among three or four similar blue ties?

256
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,800
No.

257
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,490
Look.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,650
Look. They're all different.

259
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes, well...

260
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,190
In movies and TV dramas, they always see each other in sweats.

261
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,300
But showing up in a handsome suit makes the heart drop a beat.

262
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,450
But I always wear suits and look handsome.

263
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,330
What do I do?

264
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,420
Yes.

265
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,380
Well, I see. I get it.

266
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,700
So, I thought about it.

267
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,800
Director, what if you try out a casual-yet-put-together look?

268
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,080
- Casual what? 
 - Casual-yet-put-together.

269
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,900
That's really popularâ€”

270
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,000
   

271
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,190
Why do I have so many clothes but nothing to wear?

272
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,040
Why does that matter? So what if I look like shit?

273
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,670
 You look so cute. 

274
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,340
 - Good, right? 
 - You're no good with photos. 

275
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,720
 Let's take one together. Come. 

276
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,370
 - It looks really cute! 
 - One, two, three. 

277
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,370
â™«  Another day just like yesterday  â™«

278
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,340
 So pretty. This is it. Smile! 

279
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,940
 - But where you put the flower... 
 - It looks good. 

280
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,690
 There we go! 

281
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,710
â™«  Somewhere in memories, touch my heart  â™«

282
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,860
â™«  Some flowers bloom within my love  â™«

283
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:20,860
â™«  I guess you were still my green  â™«

284
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,540
   

285
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,950
I'm late!

286
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,080
 Dr. Go Young Seon... 

287
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,170
 Dr. Go stepped out, and I don't know when he'll be back. 

288
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,270
Gosh... Goodness, girl.

289
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,700
Why are you walking so fast?

290
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,180
You're slow, Mom.

291
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,900
What? Did you see something?

292
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,570
No, it's just...

293
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,740
Should I cook beef stew, your dad's favorite?

294
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,100
With Korean beef? You just got paid, right?

295
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,810
Dad's lucky.

296
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,810
He stays home and doesn't work, but you still take such good care of him.

297
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,410
Mom, my paycheck is 3.5 million won. Not 35 million.

298
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,170
My gosh. Do you have to make your mom sad over just some beef?

299
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,340
Fine, we'll get imported meat.

300
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,360
Look, Mom. I bought you a jacket because you needed one.

301
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,610
I paid for your shared savings fund this month.

302
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,020
And I'm about to pay for your implant.

303
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,550
Implant is...

304
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,970
That's monthly payments.

305
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,260
Mom, the monthly payments come out of my paycheck, too.

306
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,920
I don't pay it off out of thin air.

307
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,990
In that case, I guess I can't expect Soo Young and Gyeong Soo's pocket money.

308
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,640
Tell them they'll get it next month.

309
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,780
You take such good care of everyone except me.

310
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,840
You're good at taking care of yourself.

311
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,200
You're the pillar of our family.

312
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,810
Old and tired pillar, about to crumble.

313
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,770
Fine, I won't get the beef. Let's not.

314
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,390
I'm not saying don't buy it.

315
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,460
Ms. Jeong Yeon Woon.

316
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,380
Yes, that's me.

317
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,570
See you.

318
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,460
I'm so tired of this.

319
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,980
Hello...

320
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,000
 Seok Ji Won! 

321
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,020
What?

322
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,850
Come on. Get it together.

323
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,100
- Where do you want to go? 
 - Where are we going?

324
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,910
You're asking me that?

325
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,330
Who else should I ask?

326
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,540
You begged and threatened me to date you.

327
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,990
Gosh, I didn't go that far.

328
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,210
You came with no plans whatsoever?

329
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,660
 If a man plans the whole date, that means 

330
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,060
 he'll do whatever he wants. 

331
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,020
 That's not very MZ*. 
 (*A term used in Korea to describe the collective group of millennials and Gen Z) 

332
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,520
 The current trend is to ask the other person's opinion first. 

333
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,000
 - Really? That's what people do these days? 
 - Of course. 

334
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,240
 Just trust me, Director. 

335
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,590
I have a plan. I was just being considerate in case you had

336
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,150
somewhere you wanted to go.

337
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,080
Let's go.

338
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,580
Miss Cha!

339
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,600
- Can't be. 
 - Ji Hye!

340
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,600
Look at you, Ji Hye.

341
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,540
You're not tired. You're just lonely, in my opinion.

342
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,330
Get in. Let's go drink together.

343
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,850
I hate this tiny town.

344
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,450
I thought you'd turn me down for sure.

345
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,960
I was craving a drink, too.

346
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,860
With me?

347
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,720
I keep joking...

348
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,130
It's my mom.

349
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,410
She can't give up the Korean beef.

350
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,930
I told her to buy it.

351
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,200
She's not a bad person.

352
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,810
Well, when I said I was sick of it,

353
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,350
I wasn't referring to my mom.

354
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,410
How should I say this...

355
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,500
Being the pillar of a poor family for a long time

356
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,950
makes your leg hurt and makes you thirsty.

357
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,570
That's what I meant.

358
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,650
I'm so embarrassed.

359
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,120
I didn't want you to know.

360
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
You keep finding things out about me.

361
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,990
I get it. You could be sick of it.

362
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,670
Even if it's your mom. Even if it's family.

363
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,740
- Pardon? 
 - You could hate and resent her, too.

364
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,900
But even so, I hope you don't blame yourself, Miss Maeng.

365
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,360
And allow yourself to get found out by me when you're having a hard time.

366
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,060
I mean, it could be me,

367
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,530
or it could be Miss Yoon,

368
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,700
or anyone.

369
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:49,430
When I get found out about being my family's pillar,

370
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,070
acquaintances tell me I shouldn't feel that way about my parents.

371
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,540
If I was flirting with a person, they just ghosted me.

372
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,730
My ex-boyfriends have said marriage means separating myself from my family.

373
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,110
That's how it's been.

374
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,570
And you say it's okay to hate.

375
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,220
It's okay to get found out...

376
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,160
No one's ever said that to me.

377
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,900
Even if you're a parent or a child,

378
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,810
you can't always just love each other.

379
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,270
We hurt those...

380
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,870
who are closest to us.

381
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,790
This is a little strange indeed.

382
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,980
What is?

383
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,190
You're just staring at me,

384
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,300
instead of pulling a sleazy prank.

385
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,900
S-Sleazy? M-Me?

386
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,600
Not provocative or cute?

387
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,340
Not those things, but sleazy?

388
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,800
Yes.

389
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Me? R-Really?

390
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm sleazy?

391
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,810
I didn't know.

392
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Sleazy...

393
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,820
- Oh, my. 
 - Whoa.

394
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,730
I'm sorry.

395
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,080
I would be happy to buy the second round. Should I?

396
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,530
We need to work tomorrow, so let's call it a night.

397
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,990
Mr. Hong!

398
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,860
Miss Maeng!

399
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,540
Hey, hey, hey!

400
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,400
Are you two dating?

401
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,750
Here you are!

402
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,740
I caught you.

403
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,640
- Were you all hanging out? 
 - Yeah.

404
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,710
- Okay. Let's go. 
 - To where?

405
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,000
Follow me.

406
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,520
Next guest with a reservation. Show me the reservation text.

407
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,240
You looked up this place at the traffic light earlier, didn't you?

408
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,560
One of Yangseo's hot places.

409
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,900
You saw that?

410
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,030
You did find a spot.

411
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,740
Since you can't get in without a reservation.

412
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,510
So you know.

413
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,620
You said you had a plan, so I thought you made a reservation.

414
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,010
Be honest.

415
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,350
Your last relationship was...

416
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,830
let's see...

417
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,420
about 18 years ago?

418
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,710
Nonsense. At most, seven yearsâ€”

419
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,670
Seven years. Wow, what a dating novice.

420
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,750
In that case, I understand this misstep.

421
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,460
Well, it's not like you've got game.

422
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,910
Me? I've been on countless dates.

423
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,480
I didn't even take a week off last year.

424
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,440
So, where and with whom did you go on such fun dates?

425
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,030
Who did I go out with? Let's see.

426
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,570
Right, a programmer.

427
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,580
Yup. A health trainer last winter vacation.

428
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,870
Who else? There were more...

429
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,870
You dated a health trainer

430
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,980
but were rejected by the school nurse?

431
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,220
Wow, what a bad girl.

432
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,200
- That's... 
 - I don't believe you anyway.

433
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,740
So don't bluff.

434
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,400
 Closing. 

435
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,280
Why don't you believe me?

436
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,720
I can tell.

437
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,090
Tell, how?

438
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,290
You've been nervous this whole time since it's your first date in ages.

439
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,820
Nope. You're the one who's nervous.

440
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,710
It's not that I couldn't date, I chose not to date.

441
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,930
People are lining up to date me,

442
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,960
but I'm just so busy.

443
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,900
Are you saying I couldn't get a date? Hilarious. Date, wait...

444
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,330
Why would I be nervous in front of you?

445
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,810
You're nothing.

446
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,820
Sure, stand ten feet away and say that.

447
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,670
Happy now? Does this feel like a real date?

448
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,960
Feels like you're shaking a little.

449
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,700
Me?

450
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,890
I got a little nervous about bumping into someone we know.

451
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,940
You've been shaking this whole time,

452
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,090
worried about getting found out.

453
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,420
Yangseo may be small, but it's very unlikely

454
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,210
to run into people we know at a building like this.

455
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,850
It's so great to all get together.

456
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,380
You're late, monk.

457
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,520
So, you're really not dating?

458
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,320
Then, how come...

459
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,970
you were in there like this?

460
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,640
- Let me explain. 
 - I-I..

461
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,280
forced her into it.

462
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,770
Forced?

463
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,940
Why?

464
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,020
She was acting petty. She lost the bet and tried to get away with it.

465
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,660
So, you called out Miss Yoon, who said she didn't want to date you?

466
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,960
Yes.

467
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,300
Chairman, did you do that because you like Miss Yoon?

468
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,760
Feelings aside,

469
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,150
I'm just following the rules. Since I won the bet.

470
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,240
Now that I look at you, Miss Yoon's outfit doesn't really say it's a date.

471
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,670
She's practically wearing her work clothes. Don't you think?

472
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,750
They're no-nonsense when it comes to things like this.

473
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,510
But you really shouldn't act like that.

474
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,770
Yes.

475
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,120
Actually...

476
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,500
Now, you know everything. What more?

477
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,290
No. We don't want to know more.

478
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,400
Then, let's eat.

479
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,060
Sure.

480
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,960
These two...

481
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,260
They're just messing around.

482
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,970
This is not messing around.

483
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,820
Be careful.

484
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,850
I don't want to go! I won't go home!

485
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,280
Get home safely.

486
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,410
Bye now.

487
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,710
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

488
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,720
- You trash... 
 - Whoa, whoa!

489
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,400
I'll take Miss Maeng home.

490
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,300
- Yes. See you. 
 - You...

491
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,060
Where are you going? That's not the way home.

492
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,310
I'm going for another drink at a secret spot.

493
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,700
You go home first.

494
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,230
This sure is a secret spot.

495
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,590
You didn't have to go that far earlier.

496
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,890
So, they'd stop asking.

497
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,220
How would we even start explaining?

498
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,790
People think you're trash.

499
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,940
I don't mind.

500
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,930
 You don't mind? What do you mean? Are you an idiot? 

501
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,440
 I caused the issue. Why are you taking the blame and begging for mercy? 

502
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,310
 They're seniors. Also, I didn't beg, I mediated. 

503
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,980
 It would end sooner if I took responsibility as the president. 

504
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,780
 Hey. Don't you feel resentful? People are blaming you. 

505
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,450
 I don't mind. 

506
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,490
 No matter what people think of me, I only care about you. 

507
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,840
 As long as you care for me. 

508
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,710
 Hey! You must be crazy. 

509
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,720
 How could you say such a thing 

510
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,050
 with a straight face? 

511
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,450
 Wait up! 

512
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,710
You're the same.

513
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,750
- What? 
 - You're hopeless.

514
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,710
Wow, you hold a grudge.

515
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,620
I didn't make a restaurant reservation, but I'm not totally hopeless.

516
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,060
I had no idea we'd run into the teachers there.

517
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,330
What were you going to do on a date with me?

518
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:01,630
Well, eat, drink...

519
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,630
Talk about our lives.

520
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,190
Sounds fun.

521
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,900
Tell me about your life already.

522
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,230
So, you got an exemption from serving in the military.

523
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,300
I tore my cruciate ligament while playing soccer in college.

524
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,760
You and your soccer...

525
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,960
We only talked about me.

526
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,130
Is there anything you want to know?

527
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,390
Did you ever miss me?

528
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,930
Even once?

529
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,660
I did.

530
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,540
There was a time

531
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,410
I wanted to see you one last time

532
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,270
and punch you in the back of your head as hard as I could.

533
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,170
Well, so you did miss me.

534
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,770
I ate too much.

535
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,560
Are you drunk?

536
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,370
Yes.

537
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:19,050
- But you're drinking beer. 
 - Beer washes it all down.

538
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,550
What are you doing?

539
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,720
I'm not trying to pull anything. All pharmacies are closed now.

540
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Back in the day, you used to get better with this.

541
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,790
That's when I was a kid. Folk remedies don't work anymore.

542
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,210
You never know.

543
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,500
You're funny.

544
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,260
Seok Ji Won, you and I...

545
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,520
How strange that we know one-half of each others' lives,

546
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,470
but we have no idea about the other half.

547
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,050
I do have some ideas.

548
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,340
You could've punched me in the back of my head

549
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,700
when I was running, carrying you on my back.

550
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,970
â™«  I'll be all right  â™«

551
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,420
What a shame.

552
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,450
â™«  No need to worry  â™«

553
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:56,420
â™«  It'll be okay once time passes  â™«

554
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:05,280
â™«  At first, your cruel words  â™«

555
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,230
â™«  They grip me and make me stay there so badly  â™«

556
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,050
â™«  Day after day, night after night  â™«

557
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,990
â™«  I thought I would be all right any time  â™«

558
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:27,700
â™«  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  â™«

559
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,790
â™«  In case your heart from the past wanders in pain  â™«

560
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:43,600
â™«  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  â™«

561
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
â™«  Always by your side  â™«

562
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,530
There are mosquitos already.

563
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,650
 Wait for me. 

564
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,900
Mr. Gong, you're mad at me, aren't you?

565
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,210
I'm salty, not mad.

566
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,630
What?

567
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,050
The more I think about it, the more I realize I have no right to be mad.

568
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,260
But since I do feel something, I'm salty.

569
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,040
You heard. Yesterday...

570
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,310
Don't do that, Miss.

571
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:54,910
It's my problem that I like you, so you shouldn't be sorry.

572
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,890
I'm already so embarrassed that I'm salty.

573
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,770
If you apologize to me for that, I would feel too pathetic.

574
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,550
If you really feel bad, let's go out for tonkatsu during lunch.

575
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,110
Are you using your wish?

576
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,830
No, this is a plea, not a wish.

577
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,670
In that case, I reject it.

578
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,630
The reports you requested.

579
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,540
Dokmok Ecological Destruction Report and Population Reduction Modeling

580
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,710
and Risk Assessment of Water Pollution and Resource Depletion. And...

581
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,590
Why are you reviewing these?

582
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,860
I just need to.

583
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,930
I see. These have been legally finalized by the company.

584
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,750
You know, right?

585
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,200
Leave it.

586
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,840
The thing you said earlier about how MZs ask for the other person's opinion.

587
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,310
- You learned all that on the internet, didn't you? 
 - Sorry?

588
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:09,920
Never give me dating advice again.

589
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,770
Did your date go wrong?

590
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,200
- I want to be alone. 
 - Okay.

591
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,070
Did you ask first for her opinion?

592
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,510
- Hurry up. 
 - Dad.

593
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,110
I'm hungover from yesterday.

594
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:33,840
You come all the way to school to have me meet someone?

595
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,950
Who?

596
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,270
Gosh, be quiet and follow me.

597
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,620
Seok Gyeong Tae, the father of your old friend, the chairman.

598
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,330
- What? 
 - He came to suck up to me about his golf course.

599
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,000
I heard that his son is single.

600
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,850
You really need to get married.

601
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,550
You should've given me a heads-up.

602
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,010
I'm not even wearing my jacket.

603
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,850
You look pretty. Let's hurry.

604
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,200
- Dad! 
 - You look pretty. It's okay.

605
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,320
Just because he's a city council member, he thinks he can boss me around?

606
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,500
Why does he want me to meet his daughter?

607
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,310
What a shitty manner!

608
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:13,380
Must be tough sucking up to a city council member with shitty manners.

609
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,010
Why don't you just pass through?

610
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,200
Gosh, must be hard, to uproot hometown lands to build a golf course.

611
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,000
I need to do what I need to do.

612
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,220
And what is it that you're holding onto?

613
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,900
Yes, Reporter Park. I'm on my way.

614
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,800
I'll message you when I'm in front of the broadcast station. Yes, yes.

615
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,930
Broadcast station? You're going on a talent show?

616
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:51,470
No, I'm going to share everything about all your hard work of

617
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:56,300
ruining our town on the broadcast. They're very intrigued.

618
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,270
What? You called into the station?

619
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,610
Yes, I did.

620
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,910
You! Seriously?

621
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,280
Don't worry, I'll blur your face.

622
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,330
- How dare you... 
 - Why, why?

623
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,930
Am I irritating you?

624
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,890
- You must be irritated! 
 - Hey!

625
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,700
Hey, you!

626
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,600
Gosh, seriously.

627
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,580
Goodness, CEO Seok.

628
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,160
Gosh, my dear Council Member Cha.

629
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,390
Long time no see.

630
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,700
- This must be your daughter. 
 - My daughter.

631
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,170
- Hello. 
 - So pretty! Let's go inside.

632
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,600
Hye Soo...

633
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,500
Hey.

634
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,270
That crazy transfer student ranked at the top of the class.

635
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,000
Hye Soo's second place. Some kids heard it at the teachers' office.

636
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,570
She came from Daechidong, and she was always at the top of the class.

637
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,720
Did you see Hye Soo's face? I'm too scared to go after her.

638
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,130
Is there something I did wrong, Miss Maeng?

639
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,390
No, I...

640
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,640
I'm just checking.

641
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,410
What?

642
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,790
I can't make stupid jokes with youâ€”

643
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,850
To be exact, I don't want to.

644
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:44,020
Oh, that must be because I crossed the line and said too much.

645
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,570
But you don't care about stuff like that.

646
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,540
I know, but I find myself caring.

647
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,440
What is this?

648
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,960
What's wrong, Hye Soo? Are you sick?

649
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,740
   

650
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,100
Hey, Go Hye Soo!

651
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,000
Hey, Eom Gi Seok.

652
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,040
How dare you scream in the safe space of the School Health Office?

653
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,960
What's with you?

654
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,800
- Come with me. 
 - What?

655
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,880
Let's get out of here.

656
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,760
Eom Gi Seok.

657
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,270
What do you think you're doing?

658
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,250
You follow me.

659
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,190
Where did they go?

660
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,180
Why are you acting like this?

661
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,470
You keep glaring at me. You act mad but won't say a word.

662
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,380
What was your attitude at the School Health Office?

663
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,270
- You really don't know? 
 - I don't. That's why I'm asking.

664
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,260
- What is the problem? 
 - Shit.

665
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,910
I don't know, either. I must like you or something.

666
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,880
What?

667
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,040
I'm into you.

668
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,680
Yeah, I like you.

669
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,600
So,

670
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,790
can't you stop what you're doing with the nurse?

671
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,500
What are you talking about?

672
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,590
Don't do what you're doing with the nurse.

673
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,420
What the hell.

674
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,250
 Of course. 

675
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,100
 How's my Ji Won doing at school? 

676
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,450
 Do you know where Ji Won's staying? 

677
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,950
 He doesn't tell me things, and he rarely comes home. 

678
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:26,210
 Kids are like that. That's why it's important to get them to settle down. 

679
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,230
 Of course, that's the best. 

680
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,920
 Here, have a drink. Okay, okay. 

681
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,980
Director Kim.

682
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,200
Yes, CEO.

683
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,590
So, where is this punk staying?

684
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,140
You scared me.

685
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,740
Aren't you getting a new phone? I'm waiting here because I can't get a hold of you.

686
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,600
Why are you waiting for me when we can meet at home?

687
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,940
It's boring to go home alone. Why? You don't like it?

688
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,710
You think I like it when you scare me like this?

689
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,700
Thank God the blooms are withering.

690
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,330
Gosh, you've been dying for the flowers to die.

691
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:09,600
Are you saying you're bummed?

692
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,000
Once the flowers die, we...

693
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,900
No need to see each other again. A clean break.

694
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,690
   

695
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,170
 The call is not going through. After the beep... 

696
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,890
   

697
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,810
Habitat Destruction and Population Decline of Daeheung Orchids in Dokmok Mountain?

698
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,950
Which side is this bastard on?

699
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,680
Hey, where is that school resident or whatever?

700
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,940
Oh, that's...

701
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,260
I asked you where that is!

702
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,030
I can take care of it.

703
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,930
Grandpa, what are you doing? It's dangerous.

704
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,020
The socket is weird,

705
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,530
and I'm the only one who can swap the bulb out.

706
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,980
What's going on?

707
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,910
He's here to see Grandpa.

708
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,950
Seok Ji Won, you must've gone crazy!

709
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,270
You bastard!

710
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,800
You don't need to go this far.

711
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,530
I don't? What are you doing here?

712
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,660
Did I send you to school for this?

713
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,070
- Father. 
 - And on top of that,

714
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,380
you made a bet to date who?

715
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,040
What? What is he saying?

716
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,810
Grandpa, it's nothing. I'll explain later.

717
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,610
Of course, it's nothing.

718
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,550
But still, how could you spread such a vulgar rumor?

719
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,590
- Stop this. 
 - How dare you tell me to stop?

720
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,390
You should rub shoulders with people at your level.

721
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,190
You...

722
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,660
Step aside.

723
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,120
If you want to see how far I'm willing to go with them,

724
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,150
do whatever you want!

725
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,870
Let's go.

726
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,760
I can't just put it back now, can I?

727
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,490
Can you explain?

728
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,070
Explain what?

729
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,790
In that case...

730
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,830
should I say what I suspect?

731
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,140
I unexpectedly...

732
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,740
Tell me. I'm listening.

733
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,190
Please pretend you didn't see. I'm returning it.

734
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:18,080
It's like nothing happened if I give it back.

735
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,820
Do you really have to go that far with me?

736
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,820
Yoon Ji Won...

737
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
- is your friend. 
 - What?

738
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:34,970
Of course, she is.

739
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,260
Then, don't do that to her.

740
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,650
Yoon Ji Won.

741
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,340
Your friend.

742
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,830
Don't do anything to hurt her.

743
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,610
I did it because of you.

744
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,830
Because I like you.

745
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,050
You know that, too.

746
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,480
So, I'd rather you just yell at me for clinging to you.

747
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,410
Talk about you and me, not Yoon Ji Won.

748
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,690
Am I the one hurting Yoon Ji Won right now?

749
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,370
No.

750
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,250
It's you, Seok Ji Won.

751
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,860
Your home. Your situation. Everything.

752
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,810
It's all poison to Yoon Ji Won.

753
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,110
What you're doing right now...

754
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,710
is hurting Yoon Ji Won the most.

755
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,510
You know that?

756
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:24,040
Are you headed home?

757
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,360
I'm resting.

758
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,080
What stopped you on your way home?

759
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,600
Are you here to see me?

760
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,490
Yes, I was wondering what you're up to.

761
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,320
I was just hanging out.

762
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,620
Did something happen? You look down.

763
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,670
Nothing's going on.

764
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,240
It's because of Seok Ji Won, isn't it?

765
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,410
I don't know what exactly you two are doing

766
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:55,020
behind the guise of the bet...

767
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,650
We're not doing anything.

768
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:04,540
If you're really suffering because of him, be firm with him.

769
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,880
Don't let him drag you around.

770
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,230
- Ji Hye. 
 - I'm not trying to blame you.

771
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:15,390
But you might be giving him hope.

772
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:21,990
 You bastard! Did I send you to school for this? 

773
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,900
Could that be true?

774
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,030
But unfortunately,

775
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,900
I can't do that.

776
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:35,860
- What? 
 - I can't be firm with him.

777
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,130
Why?

778
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,270
Because I like him.

779
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,420
What?

780
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,680
He said he only needed me, and I liked him for that.

781
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,220
He smiled like he meant it.

782
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,780
Like he was on top of the world.

783
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,280
I was eighteen.

784
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,900
How could I have not liked Seok Ji Won?

785
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,570
What are you saying?

786
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:10,920
Are you saying you used to like him, or you still...

787
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,370
He abandoned me then,

788
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:16,130
and I see the end now, too.

789
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,420
But once again,

790
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,670
I like Seok Ji Won.

791
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:28,470
That's where I'm at.

792
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:41,540
This is all pointless.

793
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,130
Look. The flowers died.

794
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,740
Miss Yoon.

795
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,400
What do you want for dinner?

796
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,510
Miss Yoon...

797
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:17,640
Please pretend you didn't see.

798
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,750
That's...

799
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,440
hard for me.

800
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:30,040
You smile, and I'm supposed to pretend I didn't see.

801
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,800
And I have no right to be angry.

802
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:36,460
This is what a crush must be,

803
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,970
but it's hard to control my feelings.

804
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:42,470
Yeah.

805
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,290
I know.

806
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,500
Miss Yoon.

807
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,220
It's okay that you don't like me back.

808
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,730
But...

809
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,320
don't go where there are people...

810
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,030
who hurt you.

811
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:47,560
   

812
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,730
   

813
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,240
   

814
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,490
Go to Yangseo.

815
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,230
Oh, that's...

816
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:23,400
The CEO said to escort you to the Seoul house after your meeting today.

817
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,760
Gi Ha, take me home.

818
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,540
Heading to Yangseo.

819
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,370
   

820
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:02,830
â™«  Looking back  â™«

821
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:10,530
â™«  As we look face to face  â™«

822
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:18,140
â™«  At the end of time that deepens in the distance  â™«

823
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:24,120
â™«  Still, I think of you  â™«

824
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:33,360
â™«  What did I mean to you?  â™«

825
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:40,850
â™«  Just one of the old memories?  â™«

826
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:48,500
â™«  Our memories from the clumsy old days  â™«

827
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:55,050
â™«  They are still as clear as day  â™«

828
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,810
How could you pull such an inappropriate prank?

829
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,290
Sir, Iâ€”

830
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:03,730
Are you making fun of this old man who's had everything taken from him?

831
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:08,980
That's why you treated my granddaughter so poorly, like your father?

832
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:16,150
â™«  Our radiant days  â™«

833
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,590
I'll hold myself back from speaking harshly.

834
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:23,020
Don't hurt my Ji Won.

835
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,360
We'll soon move out of the school residence.

836
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,480
Wait, Sir...

837
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,930
   

838
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,220
   

839
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,120
   

840
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,650
   

841
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,200
â™«  I miss you more than ever  â™«

842
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,150
 Yoon Ji Won, it's me. Call me at this number. 

843
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:21,340
â™«  I will think of you  â™«

844
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,620
â™«  So many seasons pass by  â™«

845
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:30,320
 Ji Won, it's raining. 

846
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,680
â™«  So much time passes by  â™«

847
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,910
â™«  But my heart is still full of you  â™«

848
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:46,100
â™«  Our radiant days  â™«

849
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,800
â™«  Like that warm day  â™«

850
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:57,970
â™«  I wish you were still there  â™«

851
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,160
 You're so mean. 

852
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,890
Why is this here?

853
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,110
 If you want to see how far I'm willing to go with them, 

854
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,790
 do whatever you want! 

855
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,570
 What you're doing right now 

856
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:54,190
 is hurting Yoon Ji Won the most. 

857
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,860
 That's why you treated my granddaughter so poorly, like your father? 

858
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,520
   

859
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:40,640
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the ðŸ’“Friends or Foes TeamðŸ’” @ Viki.com 

860
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,020
 To Seok Ji Won. 

861
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:46,130
 I curse you. 

862
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:49,800
 I hope you have a miserable life. 

863
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,900
â™«  I long for you again today and make my bet on a losing bet  â™«

864
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,390
 I hope you fall down every three steps you take. 

865
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,870
 I hope you don't get into any college of your choice. 

866
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:07,330
 I hope you end up lonely without any friends. 

867
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,320
 I hope you suffer from cold all the time. 

868
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,910
 I keep cursing you, 

869
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,310
 but my anger doesn't go away. 

870
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,330
â™«  Looking for you in the starlight  â™«

871
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:21,230
 To be honest, 

872
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,230
 I just really miss you. 

873
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:28,290
â™«  I run to you and embrace you  â™«

874
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,740
â™«  You're falling me down  â™«

875
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:36,160
â™«  You're raising me up  â™«

876
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,740
â™«  A lot of time has passed and crisscrossed meaninglessly  â™«

877
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,210
 So, one day, 

878
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:48,020
 even as you're carrying all the misfortune in the world, 

879
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,130
 come to me, Seok Ji Won. 

880
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:07,990
â™«  Now, please recognize me  â™«

881
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,970
â™«  As it grows faint  â™«

882
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:20,910
â™«  Grasping onto the fragments of the memories  â™«

883
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,310
Once the flowers died,

884
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,860
you said we wouldn't see each other again.

885
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:31,080
Let's...

886
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,800
Let's stop this.

887
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,500
- Seok Ji Won. 
 - I don't think I can do this.

888
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,070
So, let's forget the bet,

889
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,580
and...

890
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,770
go out with me for real, Yoon Ji Won.

891
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:05,930
â™«  You're letting me down  â™«

892
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:10,330
â™«  Then carrying my mind  â™«

893
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,390
â™«  So much time has passed without you  â™«

894
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:19,890
â™«  Not anymore can't live  â™«

895
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:24,380
â™«  You can count on me from now on  â™«

896
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:31,440
â™«  As I'm moving on, you can come over to my mind  â™«

897
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:41,490
â™«  Now, please recognize me  â™«

898
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:49,180
â™«  As it grows faint  â™«

899
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,880
â™«  Grasping onto the fragments of the memories  â™«

900
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,710
   

901
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,830
 Grandpa hasn't noticed at all. 

902
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:59,240
 I don't show it at all. 

903
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,600
 How far did you run? Your face is bright red. 

904
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,040
 What? Workshop? Seok Ji Won? 

905
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,510
 Want to come down? 

906
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,600
 Something's going on. I have a gut feeling. 

907
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,000
 I'm not interested in getting your permission to date, like, or break up with anyone. 

908
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,540
 You bastard! 

909
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,270
 I like you. 

910
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:19,780
 How come I haven't noticed it until now? 

911
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,890
 Why did you zip up his sweatshirt, Ji Won? 

912
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:26,800
 Miss Yoon Ji Won is dating someone. 

913
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:32,810
â™«  Now, I face you  â™«
