1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,770
   
   

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,740
   
   

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,170
   

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,680
   

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,040
   

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,300
   

7
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,100
I said, date me if the lilacs bloom.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,060
I'm betting on the chairman role.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,380
You better bet something you hate more than death itself.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,900
- Gosh, really... 
 - Why?

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,260
Are you scared of losing?

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,720
Why would I lose? That flower won't bloom.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,190
So, do you want to bet or not?

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,790
Let's do it. Go for it. You think I'm scared?

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,910


16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,470
Miss Yoon.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,250
What?

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,400
Hurry, let's go.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,920
- Be careful. 
 - Hold it, hold it!

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,070
What happened? Are you okay?

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,430
You're a man, and you end up like this with a shot of soju?

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,000
I thought you were just cowardly and petty,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,620
but you're also childish.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,730
Who was the one eager to agree to the childish bet?

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,210
- Are you having fun? 
 - Not sure.

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,500
I think it'll be fun once the tree blooms.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,270
Let's see if it's still fun when you get kicked out before finishing a semester.

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,180
One of us will definitely be having fun.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,280
That's enough.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,800
   

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,770
♫  I won't run away anymore  ♫

32
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,910
   

33
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,170
   

34
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,140
   

35
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,800
   

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,180
   

37
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,740
The chairman is amazing!

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,800
Wow, it happened last night, and our students are already on it. Huh?

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,190
- This is all your fault. 
 - Come on.

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,470
I invited the chairman to staff dinner purely to flirt with him.

41
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,450
Who dared pour cold water on my fragile heart,

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,270
saying she'll date when the flowers bloom?

43
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,790
Flowers, my foot.

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm absolutely sure it won't bloom.

45
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,220
♫  Now, I look at you  ♫

46
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,380
♫  Now, you save me  ♫

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,520
♫  Let go of the hatred  ♫

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,730
♫  Embrace me  ♫

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,500
My endgame is him shamefully stepping down from the chairman seat.

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,200
   
 Hey. 

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,610
 You must have the inauguration ceremony. 

52
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,700
Make it big and fancy. I'll invite the whole town.

53
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,120
 To completely crush Yoon Jae Ho's spirit! 

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,010
 Hey. 

55
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,870
Are you listening? Hey, hey!

56
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,310
Are you listening to me?

57
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,120
Father, I...

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,530
Anyway, get the Administrative Director on the line.

59
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,750
 He's there, right? I know he is. 

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,830
 Put him on. 

61
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,310
Yes, I'm on now, CEO.

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,290
Yes, I understand. Yes.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,720
All you have to do is attend.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,760
We'll prepare everything, Chairman.

65
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,150
Make it as small as possible.

66
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,990
As if we're barely doing it.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,180
I'll do my best.

68
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,890
Miss Yoon, headed to class? The field?

69
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,970
Yes, I'm headed out.

70
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,500
Since it's the fourth-period,

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,950
should the Creative Experience Department have lunch together afterward?

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,530
- We have things to discuss. 
 - Pardon?

73
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,390
If you're on your way to the field,

74
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,670
drop by the school health office

75
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,490
and tell Mr. Hong to come to the cafeteria at lunchtime.

76
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,590
He's not picking up.

77
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,190
Sir, did you take something on again?

78
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,950
Everyone's busy. As if we have time to kill.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,470
But I'm the youngest department head, so I have no choice.

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,640
What is it this time?

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,450
   

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,020
I am not awkward.

83
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm totally fine.

84
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
Miss Yoon, you're here.

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,740
Yes, I'm here.

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,640
Mr. Lee Jae Gyu wanted

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,750
the Creative Experience Department to have lunch together.

88
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,620
Apparently, we took on the chairman's inauguration ceremony or whatever.

89
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,880
Oh, I see.

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,200
What's with these inauguration ceremonies?

91
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,080
Only the teachers get to suffer, right?

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,980
Should we pull that crazy lilac out of the ground?

93
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,680
That's cheating.

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,390
What? No warning at all?

95
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,100
With the door wide open,

96
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,090
I could hear everything and had no chance to give a warning.

97
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,400
"Chairman or whatever"?

98
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,680
Sounds like you have grievances about my inauguration ceremony.

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,980
It's just that I'm worried.

100
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,950
- Worried about me? 
 - You know how it is.

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,470
You'll make a fool out of yourself

102
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,730
when you have to quit shortly after the inauguration ceremony.

103
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,940
I see! You're still thinking about our bet.

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,560
I had forgotten about it.

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,430
- What? 
 - Let's accept the results once we have it.

106
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,500
Don't worry about whether the flower will bloom or not.

107
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,400
Don't spend days thinking about it and don't lose sleep over it.

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,200
I guess you find the stakes too trivial for the bet.

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,690
But I bet something I despise more than death itself.

110
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,230
So, it's hard for me to be cool like you, Chairman.

111
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,790
That's none of my business.

112
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,090
Let's not touch the tree.

113
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,580
That would be cowardly and petty.

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,130
Mr. Hong, I'll get going.

115
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,570
Yes, see you later.

116
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,370
Yes?

117
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,850
Guys, the bell rang. Hurry up and gather.

118
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,310
Today, we'll be learning volleyball.

119
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,250
- Mr. Gong? 
 - Today, we'll learn how to serve.

120
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,430
- What are we learning today? 
 - How to serve!

121
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,770
Types of serves...

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,730
Okay. So, who wants to lead the inauguration ceremony?

123
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,490
Miss Yoon is so good at events like this.

124
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,110
She got good at it because you always make Miss Yoon do it.

125
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,400
You didn't have to go there.

126
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
I'll take this one.

127
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,260
I'll do it with her.

128
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,300
You're our only nurse, so you need to stay in the school health office.

129
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,090
You can't lead events like this.

130
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,410
- But... 
 - I can do it by myself.

131
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,610
Mr. Jang Seung Jo said not to make Miss Su Ah take on more work

132
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,680
because you're preparing for the math competition with Miss Cha Ji Hye starting this week.

133
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,830
He has been acting all high and mighty ever since he became the Math Department head.

134
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,340
What? So, you'd already decided it would be me.

135
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,200
I don't want to do it, either. I'm busy, too.

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,610
I know. Of course, you're busy since the semester just started.

137
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,520
I know it'll be tough to prepare for the inauguration ceremony on top of everything.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,800
I know, but...

139
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,600
Fine!

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,910
This is too much.

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,190
Let me speak to the vice principal again.

142
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,820
Miss Yoon, don't do it.

143
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,770
Don't do it, okay?

144
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,070
What a surprise. I thought he'd push.

145
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,970
The stocks must be doing well today.

146
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,910
Miss.

147
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,730
I'll do it.

148
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,870
Our gym is so old that it always leaks during rain.

149
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,800
And it's like this with a brief shower in the middle of the night.

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,820
So, try not to put things in this area if possible. Got it?

151
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,360
Got it.

152
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,240
You can make fun of me. Or ask me questions.

153
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,030
- Pardon? 
 - The teachers, the students, ladies, the security guards...

154
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,720
They all came by and said their piece.

155
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,450
Feel free to ask about anything you're curious about, Mr. Gong.

156
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,720
The bet from last night?

157
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,120
In that case...

158
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,390
I do have something I'm curious about.

159
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,970
May I ask you?

160
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,430
Shoot. What's the difference between 100 people and 101 asking me?

161
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,800
What?

162
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,860
Want to go off-campus for tonkatsu with me during lunch tomorrow?

163
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,520
- What do you think? 
 - Even if it's on me?

164
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,900
The school lunch is so bad.

165
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,020
I asked, what do you think?

166
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,210
Where are you going, Miss Yoon?

167
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,450
To fix the goalpost.

168
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,300
Father,

169
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,310
you've let this car sit for too long.

170
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,000
Right?

171
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,480
I keep getting more and more scared.

172
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,180
After Ji Won's parents went like that,

173
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,540
I white-knuckled my way through it.

174
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,900
But since last year, I feel nauseous and my vision gets blurry

175
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,430
when I sit in the driver's seat.

176
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,660
I'm thinking of getting rid of it.

177
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,090
Still, you never know when you might need it.

178
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,960
It's running fine.

179
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,070
My Ho Seok has always been good with cars.

180
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,040
But while serving as Head of Finance,

181
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,600
when did you have time to learn about fixing cars?

182
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
A smart kid sure is different.

183
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
It's because Ho Seok taught me well.

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,700
Thank you. I better clean the car for the first time in a while.

185
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,570
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay, thank you.

186
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,580
- Okay, see you. 
 - Yes.

187
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,560
   

188
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,890
   

189
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,380
 Over here! 

190
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,530
Why would a teacher handle all that?

191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,940
Yes.

192
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,970
Do you have a moment?

193
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,550
We never see each other, although we work at the same school.

194
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,100
Unless I come looking for you.

195
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,970
Sorry. I was busy with company matters.

196
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,530
Is that why you said no when I asked you out to dinner?

197
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,270
Sorry.

198
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,410
So, what do you want to say?

199
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm not sure if this is the right place for it.

200
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,740
Just say it. It's okay.

201
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,700
Why did you make such a bet with Yoon Ji Won again?

202
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,980
Why do I need to explain that to you?

203
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,650
After you transferred out of our high school

204
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,150
and started college,

205
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,520
you remember how I tracked you down. Right?

206
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,520
Even after that, I called you on special occasions

207
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,980
and even went to your graduation.

208
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,330
I went to the airport when you left for Dubai.

209
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,330
You did.

210
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,510
Even though I told you many times not to.

211
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,670
Why do you think I stuck around even when you pushed me away?

212
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,560
It's because...

213
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,950
I like you.

214
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,550
Ever since we were in the same class in high school,

215
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,720
I've liked you.

216
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,340
Until now.

217
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,310
Without wavering.

218
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,620
- Ji Hye. 
 - What if the flowers do bloom?

219
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,540
Will you really date her like back in the day?

220
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,770
Back in the day?

221
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,990
I know everything.

222
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,750
Yoon Ji Won and I had no secrets back then.

223
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,280
So, I know this bet is meaningless to you and Yoon Ji Won now.

224
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,520
- But.. 
 - Yoon Ji Won told you about that?

225
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,040
Yes.

226
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,000
How did Yoon Ji Won describe our relationship?

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,450
She said you secretly dated without telling anyone.

228
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,550
Barely three months.

229
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,930
And it ended when you left abruptly.

230
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,740
Barely three months...

231
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,280
And it ended...

232
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,350
Is that really what she said?

233
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,860
Why?

234
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,400
You need something more?

235
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,910
Gosh.

236
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,050
Geez! You scared me.

237
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,650
What's with you?

238
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,710
You.

239
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,210
You?

240
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,020
Yes, you. Yoon Ji Won.

241
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,660
Excuse me.

242
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,440
 How come Miss Yoon Ji Won is that way? 

243
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,810
 I'm not talking behind her back. 

244
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,620
 She needs to know to separate work and life. 

245
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,340
 I understand there's family drama, but... 

246
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,270
 She only thinks... 

247
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,960
Don't you think this is weirder?

248
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,120
I know, but...

249
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,520
 It's inappropriate to get wishy-washy by getting personal feelings involved. 

250
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,120
 Back in my day, I did anything and everything the higher-ups told me to do. 

251
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,030
Vice Principal, you're right. But still...

252
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,560
it's not like Miss Yoon has free time.

253
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,970
She has a lot on her plate.

254
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,770
Gosh, come on.

255
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,480
How much work could a B-level curriculum possibly be?

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,440
 Vice Principal, please don't say that. 

257
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,810
 You like Miss Yoon. 

258
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,300
 You know there's a lot to do in P.E. 

259
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,970
- Come on! 
  - I like her when she shuts up and works obediently. 

260
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,590
Anyway, I'll discuss this with the Head of Academic Affairs.

261
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,700
So you don't have to worry, Vice Principal.

262
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,060
Me? This is not for me or the chairman.

263
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,890
This is to satisfy our CEO.

264
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,820
Let's make it as big, fancy, and grand as he wants.

265
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,920
We need to make sure it's like that.

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,690
 Yes, I know. 

267
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,150
- I'm headed home. 
 - Okay.

268
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,890
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow.

269
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,770
I'm heading out now.

270
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,430
See you.

271
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,680
Aren't you going home?

272
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
I need to work late.

273
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,390
Let's go to the school health office with sandwiches. It's on me.

274
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,630
Miss Maeng, do you like the school health office that much?

275
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,070
You know what? Mr. Hong is sweet to you,

276
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,490
but he's strangely cold to me.

277
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,580
I know. Or I thought I knew.

278
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,700
Not many men dislike me.

279
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,890
It's interesting.

280
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,490
He doesn't like me, but since he's so kind,

281
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,380
he can't get rid of me. It's fun to watch him fidget.

282
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,220
Let me go and torture him. Are you coming?

283
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,970
I'm going home. I'm so tired.

284
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,130
Got it. See you tomorrow.

285
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,730
See you tomorrow.

286
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,460
- Miss Yoon, are you going home? 
 - Yes.

287
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,900
Let me ask you a favor.

288
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,080
A favor?

289
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,710
We're hosting a vice principals' conference at our school tomorrow,

290
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,890
and I'm mortified that all we ever serve are some measly chips.

291
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,100
Vice Principal Kim from Joongang High last time...

292
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,540
Goodness...

293
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,280
He served mangoes.

294
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,840
Please go to town and get some nice fruits.

295
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,210
Don't have them delivered.

296
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:10,020
You know Gyeongsa Fruits, right? Pick them out yourself.

297
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,710
Get plenty and prepare them for tomorrow.

298
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,470
Come on.

299
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,020
This is an official request.

300
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,750
Here.

301
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,680
- Thanks in advance. 
 - Okay.

302
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,460
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

303
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,450
Miss Yoon.

304
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,780
Mr. Gong.

305
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,420
- Where are you headed? 
 - Do you like fruit, Mr. Gong?

306
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,850
I'm a watermelon killer.

307
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,730
I'm eagerly awaiting summer.

308
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,270
Watermelons are so expensive right now because they are out of season.

309
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,920
Watermelon, okay.

310
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,170
What about fruit out of the blue?

311
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,680
Just because. Go home.

312
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,170
Where are you going?

313
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,930
To run an errand for someone.

314
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,700
Errand?

315
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,870
I'm excellent at running errands.

316
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,670
Let's go together. Get on my bike.

317
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,270
It's okay, I'm going to run.

318
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:30,400
♫  Bello, oi ne', o sole mio  ♫

319
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,560
My, what brings you here, Chairman?

320
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,880
Have you had dinner yet?

321
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,080
I will bring in external companies to plan and execute the inauguration ceremony.

322
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,520
Don't involve any admins, teachers, or students.

323
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,140
What do you mean...

324
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,840
Miss Yoon Ji Won can take care of that.

325
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,290
Don't do that. Step back.

326
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay.

327
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,260
But the CEO said to make it big...

328
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,940
I understand.

329
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,240
Do you have fresh fruit?

330
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,950
Yes, we have great fruit.

331
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,170
What would you like?

332
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,870
Give me everything from here to there.

333
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,470
What?

334
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,640
Whoa.

335
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,600
Look at the shiny muscat shining.

336
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,860
Miss, your eyes are shining more brightly.

337
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,610
Please deliver all this to the Dokmok High School faculty room.

338
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,210
Make sure you charge a delivery fee.

339
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,040
Gosh, I'd be grateful.

340
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,170
Here you go.

341
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,870
- Mr. Gong, follow me with this watermelon. 
 - Okay.

342
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,520
Goodbye.

343
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,700
- Thank you. 
 - Yes, thank you.

344
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,190
Miss, where are you going?

345
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,710
Gyeongsang Fruits, seventy-nine...

346
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,350
790,000 won?

347
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

348
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,720
I should be driving.

349
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,210
You said the report is due at 6:00. Focus on that.

350
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,790
Thank you. I'm really almost done.

351
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,420
 Is this the spot... 

352
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,870
 no one ever visits? 

353
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,030
 Yes. 

354
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,540
 Nice, right? You never imagined it'd be here, right? 

355
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,720
 So many people claim they saw a water demon here. 

356
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,330
 People stopped coming here after so many had said that exact thing. 

357
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,280
 You know that, right? 

358
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,700
 Yeah. 

359
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,190
 It's thrilling, and I love it. 

360
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,090
Are you okay?

361
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,320
I can just submit the report later and drive.

362
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,500
Leave it. I like driving.

363
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,220
I was just...

364
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,540
reminiscing about the past.

365
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,540
You mentioned this is your hometown, right?

366
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,600
Are you feeling nostalgic?

367
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,870
Yes, a pond with a demon.

368
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,210
Demon?

369
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,450
Near here?

370
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,520
Yes. Right over there.

371
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,730
Why not check it out instead of just feeling nostalgic?

372
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm not sure if I should visit.

373
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,050
You know what they say.

374
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,290
Better to regret doing it than not doing it at all.

375
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,890
I saw it on the internet.

376
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,150
You really think so?

377
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,580
Regrets are inevitable, but you'll regret it more if you don't try.

378
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,490
Mr. Gong, I told you to leave.

379
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,960
Don't stay and get spooked.

380
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,750
You said water demons live here.

381
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,960
I can't leave you alone here.

382
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,690
I'm fine with them. I've been visiting this spot for 18 years.

383
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,330
They're practically family.

384
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,200
Why do you come to a place like this all by yourself?

385
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,430
People don't come here...

386
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,390
because of the water demons.

387
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,910
How chilly. How nice.

388
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,300
What's nice?

389
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,770
Miss Yoon, can't we just turn around?

390
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,120
Rock, paper, scissors!

391
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,020
Go grab a four-pack of beer for 10,000 won at the supermarket on the way.

392
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,670
Or you could come with me.

393
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,030
Mr. Gong, on your way out,

394
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,710
don't turn around, no matter what sound you hear.

395
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,170
Gosh, Miss Yoon, stop messing with me. Geez...

396
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,220
Hurry up.

397
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,560
That was fast!

398
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,920
You did this at school. You're not stalking me today, are you?

399
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,020
You've been coming here?

400
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,650
Am I not allowed?

401
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,690
What? Your company bought this land, too?

402
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,740
I just casually come when I want to go somewhere and just hang out.

403
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,480
This is not...

404
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,680
just any casual spot for us.

405
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,400
 Why do you like me? 

406
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,820
 Why do you ask after you dumped me? 

407
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,960
 Just curious. 

408
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,520
 You've only known me for a short time, and you barely know me. 

409
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,160
 So, how can you be so sure? 

410
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,050
 I don't know anything about you, and we've only just met. 

411
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,560
 - And you're known for your nasty personality. 
 - What? 

412
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,080
 But I kept thinking about you. 

413
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,950
 From the moment I first saw you. 

414
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,160
 Before I knew it, 

415
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,590
 I was thinking of you more than 3,000 times a day. 

416
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,200
 If this is not a crush, then what is it? 

417
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,190
 YoonJi Won. 

418
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,160
 It's going to rain this weekend. 

419
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,360
 What? 

420
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,170
 Stay home. Don't go out for no reason. 

421
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,390
 Why do you care? 

422
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,790
 Yoon, hurry! 

423
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,740
 I'm coming! 

424
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,840
 I told you. It's going to rain. 

425
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,870
♫  Memories scattering  ♫

426
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,940
 What's with you? 

427
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:57,420
♫  Suddenly, they crept up  ♫

428
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200

 I must be crazy. 

432
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,300
 This guy? Why would I? 

433
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,520
 Since when? For what reason? Why? 

434
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,550
 I... 

435
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,290
 I like you... 

436
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,120
 Yoon Ji Won. 

437
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,410
 How about you? 

438
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,540
 You don't like me? 

439
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,490
 How could I like you? 

440
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,690
 You should've confessed your feelings discreetly. 

441
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,940
 Now, I need to shave my head in front of the whole school. 

442
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,980
 Hey, what you just said... 

443
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,000
 What do you mean by that? 

444
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,860
 What you said just now. 

445
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,370
 What do you think? Hey... 

446
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,170
 L-Let's date. 

447
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,200
 L-Let's date.

 Don't go anywhere dangerous during vacation. 

454
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,190
 We won't! 

455
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,200
 Stay healthy during vacation. 

456
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,530
 Class president. 

457
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,930
 Attention. 

458
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,110
 Bow to the teacher.

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,480

 How long are we going to date secretly? It's a small town. 

471
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,890
 I'm sorry, but my grandpa hates you. 

472
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,430
 He says you take after your grandfather. 

473
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,510
 My dad still tells me not to hang out with you when he gets drunk. 

474
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,000
 See? 

475
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,560
 Also, I'm scared my friends will make fun of me for the rest of my life. 

476
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,820
 - So, don't make it obvious. 
 - I'm not making it obvious. 

477
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,400
 Goodness, is that why you avoided me at school like a loser? 

478
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,220
 To not make it obvious? 

479
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,650
 Yeah. 

480
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,430
 I did well, right? 

481
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,220
 Sure. 

482
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,560
 You did well. 

483
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,880
 Hey, do you want to die? 

484
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,260
 What should we do tomorrow? 

485
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,020
 Library? 

486
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,630
 What? 

487
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,920
 I don't want to go to the library. 

488
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,160
 Where are you going so early, my granddaughter? 

489
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,200
 The library. See you later. 

490
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,910
 Hey. 

491
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,850
 Do you think we're stupid? 

492
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,120
 Let her be. The vacation just started. 

493
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,970
♫  Shining  ♫

494
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,530
♫  Clear skies after the clouds  ♫

495
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,030
♫  The wind tickles me  ♫

496
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:37,350
♫  Things I rarely felt  ♫

497
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,090
 - Yay! 
 - Looks delicious. 

498
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,890
 Peel it for me. 

499
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,450
 Scissors, rock! 

500
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,260
♫  Yellow sunshine rays  ♫

501
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,940
 Come here. 

502
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,800
 Look, the ocean. 

503
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,240
 The ocean! 

504
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,430
 Wow, it's amazing. 

505
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,860
 Look at the ocean... 

506
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,660
 Hey, they're running. 

507
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,540
♫  Walk where your feet leads you  ♫

508
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,230
♫  Breathe into your tired body  ♫

509
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,080
 Hey! 

510
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
 Come here! 

511
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:28,500
♫  Until the sun sets, walk with me  ♫

512
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,880
♫  Tik tok  ♫

513
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,290
♫  I'm fine even though time passes  ♫

514
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,310
 - So delicious. 
 - Is it delicious? 

515
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,360
 Have more of this. 

516
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,280
 Let's share. 

517
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,580
 You got some on your face. 

518
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,710
♫  Getting close to you  ♫

519
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,630
♫  Where will I end up?  ♫

520
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,730
 How many times is this? Do you know when we were supposed to meet? 

521
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,700
 The soccer game hadn't ended. I had no choice. 

522
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,170
 Is soccer more important than a promise you made me? 

523
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,450
 Can't you be understanding? 

524
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,650
 Hey! 

525
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,140
 Pick. Soccer or me? 

526
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,140
 - I mean... 
 - Whoa, you can't answer? Fine. 

527
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,890
 Why don't you date soccer? Don't ever call me again. Got it? 

528
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,550
 Forget you. 

529
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,350
 What? 

530
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,830
 You said never call you again, so I didn't call. 

531
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,940
 Come down. 

532
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
 Wait a bit. 

533
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,010
 Forget about me for soccer one more time, and we're done. 

534
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,360
 I'll just quit soccer this year. 

535
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,060
 I'll just hang with you. 

536
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,330
 You liar. 

537
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,820
 I'll never break a promise again. 

538
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,150
 Hey. You broke a promise, too. You know that? 

539
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,020
 What promise? 

540
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,180
 You were supposed to open your window before I threw three stones. 

541
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,000
 No matter how angry you are. 

542
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,790
 But I threw seven stones today. 

543
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,840
 I almost cried. 

544
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,340
 Next time, open your window on time. 

545
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,450
 Goodness. Why not just avoid messing up in the first place? 

546
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,840
 Promise. 

547
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,680
 Three times. 

548
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,460
 Happy now? 

549
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,260
 What? Why are you smiling? 

550
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,170
 You've gotten prettier since I last saw you. 

551
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,570
 We were only apart for half a day. 

552
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,910
 Anyway, you got prettier. 

553
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,870
 You and your empty words. 

554
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,950
 If I'm so pretty, treat me like I'm pretty. 

555
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,600
 What are you doing? 

556
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,630
 Hey... I'm sorry. 

557
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,900
 I feel so weird. 

558
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,660
 Kissing you is too funny. 

559
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,670
 Forget this. 

560
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,560
 Hey, I'm sorry. 

561
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,630
 I won't laugh. I'm sorry. 

562
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,010
 Come on! 

563
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,940
 I'm going insane. Why is it so funny? 

564
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,630
 Isn't it funny for you? 

565
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,270
 Let's see how long that laugh lasts. 

566
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,260
 Hey. I'm laughing because it's funny. 

567
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,130
♫  Day after day, night after night  ♫

568
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:33,070
♫  I thought I would be all right any time  ♫

569
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:40,800
♫  Holding onto time I couldn't fill  ♫

570
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:48,850
♫  In case your heart wanders in pain  ♫

571
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:55,650
♫  Don't need to worry, babe, I'm the only one to fall down  ♫

572
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,870
♫  Always by your side  ♫

573
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,890
 I'm with the boys. But there's a big problem. 

574
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,290
 What's wrong? 

575
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,610
 I miss you. Where are you? I'll be right there. 

576
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,230
 I'm going home because Grandpa's home alone. Hold back. 

577
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,560
 Who are you texting that you're so giddy? 

578
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,450
 Grandpa. 

579
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,130
 You're acting suspicious. 

580
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,790
 Suspicious? No way. 

581
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,720
 Anyway, we'll hang by the river. You should come, too. 

582
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,590
 I can't. I have to go home... 

583
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,480
 Come on. We haven't hung out all summer. 

584
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,640
 Let's go. You have to come. 

585
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,660
 - Hurry. 
 - I told you my grandpa's home alone. 

586
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,910
 - You didn't come last time, either. 
 - Where are we going? 

587
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,040
 - Hey! 
 - Over there. 

588
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,680
 Hey. 

589
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,590
 Oh, Yoon Ji Won! 

590
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,700
 How come it's been so hard to see your face this summer? 

591
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,080
 She didn't want to come here, either. I had to drag her. 

592
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,320
 How have you been? 

593
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,070
 It's about time you asked that. We go back to school tomorrow. 

594
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,110
 You're here too, Ddol. 

595
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,640
 Yeah. 

596
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,190
 Goodness. You can't make eye contact with Big Sis at all. 

597
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,970
 What? You didn't meet up at all this summer? 

598
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,360
 We can see each other once school starts. 

599
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,840
 You're acting so awkward ever since you made that weird bet. 

600
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,750
 Gosh, I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry? 

601
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,540
 Let's eat ramen. Everyone brought ingredients, right? 

602
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,230
 Yeah. 

603
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,040
 You were supposed to bring ramen. 

604
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,110
 - I thought it was kimchi. 
 - Seriously! 

605
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,360
 Are you out of your mind? The supermarket is so far away. 

606
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,150
 But Ji Won's kimchi is very tasty. 

607
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,120
 Hey, I'll go get it. 

608
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,230
 Ten? Is ten enough? 

609
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,590
 Big Sis, you're so cool. 

610
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,210
 See you. 

611
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,410
 - Go with her. 
 - Huh? 

612
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,500
 Yeah, go with Big Sis and make up. Hurry up. 

613
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,530
 - It's okay. I'll— 
 - Fine. 

614
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,260
 I'm going because you're forcing me to. 

615
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,350
 - Hurry up! 
 - Geez, that idiot. 

616
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,100
 - Goodbye. 
 - Getting prettier. 

617
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,380
 Senior, this... 

618
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,900
 What's this? 

619
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,940
 I like you. 

620
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,250
 I made this chocolate myself. Try it. 

621
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,860
 Make sure you read it. 

622
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,670
 How did she know you were here? 

623
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,200
 She's a friend of a junior I know. 

624
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,250
 That junior called me asking where I was, and I told him. 

625
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,060
 How devoted of her. 

626
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,970
 You were grinning ear to ear. 

627
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,520
 I said it was nothing. 

628
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,430
 What could I have done when she gave it to me? 

629
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,640
 You could've rejected the gift. 

630
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,460
 She's a freshman. I couldn't reject her outright. 

631
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,090
 I told her I couldn't return her feelings. 

632
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,570
 That's not rejection. That's giving her hope. 

633
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,980
 Then, should I have said I'm dating you? Tell her? 

634
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,450
 You petty jerk. 

635
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,970
 I hope all your teeth fall out after you eat all the chocolate. 

636
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,110
 That's enough. 

637
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,180
 I said it's nothing, and you still don't trust me. 

638
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,830
 Enough? I saw it all. 

639
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,540
 You make it hard to trust you. 

640
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,240
 Shit. 

641
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,790
 "Shit"? 

642
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,020
 Hey. 

643
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,380
 Don't ever call me again. 

644
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,020
 I'm not just saying this. 

645
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,870
 For real. Don't ever call me again. 

646
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,100
 Don't you know how much that mountain you want to level means? 

647
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,060
 When you were born and grew up in this town? 

648
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,560
 It's time to give up, Gyeong Tae. 

649
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,360
 You'll regret... 

650
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,250
 insulting me like this someday, Chairman. 

651
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,930
 - Gyeong Tae. 
 - I'll make sure you regret it! 

652
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,400
 Get in, guardian. 

653
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,610
 He hasn't called you, either? 

654
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,660
 My mom said Ahjussi had been transferred to a hospital in Seoul. 

655
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,010
 The company closed down, too. 

656
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:04,520
 Apparently, no one can reach anyone in that family. 

657
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,060
 But still, how could he cut us off like this? 

658
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,750
 I can't believe Seok Ji Won. 

659
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,010
 - Please pick up... 
 - The call is not going through. After the beep... 

660
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,720
 Are you still sleeping? 

661
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,040
 Ji Won. 

662
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,630
 Ji Won? 

663
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,660
 Honey! 

664
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,160
 Honey! 

665
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,670
 What's wrong with her? Ji Won. 

666
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,830
 Honey! 

667
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:29,020
   

668
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,080
   

669
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,160
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

670
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,320
 After the beep... 

671
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,400
 I'm heading out. 

672
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,500
 It's your birthday today, so don't study late. 

673
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,860
 So, we can have dinner together. 

674
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,370
 Okay. 

675
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,970
 - Have a good day. 
 - Okay. 

676
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,540
 It's cloudy skies above the whole country, 

677
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,650
 and we expect first snow in certain areas in Seoul. 

678
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,430
 Starting in the afternoon, the snow... 

679
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,780
 I hope it snows here today, too. 

680
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,040
 Right? We're right by Seoul. 

681
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,290
 Could it snow? 

682
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:00,770
 - Look at the clouds... 
 - Wishing you safe drive... 

683
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,830
 Tomorrow, Busan and Jeju Island... 

684
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,650
 So, I'm saying... 

685
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:09,070
 we just don't have to break up. Why hypothesize? 

686
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,780
 I said, "In the unlikely event." 

687
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,400
 In the unlikely event we break up, 

688
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,920
 let's meet at the Namsan Mountain Observatory on the day of the first snow. 

689
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,730
 - Why? 
 - It's romantic. 

690
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:26,820
 Us breaking up is? 

691
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,340
 No, not that. 

692
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,760
 I'm never breaking up with you. 

693
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,820
 Fine, got it. 

694
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,470
 Let's never break up, then. Let's be together for the rest of our lives. 

695
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,980
 When we go to college in Seoul, 

696
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,140
 let's go and put up a lock up there. 

697
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,880
 That's a little childish. 

698
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,550
 Hey, are you upset? 

699
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,690
 Stop it. 

700
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,540
 I hope winter comes soon. 

701
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,010
 When will the first snow fall? 

702
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,820
   

703
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,170
 Our birthdays are in winter. Why are you asking about a gift so early? 

704
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:36,210
 It's only four and a half months out. What do you want? 

705
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,440
 - Cash. 
 - What? 

706
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,550
 A scarf, then. 

707
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,180
 Fine. 

708
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,530
 Knit it yourself. 

709
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,500
 Got it? 

710
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,860
 Knit a red one for me. 

711
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,530
 Then, fold a thousand cranes for me. 

712
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,190
 Deal! 

713
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,050
 What's wrong with her? 

714
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,090
 What's wrong with him? You promised. 

715
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,360
 I did promise, but... 

716
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,340
 In red! 

717
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,930
   

718
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,160
 Yoon Ji Won, please... 

719
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:47,990
♫  I long for you again today and make my bet on a losing bet  ♫

720
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:52,390
♫  Saying that flower will bloom  ♫

721
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:03,250
♫  In the depths of my heart, the star far away  ♫

722
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,640
♫  The star far away shines brightly  ♫

723
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:15,110
♫  Looking for you in the starlight  ♫

724
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,880
♫  I run to you and embrace you  ♫

725
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,410
♫  You're falling me down  ♫

726
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:28,890
♫  You're raising me up  ♫

727
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:35,020
♫  A lot of time has passed and crisscrossed meaninglessly  ♫

728
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,500
♫  Can't live without you  ♫

729
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,880
♫  Can't be proud of me from now on  ♫

730
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:50,070
♫  I'm just wondering about you, and you're wondering about me  ♫

731
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,510
♫  Now  ♫

732
00:57:53,510 --> 00:58:02,310
♫  Please recognize me  ♫

733
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:07,590
♫  As it grows faint  ♫

734
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:13,850
♫  Holding onto the letter full of memories  ♫

735
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:17,360
♫  You're letting me down  ♫

736
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,740
♫  I'm carrying more  ♫

737
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,800
♫  So much time has passed without you  ♫

738
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,330
♫  Not anymore, can't live  ♫

739
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:35,830
♫  Can't count on me from now on  ♫

740
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:42,870
♫  As I'm moving on, you can come over to my mind  ♫

741
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:46,470
♫  Now  ♫

742
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:54,720
♫  I face you today  ♫

743
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,280
♫  Today, I see you  ♫

744
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:10,500
♫  And I won the bet, the flower has bloomed  ♫

745
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,680
- Don't look at me with those eyes. 
 - What eyes?

746
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,640
Like I wronged you in some way, Chairman.

747
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,750
Don't look at me like you're hurt somehow.

748
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,270
Thanks to you, I'm enduring through

749
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:35,840
gossip, and people assume I have no work-life boundary.

750
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,220
- That's... 
 - I'll plan the inauguration ceremony. Sure, I will.

751
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,850
I'll take care of it since I'm the school errand girl. What the hell.

752
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,420
Why are you bringing up the inauguration ceremony right now?

753
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,880
I want to show them.

754
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,780
It's not like we live in the Joseon Dynasty.

755
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,970
It's laughable that we're talking about family rivalry.

756
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:56,710
So, there's nothing uneasy between you and me.

757
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:59,050
No matter how dirty and unfair the school is,

758
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:02,180
I'll take the paycheck and keep doing my job.

759
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,970
Even if it makes me want to die, I'll see your face if I have to.

760
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,930
Just like that...

761
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:11,750
I want to show you I'm doing well regardless of you. Got it?

762
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,560
- Is that right? 
 - Yes.

763
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,360
Sounds good, then.

764
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,540
I have no reason to refuse.

765
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,360
Damn!

766
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,140
 How did Yoon Ji Won describe our relationship? 

767
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,470
 She said you secretly dated without telling anyone. 

768
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:03,980
 Barely three months. 

769
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,440
 And it ended when you left abruptly. 

770
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,230
 Miss Yoon! 

771
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,060
That took a while.

772
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,070
- Here. 
 - What about yours?

773
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,180
I got this.

774
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,050
Cheers.

775
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,800
 Barely three months... And it ended... 

776
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,360
 Is that really what she said? 

777
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,850
 Why? You need something more? 

778
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,320
 And you still came to me, knowing all this? 

779
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,320
 That's... 

780
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:12,930
 how much I liked you. 

781
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,790
 So, 

782
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,490
 I hope you can take me seriously now. 

783
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,260
 Even if you reject me, don't do it now. 

784
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,390
 Take your time... 

785
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,230
 to worry about it... 

786
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,340
 and be uneasy around me. 

787
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,860
 Consider me. 

788
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,600
 Are you awake? Are you okay? 

789
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,180
 Give me... 

790
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:05,650
 my phone. It's on my desk. 

791
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,150
 Thank you. 

792
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,580
 What's up with you these days? 

793
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,470
 You're not eating and not studying. 

794
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,890
 You don't smile, either. 

795
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,460
 He won't call me. 

796
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:35,060
 He must be mad at me. 

797
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:40,880
 The last thing I said to him was never to call me again. 

798
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,120
 Never call me again... 

799
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,530
 Who are you talking about right now? 

800
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,200
 I miss him so much, 

801
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,010
 but he won't call me. 

802
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,800
 Seok Ji Won... 

803
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,950
 He must hate me now. 

804
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,800
 He must hate me over what happened because of my family. 

805
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,590
 Seok Ji Won? 

806
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,980
 What do I do, Ji Hye? 

807
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,030
 I miss him so much... 

808
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,550
   

809
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,910
   

810
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,270
 Ji Won. 

811
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,180
 Yoon Ji Won, it's me. Call this number. 

812
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,040
 I told you never to contact me again. 

813
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,980
   

814
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,770
   

815
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,350
Miss Yoon, you downed three beers in two minutes.

816
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,680
I used to be able to do it in a minute.

817
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,620
What? A minute?

818
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,540
Let's go. The sun's coming down.

819
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,250
Yes.

820
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,560
Miss Yoon, it's dangerous over there. Come here.

821
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:29,220


822
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:38,100
♫  I won't run away anymore  ♫

823
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:46,500
♫  Have you also been waiting for me?  ♫

824
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:51,200
♫  Although I have changed a lot  ♫

825
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,800
   

826
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:02,460
♫  But our hearts are still the same  ♫

827
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,420
♫  Could this be a mere passing connection?  ♫

828
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,900
♫  If this turns out not to be love  ♫

829
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:20,420
♫  I know you won't ever come back to me  ♫

830
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,120
♫  Now, I look at you  ♫

831
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,550
 The ideas are so boring that I almost fell asleep. 

832
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:26,840
 Try again. 

833
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,970
 Why are you planning his inauguration ceremony? 

834
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,610
 - Why did you volunteer? 
 - I don't know. 

835
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,480
 He says he doesn't want it but cares about the ceremony most. 

836
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,880
 How despicable. 

837
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,370
 Hello. Good morning? 

838
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:41,430
 Did the student teacher have to sleep at your house? 

839
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,770
 If you like someone despite the hard times, that means you really like them. 

840
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,860
 - It feels like fate. 
 - Fate? 

841
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,070
 Miss Yoon begged to take on the inauguration ceremony. 

842
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,090
 I changed my mind.
