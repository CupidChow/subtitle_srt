Go on in and get some rest.
I'll stay here.

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,815
I heard you've gone against my words
and proceeded with the business.

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,089
Mother, if you're still upset with me...

6
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,125
The village you're running
your business in

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,455
is the hometown of your father's mistress.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,725
- What?
- I know.

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,965
You may not see what the problem is.

10

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,575
No, Mother.

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,305
I had no idea.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,515
I guess I thought

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,215
I'd be able to forget about that time
if that village disappeared.

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,025
That's why I didn't like
you running your business there.

16

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,209

Your grandfather will wake up.

25

He's not that weak.

26
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,715
He would be outraged to find out
that we were waiting by his side.

27

Yes, Mother. Let's go.

No, thank you.

151

I'm...

155
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,895
Actually, I'm in no relations
with the Yu-jin who has found her memory.

156
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,965
So you don't have to worry about us.

157
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,165
I'll be honest with you

158
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,135

He's a worker at a security company

161
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,049
I had requested to find Yu-jin.

162
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,175
What?

163
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,519
Why did he...

164
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,885
I guess he had another client.

165
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,215
The conditions to kill her

166
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,955
must've been more appealing
than to find her.

167
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,495
Can you think of someone
who would possibly do that?

168
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,535

Mr. Lim Chul-yong?

171
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,175
If he's behind this,

172
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,685
why is he trying to kill Yu-jin?

173
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,155
It'll take all night to explain that.

174
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,799
This place will be too dangerous to stay
once they find out

175

that their plans have fallen short.

176
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,869
We have to leave here now...

177

Leaving at this late hour
sounds more dangerous.

178
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,735
Anyway, since the hours are
too late right now,

179
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,035
why don't you sleep here for tonight

180
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,375
and head out tomorrow after breakfast?

181
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,125
[ How many times
do I have to repeat myself? ]

182
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,165
I did it by myself!

183
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,965
Gosh, if you keep lying,

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,269
you're going to be in big trouble.

185
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,309
Goodness.

186
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,835
I know your boss ordered you to do it.

187
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,049
I'm talking about that man
who's your senior, Mr. Park.

188
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,275
Hey, that's extreme speculation.

189
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,315
[ Goodness. ]

190
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,685
Do you have evidence? I know you don't.

191
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,655
Evidence?

192
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,925
Of course, I do.

193
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,535
[ When are you going to attack? ]

194
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,135
[ At night when people are gone
and they close the restaurant. ]

195
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,205
[ Should I stab her
and burn her like last time? ]

196
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,375
[ They closed the restaurant.
I'll call you again later. ]

197
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,485
Goodness.

198
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,885
You were going to stab her

199
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,725
and burn her? How scary is that?

200
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,665
Are you still going to play dumb on me?

201
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,965
Are you?

202
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,165
Gosh, how come I'm not hearing
anything from him?

203
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,675
Hey, call him.

204
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,379
He might be working right now. What if...

205
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,545
Gosh.

206
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,445
[ Oh Jung-tae ]

Where are you?

210
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,069
What? Who are you?

211
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,199
[ Me? ]

212
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,065
We've met once before.

213
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,569
[ We've met at Mr. Park's desk last time. ]

214
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,405
I'm Officer Jo
from Nonyang Police Station.

215
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,579
I'm going to the village today
to see my father.

216
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,975
I can guide you there.

217
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,705
Darn it!

218
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,749
- Turn off the phone, hurry!
- Excuse me?

219
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,189
Jung-tae got caught.

220
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,219
- Really?
- Yes!

221
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,489
I'll take care of things here.

222
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,715
You go out and get the car!

223
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,595
How did you end up being here?

224
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,069
What's your relationship with...

225
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,135
I'd like to ask that question to you.

226
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,375
How did things end up like this?

227
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,405
What?

228
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,715
I put on a show
without even knowing about it.

229
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,215
I was just trying to save you
and Belle Ombre.

230
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,689
- It was inevitable.
- And that's how

231
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,629
you lost Belle Ombre?

232
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,025
To that fake?

233
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,895
Do you know what your flaw is?

234
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,129
You're too desperate.

235
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,695
That's why you're always
being dragged around.

236
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,235
Belle Ombre isn't going to disappear
by not doing one show.

237
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,079
How could you be so impatient

238
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,075
and think of doing a show with that fake?

239
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,905
I'm baffled.

240
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,249
What about you?

241
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,785
Can't you think of it as a consequence
of not keeping in touch?

242
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,549
You should've told me

243
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,019
why you were going to Korea
and whom you were meeting.

244
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,229
Why do you always have to do things
so selfishly?

245
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,725
Forget it.

246
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,299
Goodness.

247
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,155
So my boutique

248
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,065
is opening this weekend?

249
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,595
Yes.

250
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,465
Why do you ask? What are you going to do?

251
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,105
What do you think?

252
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,505
I have to get back

253
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,805

254
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,605
[ Sorry I left without saying goodbye. ]

255
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,745
[ Thank you for everything, Chef Moon. ]

[ Thank you for everything, Chef Moon. ]

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,135
[ I thought I wouldn't be able to leave
if I had seen your face. ]

259
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,075
[ So I'm saying goodbye
through the letter instead. ]

260
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,205
[ This place was my grandfather's place. ]

261
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,445
[ Maybe that's why it was so cozy here. ]

262
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,685
[ I think I will never be able to forget ]

263

[ after much time has passed. ]

268

[ Please say goodbye for me
to the people in the village. ]

269

Pace yourself.

274
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,515
Drinks should be enjoyed
and appreciated, too.

275
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,685
This is just my second glass.

276
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,025
- You don't drink well, do you?
- Me?

277
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,295
Just take care of yourself after.

278
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,565
I don't plan on looking out for you.

279
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,595
- Fine.
- Fine.

280
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,255
[ So you're saying, you're in love? ]

281
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,425
[ Don't say that in front of your dad,
okay? ]

282
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,555
- Great work, Byeol-na.
- Right?

283
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,225
I'm telling you, I'm this good.

284

- I was just drawing

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,425
- Really?
- Yes.

294
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,355
Tell everyone
that they should be prepared.

295
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,305

- Good morning.
- You are up early.

299

Are you wearing matching clothes?

300
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,069
I went downtown last night with Mom
and bought these.

301
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,165
- So put these on.
- Why?

302
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,339
They are really expensive.

303
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,809
Be careful not to spill kimchi juice
on it. That will be a disaster.

304
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,145
She's right.

305
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,949
You've got to show respect
to Designer Bella's clothing.

306

Are these clothes so great?

307
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,945
Come to think of it, she's right.

308
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,189
We must treat these clothes better.

309
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,089
The famous designer, Bella, made it.
We must treat them nicely.

[ She's right. ]

312

So we have been hanging out
with a world-famous designer, Bella.

313
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,165
- Yes.
[ - What do you mean by, "hang out"? ]

314
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,865
I even got

315
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,165
special lessons
from the famous designer, Bella.

316
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,235
[ - Goodness. ]
- Gosh.

317
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,245
Is Bella still asleep?

318
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,885
The sun is high up.
Why haven't you come to work yet?

319
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,489
Should I go and bring her?

320
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,189
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

321
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,559
Bella went to Seoul.

322
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,985
- What?
- What?

323
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,255
She left.

324
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,025
[ What did you say? ]

325
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,995
What did you just say?
Is she not coming back?

326
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,135
[ How could she leave like that
without saying anything? ]

327
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,105
She wouldn't do that to me.

328
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,845
I want to go to her.

329
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,545
[ You're not going anywhere! ]

330
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,215

332
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,395
She got her memories back
and found her real family.

333
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,495
You should be happy for her.

334
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,499
But we are her family.

335
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,669
[ We are her family too. ]

336
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,799
How could she leave like that

without saying anything?

338
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,575
- Seol-a.
- This is just unfair!

339
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,575
She's right.

340
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,219
Even if she got her memories back,

341
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,515
[ it's just rude that she left
without saying goodbye to us. ]

342
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,245
What a cold woman.

343
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,985
It's not like we were going to stop her.

344
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,685
[ Come on. Don't be like that. ]

345
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,355
Of course she can't walk around
the whole village in the early morning

346
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,395
and tell everyone that she's leaving.

347
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,805

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,669
I'm sorry to have you go through
all this trouble.

539
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,035
No worries.

540
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,935
A close friend of mine owns the place.

541
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,809
If Bella hasn't eaten anything,

542
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,249
of course I'd help.

543
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,105
We're a team now.

544
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,015
Thank you.

545
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,685
Let's head inside.

546
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,815
Ms. Jang...

547
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,585
Actually...

548
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,595
I see.

549
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,445
I knew it was you as soon
as I saw the porridge.

550
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,345
I knew you cooked it.

551
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,815
I guess I'm busted.

552
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,055
Had I not lost my memories,

553
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,825
the time we spent together

554
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,125
wouldn't have happened.

555
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,939
[ I'm anorexic, so I can't eat properly, ]

556
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,165
and I'm very sensitive,

557
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,435
so I can never live
with other people like that,

558
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,745
especially in a tiny village like that.

559
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,075
The person that you knew was

560
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,175
Yoo Byeol-na.

561
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,285
That's not Yoo Yu-jin.

562
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,755
Had you gotten to know Yu-jin first,

563
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,825
I would've broken your heart
multiple times.

564
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,925
See?

565
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,535
You're hurt now.

566
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,035
I'm glad that I got to know
Byeol-na first, then.

567
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,545
I'm fine,

568
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,115
[ so Byeol-na, ]

569
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,685
no, Yu-jin,

570
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,815
I'm just happy

571
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,455
that your memory came back.

572
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,255
Thank you for the porridge.

573
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,949
Pungcheonok is closed today.

574
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,285
Is that you, Mr. Hwang?

575
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,215
- What?
- Haven't you heard?

576
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,589
Are you deaf?

577
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,889
Mr. Hong is with the provincial governor

578
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,095
and they're on their way there!

579
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,039
- Gosh, Da-hoon!
- What do we do?

580
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,769
- We need to hurry!
- What should we do first?

581
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,269
What do you need us to do first?

582
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,709
Let me help!

583
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,075
I don't know...

584
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,049
- Say something!
- Why don't we...

585
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,375
Wait!

586
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,919
Let's get changed first.

587
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,485
- That's a great idea.
- Let's go!

588
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,519
Welcome to

589
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,489
- Pungcheonok!
- Pungcheonok!

590
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,615
[ - Thank you. ]
- Sir.

591
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,525
This is the famous restaurant
that I've been telling you about.

592
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,195
Pungcheonok, that's a great name.

593
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,035
- We're ready to order.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,165
Can someone take the order here?

595
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,435
[ Everything on the menu is good. ]

596
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,575
The chef here is a world-renowned chef.

597
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,345
Then we'll have to see how good he is.

598
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,515
[ - We'll go with a course meal.
- I knew it. ]

599
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,715
That's an excellent choice.

600
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,559
I'll need at least 30 minutes
to get there,

601
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,195
so until then, start with the appetizer
and take as much time as you can.

602
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,449
This is omija.

603
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,979
Omija is an excellent fruit
with five flavors and scents,

604
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,319
perfect for
health and wellness trends nowadays.

605
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,385
They're best grown in cool weather.

606
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,485
Sorry, I'm getting nervous.

607
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,625
This is a salad made
with apples from Jungnyeong.

608
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,765
They're very sweet as they've been grown
high up in the mountains.

609
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,369
And the salad dressing is
a house special sauce,

610
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,395
so you'll be amazed at the flavors.

611
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,205
Here.

612
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,735
This is

613
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,909
pickled garlic

614
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,409
[ made with garlic grown here in Nonyang. ]

615
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,479
Let me tell you a secret.

616
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,775
This garlic isn't just a vegetable,
but a medicine.

617
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,519
[ You know how in the old tales, ]

618
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,089
the bear becomes human
after eating garlic?

619
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,655
That garlic is from Nonyang!

620
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,295
Quick!

621
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,159
Please prepare the broth.

622
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,859
Mushroom, shrimp, tofu, green onion,
deodeok, and tteok-galbi. Let's go.

623
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,755
Yes, Chef.

624
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,965
- Please keep stirring it.
- Yes, Chef.

625
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,409
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

626
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,535
[ - Good work! ]
- Good work, Chef Moon.

627
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,045
Finally!

628
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,345
This looks scrumptious.

629
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,085
- Enjoy!
- Yes.

630
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,385
Let's dig in.

631
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,095
Yes!

632
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,735
Gosh.

633
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:45,175
They're really enjoying it.

634
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,445
Get home safely.

635
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,105
The food was excellent.

636
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,175
Let's go.

637
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,529
Chef Moon, I'll give whatever support
that I can,

638
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,825
so please do your best.

639
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,425
Thank you, sir.

640
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,665
- Good work.
- Good work.

641
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,175
- Let's head inside.
- Let's go.

642
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:23,749
Officer Jo?

643
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,079
I just got a call
from National Forensic Service

644
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,149
and the blood found
in the fake registered car

645
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,559
[ matches with Oh Jung-tae's DNA, ]

646
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,455
[ the man who was caught
in front of your house. ]

647
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,855
That means

648
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,199
that Mr. Jin, Mr. Park's senior,

649
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,825
and Jung-tae are on one team.

650
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,269
[ I found it out. ]

651
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,435
- Mr. Jin?
[ - Yes! ]

652
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,105
I've requested the police in Seoul
to investigate the matter further,

653
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,905
so they'll get caught for sure.
Don't worry.

654

01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,175
[ There's a broadcasting company here
that we haven't invited. ]

657
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,485
Who called them?

658
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,785
I asked about it,
and apparently, Ms. Han did.

659
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,465
What is happening?

660
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,995
Things aren't looking good.

661
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,275
Chairman Louis is coming from France

662
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,835
and he called a broadcasting company
to the boutique.

663
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,445
But the bigger issue is
that there are two outfits

664
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,485
being displayed for the opening.

665
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,455
Explain properly!

666
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,055
Well,

667
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,685
the reason Sun-young called
Chairman Louis here is...

668
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,969
- Find a way to stop him from coming.
- But there's no way.

669
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,195
Find a way no matter what!

670
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,405
