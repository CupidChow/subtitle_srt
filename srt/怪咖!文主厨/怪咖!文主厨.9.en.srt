(Episode 9)

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,165
Seung-mo!

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,965
Let's get out.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,545
It's okay, come on out.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,045
Come here. It's okay, Seol-ah. Here.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,455
<i>Seol-ah.</i>

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,955
<i>Yes?</i>

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,075
<i>Seol-ah, if something happens to me,</i>

10
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,805
<i>you have to go find him.</i>

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,845
<i>He's your father.
He runs a big restaurant in Seoul.</i>

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,015
<i>My father?</i>

13
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,726
<i>Star Chef's Restaurant</i>

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,355
<i>Seol-ah.</i>

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,325
<i>Aren't you hungry?</i>

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,565
<i>When will my grandpa
go to the hospital?</i>

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,305
<i>I think he should go pretty soon.</i>

18
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,505
<i>I have a favor to ask you.</i>

19
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,475
<i>You will help me, right?</i>

20
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,755
<i>Take me to my father in Seoul.</i>

21
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,995
<i>Rice Soup Restaurant, Pungcheonok</i>

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,335
<i>Hello?</i>

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,865
<i>What? Ms. Park is
in critical condition?</i>

24
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,305
<i>I'll try to get back
as soon as possible.</i>

25
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,815
<i>But I can't go right now.</i>

26
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,345
<i>Thank you.</i>

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,645
Seol-ah, let's go.

28
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,375
<i>I'm teaching you everything that I know</i>

29
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,975
<i>because I have accepted you as my son.</i>

30
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,045
<i>Did you get that?</i>

31
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,315
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

32
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,735
<i>- Put one more log in there.
- Yes, sir.</i>

33
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,859
<i>It's good. It came out nicely.
Now, wrap it up.</i>

34
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,965
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

35
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,875
Come this way.

36
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,249
Where are you going?

37
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,415
Just come with me.

38
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,685
It's just as it was before.

39
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,339
What's this, Chef Moon?

40
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,305
The soy sauce made
with domestically produced beans.

41
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,835
The soy sauce you were looking for?

42
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,335
Really?

43
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,149
- This is great news!
- Yes!

44
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,815
We found it at last!

45
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,145
- What are you doing? Keep up.
- Hurry.

46
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,325
This way.

47
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,805
<i>Jang Sun-young</i>

48
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,945
But why isn't that girl calling
Ms. Jang Sun-young?

49
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,745
She's perfectly healthy.

50
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,885
But Ms. Jang is
desperately trying to find her.

51
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,395
<i>Mr. Park</i>

52
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,335
Hey, Mr. Park. It's me.

53
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,535
That woman lost her memory.

54
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,665
She was found at the mountain.

55
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,175
And she's only staying there
because she has no place to go.

56
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,245
She doesn't even know who she is.

57
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,715
I'm certain of it.

58
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,015
Thank you.
I'll buy you another drink soon.

59
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,825
She lost her memory?

60
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,255
You'll make tofu?

61
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,255
Now? Why?

62
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,499
That will be Seol-ah's grandpa's dinner.

63
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,499
How will you make that from scratch?
No one has cooked here for a long time.

64
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,265
Let's buy it on our way...

65
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,639
<i>The Whole World Is Crazy
About Chef Moon Seung-mo</i>

66
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,135
Is that you, Chef Moon?

67
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,045
I really want to cook the tofu
he taught me.

68
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,075
Get some rest inside if you're tired.

69
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,885
I can cook it alone.

70
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,815
No, I'll do it with Seol-ah.

71
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,885
I'll help you.

72
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,325
We can finish quickly that way.

73
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,525
- What are you doing, Painter?
- I'm milling.

74
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,629
My gosh, try harder.

75
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,399
- I'm trying already.
- Faster!

76
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,565
Goodness.

77
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,205
You just need to gently break
the clumps on the surface.

78
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,374
Okay.

79
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,015
Gently.

80
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,655
- Isn't this hard?
- No, it's fun.

81
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,325
By the way,
how can you tell if this is cooked?

82
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,269
By smelling it.

83
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,329
If it's undercooked,
it smells like fresh beans.

84
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,695
And if it's overcooked,
you can smell it burning.

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,735
This is why Seol-ah had
the sharpest sense of smell!

86
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,935
That's right. Her sense of smell
almost makes her a superhero.

87
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,775
It's all cooked now.

88
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,515
All right.

89
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,825
Now.

90
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,395
Don't press on it hard like that.

91
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,399
You have to press on it
gently like this. Press gently.

92
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,599
- Did you get it?
- Gently?

93
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,335
Okay. Gently.

94
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,049
Tofu seemed like such a simple ingredient,
but it's really hard to make one.

95
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,445
- Nothing comes easy in life.
- That's right.

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,219
If people enjoy the food
as much as you and Seol-ah do,

97
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,789
it makes the chef happy.

98
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,455
Well, it's because
you make such good food.

99
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,985
- Right?
- That's true.

100
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,455
What is this awkward vibe?

101
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,529
Something happened yesterday, right?

102
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,125
- Try it.
- Okay.

103
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,609
You too, Seol-ah. Try it.

104
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,835
Okay.

105
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,879
- Me too.
- How can the tofu

106
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,709
be so savory and soft?

107
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,275
It's because my grandpa
is the master of beans.

108
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,589
He was busy making tofu all the time

109
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,385
that he didn't take care of his health.

110
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,655
To be honest, I used to hate tofu.

111
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,165
What are those rings?

112
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,839
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

113
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,009
Stop lying. Those are matching rings!

114
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,505
No, they are not. It's a long story.

115
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,639
Stop making a fuss.
And let's get going.

116
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,975
He has to eat his dinner. Let's go.

117
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,945
You must be jealous.
Isn't this beautiful?

118
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,059
Grandpa, is it good?

119
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,365
Yes. It's good.

120
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,765
Where's my son?

121
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,009
Seung-mo is my son.

122
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,805
That's right. He's right here.

123
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,535
- My father.
- Who are you?

124
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,845
Seung-mo is my son.

125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,049
It's okay.
My grandpa sometimes recognizes people,

126
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,115
and sometimes, he doesn't.

127
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,029
Grandpa, have more tofu.

128
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,995
Okay. This is so good.

129
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,825
He can't recognize you at all.

130
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,195
This is awful.

131
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,935
- Stay here.
- What?

132
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,435
Okay.

133
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,239
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

134
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,235
My gosh, Chef Moon. Where are you?

135
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,749
<i>All of your family is gone, too!</i>

136
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,475
What on earth is going on?

137
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,445
It's nothing. We'll come back tonight.

138
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,489
I called because I need your help.

139
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,555
- Okay.
- Do you know if there's a nursing home

140
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,855
for dementia patients
near Seoha Village?

141
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,085
I need to take care of someone.

142
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,659
I'll look into that,
so don't worry about that.

143
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,895
Okay. I'll see you in the village.

144
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,335
<i>Constable Jo Soon-mi</i>

145
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,275
<i>A black van, Chef Moon's house</i>

146
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,145
<i>22O 6100</i>

147
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,385
What are you doing?

148
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,085
Nothing. My gosh,
you didn't go home yet?

149
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,599
- Aren't you going home?
- I should.

150
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,495
Don't turn on all the lights
when it's just you.

151
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,395
Okay.

152
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,635
This is Jo Soon-mi
from Investigation Support Team.

153
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,275
I need you to look
into a license plate number.

154
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,615
It's 22O 6100.

155
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,859
My goodness. Where have you been?

156
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,799
If you're leaving town,
you should have informed us in advance.

157
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,895
I left to get some ssi-ganjang.

158
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,965
I should have told you before I left.

159
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,095
I'm sorry for making you worry.

160
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,069
- My gosh.
- All right.

161
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,905
He called me.
Why are you giving him a hard time?

162
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,375
By the way, what's ssi-ganjang?
You treat it like it's some kind of gold.

163
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,039
Is it absolutely necessary?

164
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,275
How are you a civil servant
when you don't know anything?

165
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,179
The soy sauce determines the flavor.

166
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,519
And among all types of soy sauce,
it's called ssi-ganjang.

167
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,759
Goodness. You must be
so happy to be a know-it-all.

168
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,729
Only a single man who cooks
for himself would know.

169
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,485
How would I know all that?

170
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,629
I had to leave

171
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,125
because without ssi-ganjang, I can't
make the broth from Pungcheonok.

172
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,029
I'll cook
under my parents' restaurant's sign

173
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,139
and to keep the pride of our village.

174
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,065
I didn't think I
should settle for less.

175
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,935
- Well done.
- Yes, that's great.

176
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,975
That's enough interrogating.
Help us move this.

177
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,109
- Move what?
- We have to move that.

178
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,745
- All right. Let's see.
- What is it?

179
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,179
- Which one is it?
- Is it that?

180
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,715
- Is that ssi-ganjang?
- Yes.

181
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,695
Mr. Lim, the media
is going crazy these days.

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,895
You should have told us if you
had such good news like this one.

183
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,465
Thanks to Mr. Lim, I scored a good one.

184
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,505
The graph for the stock rise
is just perfect.

185
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,875
I doubt that you're treating us
to just this drink to celebrate.

186
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,985
I'm sure all of you already know
that my daughter is Bella.

187
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,825
Thanks to that, we're all smiling here.

188
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,969
And did you know that my daughter

189
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,395
chose me as her legal guardian?

190
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,735
Well, I wasn't aware of that.

I'm sure you know her brand itself

197
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,805
And if Bella and I set up
a fashion company in Korea,

198
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,145
we would be competing against Donghan.

199
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,985
And if that happens,

200
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,685
I will do everything I can
to win the fight.

I'm not that tactless.

231
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,289
That was the first time
Seung-mo accepted

- What did you say?

By the way,

236
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,695
why did he accept it?

237
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,965
He knows for sure now
that she isn't his daughter.

238
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,905
They're not related at all.

239
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,909
You may not be tactless,
but you sure are thoughtless.

240
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,839
What?

241
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,845
You don't have to be related by blood
to be family.

00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,849

245
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,955
I can't tell him at all.

How did you two even end up
getting matching rings?

247
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,495
I won't know unless you tell me.

248
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,225
Why? Is that not allowed?

249
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,065
Does that mean
you two are actually dating?

250
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,065
That's a secret.

251
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,635

It was quite scandalous back then.

257
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,755
Oh, yes. I remember.

Two people died in that car accident.

261
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,439
There was a woman in her 30s
in the car with him.

262
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,905
We found something incredible.

263
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,205
She's Yoo Hyo-myoung.

264
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,105
- "Yoo Hyo-myoung"?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,045

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,765
and turned his daughter into Bella?

271
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,735
Hey.

272
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,405
I think you guys did a great job.

273
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,705
Sorry?

274
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,679
Jung-tae, you go back to Nonyang

I don't know.

298
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,945
I just feel scared,

299
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,645
but I don't remember it.

300
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,595
I think it's a dream of my childhood.

301
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,565
It got scary all of a sudden, but...

302
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,505
Anyway, I don't remember clearly.

303
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,449
It could mean that
your memory is coming back,

304
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,145
so think of it positively.

305
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,115
But...

306
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,525
I'm not sure

307
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,695
if having my memory back
is actually a good thing.

308
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,935
I'm just so happy these days

What are you talking about?

310
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,275
Your family would be so disappointed
to hear that.

311
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,945
"Family"?

312
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,415
I must have a family, right?

313
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,955
Of course.

314
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,955
By the way,

315
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,395
how did you get such a beautiful idea?

316
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,399
What do you mean?

317
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,535
You decided to become a dad for Seol-ah
and take her in as your family.

318
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,405
Seol-ah's grandfather
thought of me as a son

319
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,275
and taught me all his secret recipes.

320
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,045
If there's one way I can repay him,

321
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,915
it's by taking her in

322
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,249
as my daughter.

323
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,615
That's what came to my mind.

324
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,485
I see.

325
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,525
My parents and the people
of this village taught me that

326
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,525
living with the people you care for

327
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,095
is what makes up a family.

328
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,965
Really?

329
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,735
Then...

330
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,935
What about me?

331
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,615
You're a good person,

332
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,315
- but...
- But what?

333
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,289
You care for me,
but don't consider me family?

334
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,615
That's not it.

335
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,989
You'll have to leave one day.

336
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,885
Whatever. Forget it.

337
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,285
So you're saying
I'm not part of the family.

338
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,795
I really feel comfortable

339
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,835
and familiar with

340
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,805
having you around.

341
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,705
I don't like
"comfortable" and "familiar".

342
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,275
What I'm trying to say is,

343
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,145
now I feel so empty and alone
when you're not around...

344
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,115
"Empty"? "Alone"?

345
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,559
And I don't think I would be able to
fall asleep or eat.

346
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,015
- Why?
- I think I'll miss you.

347
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,825

♫ <i>Love has given me a warm hand</i> ♫

351
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:05,241
♫ <i>Please look at me</i> ♫

352
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:15,151
♫ <i>And always be there, my dear</i> ♫

353
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,055
I'm thirsty.

354
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,919
- On television?
- Yes, ma'am.

355
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,749
Due to the rumors on the merger
and acquisition with Donghan,

356
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,355
stock prices are fluctuating, and
reporters are pouring questions at us.

357
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,059
I thought you could do an interview

358
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,859
and announce the next plans
for Belle Ombre.

359
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,525
"Next plans", meaning...

360
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,799
With the designs from the show,

361
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,965
we will be opening a Bella boutique
at one of Donghan's stores.

362
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,775
"A Bella boutique"?

363
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,179
So you're asking the world's
best designer, Bella,

364
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,645
to advertise a store on television?

365
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,619
Well, that's not what I meant...

366
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,845
All right.

367
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,319
But tell them
I want the questions beforehand,

368
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,315
and I'm only going to answer
what I want to.

369
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,185
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,969
Table number four, one rice soup.

371
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,339
How many times do I have to tell you?

372
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,109
Two rice soups, one soju!

373
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,705
Even Seol-ah can get...

374
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,609
Just let me and...

375
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,009
I'll do it.

376
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,945
I used to be amazing with an abacus
as a child.

377
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,445
"Abacus"? What's that?

378
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,349
An abacus. The calculating...

379
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,885
How am I supposed to explain this?

380
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,485
Move over. I'll give it a try.

381
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,059
Yes, you try.

382
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,855
Table number four,

383
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,565
two rice soups, one soju.

384
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,825
That's 20 dollars.

385
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,939
Will it be cash or credit?

386
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,935
See? Even Seol-ah can do it.

387
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,635
Let's see that again.

388
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,505
Table number four, two rice soups.

389
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,249
Are they all out of their minds?

390
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,545
What is it?

391
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,645
Just look at this!

392
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,315
No one cares about my pretty self.

393
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,385
They keep messaging me,
but they only want the address here!

394
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,029
I don't know what you're trying to say,

395
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,025
but why don't you
post the address, then?

396
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,195
Then they won't ask.

397
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,095
Come on!

398
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,169
Insects live off of dewdrops,

399
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,839
Pengsoo lives off of tuna,

400
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,039
and I live off of attention.

401
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,005
- Gosh.
- Goodness, you.

402
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,105
I give you that attention.

403
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,919
Stop that.

404
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,819
You two are driving me nuts.

405
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,959
It was nice when you were in Seoul
because you didn't pester me.

406
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,755
Mother,
please don't be too harsh to Hyo-sook.

407
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,195
Since when am I your mother?

408
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,929
Gosh, it must be nice to have
a new dependable son.

409
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,969
Am I right? Goodness!

410
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,095
Goodness.

411
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,569
Chef Moon, are you free?
Let's take a picture.

412
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,839
Everyone else is ready.

413
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,035
I'll be right out.

414
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,305
Hurry up, okay?

415
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,719
Pungcheonok

416
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,145
What is that?

417
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,189
That's the old sign that used to hang

418
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,725
at his parent's store.

419
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,999
Goodness.

420
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,795
So that's why he
needed that ssi-ganjang.

421
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,669
Come on now, let's take a picture.

422
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,709
- Yes.
- Let's do that.

423
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,169
- Make sure the sign is showing.
- Look at the camera.

424
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,079
- Come on, lower down. Where?
- Yes, okay.

425
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,309
One, two, three!

426
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,775
Pungcheonok!

427
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,285
You were much more appealing
when you were a hidden weapon.

428
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,055
But you know,

429
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,255
you should have been discreet

430
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,925
when you drew out that weapon.

431
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,195
I heard you were meeting
the stockholders behind my back.

432
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,705
You should have kept them quite

433
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,905
if you were going to do such a thing.

434
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,505
That's what I was intending.

435
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,705
What?

436
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,615
You need to hear it for yourself

437
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,015
in order to realize that
your end has come.

438
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,955
Please think of it

439
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,925
as words from a business partner,
not a son-in-law.

440
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,425
"Business partner"?

441
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,625
The times have changed.

442
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,435
You need to hand over the administration
to a business professional like me

443
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,005
and take a step back

444
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,335
as a leader of the past.

445
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,805
I want you to enjoy
the rest of your life in peace.

446
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,475
Those are

447
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,315
my words as a son-in-law,
not a business partner.

448
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,085
Chul-yong... Why, you...

449
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,569
Did you think that I wouldn't know

450
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,235
your current physical state?

451
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,005
What?

452
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,875
Dr. Choi showed me your chart.

453
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,579
I couldn't bear to keep watching
your health

454
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,285
cause a threat to the company.

455
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,955
Your greed has become ugly,

456
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,459
and I can't let it risk the lives

457
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,295
of our thousands of employees.

458
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,965
Make your decision.

459
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,435
Why, you...

460
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,645
Hello?

461
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,215
Is this 911?

462
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,125
We start business tomorrow.

463
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,855
Thank you all for helping me out.

464
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,369
In return for your support
and with my parents' recipe,

465
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,495
I will do my best.

466
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,205
Bravo!

467
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,435
Come up and say a word.

468
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:51,415
I understand that you must hate
just the sound of Donghan itself.

469
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,189
Donghan Food will work hard

470
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,825
to not disappoint Chef Moon
and everyone else,

471
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,955
who have given me a chance
to work with you here.

472
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,529
Don't forget about the county office.

473
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,399
Since I'm the person in charge
of the office,

474
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,269
I'll make sure to serve you
the best that I can.

475
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,569
Don't worry about things.

476
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,509
In light of that, I've prepared a toast

477
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,775
on behalf of the county governor here.

478
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,009
Hey!

479
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,819
He should come here
if he wants to say something.

480
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,479
- Why did you just do that?
- Come here.

481
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,615
I have to sort something out here.

482
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,315
What's my position?

483
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,685
- What?
- Your position?

484
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,959
I'm the brain of the village,

485
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,155
and that deserves to be recognized.

486
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,195
So, let's get that
out of the way first.

487
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,069
Sure, what would you like to be?

488
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,539
Anything above Jang-dan is good

489
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,169
since I'm a founding member.

490
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,479
Nonsense!

491
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,679
Chul-nam, that's not
what positions are like.

492
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,819
You have to climb your way up
from the bottom.

493
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,549
- That's what you have to do.
- That's right.

494
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,649
Becoming a subsection chief is
no easy work.

495
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,285
Look at you.

496
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,059
What's above Subsection Chief?

497
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,125
I believe it's Manager.

498
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,559
Manager? That sounds nice.

499
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,895
I want to be General Manager Jo,
or else I'm going on a strike.

500
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,335
- Sure, you can be General Manager Jo.
- What?

501
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,105
See? He is so magnanimous.

502
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,135
Start calling me General Manager Jo
from now on.

503
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,839
I won't respond if
you call me Chul-nam.

504
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,105
Then what am I?

505
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,879
I'm older and wiser

506
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,445
than Chul-nam here.

507
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,485
So, what am I?

508
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,025
What about Distribution Director?

509
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,929
Is that above General Manager?

510
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,999
Yes, that's above General Manager.

511
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,769
Sure, I'll be Distribution Director.

512
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,795
Wait! Who am I?

513
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,569
I'm the head of the women's society
and the village.

514
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,439
That being said,

515
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,505
I'll be the Operations Director, then.

516
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,709
Then I want to
be Senior Managing Director!

517
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,579
- Gosh.
- Then I'll be President!

518
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,719
Then I'll be the CEO!

519
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,289
Everyone, not everyone can have titles.

520
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,549
Who's going to work if everyone is
Manager and above?

521
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,115
Exactly my point!

522
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,899
But it's nice that
everyone has a title.

523
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,029
- That's right.
- Yes, Mother.

524
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,295
This is nice.

525
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,765
What? Grandfather?

526
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:23,826
<i>Seoul Medical Center</i>

527
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,935
Father!

528
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,635
Are you all right?

529
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,075
Father?

530
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,875
Father!

531
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,645
Father... Father.

532
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,715
Please wake up.

533
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,055
Father!

534
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,965
I'm going now!

535
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,369
What took you so long?

536
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,895
The ritual ceremony is already over.

537
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,809
I've got a lot of people to serve
as a police officer.

538
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,109
My goodness. I'm so full.

539
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,609
Soon-mi, what took you so long?

540
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,249
- Did you just get off from work?
- Hello.

541
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,779
- Hello.
- I'm sorry.

542
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,949
No worries.

543
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,479
- Head inside and have some food.
- Yes.

544
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,449
Good night.

545
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,249
Good work tonight.

546
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,619
Good work. See you around.

547
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,419
- Let's go.
- Get some rest.

548
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,859
You can go, I'll be home soon.

549
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,055
Get home safely.

550
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,395
Chef Moon,

551
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,705
a couple of nights ago,

552
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,279
I saw some suspicious people
come out of your house.

553
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,879
Yes, they came looking for Byeol-na.

554
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,975
Da-hoon said that they even brought
a photo of her, which is very suspicious.

555
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,445
- What about them?
- They came to look for Byeol-na?

556
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,615
The last time I saw them,
they were looking for you.

557
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,455
When?

558
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,899
This middle-aged man
with white hair was

559
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,855
looking for your house,

560
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,925
and I told you that
because he was so suspicious.

561
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,795
Don't you remember?

562
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,195
<i>By any chance,</i>

563
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,565
<i>did someone visit your house?</i>

564
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,205
<i>Yes, someone visited me just now.</i>

565
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,379
<i>Right? It was a middle-aged person
with white hair?</i>

566
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,045
<i>Yes, it was a middle-aged woman
with white hair.</i>

567
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,985
<i>A woman?</i>

568
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,045
<i>But it was a man.</i>

569
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,225
I remember.

570
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,155
- That's who came?
- I'm sure.

571
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,125
The man used to be a senior
to Mr. Park in the past...

572
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,765
and he operates
a security company in Seoul.

573
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,239
A security company?

574
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,205
I've kept my eyes on him

575
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,205
because he looked so suspicious.

576
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,415
He had his car parked here
and was watching your house all night.

577
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,315
Da-hoon also said that
they looked suspicious.

578
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,215
Do you have the company's
contact information?

579
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,455
I thought you might ask,

580
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,595
so I wrote down the
license plate number.

581
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,665
Hold on.

582
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,165
I was saying...

583
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,435
Operation Room

584
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,105
What took you so long?

585
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,975
I'm sorry.

586
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,915
No worries.

587
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,185
What happened?

588
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,695
Dr. Choi is saying
that his blood pressure shot up

589
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,195
and his stitches from the
surgery before got undone.

590
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,545
There are news reporters outside.

591
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,345
Are you in your right mind?

592
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,579
I told you to make sure
that nobody finds out about this!

593
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,685
Well...

594
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,685
I'm sorry, sir.

595
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,525
We'll keep the funeral minimal.

596
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,825
Funeral?

597
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,125
Are you insane?

598
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,699
Are you saying that he died?

599
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,865
Or...

600
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,409
- is that what you're hoping for?
- No, I was just...

601
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,735
Apologize immediately.

602
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,375
Stop it, all of you.

603
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,545
The publicity team
can handle the press.

604
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,815
You don't need to stay here.

605
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,945
You can go.

606
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,345
- Honey...
- I want you out, too.

607
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,155
It's really time to
congratulate you now.

608
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,999
Let's hold an executive meeting

609
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,769
so that we can decide on the successor.

610
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,095
I agree.

611
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,505
He's still in surgery.

612
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,905
Please refrain yourself
from making such comments.

613
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,475
Yes, sir.

614
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,115
You can go now.

615
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,315
Take care.

616
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,455
Let's get going now.

617
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:21,665
Good work.

618
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,065
- Thank you.
- Watch your face.

619
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,765
Don't make it so obvious.

620
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,579
And make sure to expose

621
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,275
Chairman Han's health issues.

622
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,345
Yes, sir.

623
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,065
Hello!

624
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,465
How can I get to Pungcheonok?

625
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,695
Pungcheonok?

626
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,309
Go straight and you'll find a big house
on your left.

627
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,205
- That's Pungcheonok.
- Thank you.

628
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,805
Let's go.

629
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,905
How do they even know?
It's just the opening day.

630
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,015
Excuse me,

631
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,715
how can I get to Pungcheonok?

632
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,729
Go straight and you'll find a big house
on your left.

633
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:21,959
That's Pungcheonok.

634
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,595
- Thank you.
- Bye.

635
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,795
This is the place, right?

636
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,235
It is!

637
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,809
It is! Look at the windows!

638
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,105
- They're beautiful.
- Amazing.

639
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,639
Can we take photos here?

640
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,309
Go ahead.

641
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,045
Take as many as you'd like.

642
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,419
Welcome! Welcome.

643
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,485
Come this way.

644
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,759
Follow me.

645
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,689
You must've come after seeing my post.

646
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,225
You must be followers of mine.

647
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,895
It's me. Take a good look.

648
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,395
Take as many photos as you'd like.

649
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,265
Do you have back problems?

650
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,039
You must've come a long way for photos.

651
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,269
- Yes.
- Enjoy your meal

652
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,969
and take lots of photos.

653
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,009
As a food connoisseur myself,

654
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,409
this place is incredible

655
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,845
for both the food and the mood.

656
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,849
Let's take some photos after we eat.

657
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,619
We've got a good seat over there.

658
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,019
Please seat yourself at that table.

659
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,355
Here.

660
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,155
An order for table number three.

661
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,559
Order for table number six!

662
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,195
One tteok-galbi and one trout soup
for table number three.

663
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,629
There are also two bowls of rice soup
and one tteok-galbi.

664
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,899
- Is the soup ready?
- Yes.

665
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,765
Please hurry up on getting
the vegetables ready.

666
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,839
Can you pass me some spinach
for the soup?

667
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,635
- Spinach?
- Yes, lots of it.

668
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,055
Table number three.

669
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,865
Amazing.

670
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,065
- Amazing.
- Enjoy.

671
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,909
- It looks so good!
- Come this way.

672
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,305
Here's your table.

673
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,875
This is amazing.

674
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,775
Let's eat!

675
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,415
- It's delicious.
- Absolutely delicious.

676
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,085
It's so good!

677
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,089
- That's incredible.
- This is so smooth.

678
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,655
Pungcheonok Parking Lot

679
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,295
Right that way.

680
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,169
What's happening?

681
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,569
It's exactly what it looks like.

682
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,275
The restaurant is a huge hit!

683
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,949
There's no parking available up there.

684
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,079
Come this way.

685
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,915
Pungcheonok Parking Lot

686
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,655
Yes, Mr. Hong.

687
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,359
The restaurant is an absolute hit.

688
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,395
Really?

689
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,795
All right.

690
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,569
What an amazing meal. Let's come again.

691
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,339
- Thank you!
- Welcome.

692
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,935
- It's so nice here.
- It is incredible.

693
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,045
- Take care.
- Thank you.

694
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,285
- It's beautiful in here.
- Absolutely.

695
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,059
Two bowls of rice soup
for the corner table!

696
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,585
Look at that.

697
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,255
Thank you.

698
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,125
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

699
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,365
Coming right up!

700
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,365
This is so good.

701
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,499
This is some gourmet food.

702
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,609
Right? We've got a hit restaurant

703
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,669
here in Nonyang now.

704
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,205
Two bowls of soup for the corner table!

705
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,535
Look at that!

706
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,949
I didn't expect so many people

707
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,489
right from the opening.
How did this happen?

708
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,419
Seung-mo was known for being
a talented chef without a restaurant,

709
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,719
- and people
- Wear your sunglasses.

710
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,459
got curious
when they heard about this place.

711
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,755
- I see.
- What did you just say?

712
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,459
Your influence on social media

713
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,195
also took a huge part, of course.

714
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,729
- Right.
- What are you talking about?

715
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,165
The amazing interior design is bringing
all of these people in, don't you think?

716
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,065
- Sure.
- Hello?

717
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,539
- Coming!
- Byeol-na and social media.

718
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,709
That brought these people
all the way here,

719
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,419
to eat and enjoy the place!

720
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,889
That's incredible, I should thank them.

721
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,155
Thank you, enjoy your food.

722
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,725
Thank you, enjoy. Thank you.

723
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,395
- Thank you!
- Bye.

724
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,265
Coming right up!

725
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,609
I thought it might be you.

726
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,739
It's you, indeed! Hold on.

727
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,109
Mr. Hwang, no need.

728
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,449
- Just wait.
- Mr. Hwang.

729
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,015
Hello!

730
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,349
The county governor of Nonyang has

731
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,415
made a visit himself!

732
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,725
<i>Han Mi-young</i>

733
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,765
Hello.

734
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,895
We couldn't find Bella.

735
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,635
I'm going back to Paris tonight.

736
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,505
I'll look for ways to find her there.

737
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,605
I figured that you'd be busy,

738
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,205
so this is my goodbye to you.

739
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,475
Come visit me
before you leave for the airport.

740
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,645
I have something to tell you.

741
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,935
Dr. Choi is saying that tonight and
tomorrow will determine everything.

742
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,305
He says it's unlikely
that he'll be conscious again.

743
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,049
I hope he dies in peace.

744
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,285
I booked a shareholders' meeting
next week.

745
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,759
Get the legal team
and the shareholders ready.

746
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,355
Don't worry, I got it.

747
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:31,855
And Mr. Lim, once everything
is sorted out,

748
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,825
will you hand Donghan Food over to me
as we promised?

749
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,105
Is this really the right time for that?

750
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,805
I'm just giving you a reminder.

751
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:45,705
Get going now.

752
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,935
Untitled

753
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,475
<i>I need to talk to you about real Bella.</i>

754
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,775
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

755
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,349
I'm sorry for making you come out
when you must be so busy.

756
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,345
I thought you made no mistakes.

757
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,715
I thought so.

758
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,485
This was my very first mistake.

759
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,359
But life is full of surprises.
Had it not been for my mistake,

760
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,155
I wouldn't have
gotten to meet with you.

761
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,595
Think about it.

762
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,065
Why did Bella not contact Sun-young
when she was alive all along?

763
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,105
That's what made me so curious.

764
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,675
It turns out, her memory is gone.

765
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,449
- What?
- Which is why

766
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,985
we have another chance.

767
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,759
If you give me the chance
to make up for my mistake,

768
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,825
I'll get everything done and be gone.

769
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,095
Everything?

770
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,499
After all, you're the one
who will be in trouble

771
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,205
if Sun-young finds out about Bella.

772
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,439
I think she's leaving
for Paris tonight,

773
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,939
but I think it'd be best

774
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,175
if we just take care of everything
before she leaves.

775
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,195
Yes, sir.

776
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,995
I think it's time to end things

777
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,465
with Jin Tae-soo.

778
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,905
- Sorry?
- I told you

779
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,775
that the more you know,
the more at risk you become.

780
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,585
Excuse me,

781
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,215
didn't I see you in Australia?

782
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,895
You're from the pop-up restaurant.

783
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,065
Yes, I was the manager there.

784
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,335
What a surprise.

785
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,795
Bye now.

786
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,209
The lady who came with you
to the restaurant,

787
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,335
why

788
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,905
is she there?

789
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,315
What did you just say?

790
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,689
I saw her recently.

791
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,389
What? When?

792
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,015
Where?

793
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,685
Well,

794
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,385
there's an old house in Nonyang.

795
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,125
Did you just say an
old house in Nonyang?

796
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,525
Yes.

797
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,195
Please excuse me.

798
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,595
But...

799
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,115
- Hello?
- Hello, Chef Moon.

800
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,615
What's the name of the lady
who lives at your house?

801
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,055
We saw her back in Australia.

802
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,855
- Byeol-na?
- Yes, Byeol-na.

803
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,699
After you rushed back to Korea,

804
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,569
a woman came to the restaurant
with Byeol-na

805
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,195
and she has white hair.

806
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,765
I ran into her just now,

807
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,509
and as soon as she heard about her,

808
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,205
she left for Nonyang.

809
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,205
Thank you. Okay.

810
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,595
It's unfortunate that Madame Jang
won't be working with me anymore,

811
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,265
but I believe that I can't go forward
if I don't step out of my comfort zone.

812
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:36,569
The same goes
for Donghan's conservative style,

813
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,095
which you have mentioned earlier.

814
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,935
I want to change that.

815
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,505
No,

816
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,705
I want to be the one to change that.

817
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,205
I've always sought after something new

818
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,915
and that's what gives me energy.

819
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,485
But there's one thing
that doesn't change.

820
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,989
The country where you were born.

821
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,255
How does it feel to be
back in your home country?

822
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,635
Cut on Camera Two.
Get Camera Three ready.

823
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,869
I think that explains it all.

824
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:17,475
Let's talk about something else.

825
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,215
- Let me know when it's all done.
- Okay.

826
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,755
How does it feel to be
back in your home country?

827
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,015
Goodness!

828
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,685
You scared me!

829
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,555
What are you watching?
You should be cleaning.

830
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,955
Let me be.

831
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,195
My role model Bella is on TV right now.

832
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,035
Bella? You mean me?

833
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,565
Not funny at all.

834
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,275
I'm exhausted.

835
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,709
So, who is this Bella?

836
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,205
Why do you respect her so much?

837
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:56,915
You want to watch it with me?

838
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,889
This was your first
fashion show in Korea.

839
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,855
It was broadcasted live as well.

840
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,289
How was that?

841
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,785
I'd like to hear about
your future plans as well.

842
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,925
I've always missed Korea

843
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,095
during my time in France.

844
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,765
That's why I've always wanted
to come back and do a show here.

845
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,965
I'm so happy that I got to do
exactly that.

846
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,579
I'm opening Bella Boutique
in Cheongdam-dong

847
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,479
to communicate more with my fans.

848
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,675
I'd like to communicate
with more people.

849
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,319
You're making an exclusive announcement

850
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,785
on our show
about Bella Boutique's opening.

851
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:42,985
Yes, I'll invite you for the opening.

852
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,155
Thank you.

853
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,099
And there was an even more famous part

854
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,525
to the show that became a huge issue.

855
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,495
Let's watch it again.

856
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:54,566
<i>Belle Ombre</i>

857
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,609
<i>- Bella!
- Bella!</i>

858
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:08,319
<i>- Bella!

861
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,125

<i>Stop the car!</i>

863
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,495
Unni! Are you okay?

864
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,035
Unni! Unni!

865
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,175
Unni, what's wrong?

866
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,509
Unni!

867
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,179
- That caught everyone by surprise.
- Unni!

868
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,375
What made you choose
to reveal your face?

869
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,075
Because I'm Bella.

870
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,215
Why should there be a reason
when Bella wants to show who she is?

871
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,115
Unni, are you okay?

872
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,325
- Byeol-na, are you all right?
- Byeol-na.

873
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,510
- What's wrong?
- Unni.

874
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,095
Unni, are you okay?

875
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,325
What's happening?

876
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,165
<i>Why do you do this before every show?</i>

877
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,065
<i>Bella! The finale dress! Hurry.</i>

878
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,865
<i>Good job.</i>

879
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,969
<i>Designer brands are rushing</i>

00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,419
<i>After all, I know all
of Bella's secrets.</i>

888
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,519
<i>Ms. Bella,</i>

889
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,929
<i>I'm Lim Hyun-ah,
Lim Chul-yong's daughter.</i>

890
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,659
<i>Was that you who stole the dress?</i>

891
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,295
<i>Are you insane? Stop the car!</i>

892
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:36,505
Unni!

893
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,575
Unni, are you okay?

894
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:47,919
<i>Madame Jang</i>

895
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,585
<i>Pungcheonok</i>

896
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,765
Bella?

897
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,105
Yu-jin!

898
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:16,675
Yoo Yu-jin!

899
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,915
Yu-jin!

900
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,355
Jang Madame.

901
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,195
Yes.

902
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,225
Yes, that's me.

903
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,795
Yu-jin!

904
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,935
What happened to you?
Do you know how worried I was?

905
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,205
What do we do?
Jang Sun-young is here.

906
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,675
Just run them over!

907
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,295
(Eccentric! Chef Moon)

908
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:16,300
♫ <i>I'm standing in this
unforgettable longing</i> ♫

909
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,630
♫ <i>Not able to say anything</i> ♫

910
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:28,800
♫ <i>Lingering in that day
that I cannot erase</i> ♫

911
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,480
♫ <i>Only my memories
can take me there</i> ♫

912
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,655
<i>Why are they trying to kill Yu-jin?</i>

913
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,855
<i>Lim Chul-yong.</i>

914
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,329
<i>He has announced that all wealth
and authority will be</i>

915
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,929
<i>handed over to Mr. Lim.</i>

916
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,925
<i>Chef Moon, we...</i>

917
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,605
<i>we'll meet again
after time passes, right?</i>

918
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,835
<i>Tell them to get ready.</i>

919
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:54,205
<i>I'm going to go meet them one by one.</i>

920
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,075
<i>You've looked so hard for me,
but you don't seem too happy to see me.</i>

921
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,119
<i>Relax.</i>

922
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,415
<i>You look like you've just seen
a dead person come back alive.</i>
