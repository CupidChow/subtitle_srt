00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,592
[ Episode 14 ]

3
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,945
I'm here now.

4
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,255
[ - What about Mr. Jin? ]
- I don't see him yet.

5
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,925
- I'll wait here.
[ - Be careful. ]

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,025
Will do.

7
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,335
Is that Mr. Jin?

8
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,425
What is going on?

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,765
What brings you to a place like this,
Chef Moon?

10
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,165
At a place that doesn't suit you,

11
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,235
with a bag like that?

12
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,705
I don't think the person
you are waiting for will come.

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,745
- What did you do with Mr. Jin?
- Well.

14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,415
How should I know?

15
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,355
Did you kill him?

16
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,325
Chef Moon.

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,365
I'm not the type of person
to go around killing people.

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,765
I guess I could seriously consider it

19
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,905
if there happened to be a good reason.

20
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,075
So

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,075
you even killed Mr. Jin

22
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,245
to cover the evidence?

23
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,749
Maybe it's because of your job,

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,255
but you have such a wild imagination.

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,414
And Pungcheonok.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,755
You're the one

27
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,495
who set Pungcheonok on fire.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,165
Why did you do it?

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,005
Why?

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,074
My mother and father... Why?

31
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,285
Why did you do it?

32
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,085
Why?

33
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,695
You bastard!

34
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,995
[ Seriously! ]

35
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,885
Let's go.

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,555
[ Chef Moon. ]

37
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,565
Next time, I hope to see you
at a place that suits you.

38
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,455
[ Yu-jin? ]

39
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,485
Chef Moon.

40
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,555
Nothing's

41
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,129
going on, right?

42
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,625
[ No. Of course not. ]

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,965
[ - Why? ]
- Never mind, then.

44
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,205
I just wanted to hear your voice.

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,035
[ It's getting late. Go to bed. ]

46
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,735
When will you be here?

47
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,145
I'm not sure yet.

48
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,315
It might take a bit longer.

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,415
[ Okay. Don't worry about us, ]

50
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,514
[ and take care of the business
regarding your parents. ]

51
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,385
Okay.

52
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,645
What do you mean, Lim Chul-yong was there?

53
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,015
I don't understand it, either.

54
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,015
I think we've been tracked.

55
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,615
How could he have known?

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,925
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,255
I took care of it.

58
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,395
All right. Good job.

59
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,025
I knew it.

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,665
Everything went smoothly
because you took care of it.

61
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,305
[ Go and get some rest for a few days, ]

62
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,775
and come straight to work
at Donghan Food as the head.

63
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,975
Thank you, sir.

64
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,705
[ Mr. Kang Jun-su ]

65
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,875
Yes?

66
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,045
What?

67
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,859
[ This morning,
former police officer Mr. Jin ]

68
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,729
[ and his acquaintance, Mr. Hong, ]

69
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,029
[ were found dead ]

70
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,735
[ by the mountains near Pyeongtaek. ]

71
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,239
[ Mr. Jin and Mr. Hong were found to have
inhaled toxic fumes in a car, ]

72
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,569
[ with no signs of murder. ]

73
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,309
[ A will was found on-site, ]

74
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,549
[ therefore, the police are assuming
that the two ]

75
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,075
[ took their own lives out of despair
for their situation. ]

76
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,455
[ Mr. Jin and Mr. Hong were found to have
inhaled toxic fumes in a car, ]

77
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,789
[ with no signs of murder. ]

78
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,558
[ A will was found on-site, ]

79
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,795
[ therefore, the police are assuming
that the two... ]

80
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,695
Lim Chul-yong showed up

81
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,035
at the site.

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,375
How could he have known?

83
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,904
Mother.

84
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,815
[ Mother ]

85
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,375
Keep searching.

86
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,215
- Yes, Mother.
[ - Jun-su. ]

87
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,119
[ I want to go with you tomorrow
for the deal. ]

88
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,625
It's dangerous. You shouldn't.

89
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,825
And there's been a change of schedule.

90
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,125
I think Lim Chul-yong is tracking us.

91
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,325
We advanced it to tonight.

92
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,965
Do you understand what you've done?

93
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,545
Why did you give him the information?
Just why?

94
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,875
[ I told you. ]

95
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,145
It was for you.

96
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,154
[ It was to protect you. ]

97
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,225
He said he would kill you as well.

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,025
What was I supposed to do?

99
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,795
Mother.

100
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,995
Jun-su.

101
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,605
Don't fight Lim Chul-yong.

102
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,605
Please.

103
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,645
Please!

104
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,899
Wait! One moment!

105
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,165
What now?

106
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,435
Are you going to follow us to jail?

107
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,534
Mr. Jin and Hong Joo-hyuk

108
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,674
died last night.

109
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,215
What?

110
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,545
Who was it?

111
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,125
What on earth is someone trying to hide
by killing Mr. Jin?

112
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,925
You're the only one left now.

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,525
Come on, tell us the truth. Please?

114
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,909
"Mr. Jung"?

115
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,765
[ We don't know his name, ]

116
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,239
but Oh Jung-tae overheard

117
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,275
Mr. Jin often mentioning Mr. Jung
from Donghan Group.

118
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,419
Was he the one who ordered
to kidnap Yu-jin

119
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,975
and set Pungcheonok on fire?

120
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,785
Was it all from that Mr. Jung?

121
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,915
Yes.

122
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,299
Hey, Mr. Choi.

123
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,329
[ Yes, Chef Moon. ]

124
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,129
I went around and checked for just in case

125
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,795
after hearing from you.

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,335
That Mr. Jung took his day off
yesterday and today.

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,105
Can you find out Mr. Jung's
home address as well?

128
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,175
Sure, will do right away.

129
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,015
[ What are you here for? ]

130
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,815
I'm the housekeeper here.

131
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,515
Is there something I can help?

132
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,785
I'm supposed to meet with him today.

133
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,525
Nobody's home.

134
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,629
The wife and kid are abroad.

135
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,025
The mister went out for work
early in the morning.

136
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,025
I see.

137
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,975
Oh Jung-tae spilled out everything.

138
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,975
Yu-jin's abduction and Pungcheonok's fire.

139
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,245
Mr. Jung was behind
all of these incidents.

140
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,079
Then Mr. Jung must be involved
with the murder

141
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,745
of Mr. Jin as well. Right?

142
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,659
He's not at home, and he's not at work.

143
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,515
I have no clue where he might be.

144
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,125
For now, finding Mr. Jung is our priority.

145
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,295
I'll do my best to figure things out.

146
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,565
I didn't expect Lim Chul-yong
to finish Mr. Jin like that.

147
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,035
Goodness.

148
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,365
I'm too ashamed to see Yu-jin now.

149
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,875
Don't be so hard on yourself.

150
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,445
Yu-jin's parents

151
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,445
didn't die because of you, Ms. Jang.

152
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,745
Lim Chul-yong did it.

153
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,215
What?

154
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,495
20 years ago,

155
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,595
Lim Chul-yong committed the murder
and covered it up as an accident.

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,595
My mother told me all about it.

157
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,035
How...

158
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,135
How could he do that?

159
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,715
[ Goodness. ]

160
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,215
I am going to catch

161
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,685
Lim Chul-yong no matter what.

162
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,629
I'm going to get back
what belongs to Yu-jin,

163
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,885
and I

164
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,025
will also pay him back.

165
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,835
[ This reference was prepared expecting
ruffle blouses to be in this season ]

166
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,265
along with leather material
being on the rise.

167
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,375
It hasn't been long since your last show.

168
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,149
And being on a tight schedule,

169
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,515
I believe it'll be hard to prepare
everything in time.

170
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,415
Are you ignoring me?

171
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,155
- Sorry?
- You think I won't be able to do this.

172
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,595
No, that's not what...

173
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,455
How am I supposed to come up with a design

174
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,095
when you're only giving me
cheap references?

175
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,395
Find something else immediately.

176
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,705
Leave, will you?

177
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,815
[ I'm so nervous about this. ]

178
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,255
You should.

179
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,329
We're picking Yoon-ja's senior assistant

180
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,829
who'll be in charge of this kitchen

181
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,899
[ while Chef Moon is away. ]

182
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,029
[ This is a crucial matter
indeed to be nervous about. ]

183
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,969
Yes, it is a crucial matter
for Pungcheonok.

184
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,065
[ Of course. ]

185
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,815
This...

186
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,589
- It's salty.
- Goodness.

187
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,559
- Yes!
[ - I told you it was salty. ]

188
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,589
Gosh.

189
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,889
- It was perfect for my taste.
- Right?

190
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,699
Your sense of smell isn't good at all.

191
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,759
It's all about the taste.

192
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,729
[ You know Seol-a is a genius
when it comes to smell. ]

193
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,499
If she says it's salty, it is salty.
Right?

194
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,665
You didn't have to rub it in like that.
Gosh.

195
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,465
Let's move on to the next.

196
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,545
It's

197
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,685
bland.

198
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,259
[ Bland, right? ]

199
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,019
I told you to pour in more soy sauce.

200
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,859
Are you siding with Ms. Pi or me?

201
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,229
Make that clear.

202
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,455
I'm on nobody's side.
I'm siding with the better cook.

203
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,725
[ - Gosh.
- Goodness. ]

204
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,639
Maybe Seol-a's tastebuds advanced too much

205
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,869
because she only eats
what Chef Moon cooks for her.

206
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,669
[ - Right. ]
- I'll try it.

207
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,335
[ - Okay. ]
- Good idea.

208
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,145
I must say it is bland.

209
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,219
Come on.

210
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,019
Having bland food is better
than having salty food.

211
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,559
Nonsense.

212
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,715
You need the flavor to enjoy food.

213
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,689
Oh, I see.

214
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,429
Maybe that's why your coffee is bland.

215
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,195
Are you picking up a fight with me?

216
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,595
[ No. ]

217
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,339
Wait!

218
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,339
- What?
- We have a guest.

219
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,565
- What?
- Where?

220
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,355
Something's serious.

221
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,229
Why did she come again?

222
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,555
Mom, come on.

223
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,025
Think about it.

224
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,799
I bet she came to ask Bella
to do business with her again.

225
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,895
Who is she?

226
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,335
She's a very famous person
in the fashion industry.

227
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,439
[ She was the one ]

228
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,675
who made Bella who she is today.

229
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,975
- Hyo-sook told me so.
- Right.

230
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,349
Now seeing that woman here,

231
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,745
I'm getting worried.

232
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,419
What? Why are you getting worried?

233
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,729
Last time, when that woman came,

234
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,225
Bella left us.

235
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,799
I'm worried that might happen again.

236
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,499
Oh, no way.

237
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,665
Don't worry.

238
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,675
Yu-jin.

239
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,015
Why are you here?

240
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,785
I have nothing to say.

241
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,159
I heard you were here

242
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,885
from Chef Moon.

243
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,385
So what?

244
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,025
You want me to go with you
and find Belle Ombre back?

245
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,595
Are you here to say that?

246
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,235
No, I just...

247
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,205
You...

248
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,375
It's a huge relief to see

249
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,005
how well you're doing here.

250
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,115
I saw you

251
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,545
before coming in.

252
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,584
[ It was great to see you ]

253
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,025
[ mingling with people. ]

254
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,155
[ You had such a pretty smile. ]

255
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:28,625
You couldn't meet people

256
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,235
because of me.

257
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,765
[ You had to hide your face ]

258
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,834
[ and ]

259
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,575
make clothes all your life.

260
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,475
I'm sorry I made you go through that.

261
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,645
[ I'm ]

262
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,585
terribly sorry.

263
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,055
It's not your fault.

264
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,395
It's been a while

265
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,995
since I heard your voice.

266
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,365
Yu-jin.

267
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,395
I want

268
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,075
you to do whatever you want from now on.

269
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,305
[ I came to tell you that. ]

270
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,545
[ I betrayed Hyo-myoung.
I will pay the price ]

271
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,445
for the rest of my life.

272
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,245
[ But ]

273
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,955
I want you to continue designing.

274
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,325
Chef Moon told me about it.

275
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,429
He said you're not making clothes
because of me...

276
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,265
I just don't want to do it anymore.

277
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,735
I don't want to sew anymore.

278
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,635
I don't want to design anymore.

279
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,435
Yu-jin.

280
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,905
[ I want to see you ]

281
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,575
regaining your feet.

282
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,415
Chef Moon thinks the same.

283
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,785
We should get going.

284
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,455
I have to go and help the restaurant.

285
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,525
Sure.

286
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,755
Let's get going.

287
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,705
Those clothes...

288
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,475
You designed them, didn't you?

289
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,305
They are the first clothes

290
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,915
designed by Yoo Yu-jin, not Bella.

291
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,155
They are pretty.

292
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,755
They are the prettiest
among all clothes you designed.

293
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,025
- Yu-jin?
- Today,

294
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,695
Madam Jang visited me.

295
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,995
[ She said you told her. ]

296
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,465
I did.

297
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,065
She was very worried about you.

298
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,805
From now on,

299
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,935
please don't do that.

300
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,545
[ - Have you eaten yet? ]
- Yes, I have.

301
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,975
[ When are you coming? ]

302
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,045
Are you sorting out

303
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,485
your parents' problem all right?

304
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,655
[ Never mind. ]

305
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,329
Don't worry about me.
I wish you good luck.

306
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,455
Yu-jin.

307
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,825
Actually, I found out

308
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,835
who burned my parents' Pungcheonok down.

309
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,765
What?

310
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,835
- Who is it?
- Mr. Jin.

311
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,775
It was Mr. Jin and his men,
who tried to kill you too.

312
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,205
What?

313
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,715
But that guy, Mr. Jin,
was found dead yesterday.

314
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,055
I think Lim Chul-yong did it,

315
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,625
in order to hide his crime.

316
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,785
Lim Chul-yong...

317
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,455
I didn't tell you because you might worry.

318
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,025
So please don't be mad at me.

319
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,295
Why would I be mad at you?

320
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,409
Doesn't this mean you're in trouble too?

321
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,935
[ Mr. Kang, Mr. Choi, ]

322
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,549
and Ms. Jang are helping me, so I'm fine.

323
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,745
Don't worry.

324
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,245
I will catch Lim Chul-yong and come back.

325
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,385
So please wait for me.

326
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,055
Okay.

327
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,655
- Be careful.
- I will.

328
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,185
I have to go.

329
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,055
Hey.

330
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,285
My sick mother is alone at home.

[ Please don't kill me. ]

332
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,795
Do you think it will be over

333
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,425
once we are dead?

334
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,335
[ You will be ]

336
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,835
[ You will see. ]

337
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,075
Gosh.

338
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,845
Please don't kill me.

00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,569
[ Stop sweeping. ]

you to do whatever you want from now on.

00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,589
[ - Goodness.
- Good work, everyone. ]

352
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,499
[ - Good work, guys.
- Let's wrap it up. ]

353

- Let's go!
- Oh, dear.

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,105
[ Wait up. ]

357
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,615
You must have got a lot of nerves

00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,295
She followed me around all the time.

549
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,265
I still remember the day before she left
for Seoul.

550

[ She had all her belongings wrapped up
in a cloth ]

551

and was walking down the road

552

when I chased her from the back.

553
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,585
I screamed, "Don't leave, Hyo-myoung!"

[ That's what I did. ]

555

556

her eyes were filled with tears.

557
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,465

558
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,635
- He got rejected.
- You're too mean!

559

593
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,869

595

that Ms. Jang handed me.

733
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,425
[ I mean it. ]

734
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,125
Jang Sun-young?

735
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,365
[ Why did you meet up with her? ]

736
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,105
[ You could've done as I told you to
if you couldn't handle the show! ]

737
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,035
Why are you so greedy
when you're so incapable?

738
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,345
Until when do I have to clean up
after your mess?

739
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,815
[ Stay still. ]

740
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,845
Don't you dare do anything!

741
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,985
[ To me, you're my mom. ]

742
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,355
[ Am I right? ]

743
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,665
[ Mr. Lim Chul-yong ]

744
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,635
[ Jang Sun-young! ]

745
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,175
You think you can get away with this?

746
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,275
I lost everything because of you,

747
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,145
so what makes you think you can scare me?

748
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,155
[ Your daughter will learn a good lesson
from this. ]

749
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,985
She'll stop copying

750
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,195
other people's designs now.

751
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,265
Chairman Lim Chul-yong,

752
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,169
if you pulled a fraud to steal a company,

753
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,865
then you should've made sure to hide it.

754
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,675
[ How embarrassing is this? ]

755
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,205
[ You're going to have to suffer for this ]

756
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,705
now that Belle Ombre is your company.

757
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,045
You lost everything, you say?

758
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,515
You think I don't know

759
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,225
that Yoo Yu-jin is in Pungcheonok?

760
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,325
[ I'm going to ]

761
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,625
make her end up just like Hyun-a.

762
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,265
Just wait and see.

763
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,195
Lim Chul-yong!

764
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,715
[ Lim Chul-yong knows that you're there. ]

765
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,315
Hyun-a.

766
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:55,945
What are you doing?

767
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,555
Dad,

768
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,085
I'm just preparing for the show.

769
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,885
I'm almost done.

770
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,065
- Stop.
- Why?

771
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,805
I'm almost done.

772
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,475
I'll finish it up and show you.

773
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,105
It's done.

774
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,665
Dad?

775
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,835
What's wrong?

776
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,245
To be honest,

777
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,715
I didn't want to do that, either.

778
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,385
But if I did otherwise,

779
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,825
I thought that I'd be his next target.

780
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,965
That's why I was so scared.

781
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,195
That's why we have to expose the truth.

782
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,005
If not, you might have to take the blame
for everything.

783
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,075
But will people

784
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,445
believe what I say?

785
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,815
You must have some proof.

786
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,145
All the calls were made
using illegally registered phones

787
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,915
and I got rid of every proof possible.

788
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,625
There's really nothing I can show.

789
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,165
I know. There must be some

790
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,505
at the Chairman's office.

791
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,855
Don't get out.

792
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,595
I'll let you know

793
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,765
once I have proof.

794
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,495
Yu-jin!

795
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:16,596
<font color="#fcc89b">Subtitles by iQIYI</font>
<font color="#8080ff">Ripped by RuoXi</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">Synced by 308Moune</font>

796
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,235
[ Eccentric! Chef Moon ]

797
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,339
I'm the type who has to

798
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,079
trample on whoever it is if they stop me.

799
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,345
I'm going to kill him.

800
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,515
[ Do you know why they died? ]

801
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,785
Because they underestimated me.

802
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,245
I wouldn't have done this had I known
that it'd be dangerous.

803
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,755
Madam Jang!

804
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,989
[ Everything feels so surreal. ]

805
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,929
This could be our chance.

806
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,725
[ I got the proof. ]

807
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,455
Don't trust Mr. Jung too much.

808
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,325
[ Please, just stop! ]

809
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,795
Lim Chul-yong, this is the end of it all
for you.
