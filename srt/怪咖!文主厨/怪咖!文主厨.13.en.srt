00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,497
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,765
- What's this about?
- Sir.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,035
The police are going to reinvestigate
the fire at Pungcheonok in Seoul.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,675
What should I do?

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,475
What about that?

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,375
Will that be a problem for us?

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,785
No, it won't.
But I looked into this a little deeper.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,455
And I found out this reinvestigation
was launched by Nonyang Police Station.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,825
Nonyang?

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,555
Isn't that where Seoha Village is?

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,265
Yes.

13
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,315
Go home.

14
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,865
<i>It turns out,</i>

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,965
<i>my father and Yoo Hyo-myoung</i>

16
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,535
<i>didn't die in an accident 20 years ago.</i>

17
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,135
Then what is it?

18
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,204
Chul-yong planned the murders
and made them look like an accident.

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,145
My mom just told me about everything.

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,885
What?

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,385
So, he killed...

22
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,415
<i>If I pushed forward with the construction
of the clothing industrial complex,</i>

23
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,515
I would have regretted it.

24
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,055
I would have missed my chance
of witnessing such a great restaurant.

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,055
What brings you here?

26
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,855
It is my duty as a businessman
to visit the talented chef

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,995
who runs a good restaurant in person.

28
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,105
When I withdrew the plan to develop
the clothing industrial complex,

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,839
I thought I may have unintentionally
harmed the village,

30
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,705
so I was sorry about it.

31
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,475
And I wanted to make
a good business offer

32
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,845
to you while paying the
village a visit. So here I am.

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,095
From what I've heard,

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,265
your gukbap is to die for.

35
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,795
I know it's late,

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,865
but could I try some before I go?

37
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,535
Please leave.

38
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,675
Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

39
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,285
I know it is very late to ask for food,
but I'm a customer, too.

40
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,985
Get out

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,585
right now.

42
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,425
Why?

43
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,465
Are you hiding something?

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,235
Don't you have more things
to hide than me?

45
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,445
That was Lim Chul-yong, wasn't it?

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,785
Do you think he
figured out that I'm here?

47
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,155
What's wrong, Yu-jin?

48
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,895
Were you going to leave Korea
because of Lim Chul-yong?

49
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,495
Chef Moon.

50
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,165
What if people in our village get
in trouble because of me again?

51
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,175
Don't worry. That won't happen.

52
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,145
I should get my ducks in a row too.

53
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,245
What's your plan?

54
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,685
- Tell me about your plan, too.
- Yu-jin.

55
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,755
I'll take care of this.

56
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,985
I'm just worried that
something might happen to you.

57
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,555
I don't want you or the village

58
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,895
to be in danger.

59
00:05:58,509 --> 00:05:59,905
It's not a bad feeling.

60
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,705
Having someone worry about you.

61
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,385
- Aren't you hungry?
- What?

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,455
No, I'm okay.

63
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,455
You really changed.

64
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,055
You used to make a fuss
because you were hungry at this hour.

65
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,925
Come on.

66
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,025
Wait.

67
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,685
It's ready. Try it.

68
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,165
What's this?

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,665
Magical porridge
that gets rid of your anxiety.

70
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,505
Gosh, there's no such thing.

71
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,095
Wasn't I right?

72
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,255
Yes, Chef Moon.

73
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,025
Chairman Lim Chul-yong
just paid me a visit.

74
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,499
What?

75
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,025
I have a bad feeling about this.

76
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,705
I'll go with you
when you meet up with Mr. Jin.

77
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,125
So you'll continue
to cause trouble to the end?

78
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,455
Mom.

79
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,895
I kept my promise

80
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,825
to keep you safe.

81
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,995
So give me a compliment.

82
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,065
But

83
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,605
I'm going to stop making clothes.

84
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,305
I'm just exhausted.

85
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,945
But I hope you won't scold me for that.

86
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,045
I was still able to fulfill the dream

87
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,415
you couldn't.

88
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,125
Tell me that I can stop now

89
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,955
and I did a good job

90
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,265
if you can hear me now.

91
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,675
And...

92
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,345
I'm not sure if I could stay here.

93
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,445
I want to stay with him.

94
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,285
Staying here in this village

95
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,725
and living a happy life
with the people here would be nice.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,265
But I keep making things hard for them.

97
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,505
Please tell me

98
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,165
what I should do.

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,669
Byeol-na!

100
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,695
- My goodness, she's there.
- Over there.

101
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,935
- Gosh.
- Hey!

102
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,735
- She's over there.
- Byeol-na.

103
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,735
My goodness. Are you all right?

104
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,335
Where have you been? Goodness.

105
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,405
I was visiting my mom's grave.

106
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,605
- What?
- What?

107
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,075
- Her mom's grave.
- Were you at Hyo-myoung's grave?

108
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,249
But what are you doing this morning?

109
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,155
- What?
- Goodness.

110
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,619
What are you hiding?

111
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,829
- Well...
- We were just...

112
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,785
We were exercising.

113
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,259
- A morning workout.
- Yes!

114
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,759
- Everyone was exercising.
- Right.

115
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,799
- Right? We started working out.
- Yes.

116
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,539
That's right.
We worked out since morning.

117
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,439
- My gosh, my body aches now.
- Right.

118
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,369
You should have washed your face first.

119
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,435
What?

120
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,675
- I see.
- Right.

121
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,475
You can tell that we didn't, right?
We should've washed up.

122
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,675
<i>Dad, wake up.</i>

123
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,615
<i>Dad! Wake up.</i>

124
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,985
<i>Seol-ah, what's wrong?</i>

125
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,755
<i>Byeol-na unni is gone again.</i>

126
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,585
<i>- What?
- What?</i>

127
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,395
<i>I looked everywhere,
but she's not here.</i>

128
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,769
<i>Ms. Pi!</i>

129
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,235
<i>Hey, Da-hoon.</i>

130
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,365
<i>What are you talking about?
Byeol-na is gone?</i>

131
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,505
<i>My gosh. Okay.</i>

132
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,775
<i>Okay. I got it. I'm on my way.</i>

133
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,419
<i>Honey, wake up. Byeol-na is gone again.</i>

134
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,719
<i>Someone must have kidnapped her.
Come out now.</i>

135
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,145
<i>- What?
- Oh, not again.</i>

136
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,385
<i>What?</i>

137
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,889
<i>Yes, Chul-nam.</i>

138
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,115
<i>I think Byeol-na got abducted again.</i>

139
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,655
<i>What? The police?</i>

140
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,995
<i>Yes. We must call them.</i>

141
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,029
Didn't I say it was nothing?

142
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,129
What?

143
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,335
What happened to the guy
who talked about calling the police?

144
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,835
Be quiet.

145
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,905
I, the police officer,

146
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,835
will go to work now.

147
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,045
Yes. Go on. Hurry.

148
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,579
If we're late,
Chef Moon will give us an earful.

149
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,885
Let's hurry. Okay. Let's go.

150
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,285
- Chef Moon.
- Chef Moon.

151
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,015
What are you doing here?

152
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,255
<i>- "Exercising!"
- "Exercising!"</i>

153
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,859
- I'm examining.
- What?

154
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,795
<i>"No. Exercising!"</i>

155
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,395
I'm exercising.

156
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,635
Were you exercising this morning too?

157
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,009
Well, yes.

158
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,969
You've become very diligent
while I was away.

159
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,165
Right?

160
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,375
I guess.

161
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,145
Then, I can't be the only lazy one.

162
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,575
Starting tomorrow, I'll join you.

163
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,619
- Sure.
- Okay.

164
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,685
- Sounds great. Yes!
- Yes.

165
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,389
Let's hurry. We must
open the restaurant.

166
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,485
- Bye.
- See you later.

167
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,855
That punk, Bang Da-hoon.

168
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,729
He called me up in the morning
and made a huge fuss.

169
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,155
That good-for-nothing.

170
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,135
Did you visit your mother?

171
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,865
Next time, tell me in advance,
so we can go together.

172
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,935
Okay.

173
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,975
Come to think of it,
I came back to Korea for my mom.

174
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,005
Thanks to that, I got to meet you.

175
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,045
Right. I forgot to
say something to my mom.

176
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,885
I forgot to thank her.

177
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,385
Byeol-na unni!

178
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,995
Why are you out here?

179
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,269
Did you cry?

180
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,765
I thought you were gone again,
so I got scared.

181
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,535
What happened?

182
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,435
What? Did something happen?

183
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,405
We're on our way back from our workout.

184
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,075
Let's go.

185
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,619
<i>Mr. Kang Jun-su</i>

186
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,555
<i>I'm going to meet up with Mr. Jin
four days from today.</i>

187
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,385
Da-hoon.

188
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,895
I need to talk to you.

189
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,825
You want to teach
the elders how to cook?

190
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,199
Yes. I need to be in Seoul
four days from today.

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,939
Seeing how invested
they are, I realized

192
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,065
I shouldn't close
the restaurant whenever I want.

193
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,475
You're right.

194
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,375
What is this about?
Why are you going to Seoul?

195
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,019
To take back the name, Bella,
and Belle Ombre

196
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,475
from Lim Chul-yong,

197
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,145
I need to see someone.

198
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,845
But I don't want Bella to know.

199
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,189
But if you tell them
you'll teach them how to cook,

200
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,225
won't they think it's weird?

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,265
"Chef Moon,
where are you going without us?"

202
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,095
I'm sure they'll say that.

203
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,239
Then, Bella will think it's odd too.

204
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,565
That's why I'm telling you this first.

205
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,405
Do you have any ideas?

206
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,705
Let's see.

207
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,975
Wait.

208
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,915
I'm getting back the inspiration
I have lost.

209
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,915
Great. I'll draw you a big picture.

210
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,355
It will be very smooth,

211
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,825
but elaborate at the same time.

212
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,829
No, don't do it.
I don't need your help.

213
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,099
No, just trust me on this.

214
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,725
I'm Bang Da-hoon.

215
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,765
Anyway,

216
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,009
you need to teach the people
in the village how to cook

217
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,075
without raising any suspicions
from Bella, right?

218
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,009
Hello, Da-hoon.

219
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,179
Mr. Hwang.

220
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,519
You told me that
a while ago, a TV station

221
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,085
wanted to introduce Pungcheonok
on their channel.

222
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,218
Can I meet with them today?

223
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:21,659
Sure thing.
Actually, they did call me before.

224
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,024
This all worked out.

225
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:27,995
Isn't this place great?

226
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:29,695
Have a seat.

227
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,935
I didn't expect a place like this
around here.

228
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,839
I heard you wanted to suggest something
for the documentary.

229
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,309
- Yes, sir.
- We only need

230
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,175
some shots,
and the editing will do the rest.

231
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,905
And you expect it to get high ratings?

232
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,585
I have an amazing idea.

233
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,719
<i>Documentary Project Proposal</i>

234
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,785
The documentary project proposal.

235
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,929
What?

236
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,425
So what is that supposed to be?

237
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,199
I was wondering what you were doing,
slacking off from work.

238
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,365
What is that nonsense?

239
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,795
Now...

240
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,005
We're supposed to be on TV, right?

241
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,209
But, they didn't seem
too thrilled about it,

242
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,879
so I asked Mr. Hwang to introduce me
to the production staff

243
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,375
to settle it once and for all.

244
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,689
- Are we going camping?
- Yes.

245
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,285
So, the whole village will go camping,

246
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,115
and there, Chef Moon will teach us
how to cook.

247
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,059
It will be the story of the world's
best chef, Moon Seung-mo,

248
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,855
and his clumsy assistants
growing together.

249
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,765
And in the end,

250
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,339
they will be able to run the restaurant
without Seung-mo,

251
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,769
which will be the heartwarming...

252
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,569
If we run it without Dad,

253
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,275
what will he do?

254
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,205
What? Well...

255
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,005
He needs some rest.

256
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,645
<i>Belle Ombre</i>

257
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,125
Ma'am...

258
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,055
Please keep it down. I'm here
to check what the people think.

259
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,395
The value of your clothes soared
once again after that incident.

260
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,609
There are a lot of merchandisers
from foreign luxury brands,

261
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,305
and we're getting more interest
from VIP guests, as you can see.

262
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,075
Excuse me, could you help me out?

263
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,145
One moment, ma'am.

264
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,785
Isn't this so pretty?

265
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,215
But did you hear about that?

266
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,489
Belle Ombre and Donghan are merging.

267
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,659
What? Why?

268
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,199
- Belle Ombre is doing that?
- Yes.

269
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,399
Are they insane?

270
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,595
I heard it's because Bella's dad
is the chairman of Donghan.

271
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,439
But still,
if Belle Ombre merges with Donhan,

272
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,369
it won't be a luxury brand.

273
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,075
I know. It's a bit odd.

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,805
- It's pretty though, isn't it?
- Let's go.

275
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,515
<i>Did you find Mr. Jin?</i>

276
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,615
He must be determined this time, sir.

277
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,355
We couldn't find a trace at all.

278
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,785
How will you manage to be
the head of Donghan Food like that?

279
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,725
I'm sorry, sir. But...

280
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,595
Sir.

281
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,765
We were keeping an eye on Mr. Kang,

282
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,395
and we sensed something unusual.

283
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,205
Jun-su? What?

284
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,635
Mr. Kang and Choi Gun-woo

285
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,505
are meeting up with smugglers
and passport forgers.

286
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,445
- What?
- I'm guessing

287
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,345
it has to do with Mr. Jin.

288
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,785
That's what Jun-su is up to?

289
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,429
Sir, Ms. Lim Hyun-ah is here to see you.

290
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,695
Tell her to wait.

291
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,365
What do you think you're doing?

292
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,475
I didn't want to wait.

293
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,875
Hyun-ah!

294
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,785
Dad, I'm Bella. Not Hyun-ah.

295
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,965
All right, Bella.

296
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,405
What brings you here all of a sudden?
Is something wrong?

297
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,375
Cancel the merger between Belle Ombre
and Donghan International.

298
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,875
- What?
- Just leave Belle Ombre to me.

299
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,719
I'll hold a solo fashion show soon

300
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,085
and show you myself.
Mine and Belle Ombre's value.

301
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,025
What are you doing, Seol-ah?

302
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,305
Since you came back,
I wanted to wear this again,

303
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,265
but I noticed there was a rip.

304
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,375
I tried to keep it safe
since it's valuable, but...

305
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,019
I didn't know you could sew.

306
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,449
I have to try.

307
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,785
If I keep practicing,
I'll get better, won't I?

308
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,685
Give it here. I'll do it for you.

309
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,715
You don't have to...

310
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,365
Watch carefully.

311
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,705
Like this.

312
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,745
You go this much...

313
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,015
And come back.

314
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,659
You really seem like a different person

315
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,725
when you're sewing and making clothes.

316
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,935
There.

317
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,545
All done.

318
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,415
Gosh, you're so fast!

319
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,349
Seol-ah.

320
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,845
We have to get up early tomorrow
to go camping, so go to bed.

321
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,015
Dad, look at this!

322
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,655
What is it?

323
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,025
Did Unni do this for you?

324
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,595
Gosh, it would be amazing
if she made another one like this.

325
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,595
- Right, Seol-ah?
- Yes.

326
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,065
That won't make me want to start again.

327
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,505
Is it because of Ms. Jang?

328
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,595
After you disappeared, I met Ms. Jang.

329
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,495
She looked really bad.

330
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,735
She said she was going to get back
Belle Ombre to return it to you

331
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,105
and apologize.

332
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,075
When I was having a hard time
after my mom died,

333
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,415
Jang Madame took me to Paris.

334
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,345
<i>Keep the space!</i>

335
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,655
<i>It's getting crooked. Focus!</i>

336
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,955
<i>Pay attention!</i>

337
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,755
<i>What are you doing? Continue.</i>

338
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,655
I spent every single day
studying fashion design

339
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,895
and faced my mom's death each day.

340
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,735
It was too much at first,

341
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,075
but I told myself it was for my mom.

342
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,805
I also thought the reason Jang Madame
was being so hard on me

343
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,445
was all for my mom.

344
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,045
But...

345
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,515
It was all

346
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,325
so that she could ease her own guilt.

347
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,365
I'm sure she thought she was repaying
for the betrayal on her friend,

348
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,635
who loved her like a sister,

349
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,035
through me, her daughter.

350
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,775
But she was using it as an excuse

351
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,475
to become the top again.

352
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,845
Through Belle Ombre.

353
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,355
I don't know much about her,

354
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,755
but I felt her sincere feelings
towards you.

355
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,925
Don't think of it so badly.

356
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,355
Let's stop talking about Jang Madame.

357
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,195
We need to get up early tomorrow.
I'd better get to bed.

358
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,095
Good night.

359
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,145
<i>Yu-jin is with me at Seoha Village.</i>

360
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,575
<i>Don't worry about her.</i>

361
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,655
<i>That's good to hear.</i>

362
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,625
<i>Please take care of Yu-jin</i>

363
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,095
<i>until everything gets handled.</i>

364
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,385
<i>Auntie, my wrist hurts.
I can't do any more.</i>

365
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,895
<i>Why are you acting like a baby?</i>

366
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,955
<i>Snap out of it and get started.</i>

367
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,825
<i>What are you doing? Hurry up!</i>

368
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,065
<i>Mom...</i>

369
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,935
<i>Who are you looking for?</i>

370
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,075
<i>You don't have a mom!</i>

371
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,709
<i>You are alone in this world.</i>

372
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,479
<i>You exist alone!</i>

373
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,249
<i>Here. Get to work.</i>

374
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,615
<i>Get it together.</i>

375
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,515
<i>Start the machine.</i>

376
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,145
<i>And keep the distance.</i>

377
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,685
<i>Focus on the movement of the needle.</i>

378
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,125
<i>That's it. Good job.</i>

379
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,265
<i>Yu-jin.</i>

380
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,505
<i>You got accepted</i>

381
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,175
<i>to Antwerp.</i>

382
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,005
<i>Really?</i>

383
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,745
<i>Gosh. I knew you could do it!</i>

384
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,885
<i>Good job. Well done.</i>

385
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,295
<i>Yu-jin.</i>

386
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,505
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

387
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,165
<i>CHTV</i>

388
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,605
Seung-mo.

389
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,335
Do you really think

390
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,705
we'll be able to run the restaurant
after a few days?

391
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,775
We need to make it happen.

392
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,015
What's taking them so long?

393
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,745
Hurry up and come out!

394
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,559
Unni, aren't you cold?

395
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,499
What do you mean? Fashion is all about

396
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,029
going against the weather.

397
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,399
Gosh, style is all about looking cool.

398
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,699
Haven't you heard of "swag"?

399
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,609
Oh, is that why you're wearing

400
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,935
that pleated skirt in front of Bella?

401
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,275
There's no answer to fashion.

402
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,979
Just follow your own style.

403
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,649
That's right.

404
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,449
But you might catch a cold

405
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,749
if you stay out for too long.
It will be a long shoot.

406
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,215
Don't worry.

407
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,359
Gosh!

408
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,859
Hyo-sook, are you all right?
Hurry up and wear this. I'm good.

409
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,329
I said I'm all right!

410
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,555
Goodness.

411
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,499
- My gosh!
- Goodness!

412
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,835
Yoon-ja! Slow down!

413
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,895
- Gosh!
- Slow down!

414
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,069
Is everyone here?

415
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,609
Why didn't you bring your car?

416
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,779
Our car broke down.

417
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,509
If we're going to cook there,

418
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,815
we need all this.

419
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,045
Don't even bother.

420
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,719
She was even trying
to load firewood here.

421
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,219
I had such a hard time stopping her.

422
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,489
But still,
we're going to need a fireplace

423
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,899
if we're going camping. Gosh.

424
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,765
Yoon-ja. Don't you worry about that.

425
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,795
This way!

426
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,265
- Hello!
- Come this way.

427
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,609
Over here.

428
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,665
- Hello!
- Stop here.

429
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,175
Goodness!

430
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,479
I knew you had good taste, Jang-dan!

431
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,479
Chef Moon's Cooking Camp! Load it up!

432
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,245
- Help me carry this.
- Okay.

433
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,945
Why did you bring a vacuum?

434
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,759
- Gosh.
- Careful.

435
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,155
Be careful!

436
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,465
This way.

437
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,705
<i>I'm meeting the smuggler today.</i>

438
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,415
What's this?
Are you hiding something from me?

439
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,985
Of course not.

440
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,925
Is it...

441
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,395
Because you're nervous?

442
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,739
Gosh, it's because
I have no idea where to start

443
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,135
in order to teach them cooking.

444
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,235
Why did that punk have to set this up?

445
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,905
What are you worried about?

446
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,745
You'll be there, anyway.

447
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,745
It's just a show.

448
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,875
Sure.

449
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,615
Still, they'll have to be able
to do it without me.

450
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,155
- Goodness!
- Here.

451
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,965
That's pretty! There you go.

452
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,865
Is it good? Take one for me too.

453
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,915
Lower it a bit more.

454
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,325
Have you been here before?

455
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,869
- It's my first time.
- Is it?

456
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,569
The camera is on here.

457
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,765
Wait a minute...

458
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,565
Right here.

459
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,535
It's not heavy.

460
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,079
- I feel much better.
- Yes.

461
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,245
Look, this is where we will sleep.

462
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,779
So we're sleeping here?

463
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,049
Sure. You're doing a good job.

464
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,619
I did this before.

465
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,915
We will be using this.

466
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,265
What is that? That's pretty.

467
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,639
- Right?
- Yes.

468
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,695
Sure.

469
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:54,049
<i>Chef Moon's Cooking Camp</i>

470
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,885
Pull this side up a bit.

471
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,785
- Yes. Tie it there.
- Okay.

472
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,665
Mr. Choi?

473
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,085
Chef Moon's Cooking Camp

474
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
<i>The smugglers are ready.</i>

475
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,454
<i>We have two days now.</i>

476
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,395
How much money do we need?

477
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,829
I got the lawyer to retract

478
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,869
the Jaeil PE private equity fund,

479
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,965
but that's going to take some time.

480
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,204
I'll figure out a way. Let's get out.

481
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,595
Did my warning sound
like a joke to you?

482
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,625
What are you talking about?

483
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,739
I haven't been doing anything
ever since you told me not to.

484
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,805
No, not you.

485
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,645
I meant Jun-su.

486
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,115
He's working very hard.

487
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,265
Did you not tell him
that he'll end up like his father?

488
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,465
Please, please don't do that.

489
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,935
He's your son, too.

490
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,815
That's why I came all the way here
to warn you.

491
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,955
What can I do for you?

492
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,085
I'll do anything.

493
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,255
Please don't hurt Jun-su.

494
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,455
Please, I'm begging you.

495
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,665
Go straight down this way.

496
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,905
Good.

497
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,109
I'm chopping the radish non-stop here.

498
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,439
How long do we need to do this for?

499
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,779
I know how filming works.
Do we really have to do it like this?

500
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,679
Seung-mo, can't we stop here?

501
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,445
Chef Moon, let's stop.
This is pointless.

502
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,249
Keep your pace up
and chop consistently.

503
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,055
Keep everything this size, all right?

504
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,165
I'm now going to start talking
about the menus.

505
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,179
It's not our main menu,

506
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,845
but a new one that you can make easily
at home.

507
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,279
Dad, is it made with the sausages here?

508
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,249
Yes.

509
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,889
Is cooking them really necessary?
They're good as they are.

510
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,285
Let's get working.

511
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,789
Please heat up your frying pan.

512
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,925
Okay.

513
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,365
Take a sausage and put it on the pan.

514
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,035
Next, pour in about 1cm of water.

515
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,109
You don't need any oil.

516
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,545
Just keep cooking the sausage
until the water has evaporated.

517
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,979
Once the water has evaporated,

518
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,545
cook the sausage until it's toasted.

519
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,385
Once the sausage is cooked,
turn off the heat

520
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,625
and transfer it to the other pan.

521
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,529
Like this.

522
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,495
Wipe your frying pan clean
to start working on the egg pilaf.

523
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,895
Yes, sir.

524
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,049
I can't help myself,

525
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,879
I'm going to try some of it.

526
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,045
This is hot.

527
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,085
It's delicious.

528
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,155
It's so juicy.

529
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,035
My goodness.

530
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,505
This is some intense training.

531
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,075
We've still got a long way to go.

532
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,475
We don't have time.
We can't run a restaurant like this.

533
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,215
I thought you said
that it's our restaurant.

534
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,915
We have to sell menus
other than gukbap.

535
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,855
You think food is a joke to people?

536
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,559
When the flavors change even slightly,
restaurants fail just like that.

537
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,995
Fine.

538
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,895
But don't you think this is too much?

539
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,995
It's not like you're never coming back.

540
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,569
Where are you going?

541
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,575
I have to prepare for a class
after dinner.

542
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,879
Take it easy!

543
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,575
We're on a camping trip,
for goodness' sake!

544
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,495
What is it?

545
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,665
I don't have a lot of time.

546
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,335
Jun-su,

547
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,235
let me know if you need help
with anything.

548
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,615
I was being too weak.

549
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,615
I just want to help,

550
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,955
so let me know

551
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,015
if you need anything.

552
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,055
Mother,

553
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,925
actually,

554
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,765
I'm retracting my private equity fund

555
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,505
to collect enough money to pay Mr. Jin,

556
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,605
but I don't think I can make it
by the deadline.

557
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,075
How much do you need?

558
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,245
I'll help you out.

559
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,645
Thank you.

560
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,645
No worries.

561
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,785
When and where

562
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,725
is this exchange happening?

563
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,469
- I think I did quite a good job.
- It's driving me crazy.

564
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,699
This is...

565
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,505
I told you, we can't use the fish
if you prepare it like this.

566
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,769
Do it again.

567
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,539
Seriously?

568
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,505
- Show me.
- This is really good.

569
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,305
That's spot-on.

570
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,315
Chef Moon,

571
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,985
don't you think we're working too hard?
It's just our first day.

572
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,825
And I mean that both for yourself
and for the rest of the village people.

573
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,585
We have to work hard.
Pass me the knife.

574
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,425
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

575
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,925
I told you, you shouldn't do that.

576
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,965
Are you okay?

577
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,009
- I'm fine.
- Chef Moon...

578
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,369
Let me just go wash my hand up.

579
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,375
- What's wrong?
- You should hold it with your hand.

580
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,015
Why are you doing this?

581
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,615
- What do you mean?
- It's weird.

582
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,989
We all thought we
were just going camping.

583
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,219
You're hurt and people overworked
because you...

584
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,585
What?

585
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,955
They have to learn how to cook, too.

586
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,599
If the restaurant belongs to everyone
and not just me,

587
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,929
everyone needs to do their part.

588
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,525
That's what everyone
has been doing now.

589
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,799
Yoon-ja prepares ingredients,

590
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,499
- Are they fighting?
- Ms. Byung-chun cleans,

591
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,069
Ms. Pi tidies everything up,

592
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,369
Bong-doo takes care of parking,
and Chul-nam is on the finances.

593
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,105
Everyone is doing their best...

594
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,805
Maybe Chul-nam messed up
on the finances.

595
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,075
My goodness.

596
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,379
- What do we do?
- Is this all my fault?

597
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,475
- Yes, it's all your fault.
- Darn you.

598
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,065
Bella, don't be too disheartened.

599
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,205
He must be feeling extra pressured

600
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,505
because he's taking
on his parents' restaurant name.

601
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,705
You're right. Don't be too sad.

602
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,409
But Chef Moon was too harsh for sure.

603
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,845
He's too by-the-books.

604
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,415
<i>Donghan</i>

605
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,829
<i>Han Mi-young</i>

606
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,790
<i>Two days later at 11 pm,</i>

607
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,755
<i>Pyeongtaek Port Distribution Facility.</i>

608
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,665
Motherly love,

609
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,665
indeed.

610
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,915
Give me the money first.

611
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,855
See it for yourself.

612
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,595
It's perfect.

613
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,735
It's really dark.
How are you taking photos?

614
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,445
Wait.

615
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,985
I'd like to meet tomorrow instead.

616
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,115
What do you mean?

617
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,915
Someone is following us.

618
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,525
<i>You've been busted?</i>

619
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,795
<i>Don't worry too much.</i>

620
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,125
<i>But I'm meeting up with him
tomorrow instead.</i>

621
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,125
- Tomorrow?
- <i>Yes.</i>

622
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,895
<i>And...</i>

623
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,935
you're going to have to meet Mr. Jin

624
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,735
<i>since they're following me.</i>

625
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,375
All right, then.

626
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,179
Good work, everyone!

627
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,389
It was nothing.

628
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,815
Let's eat.

629
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,089
- We're doing great.
- We are.

630
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,359
Chef is an artist.

631
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,659
- You're right.
- Lower your voice.

632
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,159
Absolutely.

633
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,665
He didn't mean it, don't worry.

634
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,499
We planned for a series of
classic blue, the color of the year.

635
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,135
- We...
- That's too cliche.

636
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,105
We used a variety of classic blue...

637
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,445
Get out.

638
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,105
- Sorry?
- Don't come back again.

639
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,075
- What?
- Ma'am,

640
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,089
the planning team took the whole night
to prepare this.

641
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,255
Ms. Seo,

642
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,459
do you not want to come back
from the next meeting on as well?

643
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,925
I'm sorry.

644
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,399
It's not a Donghan International show,

645
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,695
it's a Bella show.

646
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,065
I don't want to see anyone else
for this meeting

647
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,835
except for Ms. Seo
from the next meeting.

648
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,705
I'm going to work on the designs,

649
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,045
so get a new team for the next meeting.

650
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,719
I said, I'm going to
work on my designs.

651
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,075
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,385
Let's head out.

653
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,069
Is this all? Goodness.

654
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,735
Give me that.

655
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,805
Good work, everyone.

656
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,149
We'll continue filming at the
restaurant in the afternoon.

657
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,209
- What?
- What?

658
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,745
You're coming to the restaurant?

659
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,519
My goodness.

660
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,715
Producer,

661
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,049
I don't think we can film today.

662
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,185
Sorry?

663
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,719
We can't delay our schedule.

664
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,855
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,255
That's okay.

666
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,599
Sure.

667
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,999
- Chef Moon!
- Thank you!

668
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,669
- You're the best.
- Chef Moon!

669
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,735
- Let's go!
- Chef Moon!

670
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,509
I was going to quit
if we were filming today, too!

671
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,709
Same here.

672
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,739
Chef Moon really knows
how to treat people.

673
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,445
That's how he got her, after all.

674
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,575
- Get in the car.
- All right.

675
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,659
This is too heavy.

676
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,659
My goodness.

677
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,225
What do we do?

678
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,765
NFS has handed us
over all the information

679
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,665
on the cases

680
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,565
that Mr. Oh Jung-tae is involved in.

681
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,439
What do we do?

682
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,705
How did you get all of that?

683
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,505
"All of that"?

684
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,915
Tell me more.

685
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,055
I'll write up a good report for you.

686
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,355
You know that your sentence is reduced
if you come clean, right?

687
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,155
Right?

688
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,095
I don't know. I don't know anything!

689
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,105
You don't? All right.

690
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,935
If all of that ends up on your record,

691
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,805
that'll be 5, 10,

692
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,145
15 years.

693
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,415
Seems like you'll be in jail
until you turn into an old man.

694
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,245
I'm leaving now.

695
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,655
I'm really leaving now.

696
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,725
Hold on.

697
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,469
They want to meet at 9 pm tonight.
I'll send you the location.

698
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:05,565
Okay.

699
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,435
I should've been more careful.

700
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,739
I apologize.

701
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,905
<i>That's okay, don't worry about it.
I'll let you know when I get there.</i>

702
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,175
Okay.

703
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,475
What?

704
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,945
What do you think?

705
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,415
I'm exhausted.

706
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,855
Let's get some rest.

707
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,195
Seung-mo,

708
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,695
what are you doing?

709
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,125
Why are you packing already?

710
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,635
Isn't it tomorrow?

711
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,565
We're meeting up tonight.

712
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,635
What?

713
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,105
<i>Officer Jo</i>

714
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,545
Yes, Officer Jo.

715
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,545
Seung-mo!

716
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,085
Dad, where are you going?

717
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,625
Byeol-na unni, what's wrong with him?

718
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,029
Where is he going?

719
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,699
He got a call from Officer Jo

720
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,269
and he ran out like that.

721
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,495
What about Soon-mi?

722
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,695
Seung-mo!

723
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,235
Dad, where are you going?

724
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,775
Byeol-na unni, what's wrong with him?

725
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,179
Where is he going?

726
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,849
He got a call from Officer Jo

727
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,419
and he ran out like that.

728
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,645
What about Soon-mi?

729
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,529
What do you mean?

730
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,629
The fire at Pungcheonok in Seoul
wasn't an accident?

731
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,695
Remember Oh Jung-tae,
the man arrested the last time?

732
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,225
He's a terrible man.

733
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,829
When he got arrested,
all the unresolved cases related to him

734
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,799
were being investigated all over again,

735
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,965
and...

736
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,035
one of those was

737
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,375
the fire accident at
Pungcheonok in Seoul.

738
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,975
Are you saying that
he started the fire?

739
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,845
He just confessed.

740
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,885
Where is he?

741
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,725
Why?

742
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,425
I don't know.

743
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,965
I did just as I was told.

744
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,129
I had no idea that people would die.

745
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,265
Who told you to do it?

746
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,035
I don't know anything,

747
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,265
only Mr. Jin knows.

748
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,135
Mr. Jin?

749
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,985
Sir.

750
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:51,829
Why?

751
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:54,395
We can't get in touch

752
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,555
with one of our spies since last night.

753
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,225
What?

754
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,735
Chef Moon!

755
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,035
Where are you going?

756
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,905
You can train us tonight.

757
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,915
We're all ready to be trained.

758
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,655
I have

759
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,025
something to tell you.

760
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,595
I won't be

761
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,505
- able to...
- We have something for you.

762
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,839
Are you still not done with it?

763
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,175
I'm coming!

764
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,529
What's this?

765
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,465
We prepared a lunchbox
with the recipes you taught us.

766
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,005
We can't guarantee you
that it'll taste good.

767
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,639
It'd be weird if it tasted good.

768
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,075
Hey, we did just as we were taught.

769
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,275
If it's bad, that's all your fault.

770
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:58,449
Why are you giving this to me?

771
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,485
We noticed that you haven't been eating
since yesterday.

772
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,985
We heard that you're
going to Seoul today.

773
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,855
Have some of this and have a safe trip.

774
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,035
They kept asking me
where you were going.

775
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,505
It has something to do
with your parents, right?

776
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,005
- Sorry?
- We asked

777
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,105
Soon-mi what was going on.

778
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,245
We don't know what it is,

779
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,485
but it seems like it's
not for us to know.

780
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,155
Good luck.

781
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,355
Yes, sir.

782
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,309
Close them up before dust gets in.

783
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,479
Close them up.

784
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,739
- Careful.
- Close them up.

785
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,545
Put them in here.

786
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,025
Yu-jin...

787
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,625
I'm disappointed.

788
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,895
How could you keep it a secret
even from me?

789
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,895
Yu-jin.

790
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,065
I knew something was up

791
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,135
because you've been
weird since yesterday.

792
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,335
I'm sorry, Yu-jin.

793
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,405
I'm sorry.

794
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,245
I understand. It's about your parents.

795
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,985
But

796
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,125
promise me

797
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,055

822
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,745
I don't see him yet.

- I'll wait here.

824

Will do.
