<i>(Mr. Lim Chul-yong)</i>

3
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,403
(Episode 15)

4
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:19,070
<i>Jang Sun-young!</i>

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,640
You think you can get away with this?

6
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,550
I lost everything because of you,

7
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,520
so what makes you
think you can scare me?

8
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,460
<i>Your daughter will learn
a good lesson from this.</i>

9
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:40,400
She'll stop copying
other people's designs now.

10
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,700
Chairman Lim Chul-yong,

11
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,544
if you pulled a fraud
to steal a company,

12
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:49,274
then you should've
made sure to hide it.

13
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:52,040
<i>How embarrassing is this?</i>

14
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>You're going to have to suffer for this</i>

15
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,950
now that Belle Ombre is your company.

16
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,280
You lost everything, you say?

17
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:03,920
You think I don't know

18
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:08,590
that Yoo Yu-jin is in Pungcheonok?

19
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:10,630
<i>I'm going to</i>

20
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,060
make her end up just like Hyun-ah.

21
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:16,770
Just wait and see.

22
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,600
Lim Chul-yong!

23
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,613
<i>(New message, Madame Jang)</i>

24
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,120
<i>Lim Chul-yong knows that you're there.</i>

25
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:39,120
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:42,690
I was on the phone with him
because of Lim Hyun-ah's incident.

27
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,190
What?

28
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:47,660
Were you behind Lim Hyun-ah's incident?

29
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:50,770
Yes. I was behind it.

30
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,770
What difference does it make?

31
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:58,074
It has nothing to do with me.
It's all over now.

32
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,340
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

33
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:04,209
It was my revenge
for your mother, Hyo-myoung.

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,790
What... do you mean?

35
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,520
<i>Don't be so hard on yourself.</i>

36
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,420
<i>Yu-jin's parents</i>

37
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:19,330
<i>didn't die because of you, Ms. Jang.</i>

38
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:22,804
<i>Lim Chul-yong did it.</i>

39
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,704
<i>20 years ago,
Lim Chul-yong committed the murder</i>

40
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,240
<i>and covered it up as an accident.</i>

41
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,740
<i>My mother told me all about it.</i>

42
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,380
<i>Actually, I went there that day
to tell you the truth about her death.</i>

43
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:39,710
But when I saw you smile
so brightly there,

44
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,450
I just couldn't bring myself
to tell you the truth.

45
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,790
<i>Things are already tough
for you as it is.</i>

46
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46,660
<i>I didn't want to make you suffer more.</i>

47
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,890
<i>I couldn't gather up my courage.</i>

48
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,450
I told you to go find Ms. Seo.
What happened?

49
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,750
Find her and bring her to me now.

50
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:17,990
And I want you to look into everyone

51
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,460
around me.

52
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,230
Don't leave out anyone.

53
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,730
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

54
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:43,554
I already put in a good word
for you with them.

55
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,880
Once you get there,
you'll have a job waiting for you.

56
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,780
Thank you for looking out for me.

57
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:51,890
Ms. Seo.

58
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,390
Can you tell me
what happened to Lim Hyun-ah?

59
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,390
She ended up getting
transported to the hospital.

60
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,700
She brought it upon herself.

61
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,130
<i>Then, goodbye.</i>

62
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,130
Let me say this again.

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,710
I'm not going to Mr. Kang or Ms. Han

64
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,540
because they will

65
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:35,680
only use me to bring down Mr. Lim.

66
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,880
They will never protect me.

67
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,120
So

68
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,120
don't sell me out to them.

69
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:51,760
Don't get out.

70
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:58,300
I'll let you know once I have proof.

71
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:26,870
Yu-jin!

72
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,170
What brings you here?

73
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,610
Why didn't you tell me?

74
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,210
What?

75
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,140
About my mom.

76
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,190
- I must go see Lim Chul-yong.
- What will you do?

77
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm going to kill him.

78
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,060
I was able to persuade Mr. Jung.

79
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,270
I located Lim Chul-yong's
right-hand man, Mr. Jung,

80
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,129
and was able to persuade him.

81
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,540
If you go to him now,
you'll ruin everything.

82
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:16,350
You must be patient right now
for you to take your revenge.

83
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,824
<i>Mr. Lim isn't in his office.</i>

84
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:24,060
<i>Then, I'll wait in his office.</i>

85
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:25,920
<i>Okay.</i>

86
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,354
<i>You're here, sir.</i>

87
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,720
<i>Mr. Jung is waiting for you inside.</i>

88
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:00,790
I'm going to meet
with Ms. Jang and Mr. Kang.

89
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,160
Come with me.

90
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:08,374
Her assistant worked
on the design to practice.

91
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,770
It has nothing to do with her show.

92
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,800
My gosh, yes.

93
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:17,240
Okay. Yes. I'm counting on you.

94
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,710
Okay.

95
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:25,380
Yes, Reporter Park. I see. Goodness.

96
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,120
Well, you ought to help me out
in a time of a crisis.

97
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,390
Yes. Okay.

98
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,520
I see. Then, thank you for your help.

99
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,830
You heard about Belle Ombre, right?

100
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:41,734
The share price for
Donghan International

101
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,170
took a deep dive yesterday
because of Belle Ombre's incident.

102
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,004
Given the condition of Hyun-ah,

103
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:48,540
I don't think
anything good will come out of it.

104
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:53,810
It has affected the company
and me, personally too much.

105
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,320
That's why I must ask you

106
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,760
to go down to Seoha Village.

107
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,960
- Pardon?
- Moon Seung-mo and Yoo Yu-jin.

108
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,830
Bring them to me.

109
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:17,670
I must show them the consequence
of their attempt to bring me down.

110
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,170
Why don't you return
as the managing director

111
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:26,010
after you take care of that?

112
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,110
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,720
If you understood, leave.

114
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,860
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:41,230
Right.

116
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,460
You must make a statement as a witness.

117
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:45,700
Pardon? I see.

118
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,830
- Okay.
- Since we're on the subject, do it soon.

119
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,170
If you stall,
people will get the wrong idea.

120
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,010
Yes, sir. I will.

121
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,290
<i>Mr. Jung?</i>

122
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,460
<i>I can't trust him.</i>

123
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,060
I agree.

124
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,264
If Mr. Lim tells him to die,
he'll even fake his own death.

125
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,664
He's one of his trusted people.

126
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:19,800
He was

127
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,530
scared that he might be
the next target after Mr. Jin.

128
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,970
For now, we should believe in his fear.

129
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,710
Lim Chul-yong called me last night.

130
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:38,120
He already knew that Yu-jin
was staying at Pungcheonok.

131
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,580
What?

132
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,620
It's probably because of Lim Hyun-ah.

133
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,324
Unlike his usual self,
he got all worked up

134
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,820
and threatened Yu-jin's life.

135
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,034
I want her to stay with me
for the time being.

136
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,200
No.

137
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:53,934
That might put you in danger too.

138
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,100
Yu-jin.

139
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,140
Perhaps,

140
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,940
this might be our chance.

141
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,410
- Pardon?
- He's worked up unlike his usual self.

142
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:08,880
It means he's feeling
a lot of pressure.

143
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,180
Let's put more pressure on him.

144
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:12,750
That might give us a chance.

145
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:16,094
Right. From what I observed today,
the share price

146
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,160
for International plummeted
because of Belle Ombre.

147
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,860
Why don't you meet
with the shareholders?

148
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,430
I'll do that.

149
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,300
Then,

150
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,230
I'll meet with Lim Hyun-ah.

151
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:29,600
Lim Hyun-ah?

152
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,570
She's his weak spot.

153
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,440
Wait.

154
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:38,810
Yes, Mr. Jung.

155
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:42,950
What about the proof? Did you find it?

156
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,580
I couldn't.

157
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,820
<i>But...</i>

158
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,920
I need to go to the police
to testify as a witness.

159
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,760
- What?
- <i>I met with Mr. Lim.</i>

160
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,660
He told me that
I should take care of it now.

161
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,860
If I don't go now,

162
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:02,130
<i>it's likely that he will suspect me.</i>

163
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,500
Okay. I see.

164
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,970
I'll see you at the police station.

165
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:09,910
Chef Moon.

166
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,680
Don't trust Mr. Jung too much.

167
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,520
- What? Bella is gone again?
- Yes.

168
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,250
She's with my dad.

169
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,324
- What?
- What?

170
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,490
I called Seung-mo just in case
if something happened to her.

171
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,730
He's with her now.

172
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,834
- My gosh.
- Don't worry too much.

173
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,164
He must have missed her a lot.

174
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,370
Right.

175
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:38,274
I want to fall crazy
in love with a man.

176
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,974
- My gosh.
- What about me?

177
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,310
Get lost!

178
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,910
- Gosh. Sit down.
- Goodness.

179
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,080
Oh, my.

180
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,180
By the way,

181
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:51,780
Bella made us great outfits.

182
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,924
Shouldn't we do something
for her in return?

183
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,324
- Right?
- Yes.

184
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:57,660
What should we do for her?

185
00:11:58,265 --> 00:11:59,790
How about putting on a fashion show?

186
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:01,460
A fashion show?

187
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:04,360
She made the outfits for us.
We ought to put on a show for her.

188
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,304
You have a point.

189
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,504
Right.

190
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:11,874
Why don't we all dress up
for this fashion show?

191
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,374
- That sounds nice. I like this idea.
- Yes.

192
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,680
By the way, what do we
know about fashion shows?

193
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:24,580
How about we ask the
broadcasting company to help us?

194
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:25,880
What?

195
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,080
Nice.

196
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,394
Seol-ah, you're so smart.

197
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,894
- Let me call them now.
- Yes, go ahead.

198
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:33,020
Hold on.

199
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,160
Since we're doing this,

200
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,500
I want to put up a big screen
at the fashion show.

201
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,970
A screen? Why?

202
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,770
I shouldn't have

203
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,680
told you about your mother's death.

204
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:00,690
I regretted telling you all night long.

205
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:02,590
No.

206
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,490
If you hadn't told me,

207
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,930
I would have resented you more.

208
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:13,660
By the way,

209
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,570
why do you want to see Lim Hyun-ah?

210
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,710
I was trying to take
revenge on Lim Chul-yong.

211
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,770
But I get the feeling

212
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,540
that she will get all the
punishment in the end.

213
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,320
You feel sorry for her.

214
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:36,990
I don't know.

215
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:41,660
When I look at Hyun-ah, sometimes,

216
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,830
she reminds me of myself.

217
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,180
It's all done.

218
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,190
<i>She doesn't need to be admitted.</i>

219
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,030
<i>It's because she's humiliated.</i>

220
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,430
<i>- Why?
- Didn't you see the news?</i>

221
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,570
<i>She plagiarized designs
for her fashion show.</i>

222
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,130
<i>I think she's the fake Bella.</i>

223
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:29,540
I'll go with you.

224
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,440
You might run into Lim Chul-yong.

225
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:36,750
Why don't you go to the rooftop garden?

226
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:39,250
I won't take long. Okay?

227
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,450
<i>"Going down."</i>

228
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,330
What are you doing right now?

229
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,500
Ms. Bella.

230
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,800
Did you steal my name
just to throw it away?

231
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,770
If you went this far to take my name,
you should have done better!

232
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:56,990
Isn't it tough?

233
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,810
I know.

234
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,750
It was tough for me
just like it is for you.

235
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:23,890
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:29,260
Ms. Bella, I'm sorry.

237
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,980
You can't even handle
this mess yourself.

238
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:27,350
How did you put up
with everything you did so far?

239
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:32,520
What you did in the past

240
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,660
is definitely wrong.

241
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:37,760
But don't downplay your talent.

242
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:41,900
What?

243
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,270
You're pretty good.

244
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:45,970
You're excellent.

245
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:51,580
The reason you keep relying on others

246
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:54,010
is that you don't trust your own self.

247
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,480
Ma'am...

248
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,650
And don't abuse your body.

249
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,690
Ma'am,

250
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,060
can't you take me too?

251
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:16,270
- What?
- I want to

252
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,200
get away from my dad.

253
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,194
Goodness.

254
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:43,490
I'm so sorry for calling in
such a busy man.

255
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:44,830
Not at all, sir.

256
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,570
A witness is merely a witness,

257
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,044
but some punk kept mentioning your name

258
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,440
when you're such a busy man.

259
00:19:01,285 --> 00:19:02,480
Sorry?

260
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:06,650
We will take care of the case
on the Pungcheonok fire,

261
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,750
so you can just enjoy your coffee
and relax, sir.

262
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:15,460
And if anything goes wrong,
don't ever hesitate to call me.

263
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,830
Here.

264
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,410
<i>(Detective Unit)</i>

265
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:52,030
<i>(Chairman Lim Chul-yong)</i>

266
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,340
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

267
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:01,640
Did the investigation go well?

268
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,540
Yes, sir. Thanks to you,

269
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,984
I had a comfortable time here.

270
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:10,810
All right. Good job.

271
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,630
Follow him back to Seoha Village,

272
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,340
and when he's done there,

273
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,340
finish him off as well.

274
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,140
Yes, sir.

275
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:47,020
What are you talking about, Yu-jin?

276
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:49,020
You want to take Hyun-ah as well?

277
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:55,690
Mr. Jung is here.
I'll call you back later.

278
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,760
Mr. Jung. How did it go?

279
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,430
Well...

280
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,540
I don't have any clear evidence, so...

281
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,340
I will find the evidence

282
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:13,580
and return to Seoha Village.

283
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,690
Why does Mr. Kang want to see us?

284
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:23,690
I know.

285
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:27,190
I keep wondering if we should have

286
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:31,164
switched sides
after that fake Bella incident.

287
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,630
What are you talking about?

288
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:35,470
It's obvious, watching the
Belle Ombre situation, don't you think?

289
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:39,170
International is causing
too big of damage.

290
00:21:39,405 --> 00:21:40,840
You're right.

291
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,144
If people find out that
Chairman Han's will

292
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:47,140
at the hospital room was fabricated...

293
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,310
Watch out.

294
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,420
What's so interesting?

295
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,124
Were you talking behind my back?

296
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,824
Your mouths are closed shut
now that I'm here.

297
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,190
Of course, not.

298
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,460
Did you see the news yesterday?

299
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,160
Lim Chul-yong's misdeeds
are slowly being exposed,

300
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,400
so you should think well.

301
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,474
The company needs to run smoothly

302
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:17,270
in order for you to earn money too.

303
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:22,610
Here.

304
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,324
Seoha Teahouse

305
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,520
Our camping trip show was a huge hit.

306
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:32,290
What do you say to another episode?

307
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:35,364
Well, I was just about to suggest that.

308
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:37,134
Last time, we went camping.

309
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:40,134
This time, it will be
about fashion and food.

310
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,070
What do you say?

311
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,804
It will be a collaboration
between a fashion show and food,

312
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,304
here at Seoha village.

313
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,840
"A fashion show and food"?
That sounds good.

314
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,670
- But who will hold the fashion show?
- Don't worry.

315
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:54,814
We have a world-famous designer
in our village.

316
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:55,980
Yes.

317
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,680
And we have a top model.

318
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,250
Lim Hyun-ah to Seoha Village?

319
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:06,220
I was also doubtful at first,

320
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,560
but this could be our best weapon

321
00:23:08,635 --> 00:23:10,590
to pressure Lim Chul-yong.

322
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:14,830
And the girl wants it so much.

323
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,670
That's true,

324
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:19,840
but we don't know what Lim Chul-yong
would do if he finds out.

325
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,470
Isn't it too dangerous?

326
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,140
I think we should
aim for that, exactly.

327
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:26,314
What? But...

328
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,880
We don't have any clear evidence
to pressure him yet.

329
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,120
Do you really think
we should be acting like this?

330
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,950
If we don't have evidence,

331
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:36,650
we need to make it.

332
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,100
If we don't have evidence,

333
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,800
we need to make it.

334
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:01,850
Follow me.

335
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:20,840
- Come inside, ma'am.
- All right.

336
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:25,340
Let's go.

337
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,760
Dad!

338
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:46,730
It's been so long, Chef Moon.

339
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:49,400
Did you take care of things in Seoul?

340
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:51,004
- Yes, sir.
- You know,

341
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,874
we were worried about you too,

342
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:56,010
but we were so anxious,
thinking she had disappeared again.

343
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,384
That's right.

344
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:02,584
Next time, tell us ahead
if you're going to be gone.

345
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,050
- Yes.
- That's right.

346
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:07,620
I'm sorry.
I'll be sure to tell you next time.

347
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:09,290
All right.

348
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:10,790
- Gosh.
- Okay.

349
00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:17,330
Madame Jang, you're back.

350
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,970
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

351
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:23,770
Hyun-ah.

352
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:25,200
Come on in.

353
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:27,210
- What?
- Goodness!

354
00:25:27,715 --> 00:25:29,170
That's the fake Bella!

355
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:30,744
- What?
- Hey!

356
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:33,350
Hey, that lady is here!

357
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:35,150
- She's the fake one!
- Goodness!

358
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,380
Let me introduce her.

359
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,390
This is

360
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:43,720
Designer Lim Hyun-ah.

361
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,564
- What?
- Be quiet.

362
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,530
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

363
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:53,604
Goodness!

364
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:56,644
We can't let a guest
stand there like that.

365
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,904
- Oh, yes.
- You're right.

366
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:01,410
- Come and sit down.
- Come.

367
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,514
We will get you a cold drink.

368
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:05,544
- Yes, that's right.
- Come on.

369
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,914
Let's go.

370
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,110
Yes, hello.

371
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:12,994
This is great.

372
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:16,720
We're holding a fashion show,
and you're like a savior to us.

373
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:17,864
A fashion show?

374
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:19,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

375
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:23,500
We will be holding a fashion show
with the clothes you made for us.

376
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,930
We were going to surprise you
when you came back.

377
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:30,674
She made clothes for you?

378
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,974
Yes, would you like to see?

379
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,210
Sure.

380
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,340
So you've started making clothes again?

381
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,250
You thought well.

382
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,924
The broadcasting company

383
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,320
wanted to do another episode,

384
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:49,190
so we're preparing to shoot one
about fashion and food.

385
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,020
- When?
- In two days.

386
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:53,460
What?

387
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,160
Isn't it pretty?

388
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:01,230
She made it for me.

389
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,540
It's so pretty.

390
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,910
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

391
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,150
Yes.

392
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,050
It's so pretty.

393
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:25,360
What happened?

394
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:28,634
I thought she was going for a walk...

395
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:29,800
So...

396
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:32,630
You're saying you don't know
where she went?

397
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:35,670
We checked the
surveillance cameras, sir.

398
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:49,620
Moon Seung-mo...

399
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,384
- What do I do?
- Do it like him.

400
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:55,894
- We practiced last time!
- Don't you remember?

401
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:57,364
We did.

402
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:59,420
- Goodness.
- All right, wait.

403
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,390
I can do it.

404
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:05,460
Lim Chul-yong must
have found out by now

405
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:09,300
that Hyun-ah is gone, right?

406
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,010
I think so.

407
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:16,810
Do you think it will be
okay for us to hold

408
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:18,880
the fashion show?

409
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,254
- Move swiftly.
- Swiftly.

410
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:23,454
- Slow down.
- Are you dancing?

411
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,224
- Like this.
- Come on.

412
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,390
They're so excited

413
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:29,720
to do it for me.

414
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:35,230
Besides,
they're scheduled to shoot it for TV.

415
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:37,400
How can I tell them not to?

416
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,570
It might be better off this way.

417
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,700
What?

418
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,740
Lim Chul-yong will
be taking action soon.

419
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:52,340
If the villagers stay here until late
preparing for the show,

420
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,680
it might be better.

421
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:56,880
We might need their help.

422
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:58,720
Yes.

423
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:01,390
If we all fight together,

424
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:04,720
we might have a chance
against Lim Chul-yong.

425
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,200
We should tell the villagers.

426
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,514
Look at me.

427
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:22,914
Follow me with confidence.

428
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:24,514
- Hurry up!
- What is it?

429
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,580
- Help me, Hyo-sook.
- I'll do it.

430
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,420
I have something to tell you.

431
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:32,920
- What?
- What?

432
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:34,720
What is it?

433
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,790
Unni.

434
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:44,760
This is our backyard.

435
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:47,430
Isn't it so pretty?

436
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:54,340
Yes.

437
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,450
Unni. Sit over here.

438
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:05,980
Okay.

439
00:30:09,095 --> 00:30:12,760
My dad often sits out here.

440
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:15,860
He says it calms his mind

441
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:17,400
and relieves anger.

442
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:20,874
That's why I tried
to sit here sometimes

443
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,300
just like my dad.

444
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,440
Maybe it's because I'm too young,

445
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:28,640
but I don't get it, to be honest.

446
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,610
- Was it Seol-ah?
- Yes.

447
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:37,220
Do you like your dad, Seol-ah?

448
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,750
I like him so much.

449
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:41,750
My dad can be a bit grumpy,

450
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,690
but he actually has a huge heart.

451
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:46,860
That's what Byeol-na unni said.

452
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:51,560
Seol-ah,

453
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:54,430
you're so lucky.

454
00:30:58,145 --> 00:30:59,470
It's pretty.

455
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:10,520
I never thought they would be so bold.

456
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:14,290
I will drive down first thing tomorrow

457
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:16,490
to save Ms. Lim Hyun-ah

458
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,260
and bring Moon Seung-mo and Yoo Yu-jin

459
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,630
back to you, sir.

460
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,070
Not just like that.

461
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:42,450
We should prepare a special event

462
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:46,080
at a special place.

463
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:48,450
Sorry?

464
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:00,900
I've never felt

465
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:04,200
anything like this before.

466
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,640
What do you mean?

467
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:11,640
It feels warm

468
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:13,880
and cozy.

469
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:16,880
Free

470
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,720
and cute too.

471
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,490
Yes, you're right.

472
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,990
Looking at Seol-ah's dress,

473
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,160
it seems like Bella's style

474
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:34,400
has changed that way too.

475
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:37,770
How should I say this...

476
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,440
She seems carefree,

477
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:43,610
and as if she's saying,

478
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:47,680
"Yes, this is me."

479
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,320
Do you think

480
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:53,790
I could be like that too?

481
00:32:57,195 --> 00:32:59,930
Of course. You can do it.

482
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:08,330
Watching the villagers earlier,

483
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,540
I felt so envious.

484
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:15,640
Of the village

485
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,340
and this house.

486
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:22,280
But...

487
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,950
Don't you think it's so ironic?

488
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:29,320
She ended up here because of you.

489
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm saying this to ease your guilt.

490
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:43,940
Thank you

491
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:47,670
for bringing me here too.

492
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:52,280
Thank you for coming with us.

493
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,259
It suits you well.

494
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,560
Thank you.

495
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:19,160
Why aren't you asleep?

496
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,800
How can I sleep
when you're out here like this?

497
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:28,910
Thank you

498
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,680
for letting me be

499
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:34,810
with Jang Madame and everything.

500
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:36,250
No need to thank me.

501
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,720
She is like a mother to you.

502
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,020
You're right.

503
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,720
She has lived with me

504
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,830
longer than my own mother had.

505
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:53,770
It must be tough for you.

506
00:35:57,275 --> 00:35:59,440
You're the one who's
going through a lot.

507
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:02,440
It has been over 20 years for me,

508
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,580
but that's not the case for you.

509
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:09,950
I just can't believe

510
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:12,520
any of this.

511
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,490
I can't accept it, either.

512
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:25,200
Nothing will happen, right?

513
00:36:56,235 --> 00:37:01,634
One, two, one, two.

514
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:02,830
Here.

515
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,600
It's good!

516
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:10,844
- We are
- Closed today

517
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,514
- and tomorrow
- due to the preparation

518
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,610
- for
- the fashion show!

519
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,680
Good.

520
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:19,750
What are you doing?

521
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,290
That's Byeol-na unni's sweater,

522
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,560
but it also looks good on you.

523
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,230
Really?

524
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:32,364
Would you like to show me
around the town?

525
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:33,530
Sure!

526
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,770
- I'll go with you.
- Come along.

527
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:57,590
This is where you can see
the entire Seoha Village.

528
00:37:57,965 --> 00:37:59,160
Beautiful, isn't it?

529
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:03,500
It's stunning.

530
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:13,510
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

531
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:14,940
<i>What is it?</i>

532
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:19,410
<i>The reason I went to Seoul was</i>

533
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:24,920
<i>that I found out</i>

534
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:29,690
<i>that Lim Chul-yong was
behind the fire at Pungcheonok.</i>

535
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:32,790
<i>- What?
- No way.</i>

536
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,990
<i>Not only that, but Yu-jin's mother,
Ms. Yoo Hyo-myoung,</i>

537
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,900
<i>also did not pass away
in a car accident</i>

538
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:41,970
<i>but was killed under the orders
of Lim Chul-yong.</i>

539
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,000
<i>What do you mean?
What happened to Hyo-myoung?</i>

540
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:47,770
<i>Lim Chul-yong did?</i>

541
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:52,010
<i>I can't ask you for help,
knowing how dangerous it is.</i>

542
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:53,550
<i>No, let us know if you need help.</i>

543
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,850
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

544
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:58,880
<i>I expect him to make a move
today or tomorrow.</i>

545
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,220
<i>So don't do anything on your own.</i>

546
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:06,120
<i>In particular, we'll need to watch out
for Seol-ah and Hyun-ah.</i>

547
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,230
<i>Okay.</i>

548
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:19,100
Yes, Mr. Jung.

549
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:21,810
You're on your way here?

550
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,640
I just started driving now.

551
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:25,910
Did you get any proof?

552
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:27,650
I have.

553
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:29,880
<i>I'll show you when I get there.</i>

554
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:31,820
Okay.

555
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,130
<i>- Did the investigation go well?
- Yes, sir.</i>

556
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,300
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

557
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,500
<i>I had a comfortable time here.</i>

558
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:52,044
<i>All right. Good job.</i>

559
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,170
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

560
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:57,110
<i>- Sir,
- Yes?</i>

561
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,040
<i>I have something to say.</i>

562
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,980
<i>Moon Seung-mo approached me.</i>

563
00:40:06,685 --> 00:40:07,790
<i>What?</i>

564
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,260
<i>Moon Seung-mo found me</i>

565
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:13,990
<i>and threatened me to tell him everything
regarding the Pungcheonok incident.</i>

566
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,430
<i>He thinks</i>

567
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,160
<i>I am on his side.</i>

568
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:34,550
Look! Spring is here!

569
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,320
You look beautiful with
the flower in your hair!

570
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,624
Seol-ah, can you put
some in my hair, too?

571
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,894
Look at that.

572
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:44,290
It's a flower carrying flowers!

573
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,494
What kind of flower is this?

574
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:49,134
- Right, what kind is it?
- It's camomile.

575
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:50,600
Camomile.

576
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,874
Mr. Jung is on his way,

577
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,370
so let's take Hyun-ah to Seoha Teahouse.

578
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,740
I can't trust him fully right now.

579
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:08,350
Let's do that.

580
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:10,780
Sure.

581
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,820
Hyo-sook,

582
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,720
- let's open up the teahouse.
- Sorry?

583
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,194
Yes.

584
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:25,430
We've got two famous designers here,

585
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:29,274
so why don't we do a rehearsal
at the teahouse?

586
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,004
That's a great idea!

587
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:34,770
- Can I tag along?
- Of course.

588
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,844
- You have to rehearse, too.
- You're right.

589
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:39,340
Let's get going, then.

590
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:40,950
Let's go!

591
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,150
- Be careful.
- Will do.

592
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:56,890
My daughter, Hyo-sook,

593
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:02,330
no, Da-mi, is from a modelling school.

594
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,140
You have no idea how much money
I invested in her.

595
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:09,444
Everyone, follow me.

596
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,610
Sure.

597
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,654
Make your gaze powerful!

598
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:18,484
- Powerful!
- As if you're a predator.

599
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,024
- Powerful.
- All right.

600
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,724
Everyone, follow me now.

601
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:22,950
Okay!

602
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,960
- Lift your leg. Yes.
- Strong gaze!

603
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:29,030
Shake your body! Scatter it.

604
00:42:29,065 --> 00:42:31,264
Powerful gaze. You're doing so well!

605
00:42:31,265 --> 00:42:32,800
- How am I doing?
- Awesome.

606
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:35,270
- You're so good.
- I am, aren't I?

607
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:37,170
Powerful, right?

608
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,140
What should we do?

609
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:42,170
We can't let this be.

610
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:44,114
I have to do my job.

611
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:46,640
- This is so much fun.
- We're doing great.

612
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:47,950
Everyone!

613
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:51,120
- Stand in your positions.
- Yes, ma'am.

614
00:42:56,955 --> 00:42:58,160
Mr. Jung.

615
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:03,830
Nice restaurant.

616
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,900
Where is Hyun-ah?

617
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:11,444
I took her because she said
that she wants to be

618
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:12,740
away from Lim Chul-yong.

619
00:43:13,045 --> 00:43:14,440
She isn't here right now.

620
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:17,880
Seems like you don't fully trust me.

621
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,710
Aren't you the same?

622
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:26,250
Is this enough?

623
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:28,950
It's Mr. Jin's phone.

624
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,120
It's Mr. Jin's phone?

625
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:38,230
- Chef Moon!
- Officer Cho.

626
00:43:39,665 --> 00:43:41,470
He's Mr. Jung Gwang-su of Donghan.

627
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:46,600
So, this is the man?

628
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:50,680
I'm Cho Soon-mi.

629
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:59,354
This is Mr. Jin's phone,
where he recorded a conversation

630
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:00,750
between Mr. Lim and himself.

631
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:08,960
You're saying, Mr. Lim Chul-yong
ordered Mr. Jin to kill Bella?

632
00:44:10,335 --> 00:44:12,130
To get this evidence,

633
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:15,970
I went to Seoul myself,
but I couldn't meet with Mr. Jin.

634
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:18,440
That night, Mr. Jin
and Hong Joo-hyuk died

635
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:20,270
in their car.

636
00:44:22,315 --> 00:44:25,540
Then, everything is
over once we retrieve

637
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:27,250
the contents in this phone.

638
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,310
Will that be possible?

639
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:32,450
We'll give it a try.

640
00:44:34,155 --> 00:44:36,050
How long will it take?

641
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:38,690
I'll try to work as fast as possible.

642
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:42,990
And

643
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,100
since you're the only witness,

644
00:44:46,165 --> 00:44:49,200
we'll protect you
to the best of our abilities.

645
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:50,870
Constable Cho Soon-mi

646
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:54,870
Give me a call if anything happens.

647
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:57,070
Will do.

648
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:59,410
Bye now.

649
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:12,090
Chef Moon,

650
00:45:12,925 --> 00:45:14,760
I have something to tell you.

651
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:20,200
It doesn't look like
he came here alone.

652
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:24,940
I saw earlier,

653
00:45:25,675 --> 00:45:27,340
and some strange man was

654
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:30,310
chasing after him.

655
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:33,910
I don't know what he's up to.

656
00:45:38,925 --> 00:45:40,280
Yes, sir.

657
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:42,720
Yes, I met up with him.

658
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:45,320
I don't think he's suspecting anything.

659
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:49,960
I'll do it

660
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:52,730
as planned tonight.

661
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:15,150
My back hurts.

662
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:18,460
We have the title of the show.

663
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,224
- What?
- What is it?

664
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:21,630
Seol-ah made it.

665
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:24,930
It's "Eccentric! Chef Moon".

666
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,570
What a great name!

667
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:29,270
That's awesome.

668
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:31,470
Seol-ah, you're amazing.

669
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:33,844
What do you think, Yoon-ja?

670
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:35,144
It sounds good.

671
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:37,314
It's all good

672
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:39,040
as long as Yoon-ja is satisfied.

673
00:46:40,245 --> 00:46:41,750
Stop it, you.

674
00:46:43,085 --> 00:46:45,120
You're a smart one.

675
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:52,424
<i>Seoha Rice Mill</i>

676
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:54,834
- You're tired, aren't you?
- Great work.

677
00:46:54,835 --> 00:46:56,494
- It's bedtime already.
- See you tomorrow.

678
00:46:56,495 --> 00:46:58,864
- See you tomorrow.
- Get home safe.

679
00:46:58,865 --> 00:47:00,134
Bye!

680
00:47:00,135 --> 00:47:01,630
<i>Bring her back now.</i>

681
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,334
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- See you tomorrow!

682
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:05,070
See you!

683
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:07,574
Let's get going.

684
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,070
This is nice.

685
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,244
Follow them closely.

686
00:47:12,245 --> 00:47:13,380
Yes, sir.

687
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:15,814
- Pigs go?
- Oink oink!

688
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:17,210
And Seol-ah?

689
00:47:17,425 --> 00:47:18,880
Is a princess!

690
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:31,430
Jang Madame!

691
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:34,030
Unni!

692
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:35,700
Bella!

693
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:37,170
Hyun-ah!

694
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:38,640
Girls!

695
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:41,110
Seung-mo!

696
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,470
What? Okay, I'm on my way.

697

<i>(Message)</i>

698
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:54,020
<i>Come here, all alone.</i>

699
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,260
Hello there,

700
00:48:33,695 --> 00:48:35,490
Chef Moon.

701
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,030
It's been a while.

702
00:48:39,505 --> 00:48:43,000
You just don't ever listen to me,

703
00:48:43,705 --> 00:48:46,540
so I got curious about you.

704
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:51,380
I was wondering how
you could be so bold.

705
00:48:52,815 --> 00:48:54,310
Let go of Yu-jin first.

706
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:07,590
This lady here

707
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:11,330
should've died right here long ago.

708
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:16,800
Had that happened, everything
would've worked out just fine.

709
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:22,040
Who would've known
that she'd regret surviving

710
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:25,240
until now?

711
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,080
I'll do anything you want,

712
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,524
so let her go.

713
00:49:32,525 --> 00:49:36,050
I've given you guys so many chances.

714
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,520
I didn't want to do this,

715
00:49:38,965 --> 00:49:40,120
but

716
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:43,530
it's too late now.

717
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:54,550
Yu-jin!

718
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:58,700
I've given you guys so many chances.

719
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:01,170
I didn't want to do this,

720
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:02,770
but

721
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:06,180
it's too late now.

722
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:16,960
Yu-jin!

723
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:45,680
I am

724
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,190
the type who has to

725
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,560
trample on whoever
it is if they stop me.

726
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:10,280
And you think you can stop me?

727
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:12,780
Stop now.

728
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:16,380
You've killed enough people now.

729
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:19,784
You've killed Mr. Kang's father

730
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,350
and your friend, Mr. Kang Min-suk,

731
00:51:24,325 --> 00:51:26,420
Ms. Yoo Hyo-myoung, Yu-jin's mother,

732
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,600
Chairman Han Dong-gil of Donghan,

733
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,504
your loyal people,

734
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:35,330
Mr. Jin Tae-soo and Hong Joo-hyuk,

735
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:39,340
as well as my parents.

736
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:43,140
Here's a piece of advice for you.

737
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,080
Stop here.

738
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,420
Do you know why they died?

739
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,260
Because they underestimated me.

740
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:03,364
Had they just listened to me,

741
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:06,430
they wouldn't have died so painfully.

742
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:11,600
Unfortunately,

743
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:16,110
you're just the same as them.

744
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:24,150
Kill them both at once.

745
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,450
Chairman Lim Chul-yong,

746
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,650
it's all over for you.

747
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,530
Lim Chul-yong!

748
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,650
What you've done is

749
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:00,650
being broadcasted all over the world.

750
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,220
It's dark, but you can see it clearly.

751
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:06,720
Over 100,000 people
are watching already.

752
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:09,164
<i>We have to report him.</i>

753
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:10,534
<i>Is this real?</i>

754
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:11,930
<i>I'm getting goosebumps.</i>

755
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:51,070
<i>- Yes, Chef Moon?
- Mr. Jung,</i>

756
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:54,810
<i>I see that you have</i>

757
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,280
<i>brought me a fake phone.</i>

758
00:53:58,385 --> 00:53:59,510
<i>What?</i>

759
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:01,350
<i>Look behind.</i>

760
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:03,480
<i>Does he look any familiar to you?</i>

761
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:17,830
<i>You're his next target.</i>

762
00:54:19,705 --> 00:54:20,900
<i>Think carefully.</i>

763
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,400
<i>Your life depends</i>

764
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,640
<i>on your choice right now.</i>

765
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,510
<i>What's Lim Chul-yong's plan?</i>

766
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:40,350
Jung Gwang-su, you!

767
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:51,100
- Kill them all!
- No, Dad!

768
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:54,770
Dad,

769
00:54:55,435 --> 00:54:58,170
- please, just stop.
- Hyun-ah, get back inside.

770
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:02,610
Dad, I'm not Bella.

771
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,040
- Stop all of this!
- Hyun-ah!

772
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,490
I'm not Bella.

773
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,820
For the past few months,

774
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:22,790
under the orders of Chairman Lim
of Donghan Group,

775
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:25,764
I pretended to be Ms. Bella

776
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:27,600
instead of the real Bella,
who lost her memory.

777
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:31,900
All of the rumors and questions
surrounding my identity

778
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:33,740
are indeed true.

779
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,350
Stay still!

780
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,794
- Bella!
- Goodness.

781
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:49,020
Arrest them.

782
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:51,264
Chef Moon! Are you all right?

783
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,524
Are you okay?

784
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:55,890
- My goodness, what happened?
- Are you okay?

785
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:57,304
This is a huge scoop.

786
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:59,530
Right? It's Pungcheonok round three!

787
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:02,674
- Bella!
- Are you okay?

788
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:03,870
Come here.

789
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:06,500
Stay still.

790
00:56:10,485 --> 00:56:11,840
Hyo-sook!

791
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:13,814
Hey!

792
00:56:13,815 --> 00:56:16,480
It's him over there!

793
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:20,990
Get him!

794
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:24,824
- Get him!
- We have to get him.

795
00:56:24,825 --> 00:56:26,990
- Quick!
- Go.

796
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:28,734
Come on.

797
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,664
Gosh. What do we do?

798
00:56:30,665 --> 00:56:32,900
- Be careful.
- Careful.

799
00:56:33,835 --> 00:56:35,930
Chef Moon, are you okay?

800
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:41,110
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

801
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,210
I wouldn't have done this had
I known that it'd be dangerous.

802
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:47,250
I'm sorry.

803
00:56:47,985 --> 00:56:49,780
I'm so sorry, Chef Moon.

805
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:05,930

so please provide support.

806
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:10,070

Did you see Lim Chul-yong's face?

He turned blue when I turned
the flashlight on him.

828
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:12,660
No, that was because I was
live-streaming him on the internet.

- Indeed.

Is everyone safe now?

833
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:27,000
Since his deeds are all out now,

834
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:28,940
all that there's left
is his punishment.

835
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:31,744
It'll be the end of it all
once Officer Cho arrests him.

Right, Seung-mo. What about the show?
