00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:13,323
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,335
- You're not going to get off?
- Hey, don't be petty.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,710
Okay. I'll get off now.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,205
- I said, I'd get off now.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,765
I'm here to meet Managing Director
Kang Jun-su of Donghan Food.

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,865
Please wait.

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,205
Does Managing Director Kang
have an appointment?

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,635
My name is Moon Seung-mo
of Pungcheonok.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,505
There's a man named Moon Seung-mo.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,375
Okay.

12
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,375
<i>Donghan Food</i>

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,145
Okay.

14
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,890
Managing Director Kang doesn't
have any appointments today.

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,285
Then, make an appointment for me.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,555
You can't make an appointment
at the last minute.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,955
If he's not here,
I am willing to wait for him.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,025
What is this about?

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,725
He came to meet Managing Director Kang
of Donghan Food without an appointment.

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,695
I'm sorry, but please make
an appointment and come back.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,265
I can make an appointment with him now.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,870
Sir, if you don't cooperate,
it will be...

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,075
What's going on?

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,015
Three generations of my family ran the
restaurant in one place for 80 years.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,384
Did a conglomerate like this

26
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,285
have to steal the name
of our family's restaurant?

27
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,055
There has been a misunderstanding.

28
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,300
The lawsuit regarding the restaurant

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,465
took place before I was instated,
so I don't know the details of the case.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,835
You don't know the details of the case?

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,675
In fact, when the case
came to my attention,

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,845
I was meaning to tell you
how the company wanted to handle it.

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,345
I heard there was a tragic accident.

34
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,745
I am sincerely sorry for your loss.

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,290
Our company, Donghan Food,

36
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,854
will not take any actions
if you wish to resume running

37
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,285
the restaurant
under the name of Pungcheonok.

38
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,930
Besides, a lot of people know
your restaurant

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,260
as the main branch
of our brand, Pungcheonok.

40
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,125
The main branch of your brand?

41
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,265
Yes.

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,435
Or should we officiate that the
restaurant is indeed the main branch?

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,180
I can exempt you
from paying the membership fee.

44
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,735
I can talk to my team for you.

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,475
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,715
If you need the money

47
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,645
to repair the restaurant,

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,415
we can partially pay for your repair.

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,755
Look.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,835
My parents are the ones who can
allow you using the name, Pungcheonok.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,905
It's not something
you people have power over.

52
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,145
I have no idea how the court allowed
you to have such rights to do so.

53
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,615
But on behalf of my parents,

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,645
I will not allow you

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,315
to use the name, Pungcheonok.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,465
Besides,

57
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,065
your mindset that
money can solve everything...

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,435
Isn't that really immature?

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,620
<i>Donghan Food</i>

60
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,505
Darn it.

61
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,755
<i>Pungcheonok</i>

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,625
<i>Grandpa, Granddaughter Seol-ah, Grandma</i>

63
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,540
<i>My goodness.</i>

64
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,040
<i>You're so good at drawing!</i>

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,840
<i>Gosh. Is that you, Grandma, and me?</i>

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,505
<i>What am I doing in the drawing?</i>

67
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,935
<i>- You're making rice soup.
- Rice soup?</i>

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,605
<i>- You're such a cutie pie.
- Gosh.</i>

69
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,445
<i>Grandpa, Granddaughter Seol-ah, Grandma</i>

70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,835
I forgot to buy it when we ran out.

71
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,950
Are you kidding me?

72
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,845
I'm really okay.

73
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,315
I'll go to the market
and buy something.

74
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,755
I don't have a car.

75
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,855
Then, I'll go to the teahouse
and get some food.

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,995
My gosh, I'm starving.

77
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,805
You're hungry, right? Follow me.

78
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,535
Where are you going?

79
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,525
- This is the place today.
- What?

80
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,365
Is that you, Seol-ah?

81
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,840
What brings you here today?

82
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,865
I was passing by and got thirsty,
so I stopped by.

83
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,875
I wanted to get some water.

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
Did you have lunch?

85
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,775
My gosh, don't offer me food.

86
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,875
I don't want to impose on you.

87
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,950
That's not imposing on me at all.

88
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,190
I just need to put two more spoons

89
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,285
on the table.

90
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,185
You should come in too, young lady.

91
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,955
My gosh, I really shouldn't.

92
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,775
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

93
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,720
Seol-ah, you eat your food
with such gusto.

94
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,955
Goodness.

95
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,405
You're just a kid. What are you doing?

96
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,065
It's okay.

97
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,575
I need to somehow
pay you back for the food.

98
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,675
- You don't need to.
- How is she that good?

99
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,085
Do you want a yogurt drink?

100
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,425
- Hide this.
- What?

101
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,295
Is that you, Seol-ah?

102
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,440
Hello, sir. Are you working now?

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,805
Oh, my. You're so diligent.

104
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,175
Hold on. I don't have much to give you.

105
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,845
Here.

106
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,345
Do you want to have an apple?

107
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,615
Gosh, you're giving me fruits now?

108
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,860
Give her one too.

109
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,815
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

110
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,140
She and her bad manners.

111
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,835
She ought to say hello
when she sees an elder.

112
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,735
In our society, having good manners is
important. She should behave better.

113
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,475
How is it?

114
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,505
You're amazing.

115
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,080
Give me the apple.

116
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,215
What?

117
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,860
What's going on?

118
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,730
- My gosh.
- Hello.

119
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,725
- It's Seol-ah.
- Hi, Seol-ah.

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,260
Have some apples.

121
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,030
- Goodness. Okay.
- Are those for us?

122
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,500
- Oh, my.
- How sweet.

123
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,700
Do you want to try some?

124
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,335
- Try it.
- You don't have to give me food.

125
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,210
Who on earth is she?

126
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,935
- Try some of this.
- Give her some.

127
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,580
- Open wide.
- Goodness.

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,980
- There you go.
- She's scary.

129
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,145
How adorable.

130
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,645
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

131
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,415
What on earth happened to Bella?

132
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,055
Ms. Jang Sun-young.

133
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,465
Who sent you?

134
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,735
Mr. Lim asked me to escort you.

135
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,400
Mr. Lim?

136
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,205
He's the Managing Director of
Donghan International, Lim Chul-yong.

137
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,555
Bella decided to work with Donghan
without talking to me first?

138
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,895
Do you expect me to believe that?

139
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,995
That's up to you, Team Leader Jang.

140
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,695
I mean, that's up to you,
Director Jang.

141
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,940
We've been preparing the season
solely based on Bella's promise.

142
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,665
But it's flustering now that
we can't get in touch with her.

143
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,880
The monetary damage
is too severe, you know.

144
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,805
At least when I was working
for Donghan International,

145
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,845
you people didn't stoop this low.

146
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,985
I must file a missing person's
report first for Bella.

147
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,015
You know what?

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,555
I'm only asking you this
out of personal curiosity.

149
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,425
Yoo Hyo-myoung.

150
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,265
Does Bella know about her?

151
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,710
It makes me wonder
if she was okay with having you

152
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,235
in her life knowing
her mother died because of you.

153
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,045
Seeing your face,
I take it that you've kept it a secret.

154
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,450
Yoo Hyo-myoung.

155
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,990
She was a beautiful model.

156
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,185
And she was a
talented designer as well.

157
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,625
When she finds out
about this awful ill-fated connection,

158
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,795
what will she think of you?

159
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,165
How will Bella think?

160
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,065
You...

161
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,140
What are you getting at?

162
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,365
Ms. Jang.

163
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,805
Let's try this again
as a businessman to a businesswoman.

164
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,045
Now that her contract is up with Louis,

165
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,590
if she doesn't sign another contract,

166
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,255
she would be wasting a whole season.

167
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,985
When people find out that Bella
went off the grid at her pleasure,

168
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,130
it's obvious
that Belle Ombre's reliability

169
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,695
will go down the drain.

170
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,265
I'm sure you know
the nature of this industry.

171
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,835
It's hard to climb up the ladder,
but it takes only a moment to fall.

172
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,365
Belle Ombre.

173
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,575
Did Bella grow Belle Ombre by herself?

174
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,075
No, she didn't.

175
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,675
The company grew on

176
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,875
your blood and sweat of 20 years.

177
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,285
You must do something
instead of watching it crumble down.

178
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,915
It won't crumble down.
What are you talking about?

179
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,655
Belle Ombre will not crumble
no matter what.

180
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,625
Exactly. Of course, it should not.

181
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,565
That brings me to my point.

182
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,865
To help you out from this predicament,

183
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,935
I prepared something.

184
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,725
How...

185
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,025
It looks just like Bella's studio.

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,935
What do you think?

187
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,375
Isn't it shocking how similar
the design looks to Bella's?

188
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,005
Goodness.

189
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,215
How...

190
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,915
What are you plotting right now?

191
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,485
All right.

192
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,030
Let me introduce to you, the new Bella.

193
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,055
What?

194
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,165
Who are you?

195
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,305
Hyun-ah, you should say hello.

196
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,335
She's my daughter.

197
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,420
I was worried

198
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,545
that she was influenced by Bella's works
too much ever since her art school.

199
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,485
I had no idea that this would
come around to save my butt.

200
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,825
Anyway, here's the bottom line.

201
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,055
We just need the title

202
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,025
that Bella is working with
Donghan International for this season.

203
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,970
Yes, if Bella shows up
before it's over,

204
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,335
she can continue this project herself.

205
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,135
Don't worry.

206
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,155
<i>(Do you want to delete the file?)</i>

207
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,295
<i>(Do you want to delete the file?)</i>

208
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,210
<i>Take it.</i>

209
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>- I can't accept this.
- It's for your kid's tuition. Take it.</i>

210
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,510
<i>I really can't.</i>

211
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,915
<i>Come on. It's coming from me.
You're embarrassing me.</i>

212
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,480
<i>Take it. Here.</i>

213
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,715
<i>Goodness.</i>

214
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,455
<i>Hey, I need to ask you for a favor.</i>

215
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,470
<i>- Pardon?
- Deleting the CCTV footage</i>

216
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,095
<i>isn't that hard.</i>

217
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,005
I got a call that they took care of it.

218
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,665
Good job.

219
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,075
They retrieved it at the cliff.

220
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,655
Look at this.

221
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,125
This is the report the managing
director of Donghan Food got

222
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,970
from the junior managing director.

223
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,135
<i>Old Restaurant Project,
1st restaurant: Pungcheonok</i>

224
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,165
Are you being bullied at work?

225
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,035
Are you an outcast?

226
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,610
No, I'm not.

227
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,880
Mr. Lim's system has been implanted
for so long and is sturdy.

228
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,605
All the directors are on his side.

229
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,515
Look how they're treating me.

230
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,515
I need you to come to work fast.

231
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,914
Start next week.

232
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,315
All of a sudden?

233
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,490
So you want me to get bullied

234
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,454
at work with you starting next week?

235
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,325
This is why I'm buying you
a delicious meal to cheer you up.

236
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,765
I see. Okay.

237
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,434
I am so honored
to have this meal with you.

238
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,405
<i>Grandpa, Granddaughter Seol-ah, Grandma</i>

239
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,575
<i>- What is it?
- Hey, this is big!</i>

240
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,775
Seung-mo.

241
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,815
What's this?

242
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,190
<i>It will be cloudy.</i>

243
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,515
- Darn it.
- Seol-ah.

244
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,485
Did you draw this?

245
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,385
I drew this at the restaurant.

246
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,255
With Grandpa and Grandma.

247
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,295
Did you go to Seoul
because of Pungcheonok?

248
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,600
I wonder why you had to go alone.

249
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,510
- Why didn't you take us?
- Why didn't you take us?

250
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,765
Why didn't you take us?

251
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,410
Also, what time did you
get home last night?

252
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,045
- I fell asleep waiting for you.
- Tell me about it.

253
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,045
I was so scared,

254
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,015
thinking he had left me.

255
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,360
Seol-ah, your dad isn't
that much of a scumbag...

256
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,485
I mean, jerk. Right?

257
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,125
Didn't you even bring us back
a gift from Seoul?

258
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,130
He already feeds us three meals a day.

259
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,165
How could we ask for more?
We just can't.

260
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,875
I heard the market is open today.
Why don't we go?

261
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,075
We can shop for winter clothes
and groceries.

262
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,475
The market?

263
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,145
We're going to the market!

264
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,345
- Let's make the bed.
- Make the bed.

265
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,355
Dodo Mart

266
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,555
What's this?

267
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,055
It's so big!

268
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,265
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

269
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,565
What are they so excited about?

270
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,335
Just look at them.

271
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,410
No!

272
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,945
Are you seriously going for that color?

273
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,250
That's the worst match for Asian bodies

274
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,985
with a long torso and short legs,
like yours.

275
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,685
That's a bit too harsh!

276
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,595
Try this one. Go and change.

277
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,030
But I like this one better.

278
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,995
What are you, a crayon?
Why would you wear all the colors?

279
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,035
Go and change this instance. Follow me.

280
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:03,335
Right now!

281
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,435
What's taking them so long
to buy some clothes?

282
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,545
I'll be outside.

283
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,525
Is that really me?
Are you sure that's not a princess?

284
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,065
Of course not.

285
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,670
That's just my sense of style,

286
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,305
which I used to carefully pick out
according to your body and skin tone.

287
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,475
Really?
What style do you think would fit me?

288
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,375
Could you help me out once more?

289
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,585
This. This.

290
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,485
This.

291
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,025
Go and change.

292
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,700
Yes sir!

293
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,045
Isn't it pretty?

294
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,655
I think it would be so pretty
with this dress.

295
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,425
No, it looks better on me.

296
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,055
I think it could be the finishing touch
to my outfit.

297
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,595
Do you have the money?

298
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,640
Look. What do you think?
It looks good on me, right?

299
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,305
Isn't it perfect? I bet you
really want to buy this for me.

300
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,670
What do you think?

301
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,275
Yes, take a good look.
Who does it look better on?

302
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,745
I think I'm good. I'm not worth it.

303
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,660
That doesn't even cost much.
It's practically nothing.

304
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,760
How much is it?

305
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,285
It's 6 dollars per piece,

306
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,695
but I'll give you 2 for 10 dollars
if you pay cash.

307
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,930
Why is it so expensive?

308
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,370
What is it, organic or something?

309
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,635
Are you from abroad?
That's how the price is in Korea.

310
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,840
That's practically wholesale price.

311
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,480
We have the cheapest price around here.

312
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,245
Why don't you just give it to us
for 8 dollars?

313
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,845
Forget it.

314
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,245
I'll just give it to my dog.

315
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,820
Let's just go.

316
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,315
We're no better than his dog.

317
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,555
All right. Let's go.

318
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,695
Gosh, you...

319
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,645
- I'm going to go try them on.
- Me too.

320
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,445
Seung-mo.

321
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,815
Do you want some coffee?

322
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,085
What's wrong with you?
Someone is at that teahouse, right?

323
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,400
What are you talking about?
Of course not!

324
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
- Don't do it.
- Do what?

325
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,465
Don't you remember how you lost
that art academy in Seoul?

326
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,270
Gosh. You're always willing to hand over
everything when it comes to women.

327
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,570
I'm not like that anymore!

328
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,265
Sure. You have nothing left, anyway.

329
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,635
Get ahold of yourself!

330
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,310
Or else I'm going to tell your father
you're here.

331
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,015
Gosh, and I call you my friend.

332
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,950
Fine, all right?
I'll stop drinking coffee.

333
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,145
Are you happy?

334
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,960
How would you do that?

335
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,355
It seemed like you love coffee.

336
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,715
Hello, ma'am.

337
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,490
Chef Moon. Paint.

338
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,155
Not "paint". "Painter". I'm a painter!

339
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,540
I'm not deaf, you!
Why are you screaming?

340
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,835
Anyway, what do I call that lady?

341
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,880
I don't even know her name.

342
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,780
- What?
- You know her name, don't you?

343
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,480
You don't just say, "hey", do you?

344
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,015
Her name? What was her name, again?

345
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,945
What an eccentric woman she is.

346
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,215
Very eccentric, indeed.

347
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,855
"Eccentric"? Are you talking about me?

348
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,685
She's...

349
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,055
- Her name is Yoo Byeol-na.
- Yoo Byeol-na?

350
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,925
"Yoo Byeol-na"?

351
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,500
Yes, that right! She is!

352
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,800
I quit taking my omega-3 pills,
so my memory is bad these days.

353
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,005
She's Byeol-na.

354
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,840
"Byeol-na".

355
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,940
No wonder they say
your name says who you are.

356
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,350
She's so eccentric, just like her name.

357
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,675
You're right!

358
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,745
- Why are you still out here?
- Hello, ma'am.

359
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,090
Speak of the devil!

360
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,185
Byeol-na. Yoo Byeol-na!

361
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,060
What's wrong with him?

362
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,325
That's your name, isn't it?

363
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,730
Yoo Byeol-na.

364
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,670
- Me?
- It suits you so well.

365
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,865
Your parents must have had a vision.

366
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,705
Byeol-na? My name?

367
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,675
What's this...

368
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,945
Byeol-na? My name?

369
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,915
What's this...

370
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,005
What the heck? That's so tacky!

371
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,275
They say plagiarism
is a talent as well.

372
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,505
I guess they're not
completely worthless.

373
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,845
Now, now.

374
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,520
You can help fill up

375
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,915
whatever is lacking from her designs,
can't you?

376
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,055
That's why we are a team.

377
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,955
Bella was able to become
a world-class designer

378
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,255
because you were there with her,
wasn't she?

379
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,295
So I'm saying...

380
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,095
Don't waste any more time,

381
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,165
and let's sign that contract now.

382
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,110
I will talk to my lawyer

383
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,575
and then decide.

384
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,215
The contract looks fine.

385
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,885
You may sign it as is.

386
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,060
I don't think there's
anything against us

387
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,925
in terms of money or conditions either.

388
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,155
Is that so?

389
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,795
Sir, would you please
come out for a moment?

390
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,065
One moment.

391
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,560
Certified Copy of Register

392
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,155
"Seoha Village"?

393
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,895
Certified Copy of Register

394
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,995
This is my other client's.

395
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,665
I'm sorry.
I was trying to look at this painting.

396
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,975
It's all right.

397
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,240
What would you like to do
with the contract?

398
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,645
I think you should have it notarized.

399
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,745
I'll have to think about it.

400
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,885
I'll let you know when
I make a decision.

401
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,955
Right.

402
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,225
Did...

403
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,055
Yu-jin come here, by any chance?

404
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,295
Yoo Yu-jin?

405
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,265
- Yes.
- No.

406
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,695
Is she back in Korea?

407
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,235
Never mind.

408
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,705
Thank you.

409
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,285
Hello.

410
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,885
Jang Sun-young was just here.

411
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,095
I think you'll be having your way soon.

412
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,070
Well, then

413
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,325
I'll assume that our firm

414
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,100
will be handling

415
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,065
all of Donghan Group's legal services
from now on.

416
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,535
Yes, sir.

417
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,905
All right.

418
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,705
Da-hoon.

419
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,105
Bang Da-hoon!

420
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,315
What is it? I need to use the toilet.

421
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,455
Something's missing.

422
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,355
- Come over here.
- What?

423
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,025
Try this for me.

424
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,025
You remember Pungcheonok's broth,
don't you?

425
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,565
What do you think?

426
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,565
I think something's missing,
but I can't remember.

427
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,965
It's tasty.

428
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,275
It's my fault for asking you.

429
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
Look after this for a minute.

430
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,720
- I'm going to the kitchen.
- I told you, I need to use the toilet.

431
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,445
Gosh, something's missing.

432
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,915
Darn it.

433
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,315
Byeol-na!

434
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,885
Byeol-na! The furnace!

435
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,225
Watch over the furnace for me.

436
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,100
What do you want me to do with it?

437
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,470
Put in some wood

438
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,240
if the fire dies down.

439
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,435
That's disgusting!

440
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,045
Is this too weak?

441
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,805
I can't tell.

442
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,865
I don't think this is enough.

443
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,935
Is there any wood?

444
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,565
Wood?

445
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,875
Pungcheonok

446
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,245
This is wood.

447
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,915
Pungcheonok

448
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,625
There.

449
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,865
Is that beef?

450
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,105
I'll see

451
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,575
if this is done.

452
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,115
You heard me, right?

453
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,455
It's hot.

454
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,000
That's amazing.

455
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,435
What do you think you're doing?

456
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,305
Gosh, you...

457
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,875
Pungcheonok

458
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,380
Why did you push me like that?

459
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,315
How could you beat me
for eating some meat?

460
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,255
Do you have any idea what this is?

461
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,525
I was told to put in some wood.
Why are you blaming me for that?

462
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,530
Just say it's because of the meat!

463
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,360
At least have some sense
if you lost your memory!

464
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,755
Does this look like firewood?

465
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,530
Do you think you can get away
with anything

466
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,825
just because you lost your memory?

467
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,665
What did you just say? How could you?

468
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,180
What's wrong? Why are you fighting?

469
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,375
Come on!

470
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,145
You brought that here?

471
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,545
Pungcheonok

472
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,985
Darn it.

473
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,885
Get out.

474
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,155
Go on, get out of here!

475
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,255
I was just about to!

476
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,055
What's wrong, Byeol-na?

477
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,965
Hey, why are you getting so mad?

478
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,965
Darn it.

479
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,845
That jerk.

480
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,145
"Get out"?

481
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,555
Does he think I have
nowhere else to go?

482
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,325
I'd rather not go there either.

483
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,855
I'm hungry.

484
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,395
That bite of beef is
making me hungrier.

485
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,855
Bella.

486
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,665
Where in the world are you?

487
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,775
<i>When people find out that Bella
went off the grid at her pleasure,</i>

488
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,050
<i>it's obvious
that Belle Ombre's reliability</i>

489
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,415
<i>will go down the drain.</i>

490
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,685
<i>I'm sure you know
the nature of this industry.</i>

491
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,920
<i>It's hard to climb up the ladder,
but it takes only a moment to fall.</i>

492
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,395
<i>Belle Ombre. You must do something
instead of watching it crumble down.</i>

493
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,515
<i>Jang Sun-young</i>

494
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,855
<i>Right. I'll be like Seol-ah.</i>

495
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,525
Why does everyone sleep so early?

496
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,435
What should I do?

497
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,375
Does pride get me food?
No, I'm starving.

498
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,275
Whatever.

499
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,925
What are you doing out alone?

500
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,555
Hello.

501
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,025
I went out for a walk.

502
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,735
You sound hungry.
You want to take a seat?

503
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,345
Fine,

504
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,280
but I'm not here because I'm hungry.

505
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,485
I'm just being nice
because you offered.

506
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,095
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to take it?

507
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,875
What is this? You couldn't have
just found it somewhere.

508
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,445
Did you buy it? Just for me?

509
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,275
I bought you one while I was buying one
for Seol-ah so that you two wouldn't fight.

510
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,385
Give this to Seol-ah.

511
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,055
Thanks.

512
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,395
As expected of Chef Moon!
It's delicious.

513
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,765
Pour me a drink, too.

514
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,145
- I'm done.
- You only have one bottle?

515
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,675
Yes.

516
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,315
Hold on.

517
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,185
What is she doing?

518
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,835
How did you know there were drinks?

519
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,505
I don't know how I know.

520
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,675
I just had a feeling.

521
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,275
Whatever, as long as I have
a drink to pour myself.

522
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,925
This is so good!

523
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,770
Pace yourself.

524
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,965
Drinks should be enjoyed
and appreciated, too.

525
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,640
This is just my second glass.
You don't drink well, do you?

526
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,805
Me?

527
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,735
Just take care of yourself after.

528
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,905
I don't plan on looking out for you.

529
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,045
- Fine.
- Fine.

530
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,205
80 years.

531
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,945
80 whole years.

532
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,485
They spent all that time waking up
early every morning to get to work.

533
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,725
But because they were unfortunate
enough to have such a proud son,

534
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,995
all I have left is that signboard.

535
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,805
I go insane

536
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,905
every time I think about it.

537
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,415
I had no idea.

538
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,045
I'm sorry, Chef Moon. I really am.

539
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,315
But the signboard isn't

540
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,095
the only thing they left you with.

541
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,325
You have all these drinks here.

542
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,495
You're right.

543
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,575
I have all these drinks
that my dad made.

544
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,905
Dad.

545
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,965
I'm done.

546
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,465
Dad...

547
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,775
Dad...

548
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,775
I can't believe that I finished this.

549
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,385
I'm a piece of trash!

550
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,690
I'm a piece of trash!

551
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,320
Stop it!

552
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,285
- Don't call yourself trash.
- I'm terrible.

553
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,095
You think I'm happy?

554
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,925
I'm just as frustrated as you are.

555
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,935
I don't remember anything.

556
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,165
I don't even know

557
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,335
who I am.

558
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,575
Why are you crying?

559
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,715
Stop crying.

560
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,485
My goodness. Moon Seung-mo!

561
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,195
Be quiet, my head hurts.

562
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,695
What are you doing? There's a kid here!

563
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,905
You pervert! What did you do?

564
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,050
Me? What did I do?
Why are you sleeping here?

565
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,820
- Why was I sleeping here?
- You slept here, see?

566
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,350
- Why were you sleeping here?
- Why was I sleeping here?

567
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,955
- How do I know that?
- How do I know that?

568
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,525
Seol-ah, let's go.

569
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,065
You lucky man.

570
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,295
What's up with that smirk?

571
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,265
Have a great time.

572
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,665
No!

573
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,810
- It's not what it seems!
- And you're the one to talk?

574
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,350
It's really not what it seems!

575
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,645
Bang Da-hoon!

576
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,175
You pervert.

577
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,445
Pervert?

578
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,045
Why are you blaming it all on me?

579
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,355
Why are you crying?

580
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,365
Stop crying.

581
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,235
Did we kiss?

582
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,245
No way.

583
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,175
No way.

584
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,415
Absolutely not.

585
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,855
Why are you looking at me like that?

586
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,085
No!

587
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,355
Goodness. Chef Moon that man...

588
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,925
What are you thinking?

589
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,040
That hairpin. Where is that from?

590
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,165
What?

591
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,205
This? Your dad bought me one.

592
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,305
Yours is in my jacket
in the living room.

593
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,715
Dad, where's Byeol-na's jacket?

594
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,590
<i>Donghan X Belle Ombre</i>

595
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,925
We are announcing

596
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,565
that Donghan International is launching

597
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,935
a new fashion brand with the
world-renowned designer, Bella,

598
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,105
and will be collaborating
with her brand.

599
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,375
Special Collaboration

600
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,345
I present to you,
the co-founder of Bella Ombre,

601
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,345
Madame Jang.

602
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,020
Special Collaboration Signing Ceremony

603
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,525
Why don't you say a word?

604
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,755
No, thanks.

605
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,825
In particular, Designer Bella

606
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,435
will be sharing
her knowledge and experience

607
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,935
gained from her time working
with many international brands

608
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,710
with Donghan,
Korea's leading fashion brand.

609
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,505
Together, we will

610
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,705
bring Korean fashion
to the international level.

611
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,815
Special Collaboration Signing Ceremony

612
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,515
Seung-mo!

613
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,415
You scared me.

614
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,860
- Here!
- What's this?

615
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,855
The signboard burned down yesterday.

616
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,960
I know I wasn't the one who burned it,

617
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,660
but I didn't feel good about it after.

618
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,365
So I used my artistic senses

619
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,800
to make a new one.

620
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,470
What do you think? Cool, right?

621
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,570
"Cool"?

622
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,935
The original one is better
even when it's burnt.

623
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,540
And who's going to
be able to read that?

624
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,775
How are you so artistically insensitive
and still a chef?

625
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,710
And why wouldn't anyone be
able to read this?

626
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,145
Everyone can read it!

627
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,815
Seol-ah, come here. Try reading this.

628
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,715
<i>Pungcheonok</i>

629
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,125
Try reading it, come on.

630
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,930
See? Nobody can read it.

631
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,665
No, I don't think that's it.

632
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,665
Seol-ah, are you illiterate?

633
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,540
Unbelievable.

634
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,240
Kids your age can read cartoons by now.

635
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,375
How did you not know this
when you're her father?

636
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,945
Come on.

637
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,875
You really can't read?

638
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,620
Raising a child is never easy.

639
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,660
It's not too late. We can teach her.

640
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,025
Stop the nonsense.

641
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,825
Anyway,

642
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,995
where's Byeol-na?

643
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,500
How embarrassing!

644
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,570
What do I do now?
How do I look at everyone?

645
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,170
What if everyone knows?

646
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,535
It's all over for me.

647
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,675
All over.

648
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,115
What is it? Are you bored?

649
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,985
Follow me and you'll earn some money
while having fun.

650
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,085
I'll also feed you.

651
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,300
Sure, I'll earn some money.

652
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,200
Go out in the morning

653
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,400
then come back in the evening.
I won't see him often.

654
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,565
See? Thinking helps.

655
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,105
Yoon-ja!

656
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,915
Who said this would be fun?

657
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,520
How is this possibly fun?

658
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,890
Yoon-ja, were you lying to me?

659
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,190
Lying? What are you talking about?

660
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,390
And how is this not fun?

661
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,130
You're a weird one, indeed.

662
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,365
Darn it. Whatever.

663
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,830
This isn't fun at all.

664
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,365
I'm leaving. Just pay me
for what I've done up to now.

665
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,410
If you leave now, that's a violation
of our contract.

666
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,875
I can't pay you then.
Are you okay with that?

667
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,380
How much longer do I need to work then?

668
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,215
Why so curious?

669
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,445
We have to do the entire field.

670
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,860
The whole field?

671
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,830
You're getting saliva on the cabbages.

672
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,125
It'll be over before you know it.

673
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,095
Goodness.

674
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,265
This is

675
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:11,005
how farming works.

676
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,980
We sow the seeds in the spring,

677
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,005
weed out the weeds in the summer,

678
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,345
work and harvest in the autumn,

679
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,515
then prepare for the
spring in the winter.

680
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,245
People may betray me,

681
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,085
but farming doesn't.

682
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,255
You just sow...

683
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,660
What? Where did she go?

684
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,365
Did she run away?

685
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,565
Aren't you the lady
at Chef Moon's house?

686
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,235
What brings you all the way here?

687
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,345
<i>I can see myself working here.</i>

688
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,115
How much will I get paid

689
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,845
if I pick all the apples here?

690
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,315
Why? You want a job?

691
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,495
I'll give you 5kg of apples

692
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,425
if you pick all of them down this road.

693
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,165
Really?

694
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,035
Are you hungry?

695
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,035
Hold on.

696
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,275
Have an apple.

697
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,575
Bong-doo, you're the best!

698
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,985
It's delicious.

699
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,190
How can an apple be so delicious?

700
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,760
By the way, how do you

701
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,925
talk like that?

702
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,755
- What?
- I hear there's no separate language

703
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,625
for the elders in foreign countries.
You're from Australia?

704
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,365
Me?

705
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,505
Maybe it's because you can't
remember anything,

706
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,540
but you never show any respect
for the elders when you speak.

707
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,940
You don't know the Three Bonds
and Five Relationships in Confucianism.

708
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,950
I just...

709
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,645
Let me tell you about the Three Bonds
and Five Relationships.

710
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,790
It's a set of principles

711
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,720
that all humans must follow
for basic manners.

712
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,860
In particular, for adults,

713
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,060
you have to respect elders.

714
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,130
You must put the elders first.

715
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,260
In everything,

716
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,130
people older than you

717
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,970
must come first.

718
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,470
That's what it is.

719
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,765
So, you have to respect...

720
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,740
Where are you going?

721
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,640
- Poor girl.
- How dare you leave when I'm talking?

722
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,740
- Look at her bad manners.
- If you push his buttons,

723
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,310
he's going to talk
until your ears are bleeding.

724
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,220
That's why a lot of people
had to visit the town

725
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,350
to see an ear doctor.

726
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,450
Goodness. You had a hard day.

727
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,285
It's okay now. Keep peeling.

728
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,595
You're doing great.

729
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,325
Did you know?

730
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,240
Our Nonyang garlic...

731
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,110
is actually not garlic, but medicine.

732
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,335
Indeed, it is.

733
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,580
- Really?
- Yes.

734
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,550
Haven't you heard of the folktale,

735
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,450
where a bear becomes human
after eating garlic?

736
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,545
That garlic is Nonyang garlic.

737
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,320
I became a public servant
after eating this garlic.

738
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,815
That's right!

739
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,085
He wasn't human before.

740
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,200
And our Nonyang garlic is so sweet.

741
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,525
They're sweeter than apples.
Would you like one, honey?

742
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,935
- Sweet, isn't it?
- Yes.

743
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,110
- Delicious.
- Indeed.

744
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,075
Would you like to give it a try?

745
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:38,510
- Sure.
- I'll give you the biggest one.

746
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,645
Open your mouth.

747
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,675
Here.

748
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,495
Why are you crying? Are you sad?

749
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,235
I almost died.

750
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,775
It's Paint. Paint!

751
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,945
Where is he going?

752
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:27,295
Ladies shouldn't get their hands wet.

753
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,225
Housewife's eczema is painful.

754
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,895
Welcome.

755
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,965
Paint! You work here?

756
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,245
How much do they pay you here?

757
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,610
Pay him?

758
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,945
He's just volunteering
with innocent intentions.

759
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,245
- Right?
- Yes.

760
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,515
I'm just purely helping out.

761
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,485
An artist shouldn't be so greedy.

762
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,525
What is this town? Everyone is a thief!

763
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,955
But

764
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,325
who are you?

765
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,635
I've never seen you before.

766
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,865
<i>Seoha Teahouse</i>

767
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,210
<i>What is this?</i>

768
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:18,275
<i>What is this urge burning inside of me
that wants to criticize her outfit?</i>

769
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,845
Me?

770
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,975
I'm Byeol-na.

771
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,485
I'm Yoo Byeol-na.

772
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,045
<i>What is this woman?</i>

773
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,785
<i>I have a bad feeling that
she's destined to be my enemy.</i>

774
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,460
Nice to meet you.

775
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,595
I'm...

776
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,955
Gong Da-mi.

777
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,865
Seeing

778
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,535
how you just barge in here
and talk so rudely to me,

779
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,740
I'm guessing you didn't learn
your manners at school.

780
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,875
Where are your manners?

781
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,205
<i>I got the first blow!</i>

782
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,145
<i>So, is this how you're going to be?</i>

783
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,315
Your left shoulder is sagging.
Is your posture bad?

784
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,955
Look! Bowlegs!

785
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,525
Tighten your abs and your butt!

786
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,225
A little better. I'm leaving now.

787
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,635
Thank...

788
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,365
What is wrong with me?

789
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,735
Seoha Rice Mill

790
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,315
Nice one!

791
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,925
- Hyung!
- Why?

792
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,725
Someone scratched Mr. Jin's car.

793
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,535
He's going to yell at us.

794
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,135
I told you to park properly!

795
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,505
Sorry, sir.

796
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,510
This car did it.

797
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,175
- Which one?
- Here.

798
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,285
Darn it.
How am I supposed to find this punk?

799
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,355
Can you pause here?

800
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,325
- Here?
- Yes.

801
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,065
Stop.

802
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,035
Stop! I told you to stop!

803
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,805
This woman...

804
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,925
What are you doing?
Are you looking for someone?

805
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,935
Just wondering where everyone is.

806
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,765
Seol-ah is at Yoon-ja's house

807
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,905
and I got Da-hoon to pick her up.

808
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,275
But why do you want to know that
all of a sudden?

809
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,045
Well, it's because...

810
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,620
I was just trying to
avoid you, obviously.

811
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,650
You think that'll be possible
when we live together?

812
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,545
So what? You're kicking me out?

813
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:16,385
- I didn't say that.
- Whatever. Forget it.

814
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,065
I'll go this way.

815
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,495
You go that way.

816
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,163
Okay.

817
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,715
This is tiring.

818
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,455
Why can't I stop thinking of her?

819
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,635
Why should I be the only one
to feel embarrassed?

820
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,095
Seriously.

821
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,575
I'm fine, too.

822
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,245
I'll pretend that I'm confident.

823
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,675
No,

824
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,945
I am confident.

825
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,955
She's alive?

826
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,725
Are you sure?

827
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,225
Yes.

828
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,135
Then why...

829
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,655
Make sure to pass on what I say.

830
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,185
Find the woman

831
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,725
and kill her

832
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,625
without anyone knowing.
