2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,379
So you're saying,

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,519
Mr. Hong, the county governor,
teamed up with Donghan

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,819
and they want to wipe out our village?

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,615
Don't say it like that.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,519
- It's a win-win for both sides.
- "Win-win"?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,759
Are you taking the governor's side
as a fellow civil servant?

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,759
I'm not saying this
because my daughter is the police,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,499
but we do have to consider it
from their perspective.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,199
It's not the time for chit-chat.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,709
This is a serious problem,
so let's share our thoughts.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,309
What else is there to say?

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,749
I oppose it. We all oppose it!

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,305
Yes, we oppose it.

15
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,619
I don't know what I did so wrong
in my past life.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,715
Why do I have to get kicked out
of my house again?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,319
After getting married in Nonyang,

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,355
I lost all my ancestors' land
because of the flood,

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,159
and I couldn't say a word

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,029
because I was poor and uneducated.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,265
That's right.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,769
Our property was submerged.

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,969
We had practically nothing to eat
and we still had to share that.

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,239
Our whole family had to live scattered.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,345
And you want us to
go through that again?

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,815
What do you mean, "submerged"?

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,615
It was about 30 years ago.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,588
They were trying to build
a big dam over here,

29
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,855
and the whole of upstream Nonyang
was flooded with water.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,255
I came back to a lake when I
was discharged from the military.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,025
Have you all forgotten?

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,295
The reason why
we're all able to live like this?

33
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,369
It's all thanks to Byung-soo, isn't it?

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,869
Are you at that again?

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,635
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,479
We should never forget our roots.

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,449
And your dead father, too.

38
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,019
Those people fed us for nothing

39
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,619
and sold their land
to put a roof above our heads

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,719
just because they felt bad for us!

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,385
You shouldn't be talking like that

42
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:06,654
in this house, at the least!

43
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,995
What's wrong?

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,025
I don't know.

45
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,105
It's just so sad to hear this story.

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,535
Goodness.

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,909
Just look at her.

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,049
Byeol-na is not even from around here,
and she's this upset.

49
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,649
We can't just sit around.

50
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,185
We can't just sit around when
they're trying to wipe out our village!

51
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,955
Let me fill your glass, sir.

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,224
As you know, Mr. Hong,

53
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,669
timing is important in business.

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,795
Of course, sir.

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,569
Excuse me for saying this,

56
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,509
but if you can't show us results
within three months,

57
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,509
we will have to invest somewhere else.

58
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,974
Gosh, what are you saying?

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,845
It's all for the good of our district.

60
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,845
Who would take charge if I don't?

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,215
You can trust me.

62
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,589
Now, here's to Donghan
Group and Nonyang!

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,685
Cheers.

Well, I...

92
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,125
I was just walking past,
and I felt a dark presence.

93
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,555
- I was checking to see if any...
- You must be out of your mind.

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,239
You focus on your own work.
You're only a constable.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,469
You're just supposed to alert Finance
Office if there's an abandoned car!

96
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,169
I couldn't reach the owner, so...

97
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,505
You're driving me nuts.

98
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,505
That's why you're
supposed to alert them!

99
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,375
Do it first thing tomorrow.

100
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,475
- I'm off duty tomorrow.
- Are you joking with me?

101
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,685
Do it yourself. I'm going to
check on it. Do you understand?

102
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,255
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,625
Gosh, you're driving me crazy!

00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,694

24-Hour Sauna

106
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,495
So, you're saying
we should organize a task force?

107
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,405
That's it. That's what I'm saying.

108
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,969
Then we need a chief, don't we?

109
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,505
Of course, we do.

110
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,115
I already work two posts,
so it might be a bit challenging,

111
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,419
but if you trust my performance
and experience

112
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,019
and insist that I must do it,
then I guess I don't have any choice...

113
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,555
Give your recommendation.

114
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,429
- What?
- If you think someone can do a good job,

115
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,889
recommend someone.

116
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,559
If you think you'll do a good job,
you can go for it too.

117
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,599
That's how we should do it.

118
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,095
Oh, yes. Right.

119
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,899
It's just mere formality.

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,469
But we're living in a democratic world,

121
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,709
so let's do it as Da-hoon says.

122
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,075
Is there anyone you'd
like to recommend?

123
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,175
- Go ahead.
- You do it.

124
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,919
- Yoon-ja.
- What?

125
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,185
Don't you have anyone to recommend?

126
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,885
Right.

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,985
Ms. Pi would be a
good fit, wouldn't it?

128
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,859
She's the head of the women's society

129
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,369
and the village.

130
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,725
Oh, goodness.

131
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,499
What do you think, Ms. Byung-chun?

132
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,569
Oh, right.
She should be the one in charge.

133
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,739
She likes being in charge.

134
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,005
Oh, goodness.
I don't like being in charge. No way.

135
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,779
Since everyone is wanting me to do it,

136
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,979
I'll do it with a sense of duty
as I'm the head of

137
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,379
the women's society and the village.

138
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,519
What about Seung-mo?

139
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,645
What?

140
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,019
Seung-mo may be stuck here
in the countryside,

141
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,659
but he's very famous.

142
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,299
He has won the gold medal
at the World Chef Championship

143
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,459
and he's been the main chef
every time the president

144
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,499
went on an overseas trip
to cook his dinners.

145
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,239
- He received a presidential citation.
- Oh, I see.

146
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,909
You're saying he's
outrageously competent, right?

147
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,579
Right. He knows a lot
of reporters in Seoul too.

148
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,049
And he knows many higher-ups
in the diplomatic field as well.

149
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,975
I think we'll be in good hands
if he ever becomes the chief.

150
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,249
Really?

151
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,685
I didn't know Chef Moon was
such an amazing person.

152
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,215
You're way too kind.

153
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,689
Hey, I don't know anything
about this village. Why would I do it?

154
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,629
Painter has a good point.

155
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,829
How about we go fresh with a new face?

156
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,129
Right.

157
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,869
I've done many demonstrations when
I was young and this is what I know.

158
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,465
It's a battle of wits eventually.

159
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,269
Being the head of such a small village
wouldn't do.

160
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,539
This is a totally different matter
to deal with. Of course.

161
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,239
Excuse me?

162
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,549
Are you saying my face is old

163
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,349
and that I'm stupid right now?

164
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,545
Ms. Pi, you should do it.

165
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,019
I've just moved in,

166
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,719
and I don't know
much about the village.

167
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,085
Let's vote.

168
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,789
- Excuse me?
- Let's vote.

169
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,985
Democracy is all about voting.

170
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,129
- Okay.
- Yes. Let's do it.

171
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,899
That's a good idea.

172
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,495
Ms. Pi, you never disappoint us.

173
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,499
- That's a great idea.
- Let's do it.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,805

176
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,609
I didn't.

177
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,505
I didn't vote for me.

178
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,445
Would you shut it, you brat?

179
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,345
Can't I share my two cents?

180
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,645
Da-mi. Da-mi!

181
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,255
Okay, Chef Moon.

182
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,429
I hope you do your
best for our village.

183
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,499
If you have any questions,

184
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,269
contact me anytime you want.

185
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,265
Chef Moon, how do you feel?

186
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,245
I...

187
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,615
I'll go and get some sikhye.

188
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,219
Sikhye?

189
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,989
Dad, take me too.

190
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,449
Is he treating us?

191
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,389
I want some more sikhye too.

192
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,459
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

193
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,289
- Can I have some seaweed soup?
- Goodness.

194
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,529
Don't be so downhearted, Ms. Pi.

195
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,425
Square your shoulders. Wait for me.

196
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,635
Have you heard?

197
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,269
As soon as the redevelopment plan
of Seoha Village was spread,

198
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,609
the land value increased already.

199
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,609
According to my uncle
who works as a real estate agent,

200
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,779
our land value will soar
at least five times

201
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,849
once the redevelopment is done.

202
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,019
- That's good.
- Awesome.

203
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,549
Don't you know about Anjoong?

204
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,719
My sister-in-law got
married in Anjoong.

205
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,089
That city was gentrified
and she's now driving a BMW.

206
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,729
- A BMW?
- Really?

207
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,895
I guess we'll only have
sunny days ahead of us.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,829
- Right.
- I'm so excited.

209
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,165
What?

210
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,265
What did you just say?

211
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,165
Say it again.

212
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,405
I said, say it again!

213
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,139
What's wrong with you?

214
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,839
Why did you have to talk about

215
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,979
World Chef Championship

216
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,409
and cooking dinners for the president?

217
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,915
How could you be so slow-witted?

218
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,615
Why did you have to recommend me
at that moment?

219
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,689
You know a lot of higher-ups.

220
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,459
It's good if you could help out
the village.

221
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,329
And the adults are against it.

222
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,989
We should help our neighbors!

223
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,059
Then you should do it, why me?

224
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,095
My dad told me to never be the leader.

225
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,695
Darn you.

226
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,365
Something happened at the sauna.

227
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,005
Come on!

228
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,239
What is it again?

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,475
- Goodness.
- What's going on?

230
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,009
They're from Sangcheon Village.

231
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,649
What are you doing here?
This is ridiculous.

232
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,189
Do you know what
they were talking about?

233
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,819
Goodness, what?

234
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,089
If they build factories,
your land value will increase?

235
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,825
Consider yourself dead today,
you're dead meat.

236
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,499
Bring it on. Bring it on!

237
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,999
We didn't say anything wrong.
What's the matter with you?

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,239
What?

239
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,409
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

240
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,909
What kind of lesson?

241
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,239
- Goodness.
- Are you mad?

242
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,109
How dare you point at someone
older than you?

243
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,579
- Yes, I'm mad.
- Why you...

244
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,349
- Take this!
- Gosh!

245
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,679
- Do something.
- Go!

246
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,319
- What did you say?
- Come on.

247
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,385
- Come over here!
- What did you say?

248
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,859
- Take that.
- How dare you, get out!

249
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,589
- Let go.
- Mom!

250
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,525
- Let go.
- Get away!

251
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,499
Let go!

252
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,799
Why you brat!

253
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,025
- Get out!
- Move!

254
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,169
Nosebleed!

255
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,865
Nosebleed!

256
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,965
Hyo-sook!

257
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,749
Hyo-sook is not breathing.

258
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,845
CPR!

259
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,559
Resident's Companion,
Trusty Nonyang Police

260
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,685
This one?

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,385
It's fine.

262
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,989
You can't reach the owner, right?

263
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,095
Right.

264
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,265
If we can't contact the owner,

265
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,569
he must've bought it from shark loans.

266
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,669
What will happen to this car?

267
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,665
What do you think?
We should sell it by public auction.

268
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,335
You checked the inside, right?

269
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,909
Last time, there was a fish
or something inside

270
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,875
and we almost died cleaning that.

271
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,779
I'll double-check.

272
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,975
- Okay. Please do.
- Yes.

273
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,655
What's this?

274
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,235
It's blood.

275
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,935
It's blood.

276
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,075
All the other chefs are
incredible as well,

277
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,309
but I believe Chef Moon Seung-mo

278
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,015
is the right man
for our premium Korean food project.

279
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,259
What do you think, Ms. Song?

280
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,619
He's the only chef who's capable

281
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,125
of presenting all types of Korean food
across the nation.

282
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,555
We were considering him

283
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,855
since the very
beginning of this project.

284
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,899
Marketing team?

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,999
His wide experience in foreign stages

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,264
will also be of great help
when launching in the global market.

287
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,638
Moon Seung-mo is that outstanding?

288
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,474
I told you. He's the best.

289
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,999
Since you're here,

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,465
- I'll be honest with you.
- Okay.

291
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,699
To me, it's a tempting offer.

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,995
I'm glad you think so.

293
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,735
There aren't many chefs in Korea
who can pull off such a business...

294
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,449
Is there a problem?

295
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,245
This seems to be Chef Moon's work.

296
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,545
Are you in touch with
Chef Moon Seung-mo?

297
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,285
No.

298
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,915
If Chef Moon is in this,
it will be game over.

299
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,525
I'm glad he is not. Please try it.

300
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,425
One bulgogi and two bibimbap!

301
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,485
Gourmandism

302
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,685
By the way,

303
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,285
Chef Moon is certainly
out of this, right?

304
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,959
- Pardon?
- I mean, if Chef Moon is in this too,

305
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,265
there's no reason for us to do it.

306
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,905
Is there something important
to talk about?

307
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,575
It is something important.

308
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,505
As I told you before, I came to Seoul.

309
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,149
So are you going to treat me a drink?

310
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,545
Of course I will.

311
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,955
As a matter of fact,

312
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,085
the company I'm working for now is
preparing a premium Korean food project.

313
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,529
And I need your help.
That's why I'm here.

314
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,625
Gourmandism

315
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,195
- "Premium Korean food project"?
- Yes.

316
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,935
Please take a look inside.

317
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,645
I'm sure you will love it.

318
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,645
Donghan Food

319
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,615
Mr. Choi.

320
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,515
Yes?

321
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,885
I'm sorry

322
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,855
but I can't work with Donghan. Sorry.

323
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,485
Excuse me?

324
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,765
Yes.

325
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,869
We are planning to advertise
this show extensively

326
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,635
so everyone in Korea
will know about it.

327
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,569
Don't worry about the cost.

328
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,075
Just make sure to publish
as many advertisements as possible.

329
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,245
All right. Thank you.

330
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,555
It seems that you are advertising
the show more intensively than usual.

331
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,525
So Bella sees it and comes back.

332
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,395
What if she doesn't?

333
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,365
What?

334
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,735
What if Bella never comes back?

335
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,235
Are you out of your mind?
How dare you say nonsense like that?

336
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,345
Bella will definitely come back.

337
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,615
The show is just around the corner.
Why don't you focus on your work?

338
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,625
Yes. This is Jang Sun-young.

339
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,095
Yes. There is a
person that I must find.

340
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,935
I need to find the person in secret.

341
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,605
Oh, I see.

342
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,005
Okay. I will call you back.

343
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,015
Excuse me.

344
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,255
Are you

345
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,685
- looking for somebody?
- Pardon?

346
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,625
I think I can help you.

347
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,265
Actually, finding
people is my specialty.

348
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,435
This is unpleasant.

349
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,335
I didn't know you were an eavesdropper.
It's not a nice habit to have.

350
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,275
If you change your mind later, call me.

351
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,715
Hey, how am I supposed to trust you?

352
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,959
Seeing that you tag
along with Lim Hyun-ah,

353
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,755
you must be one of
Lim Chul-yong's people.

354
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,425
We are freelancers.
We don't work for certain people.

355
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,965
We work for those
who make a better offer.

356
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,675
Well, then.

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,155
<i>Jin Tae-soo</i>

358
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,565
Down there is the entrance
of Seoha Village.

359
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,299
Donghan International plans to build
a clothing manufacturing factory

360
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,505
and a general warehouse.

361
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,275
The total land is 336,528m².

362
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,809
We will combine the
dispersed warehouses

363
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,505
and move them to a bigger place.

364
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,715
After the project is completed, not only
the increase of Nonyang's population

365
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,915
but also a revitalization
of the domestic market is expected.

366
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,915
This will be the biggest facility
in this region, sir.

367
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,755
Don't worry.
Nonyang will take care of it.

368
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,095
Make sure to take good care
of the residents' complaints.

369
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,625
- Mr. Hwang.
- Yes.

370
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,635
- Is everything going all right?
- Yes, sir.

371
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,405
The preparation for today's briefing
is going smoothly.

372
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,775
Good. Thanks.

373
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,675
Now, shall we?

374
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,745
This way.

375
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,855
You're making me dizzy.

376
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,539
Why are you so restless
like a dog that has a call of nature?

377
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,505
She's right. Stay still, will you?
You're distracting me.

378
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,235
Do you have any idea
how amazing this is?

379
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,875
Why won't Mom call me?

380
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,575
May I ask what is so amazing?

381
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,719
What a frustrating man you are.

382
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,789
Seoha Teahouse

383
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,689
Depending on the result
of the briefing today,

384
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,485
I might end up going to Seoul.

385
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,155
How isn't that amazing?

386
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,525
You're right.

387
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,965
It is truly amazing indeed.

388
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,569
How annoying.

389
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,665
But I like here better than Seoul.

390
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,149
Now we are going to start
the briefing about the development

391
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,275
of Seoha Village and Mount Bongu
in Nonyang.

392
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,749
The county governor, the Managing Director
of Donghan International, Lim Chul-yong,

393
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,855
and the Junior Managing Director,
Jung Gwang-su, joined us today.

394
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,225
This is cool.

395
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,755
Thanks for coming.

396
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,095
The construction of Donghan's
clothing industrial complex

397
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,939
will be the biggest development project
in our region.

398
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,135
As Mount Bongu and Seoha Village are
within the development area,

399
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,635
for the construction
of the clothing industrial complex,

400
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,709
they will have to be moved...

401
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,749
What?

402
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,075
Are you saying you will sweep us away?

403
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,549
All residents of Seoha Village are
against this project.

404
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,389
He's right.

405
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,819
One's property rights
must be protected.

406
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,689
This one-sided project is just absurd.

407
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,859
He's right. We are against this.

408
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,165
- I don't want this.
- Hey, the Subsection Chief is talking.

409
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,569
Who do you think
you are to interrupt him?

410
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,505
He's the chief
of our village's task force.

411
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,905
"Chief"?

412
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,639
Now that you mention it,

413
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,575
it's not something
that you can be against.

414
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,609
It's the county office's decision.

415
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,949
It's not something you can go against.

416
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,419
He's right. Plus, this isn't only
Seoha Village's matter.

417
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,789
This is a matter
of the entire residents of Nonyang.

418
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,859
- You must hear
- Goodness.

419
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,215
other villagers' opinions too.

420
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,159
Every resident in Sangcheon Village
supports this project.

421
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,829
- That's right!
- We do support the project.

422
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,239
My goodness. Look at them applauding.

423
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,139
- Stop applauding.
- Goodness.

424
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,139
Seeing her talking all nonsense,

425
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,339
I regret that I didn't crush him
the other day.

426
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,439
Look who's talking!

427
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,709
What the...

428
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,149
Do you want a piece of me?

429
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,919
Bring it on if that's what you want.

430
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,779
- We didn't start this! You started it!
- Be quiet.

431
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,349
- This is unbelievable.
- Goodness.

432
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,145
Just stop already!

433
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,885
Sit down.

434
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,159
The villagers of Seoha Village
will lose their hometown

435
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,655
once the construction begins.

436
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,595
So their opinions
should matter the most.

437
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,499
Our chief is one smooth talker.

438
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,129
- He sure is.
- What?

439
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,999
- That's just absurd.
- What?

440
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,639
All residents of Nonyang
have the right to make the decision.

441
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,809
- That's true.
- See?

442
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,479
- Don't be ridiculous!
- No way!

443
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,439
- What are you talking about?
- That's just nonsense!

444
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,705
- Our opinion matters the most!
- She's right!

445
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,719
- Don't be ridiculous!
- I can't believe this!

446
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,185
- Seriously!
- What's with all the mess?

447
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,689
- This is insane!
- Stop yelling!

448
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,759
- Wait!
- How dare you point your finger at me!

449
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,889
This is just ridiculous!

450
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,885
Stop the nonsense!

451
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,425

Let's talk.

454
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,765
Get off of me.

455
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,735
Just for a second, sir.

456
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,975
Mr. Lim Chul-yong!

457
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,975
Stop it. Gosh.

458
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,245
Darn it.

459
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,475
Where are you going?

460
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,025
So he's the chief of the opposition?

461
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,855
That's right, sir.

462
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,199
The villagers seemed to like him.

463
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,195
It might make things rather easier.

464
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,395
Pardon?

465
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,065
You remember how we disassembled
the labor union before.

466
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,835
Try to win him over.

467
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,575
Yes, sir. I will do some research.

I didn't kill her. I really didn't.

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,305
I didn't kill Bella.

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,115

It was

476
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,365
just an accident.

477
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,765
An accident.

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,575
"Bella"?

479
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,565
She should be back before the show.

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,865
Come on, Bella. What happened to you?

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,835

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,385
You must be worried

You don't look as happy as before.

You have changed a lot.

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,235
You never worried about others.

I want to know and
hear a lot of things,

491
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,775
but today, I will ask you
only one question.

492
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,045
I asked Mr. Lim about it,
but he wouldn't give me a clear answer.

493
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,425
Bella. Who is she?

494
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,555
I told you before.

495
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,195

I'm not sure what you're talking about.

500
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,145
So it's her.

501

You weren't a talented designer,

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,155

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,725

that I should be hearing this.

to keep your face straight right now.

I think it will be hard to find her
just with a picture.

531
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,515
Yoo Yu-jin.

532
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,785
She's 34 years old this year.

533
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,355
About a couple of months ago,
she called me and said she'd fly to Korea.

534
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,355
And I haven't heard
anything from her since.

535
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,995
She has lived in France for 20 years,

536
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,329
so she probably knows
next to nothing about Korea.

537
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,365
Which is why it was hard to find her.

538
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,834
I visited the place she used to live
when she was young,

539
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,165
but I guess it has been too long.

540
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,004
The house is now owned by someone else.

541
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,205
May I ask

542
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,945
your relationship with her?

543
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,915
She's...

544
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,715
like my daughter.

545
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,529

<i>Direction of the project</i>

547
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,175
- You came back late.
- I had some drink.

548
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,045
Something interesting happened.

549
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,315
Today, I learned who Bella was.

550
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,525
What?

551
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,495
You will also be surprised
to know who she is.

552
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,205
You don't know who she is, do you?

553
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,475
What do you mean?

554
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,115
As I said before,

555
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,645
I can't be

556
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,685
on the same team

557
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,655
with someone who deceives me.

558
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,285
I want you to keep that in mind.

559
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,245
<i>Bella</i>

560
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,985
<i>Donghan International, Bella</i>

561
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,755
<i>Donghan International, Bella</i>

562
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,335
A collaboration with dead Bella?

563
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,435
She's asking me to find Bella
not knowing if she's dead or not?

564
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,545
I got a big one.

565
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,055
What is Doctor Choi saying?

566
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,425
It's just a checkup.

567
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,035
To be honest,

568
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,765
I'm not sure how much longer

569
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,705
I can enjoy times like this,

570
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,875
which is why I called you.

571
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,445
Grandpa, don't say that.

572
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,515
- Jun-su,
- Yes?

573
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,185
I'm sure you had a nice life in the US,

574
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,225
sorry for calling you back to
Korea like this.

575
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,825
And thanks for coming back.

576
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,365
I told you, I came back
because I wanted to.

577
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,739
If you keep saying that,
I'm going to go back.

578
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,405
You kid!

579
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,085
Fishing is

580
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,585
a lot like running a business.

581
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,625
Those who catch fish well

582
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,299
try their best to catch whatever it is,

583
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,535
whether it's a big fish
or a small fish.

584
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,905
It goes the same for
running a business.

585
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,319
Even just the slightest bit of ego

586
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,815
telling me that I've done enough

587
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,115
can push me down
to the ground in failure.

588
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,195
Of course, there are
lessons to learn from failing.

589
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,725
But now is

590
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,135
the time you need to succeed.

591
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,365
That's why I'm nagging you like this.

592
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,275
Chul-yong is

593
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,915
not an easy opponent.

594
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,215
Yes.

595
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,625
I'll remember that.

Hey.

You look worried.

612
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,775
My parents

613
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,189
had Pungcheonok passed down to them,
and have operated the place

614
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,915
to maintain its 80-year tradition.

615
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,155
And all I have left
is just a signboard.

616
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,725
Yes.

617
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,825
The company that took away Pungcheonok
from my parents is

618
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,825
Donghan.

619
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,565
And they're now trying
to take this house away, too.

620
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,075
That's ridiculous!
How can they do such a thing?

621
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,605
I know.

622
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,045
It's an ill-fated relationship.

623
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,745
Since we've come to this point,
I'm never letting them have their way.

624
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,585
I'll help you as much as I can.

625
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,125
They better watch out.

00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,109
Everyone, Donghan Group is trying
to take over our village!

00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,869
- They're sweeping it away!
- Please sign in it!

628
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,909
- Please take one.
- Please.

629
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,209
Take this. Thanks.

630
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,579
No, thank you.

631
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,249
Please, just one.

632
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,419
Is signing a petition so difficult?

633
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,719
It's so cold and
people are even colder.

634
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,419
It's a cold world.

635
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,355

Here, sign this for me.

636
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,759
You're doing good work.

637
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,129
Do you just go around during your
work hours, talking to people?

638
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,099
How do you know everyone?

639
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,095
It's nice to know lots of people.

640
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,899
I don't know anyone, so I'm no help.

641
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,899
Chef Moon, I thought you were famous!

642
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,335
Why doesn't anyone here know you?

643
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,935
I don't know. Maybe I should've made
more appearances on TV.

644
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,149
It's so cold, can't we just start
from inside the market?

645
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,719
- It's too cold, isn't it?
- Yes!

646
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,249
Everyone, let's start
from inside the market.

647
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,849
- I know a lot of people in there.
- Sounds good.

648
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,559
Let's start from the inside.
Let's head in. It's too cold.

649
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,229
- Let's go!
- Let's head inside.

650
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,229
Come in.

651
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,995
Where did Hyo-sook go?

652
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,669
- Go ahead with the development!
- Go ahead with the development!

653
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,399
- Go ahead with the development!
- Go ahead with the development!

654
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,909
Everyone, this is

655
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,275

our petition signed.

656
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,539

- Go ahead with the development!
- Go ahead with the development!

660
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,845
Look there. Come here.

661
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,859
Hello!

662
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,929
- Could you sign this for us?
- Thanks so much!

663
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,789
Where should I go next?

664
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,429
- Hey there!
- Here.

665
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,459
Hello.

666
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,795
- Hey, do you mind signing this for me?
- Let me try this.

667
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,899
Hello!

668
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,795
Down with the warehouse development!

669
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,575
Where is Da-hoon?
I don't see him at all.

670
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,275
I don't know.

671
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,205
All right. Do I sign in here?

672
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,375
You!

673
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,159
Ms. Byung-chun! Hyo-sook is in red!

674
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,215
What?

675
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,589
You! Stop right there!

676
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,655
You!

677
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,299
Stop right there!

678
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,269
What do you think you're doing?

679
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,065
- You're dead!
- Bang Da-hoon!

680
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,099
- Stop right there.
- Da-hoon!

681
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,169
Stop!

682
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,369
- I can't stand them anymore.
- How could they...

683
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,475
- Stop there!
- You!

684
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,379
- How dare you?
- Come here.

685
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,275
- Fight me.
- How could you?

686
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,815
My goodness.

687
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,619
I'm going to die from the frustration.

688
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,289
- How can you be so mindless?
- Calm down.

689
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,889
How can I calm down?

690
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,255
Sure, I get Hyo-sook.

691
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,659
But Da-hoon, I knew you were crazy,

692
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,129
but have you gone out of your mind?

693
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,199
No need to ask.

694
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,139
I knew it when they started
hanging out every day.

695
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,269
Let's have them sit here like this
until tomorrow.

696
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,109
Until tomorrow? Please!

697
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,839
Put your hands down

698
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,005
and I'll kill you both with
my own hands. Understood?

699
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,675
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

700
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,845
Stop it.

701
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,815
Put your hands down and stand up.

702
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,755
I have nothing to say.

703
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,355
She's not my daughter, she's my enemy.

704
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,659
Calm down.

705
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,595
We've got quite some signatures
on our petition, so we still have hope.

706
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,295
The next part is what matters.

707
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,009
Chef Moon, this won't do at all.

708
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,439
You've seen it all earlier

709
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,039
how hard those two worked
to get their petition signed.

710
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,749
Their side has so many more signatures
than ours. It's incomparable.

711
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,609
In my opinion,

712
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,715
we're completely defeated.

713
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,115
We need to find a new way.

714
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,685
Then let's each try to come up
with something.

715
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,959
I'll head to Seoul and meet up
with some news reporters tomorrow.

716
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,185
All right.

717
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,899
Don't you think
we'd leave a bad impression

718
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,435
if we just show up like this?

719
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,065
You wanted to meet him.

720
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,009
I know him,

721
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,035
and he doesn't change
his mind so easily.

722
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,975
If we don't show up like this,
we'll never see him again.

723
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,045
Especially you.

724
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,885
What did I do?

Chef, are you there?

728
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,065
What should we do?
I don't think he's home.

What are you doing in my field?

732
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,179
We're here to measure the ground.

733
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,349
Don't mind us and do your job.

734
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,719
Who gave you permission

735
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,249
to measure my land?

736
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,589
The county office gave us permission.

737
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,749
The county office, my foot.

738
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,019
It's my land, not theirs!

739
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,589
You're a part of those people trying
to take our village, aren't you?

740
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,455
And you want me not to mind you?

741
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,795
Sure.

742
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,695
I'm going to beat you guys up,

743
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,509

to do your job, too?

744

Are you trying to scare us with that?

747
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,449
- Let's go.
- I'm just defending myself.

748
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,715
Fine, bring it on.

749
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,789
Goodness. My back!

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,969
You think a clueless old man like you
can fight us?

752
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,199
Demolishing the village
and building a factory is good.

753
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,369
Why are you interrupting us?

754
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,739
- My neck!
- Hey!

00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,235
- beat up an old man like this?
- You're going to kill me!

from Nonyang Construction.

769
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,349
I called the police.

770
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,909
Stop it if you don't
want to go to prison.

771
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,515

772
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,145
Come on.

773
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,869
Even if it's your request,

774
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,439
it's such a small village thing,

775
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,635
so it's going to get cut.

776
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,869
Isn't there anything you can do?

777
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:31,375
Maybe if you do an exclusive interview
with us, things will be different.

778
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,015
I'll do it.

779
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,385
Okay, I'll make up a story then.

780
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,555

would've gotten hurt, too.

Mr. Choi? What brings you here?

801
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,175
I came here to see you

802
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,645
but ended up here.

Are you all right?

807
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,895
Yes, all thanks to them.

00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,995
But Bong-doo is...

809
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,865
We meet again.

810
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,905
Right.

811
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,105
Bong-doo, you'll be moved to a ward.

00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,175
- Please be gentle.
- Bong-doo.

813
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,315
Chef Moon,

814
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,915
do you mind sparing a minute for me?

815
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,455
Please.

816
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,099
Thankfully, the police are

817
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,395
being very cooperative.

818
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,095
I don't think there will be anything
for you to worry about.

819
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,075
First of all, thank you.

820
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,075
It would've been a disaster
if it weren't for you.

821
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,975
I did what I had to.

822
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,745
But

823
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,115
the reason we're here is

824
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,459
that we want to have you
as the directing chef for this project.

825
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,025
That's why we came to Nonyang.

826
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,799
I understand that you may not want to

827
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,769
because of what happened
with Pungcheonok.

828
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,665
But Mr. Kang has
nothing to do with that.

829
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,665
Mr. Kang Jun-su,

830
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,475
how are you related to the managing
director of Donghan International,

831
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,705
who wants to build a factory here
while hurting people?

832
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,645
Lim Chul-yong.

833
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,355
He was the one who proceeded
with the Pungcheonok case too, right?

834
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,559
Well...

835
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,795
It's okay.

836
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,265
Mr. Lim Chul-yong is

837
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,735
someone that I need to overcome.

838
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,339
Chef Moon, just have a look look
at the project plan.

839
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,309
It's a great business plan.

840
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,579
We can do everything as you'd like.

841
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,249
Can you just look over...

842
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,415
Thank you for today.

843
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,815

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,025
Hold on.

846
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,089
Mr. Choi, I'm sorry, but...

847
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,559
When we were in Australia,

848
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,225
you promised that you'd help me out
once in Korea.

849
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,925
You haven't forgotten, have you?

850
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,235
This is it.

851
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,935
I'm not telling you
to decide right now.

852
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,475
Just please take a look at it
and give me a call when you do.

853
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,645
Gun-woo,

854
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:36,285
do you know anything else
about what Mr. Lim is doing here?

855
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,985
Well... I don't.

00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,365
Why did you make such a mess?

858
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,939
That old man was getting on my nerves.

859
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,705
That's your excuse?

860
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,535
You can't even train
your employees properly?

861
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,909
What a headache.

862
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:01,215
Sorry.

863
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,089
I'll take care of it

00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,845
as the representative
of Nonyang Construction.

865
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,015

one more time, you're done.

866
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,085
Yes, sir.

867
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,065
What are you going to do
about Seoha Village?

868
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,595
What else is there to do?

869
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,835
If we have to, we'll get an approval
from the board of county

870
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,865
and force the eviction.

871
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,209
What? Bong-doo?

872
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,705
All right, I'll visit him later.

873
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,119
I knew there'd be a disaster!

874
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,119
I can't agree with this,
but I can't disagree either.

875
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,685
- What am I supposed to do?
- Are you really going to do this?

876

As long as I proceed with
this Donghan project,

877
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,129
I could be appointed
as the provincial governor.

878

Stupid people are ruining everything!
Darn it.

879
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,895
You should lower your voice.

880
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,635
- Take a look at this.
- What is this?

881
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,065
"Promoting local produce"?

882
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,639
You think we have time for this?

883

00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,279
Tell the Director of
Culture and Tourism to wait.

885
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,445
Yes, sir.

886
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,585
He's going to leave us with nothing
and become a provincial governor?

887
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,325
<i>Department of Culture and Tourism</i>

888
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,329
Gosh. What happened?

889
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,869
Are you all right? What do we do?

890
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,769
Hey there.

891
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,999
Hi.

892
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,835
Some men came and made a mess
at my field today.

893
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,309
Careful!

894
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:37,205
They were from the
construction company.

895
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,445
Officer Jo caught them.

896
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,249
- Such heinous people!
- Goodness.

897
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,919
They've been in and out of jail
so many times.

898
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,615
- That's terrible.
- Indeed.

899
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,429
See? Those people you sided with

900
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,389
made him like this. Are you happy now?

901
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,525
Don't put it that way.

902
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,995
Sorry, sir.

903
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,969
Bong-doo, I'm not one of them.

904
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,869
You better apologize properly.

905
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,309
- Stop smacking me!
- Please.

906
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,579
Be quiet! Seriously.

907
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:12,379
What are you going to do?
Are you just going to let this go?

908
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,819
I've contacted the Jo Family Club,

909
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,089
so they should be all heading
to the county office now.

910
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,619
Good job.

911
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,819
I'll head to the county office
and talk to the county governor.

912
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,089
- Good idea.
- Byeol-na, stay here with Seol-ah.

913
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,729
No, let me come with you.
Painter, watch Seol-ah.

914
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,499
- What?
- I'll go with you!

915
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,869
I'm the one who has strings to pull.

916
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,129
Everyone,

917
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,239
we shouldn't just stay here
like this, either.

918
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,969
- Let's go!
- That's right!

919
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,465
We'll be back.

920
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:43,845
We'll stay here,
looking back on what we've done!

921
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,949
Come back safely!

922
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:50,149
Look. This is Nonyang County Office.

923
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,415
It's big, isn't it?

924
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,455
This is where my husband works
as the subsection chief.

925
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,259
- Subsection Chief?
- Yes, it's a powerful position.

926
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,429
- It's not food.
- Chef Moon!

927
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,929
- Chef Moon!
- Honey!

928
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,755
Come and have a talk with me.

929
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,895
Honey, I'm here.

930
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,169
Head inside, it's cold.

931
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,929
He's worrying for us.

932
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,609
Let's head inside. It's cold.
Let's go inside. This way.

933
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,005
Chef Moon, I have
something to show you.

934
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,175
Take a look at this.

935
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,245
Come on.

936
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,949
<i>Kind People, Good Nonyang</i>

937
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,589
Sir, we're in trouble.

938
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,885
What's up?

939
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,029
The entier Jo family is here,

940
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,059
demanding to have a meeting with you.

941
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,099
What?

942
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,365
This won't be good for
the upcoming appointment.

943
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,365
You know how powerful they are
in this region.

944
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,269
Why Jo family of all people?

945
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,009
I think you should flee
for the time being.

946
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,739
That's right. Tell them
that I'm on a work trip.

947
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,575
Okay. This way.

948
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,475
This is not proper.

949
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,385
- This shouldn't happen here!
- Right.

950
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,859
It's the home of politeness and
manners, Chungcheong Province!

951
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,989
That's right!

952
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,055
How dare young men

953
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:09,699
- beat up an old man in broad daylight?
- Sir.

954
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,829
Get out of my way!

955
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:15,499
- We can't just let this one slide.
- Please.

956
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,539
- Right.
- Get out!

957
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,769
- Sir...
- Get the county governor here.

958
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,209
Get the county governor here!

959
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,639
- Come on.
- Bring him.

960
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,709
- Bring him right now.
- Please calm down.

961
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,309
- Let's go.
- How could they?

962
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,075
Bring him here!

963
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,555
- Sir, hold on.
- What?

964
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,755
Kind People, Good Nonyang

965
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,169
Kind People, Good Nonyang

966
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,625
Nonyang County Office

967
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:50,669
Goodness. Thank you!

968
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,309
- Come here.
- Thanks for coming.

969
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,739
We can't even go out!

970
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,835
Lock the doors!

971
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,245
- Lock all of them!
- Yes, sir.

972
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,679
- Where should we go?
- Let's head upstairs.

973
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,415
- Upstairs?
- Come with me.

974
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,219
We're not here to exercise violence.
Let us meet the county governor.

975
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,159
He's on a business trip right now.

976
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,855
- Make an appointment and come...
- We'll wait here, then.

977
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,995
Call him.

978
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,995
The entire Seoha Village people
are here, waiting to meet him.

979
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,505
Call him. Come on.

980
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,505
- You can do it.
- Go and check first.

981
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,305
- Check!
- Yes, sir.

982
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,815
Hello.

983
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,555
What?

984
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,799
I thought he wasn't here. Here he is!

985
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,199
- Look at that!
- He's right there!

986
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,439
He was running away
from us all this time!

987
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,199
How dare a young man be so rude?

988
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,769
- Look at him.
- How dare he?

989
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,175
Yes, sir.

990
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,675
Yes.

991
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,879
The county governor is inside.

992
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,009
- What?
- What?

993
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:09,249
- How dare you lie to us?
- You lied to us!

994
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,819
You shouldn't lie like that.

995
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,489
- Let's head inside.
- Let's go.

996
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,219
Get out of the way.

997
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,655
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

998
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,155
Look, Mr. Hong.

999
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:26,195
We've supported you
during your election

1000
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,335
and elected you to serve us.

1001
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,365
How could you do this?

1002
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:36,305
How dare your people beat up
an old man in broad daylight?

1003
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,845
And we came to meet you,

1004
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,979
but you didn't even come out.

1005
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,515
Instead, you were too busy finding
a way to run away from us. Despicable.

1006
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,115
- Sir!
- Be careful.

1007
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,025
Sir, please calm down.

1008
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,755
It's not what you think it is.

1009
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,499
We're going to do whatever we can

1010
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,265
to punish the men
for what happened yesterday.

1011
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,469
But the Seoha Village takeover is
for the county and the village.

1012
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,965
I had no choice.

1013
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,109
If it's for the betterment
of the county and the village,

1014
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,279
then is it okay to proceed
without our permission?

1015
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,579
- That's right.
- Please calm down.

1016
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,315
Mr. Hong gave it a lot of thought
before making the decision.

1017
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,249
Every year, the population is decreasing,
and jobs are disappearing.

1018
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,359
How else can we develop the county...

1019
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,125
Is that what you need?
An alternative plan?

1020
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,095
An alternative plan?

1021
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,295
What plan?

1022
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,565
What happened?

1023
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,935
We looked into it,

1024
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:45,345
and I don't think we can get him
on our side.

1025
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,549
Why?

1026
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,715
The chief of the village is

1027
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,455
- the son of Pungcheonok.
- Pungcheonok?

1028
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:57,955
You know, the burnt restaurant.

1029
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,755
I do have a plan.

1030
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:08,835
I'll open a restaurant in my name

1031
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,379
in Seoha Village, Nonyang.

1032
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,305
What did he just say?

1033
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,645
What?

1034
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:50,275
(Eccentric! Chef Moon)

1035
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,009
<i>Why are you so worried
even before opening the restaurant?</i>

1036
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,819
<i>I'll take care of the interior design.</i>

1037
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,945
<i>What do you think?</i>

1038
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,819
<i>It's beautiful!</i>

1039
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,489
<i>- Byeol-na, you're the best.
- The best!</i>

1040
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,015
<i>How is there such a hip place
in this middle-of-nowhere village?</i>

1041
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,755
<i>No wonder you're so proud of yourself.</i>

1042
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,025
<i>What a masterpiece.
No wonder you're so picky.</i>

1043
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,229
<i>Bits and pieces of my memories
are coming back.</i>

1044
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,169
<i>Bella, you always came back
before the show.</i>

1045
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:16,095
<i>I present to you,
Designer Yoo Byeol-na!</i>

1046
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,939
<i>Ms. Jang!</i>

1047
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,675
<i>This is the finale
of your fake Bella show.</i>

1048
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,379
<i>Thank you!</i>

1049
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,745
<i>Why are you so full of surprises?</i>

1050
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:33,760
♫ <i>And the fact the it's you,
it was impossible</i> ♫
