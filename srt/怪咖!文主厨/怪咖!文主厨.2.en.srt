00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,631
(Episode 2)

3
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:46,670
Blood...

4
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,040
Bella...

5
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:52,540
Bella...

6
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:54,280
Bella?

7
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:07,620
Dad.

8
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:11,130
What do I do?

9
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,870
We've been having ramyeon for days now.

10
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,344
And you're calling this a meal?

11
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,280
Then are we supposed to drive out
each time?

12
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,080
Just eat!

13
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,424
We don't have
anything in the kitchen.

14
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:37,890
Hey, aren't you tired of eating that?

15
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,260
Why are you picking on her?

16
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,290
Darn it.

17
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,429
We were eating!

18
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,870
Why are you taking that?

19
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,070
Hey!

20
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:01,040
Something good is going to happen.

21
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,810
Stop eating.
We need space for the good stuff.

22
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,480
Thank you for the meal!

23
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:46,790
Unbelievable.

24
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:09,140
It's good.

25
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:11,780
Eat.

26
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:24,030
What are you going to do now?

27
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,830
What?

28
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,999
You said you'll sell the place
and move to Seoul.

29
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:29,400
I don't know.

30
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,204
What about Seol-ah?

31
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,304
We'll find her mother
and send her back.

32
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,440
Right.

33
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:41,710
But don't you think it's weird?

34
00:03:42,045 --> 00:03:46,550
The mom must have a reason
why she left her with you.

35
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:50,354
It's too mean to just send her away.

36
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,050
Do I look like a charity to you?

37
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:55,820
I've never seen her
and she's not even related to me.

38
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,730
So why should I keep her?

39
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,030
I don't know.

40
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,689
Dad.

41
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:29,930
Bella is...

42
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,230
Be quiet.

43
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,940
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,670
Let's go.

45
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,850
Just get in.
The security team will take care of it.

46
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,600
How can we just leave like this?

47
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,730
Bella is gone!

48
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,434
We need to report it to the police
and call 911!

49
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:13,570
She's dead.

50
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,140
She's dead, okay?

51
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,540
She fell into the
river in this weather.

52
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,110
Do you really expect her to be alive?

53
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,980
But still, how can we leave like this?

54
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,380
- We need to at least try...
- Are you trying

55
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,090
to destroy me?

56
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,554
Do you want the
whole world to know that

57
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,564
the daughter of the head
of Donghan International killed

58
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:35,790
the world-class designer, Bella?

59
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,800
The company will quietly
take care of this.

60
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:44,300
You came here alone.

61
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,740
Don't say anything.

62
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,420
Where did she go? Gosh.

63
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,700
Gosh, where is she?

64
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:16,660
Seung-mo!

65
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,140
Seung-mo!

66
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:23,810
- Yes?
- I can't find Seol-ah anywhere.

67
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,610
What happened to her?

68
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,040
Let's go out and look.

69
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,650
Gosh.

70
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,110
Seol-ah!

71
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,050
Seol-ah!

72
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,424
Hello. Did you see Seol-ah,
by any chance?

73
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,464
- Seol-ah?
- Yes.

74
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,090
Seol-ah? I saw her a while ago.

75
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:45,194
Where did I see here, again?

76
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,434
- You're getting dementia.
- What?

77
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:50,004
We just saw her go to the mountains.

78
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,200
The mountains?

79
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:52,204
Why?

80
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:53,944
Weren't you with her?

81
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,570
Yes. Thank you!

82
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,270
Thank you.

83
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:04,380
Gosh, what is she thinking?

84
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:05,650
Stop that.

85
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:08,454
Why is that kid such a brat?

86
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,950
- I said, stop that!
- Stop what?

87
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:15,290
Darn it.

88
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,530
I'm going back,
so you look for her on your own.

89
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,260
Hey! Why, you...

90
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,774
Hey!
I get that you're going through a lot,

91
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:25,400
but this is too much!

92
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,474
Seol-ah is only seven.

93
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,970
Do you think she feels good
about this situation?

94
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:33,110
Darn it.

95
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,540
Do whatever you want.

96
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:40,280
Seol-ah!

97
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:42,950
Seol-ah!

98
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:47,960
Hello.

99
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,364
You're here.

100
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,594
It's a good thing you came.

101
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,804
When the town is going through
something like this,

102
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:57,670
we need the youngsters to help out.

103
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,604
- Where are you going?
- To hunt down the boar.

104
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,844
- "The boar"?
- Yes.

105
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,514
Mr. Yang got attacked by a boar

106
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,740
while picking mushrooms and
hasn't been able to walk for a month.

107
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,984
The boars are so wicked these days.

108
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,310
- You won't believe it!
- We need to kill them all!

109
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,990
Seung-mo, there are boars up there.
What are we going to do?

110
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,324
- Chef Moon!
- Chef Moon, where are you going?

111
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,760
Young man!
What will you do with your bare hands?

112
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,060
The boars won't be an easy match!

113
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:29,560
That's not it. Seol-ah ran away

114
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,404
and the ladies said
she went into the mountains.

115
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:35,140
- What?
- Chef Moon's kid?

116
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,204
Yes.

117
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,344
What are you all doing here?

118
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:42,014
Goodness, they think their kid
went into the mountains.

119
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:43,810
- What?
- So that's why he ran like that.

120
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:45,514
Let's follow on before
something happens.

121
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,354
- Yes.
- Why would we go?

122
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:49,579
- This is crazy!
- It's dangerous!

123
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,690
Kid!

124
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,420
Kid!

125
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:56,960
Seol-ah!

126
00:08:58,235 --> 00:08:59,360
Gosh.

127
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:01,960
Kid!

128
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:04,830
Kid!

129
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,370
Seol-ah!

130
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,700
Kid!

131
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:21,580
It's going to get dark soon.

132
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,290
Where did she go?

133
00:09:28,665 --> 00:09:29,760
Kid!

134
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,730
What are you doing out here?
It's dangerous.

135
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,430
A kid like you
shouldn't be out here alone.

136
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,400
You wanted me to go.

137
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,800
I was just happy to see my father.

138
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:46,570
But you don't like me and want me out.

139
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:48,480
What are you talking about?

140
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,110
Do you really want me to yell at you?

141
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,684
- Over there.
- What are you doing?

142
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:57,790
Over there.

143
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,820
What is it?

144
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:04,260
What is it?

145
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:06,960
Seol-ah.

146
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,980
Are you okay?

147
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:32,790
Hey.

148
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:35,620
Hey!

149
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:19,674
- Seol-ah!
- Seol-ah!

150
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,004
- Seol-ah!
- It's getting cold.

151
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,044
- Why? What's wrong?
- What's that noise?

152
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:25,944
- There's something over there!
- What is it?

153
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,110
- It's a boar!
- Stop holding me like that!

154
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:30,510
It's not a boar.

155
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,354
It's Seol-ah! Goodness!

156
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,450
Seol-ah!

157
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:38,950
Goodness, did you hide behind me
because you thought it was a boar?

158
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,864
Goodness gracious,
we've found you, Seol-ah!

159
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,234
Did you run out of fear?

160
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:48,930
Seol-ah, why did you go up
the mountains so late at night?

161
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:51,374
Are you okay? Are you thirsty?
Do you need water?

162
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,274
- No?
- Seol-ah.

163
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,700
Where's Seung-mo? Your dad?

164
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:58,344
- In the mountains. A woman.
- Yes?

165
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:01,384
My dad was in a mess
and there was blood everywhere.

166
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,684
Blood? Oh my goodness!

167
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,914
Who? Where did this happen?

168
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:06,314
All the way over there!

169
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,780
- Over there? Where?
- Over there?

170
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,794
- Goodness! What's happening?
- Gosh, Chef Moon!

171
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,420
Let's go.

172
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,734
Just walk. You can't even run.

173
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,034
- Chef Moon!
- Chef Moon!

174
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,234
- Chef Moon!
- My goodness.

175
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,560
Take it slow.

176
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,934
Who is this lady?

177
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,304
Take this, please.

178
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,844
I am a man with great strength,

179
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,570
but I hurt my back
at the county's athletic meet.

180
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,980
I may be smart, but I'm not fit at all.

181
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:38,014
You know it.
I have dislocations all the time.

182
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,610
That's why I can't put my arms behind.

183
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,750
Do you want me to support her?

184
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,824
- No, it's her butt. What should I do?
- Just get out!

185
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:47,260
- Goodness, isn't this blood?
- What?

186
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,994
- There's blood!
- Gosh, what is going on?

187
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:53,804
Flip it around. My goodness.

188
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,660
What is going on?

189
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:00,270
Gosh.

190
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,140
Goodness.

191
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,680
What's taking the ambulance so long?

192
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:11,184
By the way, did that lady
get hit by a boar?

193
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:12,454
I don't know.

194
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,280
Let me catch my breath.

195
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:17,094
The county office should've caught
all the boars in advance.

196
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,794
Look, a person is injured.

197
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,494
No wonder civil servants are condemned.

198
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,194
I should write a petition
to the Blue House.

199
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,994
To the Blue House? Look at you.

200
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,194
Why do you always blame
the county office for everything?

201
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,734
What did we do wrong?

202
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:30,264
Why do you have to make
a fuss about everything?

203
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:31,504
We have a witness!

204
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,274
A witness we carried
all the way from the woods.

205
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,974
Come on, Chef Moon.
Am I right or wrong?

206
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,074
Right, go ahead and speak.

207
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,314
I said I don't know.

208
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,614
Everyone, just stop.

209
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:40,514
A person is lying down with an injury.

210
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,344
Look at all that blood.

211
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:45,384
I hope she's not in
a critical condition.

212
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,514
What should we do?

213
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,480
Wait.

214
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:48,584
This is when

215
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,954
a civil servant should step in
and do his duty.

216
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,120
- Okay.
- What?

217
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,960
Go check on her.

218
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,760
Taking a closer look...

219
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:00,530
Yes?

220
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:03,900
She's pretty.

221
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,240
- She's pretty?
- Yes.

222
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,844
- She's pretty?
- Ouch!

223
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:13,074
- Gosh, why isn't the ambulance coming?
- How could you say that?

224
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,184
- Gosh.
- Ouch!

225
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,780
- You're pathetic.
- What did I do wrong?

226
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,984
<i>Tell me, what did I do wrong?</i>

227
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,824
- Gosh, they're so loud.
- <i>She's pretty!</i>

228
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,024
<i>- Stop it!
- What? "She's pretty"?</i>

229
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,250
Seol-ah.

230
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:31,130
You should've gone inside.

231
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,100
Is that lady okay?

232
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

233
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,734
Don't worry and go inside the home.

234
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,570
The adults will take care of it.

235
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:46,810
Oh, you must be hungry.

236
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,580
Wait a second.

237
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,990
Nibble on this.
Let's go inside the home.

238
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,350
Just a second.

239
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:03,460
Yes?

240
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,730
Yes, I'm the one who made the call.

241
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:07,230
Where are you?

242
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,930
Come through the west entrance
of Seoha Village.

243
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,074
Okay.

244
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,134
- Let go!
- Stop it!

245
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:15,844
- Why are you being so worked up about it?
- Get out.

246
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,774
That was totally inappropriate to say.

247
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,374
I'm so embarrassed.

248
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,214
- Who cares?
- How could you joke around?

249
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,284
- I was carrying on with my duties.
- You're so pathetic.

250
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:26,784
- Could you just shut it, you old woman?
- You're pretty too!

251
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:27,954
I know I'm pretty. So what?

252
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,224
Everyone knows I'm pretty.

253
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,354
What are you doing?
You didn't ask for my permission.

254
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:35,024
You can't eat someone else's chocolate
without permission.

255
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:38,260
Honey, what are you doing?

256
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:42,804
Well, Da-hoon gave me this chocolate,

257
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:45,004
but she took it away from me.

258
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,300
That's wrong.

259
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,140
What are you talking about?

260
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,714
The ambulance is coming soon.

261
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,514
- I see.
- Seol-ah. You can't be there.

262
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,140
Come over here to me.

263
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,310
What's going on? What is that?

264
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:00,684
What is she?

265
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,724
- It's a zombie!
- Protect us, Buddha.

266
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:04,820
What are you doing? Let her go.

267
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,564
I'm hungry.

268
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,694
Come here.

269
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:10,790
Gosh.

270
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,690
Wait, that's...

271
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,060
Gosh.

272
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,510
Hey, what is this?

273
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:35,624
This is goji juice.

274
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,524
- Goji?
- What? "Goji"?

275
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:39,824
What's that?

276
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:40,994
It's just some kind of juice.

277
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:44,130
Then she's not covered in blood?

278
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:45,164
It's juice?

279
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:47,034
- Really?
- Yes.

280
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,864
Goodness, what a relief.

281
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:51,934
Thank the lords and deities
all around the world!

282
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:53,834
What a relief it is indeed.

283
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:56,744
Why is it a relief?
Is it a relief because she's pretty?

284
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,474
- Yes.
- Can you quiet down?

285
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,240
I'm so out of my mind.

286
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,380
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

287
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,310
By the way,

288
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,120
who are you all?

289
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,420
- Well... I'm...
- Right.

290
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,794
You fainted in the woods

291
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:19,163
and he carried you all the way here.

292
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,259
- He saved your life.
- Cut it.

293
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:25,900
Wait.

294
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,100
Haven't we met before?

295
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:30,769
What?

296
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:36,214
Are you dropping
pickup lines right now?

297
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,653
No, it's not like that.

298
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:39,754
Goodness, old habits never die.

299
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,824
- Shame on you!
- Shame on you!

300
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:44,120
Chef Moon, I'm disappointed in you.
It's not the right time.

301
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,790
Get out.

302
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:49,220
Hey, Miss. Are you okay?

303
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,664
Who are you and where are you from?

304
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:55,560
- Me?
- Yes, you.

305
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:56,860
I'm...

306
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,240
Who am I?

307
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,070
What's your name?

308
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:05,810
Do you remember your name?

309
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,284
- No.
- You don't?

310
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,644
"No"? Is she from overseas?

311
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,614
- Will you shut it?
- Why?

312
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,710
Where do you live?

313
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:15,624
I don't know.

314
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,154
Do you have any parents,

315
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,224
siblings, relatives, or friends?

316
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,390
I don't know. I can't remember.

317
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,494
She sure did lose it.

318
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:29,800
- Lose what?
- She's speaking casually to us.

319
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,534
She lost her manners for sure.

320
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,174
Goodness, that's not important!

321
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:35,970
I'm certain. I saw her before.

322
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,840
Haven't we met before?

323
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,710
What? Amnesia?

324
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:45,714
Yes. Other than that,

325
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,950
she only has light
scratches and bruises.

326
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,454
Simple treatments will do.

327
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,094
Is this some kind of drama or what?

328
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:55,064
How could something so bizarre happen?

329
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,820
It can happen.

330
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,164
There are cases when patients suffer

331
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,334
from brief memory loss
after an accident.

332
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,430
Most of them do gain their memory back.

333
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,274
But there are rare cases in which
that doesn't happen.

334
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:10,604
What will happen to her?

335
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,744
We'll have to see.

336
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:14,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:17,784
What's going to happen now?

338
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:20,214
Do we have to take care of her?

339
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:22,920
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

340
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,420
Can't you remember anything?

341
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,500
- I'm hungry.
- Gosh.

342
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't worry.
We have our light in the dark.

343
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,674
Right. We have Soon-mi!

344
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,004
Oh right, Officer Jo.

345
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,770
We have her for moments like these.

346
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:47,214
Trust me and follow.

347
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,614
- So reliable!
- Are you sure about this?

348
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,054
Who's Soon-mi?

349
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,054
It's his daughter.
I wonder what she's doing.

350
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:55,250
- Let's go.
- It's all going to work out!

351
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,324
- Nothing.
- What?

352
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,494
What are you talking about?

353
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:03,824
Is she a ghost?

354
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,664
A spy or what?

355
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:08,164
Why are you getting mad at me?

356
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,604
The computer doesn't recognize her.
What can I do?

357
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:12,904
Look, here.

358
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:14,874
Her thumbprint isn't registered?

359
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,040
No.

360
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,640
What are we going to do?

361
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,514
Unidentified patients must be kept

362
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,810
in the designated
hospital for 48 hours.

363
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,950
Who is standing surety for her?

364
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,720
- What?
- Surety?

365
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:31,620
Surety?

366
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:33,550
Surety...

367
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,494
<i>Safe Nonyang, Happy Residents</i>

368
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:38,894
- What do we do now?
- She's nobody.

369
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:42,504
I guess we should either stand surety
for her or keep her in the village.

370
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,300
What are you talking about? Surety?

371
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,570
We can't stand surety for a stranger.

372
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,140
You see,

373
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,044
you must never stand surety for anyone.
Not even for your parents.

374
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,210
- Right.
- And to be honest,

375
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,654
the one who brought her should take
responsibility to the end. Am I wrong?

376
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,710
She's right.

377
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm leaving soon.

378
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,584
I'm not staying here.

379
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,024
The one who takes out the trash is
supposed to be in charge of it.

380
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:07,924
Don't you know
the polluter pays principle?

381
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:09,524
You caused this,

382
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,034
- so you are responsible for it.
- Right.

383
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:13,630
I agree with him.

384
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:15,764
Officer Jo is my daughter.

385
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,804
That's why she's doing us a favor

386
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:19,830
and let us keep her in the village.

387
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,674
She doesn't have any
memories. Until when?

388
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,444
She might get her memories back soon.

389
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:24,644
What if she doesn't?

390
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:26,814
Well, that's none of our business.

391
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:30,114
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
Gosh, this is annoying.

392
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,984
Let's take her to
the village first and...

393
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:33,680
What do you mean by we take her?

394
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:38,020
- You take her.
- Me?

395
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,650
No way.

396
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,094
That doesn't make sense.

397
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:44,690
Mr. Hwang, you're the chief
of the village. Why don't you take her?

398
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:45,794
What?

399
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:47,704
I'm the Subsection Chief of
the county office

400
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,800
and she's the head of the village
and the women's society!

401
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,434
I'm swamped
with all the government affairs!

402
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,244
We can't take care of her. Am I wrong?

403
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,274
He's right. Don't be crazy.

404
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,470
Now, we have only one person left.

405
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:01,014
One must be responsible
for what they did.

406
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,240
- He's right.
- Right.

407
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:03,944
Let's just take her with us.

408
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,584
I'm sure her memories
will come back soon.

409
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,080
Why should I...

410
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:10,990
This is driving me crazy.

411
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,220
Darn it.

412
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,720
Wait. The kid.

413
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:17,890
Where's the kid?

414
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:21,830
Don't do this.

415
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,600
I can't go like this.

416
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,000

You didn't say anything to me.

422

I didn't want to come,

423
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,440
but the lady is so strong.

424
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:14,210
- Excuse me.
- Leave her alone.

425
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,554
She has been whining that she's hungry.
We must feed her some food.

426
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:19,450
He's right. Let's grab some food.

427
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:22,020
Seol-ah, come on in with us.

428
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,064
We have been starving too.
Let's get some food.

429
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:26,194
- Okay.
- Okay.

430
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:28,504
- I feel like jjajangmyeon. Let's eat.
- Okay.

431
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,604
All right.

432
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,334
- Hello.
- Welcome.

433
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:32,874
- One jjajangmyeon please.
- Okay.

434
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,670
Seriously.

435
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:08,044
I definitely have seen her somewhere.

436
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:10,140
You keep saying weird things.

437
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:12,940
Where could you have possibly seen her?

438
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:14,910
I can't remember.

439
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,980
It must be an epidemic.

440
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,710
Losing memories.

441
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:22,550
You're single.
If you like her, just tell her...

442
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:24,590
That's not what it is.

443
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,420
Easy. You might get
an upset stomach.

444
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:30,920
Does she have a beggar
inside her stomach or what?

445
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:34,090
"A beggar"?

446
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,804

00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:42,800
<i>No way.</i>

450
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:49,314
Hey, I remember where I saw her.

451
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:50,580
- Come on. Don't be...
- Be quiet.

452
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:52,680

453
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:03,320

454
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:04,490
Hey.

455
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,330
I'm sure that woman was...

456
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:09,860
What?

457
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,300
An Australian beggar.

458
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:13,970
An Australian beggar?

459
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:18,310
What nonsense are you talking about?

460
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:22,544
I saw her when I went on
a business trip to Australia.

461
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:23,740
Really?

462
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:28,720
What is an Australian
beggar doing here?

463
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,520
How would I know?

464
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:33,994
It's not a good thing to talk about,
so let's keep this just between us.

465
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:35,360
Okay.

466
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,234

00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,884
Who are you calling
at this late hour?

470
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:58,750
Stay out of women's business.

471
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:02,950
Hey, it's me.

472
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:06,520
Well, I called you for a reason.

00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:11,264
You must carry this to the grave.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

474
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,730

came to our village.

475
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,330
What?

476
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,570
No. Australia.

477
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:20,734
Austria. A beggar from Austria.

478
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,870
It's Australia.

479
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,840
The country is Australia.

480
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,880
Hello? Yes. It's Australia...

481
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:33,654

00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:34,684
I'm telling you.

483
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:38,194
You must not tell
anyone, okay? Okay, bye.

00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,354
Hey, Mrs. Byung-chun.

I'm going to tell you a top secret.
Don't tell anyone, okay?

486
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,660
Today, some Australian beggar
came to our village.

487
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:49,234
Her fashion is totally different.
It must be because she's from Australia.

488
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,234
No. It looked fake.

489
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,304
Hello? A beggar came from Australia.

490
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,944
No, she's not pretty.
I'm much prettier than her.

491
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:57,544
It's a secret. Okay?

492
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,344
Hey, Yoon-ja.

493
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:02,744
You must keep this to yourself.
It's a top secret.

494
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:04,310
Seriously? An Australian beggar?

495
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:08,650
You must not tell anyone
about what I just told you.

496
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:12,050
Hey, that's enough.

497
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,494
That way, you won't be able
to tell the whole nation about it.

498
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,024
Why don't you just
make an announcement?

499
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:18,560
Tell everyone that an Australian beggar
came to our town.

500
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:22,730
Goodness. Why are you
speaking so loudly?

501
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:24,634
I didn't lie.

502
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,334
It's what Chef Moon said.

503
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:28,874
You don't know anything.

00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,414
Sure. Sure. Goodness.

506
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:35,514
Just stop it already.

507
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:39,050
I need to tell Hyeok's mother about it.

508
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,480
Oh, hey. It's me.

509
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:43,480
An Australian beggar.

510
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:48,490
This way.

511
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:50,490
This way.

00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:56,100
Come in. This way.

00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,514
- Who?
- I heard...

517
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:11,140
an Australian beggar
came to our village.

518
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,880
How did you...

519
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,180
It's not me.

520
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,250
It's a secret.

521
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,560
We are going to keep it secret.

522
00:28:23,695 --> 00:28:24,894
Thanks to Ms. Pi,

523
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:28,704
I get to see something interesting.

524
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:31,130
Where is the foreign beggar?

525
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,300
We dropped her off on the way.

526
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:37,004
What? We came here for nothing then?

527
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:39,344
It's late. You should go home now.

528
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:42,684
Who is the woman that
went into the house?

529
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:46,210
Right. She seemed new.

530
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:52,220
I understand.

531
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:55,764
I'm sure it's hard for a single man
to raise a child.

532
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:58,094
- Who raises whom?
- Your daughter.

533
00:28:58,095 --> 00:28:59,794
She's not my daughter.

534
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,360
Then who is that woman?

535
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,060
What are you thinking?

536
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:04,904
- That's not what it is!
- My goodness.

537
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:06,630
- Jeez.
- Goodness.

538
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:10,600
That freak has got a temper.

539
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:13,470
What's so bad about
being curious? Right?

540
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:17,710
He's one cranky man.

541
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:21,150
Please don't be mad.
He's just tired today.

542
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:23,684
Then tell us.

543
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:24,790
- What?
- Over there.

544
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:27,550
- Who is she?
- Tell us.

545
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:35,300
She's a relative of his.
A distant relative.

546
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,034
A relative, I see.

547
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,100
- I will get going.
- Okay.

548
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,040
Okay, bye.

549
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:46,344
See? She's just his relative.

550
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:47,840
Do you believe that?

551
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:58,120
How did Ms. Pi know about her?

552
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,420
Are you acting?

553
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:03,360
You are the only one whom I told
about it. And I didn't tell anyone.

554
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,930
- So who could it be?
- It's not me.

555
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,030
Forget it.

556
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,440
I didn't realize it before,

557
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:24,140
but that lady stinks.

558
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:28,380
Goodness.

559
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:45,570
Who am I?

560
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:49,070
Why can't I remember anything?

561
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:52,070
Who am I?

562
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:59,540
I will put the clothes here.

563
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,420
Right. There is no underwear.

564
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,920
Forget it.

565
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:35,050
<i>The first red sea-bream shows up!</i>

566
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:42,120
<i>We caught it!</i>

567
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:47,630
Darn it.

568
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:53,730
Seriously,

569
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:57,304
are these the only clothes you've got?

570
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:58,970
Be happy with what you've got.

571
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:01,614
They're my clothes.
Of course they don't fit you.

572
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,014
What? They fit you?

573
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:06,814
You should rather be thankful
than complaining about the clothes.

574
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:08,654
Just put on what you got.

575
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,280
If you don't like them, just be naked.

576
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,284
What? Be naked?

577
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,624
- What a pervert...
- Pervert?

578
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,024
You're unbelievable.

579
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:17,964
And why do you talk down to me?
You don't know me.

580
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,664
It's just comfortable that way.

581
00:32:19,665 --> 00:32:21,730
If you don't like it,
you can talk down to me too.

582
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,200
How old are you?

583
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:30,040
Hey, she doesn't remember her name.
There's no way she remembers her age.

584
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:32,370
Now stop, both of you.

585
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,714
I'm sure you're confused
because you lost your memories.

586
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:36,840
Why don't you go take some rest?

587
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:38,380
Okay.

588
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,924
I figured she didn't have panties,

589
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,418
so I gave her my new
teddy bear panties.

590
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:50,764
It's kind of me, right?

591
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:51,890
Yes.

592
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:53,560
Yours?

593
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:55,790
Your teddy bear panties?

594
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:00,370
Is that what she was talking about?

595
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:08,340
The shock from the accident
caused a severe bruise on her head,

596
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:10,580
but it's not too serious.

597
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,610
Let her take a complete rest.

598
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,850
It will help her recover fast.

599
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,020
Let's see it for now.

600
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,090
Okay, Doctor.

601
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:23,420
All right.

602
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:41,310
Stop pretending to sleep.

603
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:58,820
Dad, what do I do?

604
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:00,990
I will take care of everything.

605
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,400
So don't say anything unnecessary.

606
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:06,800
Just keep quiet.

607
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,650
I...

608
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,490
I killed Bella.

609
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,230
Is it a wild animal?

610
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:56,270
Goodness! What are you doing?

611
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:58,340
I'm hungry.

612
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:01,310
Darn it.

613
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:38,220
Am I a maid or what?

614
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,890
You guys are unbelievable.

615
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:46,190
It looks so tasty.

616
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:02,970
There it comes.

617
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,180
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

618
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:11,920
Let's eat.

619
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,524
That was a great meal.

620
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:21,134
Chef Moon is the best.

621
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:22,590
- You're the best!
- You're the best!

622
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,734
Now, please get us some morning coffee.

623
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:26,934
I want an espresso.

624
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:29,530
I want some hot chocolate.

625
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:30,944
Seriously,

626
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:33,740
are you kidding me?

627
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:38,010
From now on, earn your food. Okay?

628
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:39,814
- You.
- Yes?

629
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,080
Clean up the table and wash the dishes.

630
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:45,454
And you. Go clean the backyard.

631
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:46,650
And you.

632
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:50,890
Follow her.

633
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:54,964
What are you doing? Do it right now!

634
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:56,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

635
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:08,740
But it's already clean.
What am I supposed to do?

636
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:11,344
I don't know.

637
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,710
Isn't this your job, Old Lady?

638
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:16,314
That has been bothering me
since yesterday.

639
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:17,884
Why do you call me Old Lady?

640
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:19,720
I don't look like an old lady.

641
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,890
Then how should I call you?

642
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:27,034
How old are you?

643
00:38:27,035 --> 00:38:28,430
I'm seven.

644
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,034
Call me Unni.

645
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:33,360
Unni.

646
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:36,430
You have got to be kidding me.

647
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,510
Okay, Unni.

648
00:38:43,075 --> 00:38:45,280
Well done. Good girl.

649
00:38:47,515 --> 00:38:48,614
Let's go.

650
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:49,914
That petty punk.

651
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:51,920
He's a good cook, but he's so arrogant.

652
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:56,550
I might get a housewife's eczema.
Seriously.

653
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:59,060
I wonder where a cafe is.

654
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,094
<i>Seoha Rice Mill</i>

655
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,360
A rice mill?

656
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:05,600
A teahouse?

657
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,430
Is it a rice mill or a teahouse?

658
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,200
It looks weird.

659
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:18,940
<i>Seoha Teahouse</i>

660
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,650
Have a seat.

661
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:28,420
I didn't know there
was a place like this.

662
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:32,824
Wait, you're not a local here.

663
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,530
Your accent is...

664
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:39,100
I'm from Seoul.

665
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:42,174
You know the old house in the corner.

666
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:46,100
Then you should be able to tell
how good our coffee is.

667
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:49,610
Our coffee is the
original Brazilian...

668
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:52,440
Arabica style.

669
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:53,610
Pardon?

670
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,554
"I wonder what's the
deal with the woman"

671
00:39:56,555 --> 00:39:59,720
"with such a modern and sophisticated
look, which is rare around here."

672
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,290
That's what you were thinking,
weren't you?

673
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:03,520
What?

674
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:06,690
Oh, dear.

675
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,790
Are you curious about me?

676
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:12,930
Just because you are curious,

677
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:15,434
- do I have to tell you?
- Yes.

678
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:17,200
No. Sorry.

679
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:22,740
I used to be a successful model

680
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,580
when I was in Seoul.

681
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:27,654
And I'm not the type of person
who brags about those things.

682
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:30,820
Oh, a model.

683
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:32,880
So you're a model.

684
00:40:34,855 --> 00:40:38,960
How would I ever
show off that I'm a model

685
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:42,960
who has done photoshoots in Seoul?

686
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:45,530
- That's not polite of me.
- Not at all.

687
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:48,700
That's very charming of you.

688
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,504
I wasn't just a famous model,

689
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:58,014
but a rising star,
even starring in ads.

690
00:40:58,015 --> 00:40:59,910
You think I'm the type
that would show off about it?

691
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:04,020
I can tell you're a star
even without you telling me all this.

692
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:07,590
Anyway,

693
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,390
if you're here to have some coffee,

694
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:14,864
can you pay for 10 cups in advance?

695
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:15,930
For 10 cups?

696
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:17,860
I only take cash.

697
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:21,930
Cash!

698
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:25,174
It's 3.5 dollars per coffee?

699
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:27,440
I'll give you 35 dollars.

700
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:33,410
I only have 32 dollars.

701
00:41:34,055 --> 00:41:35,150
That's fine.

702
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:38,420
Thank you.

703
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:44,764
<i>Update on the
Pungcheonok Lawsuit File</i>

704
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:47,734
<i>Lawsuit regarding
trademark rights on Pungcheonok</i>

705
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:09,850
Hello, everyone.

706
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,980
Sorry I took so long in calling
for a meeting.

707
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,694
Please understand
that I had to look over

708
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:19,460
all departments' works beforehand.

709
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:27,600
Before we begin, Mr. Jung,
may I ask you a question?

710
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:30,970
Yes, please do.

711
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:35,210
Why do we have so
many lawsuits going on?

712
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:39,584
These lawsuits are

713
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,354
from little issues
that we have with people

714
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:42,914
while establishing
our new franchise brand.

715
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,450
There's no need to worry about them.

716
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:47,424
We've already won the lawsuit

717
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:49,150
on the trademark rights
on Pungcheonok, too.

718
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:50,790
There's no need to worry, really.

719
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,260
Is that right?

720
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:57,130
This is something I've learned
in my long time living abroad.

721
00:42:58,105 --> 00:43:00,434
Foreigners think very highly of Korea

722
00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:02,270
because we're so developed.

723
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:05,840
So I assumed that Donghan was managed

724
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:10,270
in a very developed way as well.

725
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:16,610
I was quite disappointed
after reading over my report.

726
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:18,950
Very disappointed, actually.

727
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:25,290
It looks like we've been picking fights,
not managing our company.

728
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:29,490
How we're expanding our business
is also very backward.

729
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,300
In Korea, that's called bullying,

730
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:36,130
abusing our power
by stealing others' brands.

731
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:38,770
I will never accept such a way
of expansion,

732
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:42,410
not during my time here

733
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:45,980
as the Managing Director.

734
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:47,880
Yes, sir.

735
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:06,160
Yes, Gwang-su.

736
00:44:08,435 --> 00:44:09,570
Jun-su did what?

737
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:16,670
All right.

738
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:30,420
Where's Chairman Han?

739
00:44:31,325 --> 00:44:32,390
He's not here yet.

740
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:35,490
Come and have a drink.

741
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:41,130
You seem busy.

742
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:43,430
It's been a while since I saw you.

743
00:44:44,675 --> 00:44:46,240
Do you know why he called me?

744
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,410
I don't know.

745
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,840
Maybe he'll announce his successor.

746
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:58,120
I'm just kidding. It's funny.

747
00:44:59,055 --> 00:45:00,650
This is my first time

748
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:03,390
seeing you so bad at
hiding your thoughts.

749
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:05,190
I'm in no mood for joking around.

750
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:08,960
Why do you look so serious?

751
00:45:10,535 --> 00:45:11,760
Is it because of Jun-su?

752
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:21,410
- Hello, sir.
- You're here.

753
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:22,840
Have a seat.

754
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:26,840
I thought it'd be nice if we got
together and had some nice fish stew.

755
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:30,650
Hello, there.

756
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,090
You went fishing with Jun-su?

757
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:39,490
- You're mean.
- Why?

758
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,830
Well,

759
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,634
you've never gone
fishing with Chul-yong,

760
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:45,360
who has served you for over 20 years.

761
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:47,300
And you went with
Jun-su in a heartbeat.

762
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,904
- Chul-yong must be disheartened.
- Well...

763
00:45:50,905 --> 00:45:54,640
He doesn't like fishing.
He likes golfing more.

764
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:57,910
No need to torture him by
going fishing, don't you think?

765
00:45:58,445 --> 00:45:59,540
Yes, sir.

766
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:03,380
Did you catch a lot?

767
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:05,020
Did you?

768
00:46:05,655 --> 00:46:08,520
Jun-su is quite good.

769
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,890
He caught a really big one today.

770
00:46:11,395 --> 00:46:12,520
Really?

771
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,660
What aren't you good at, son?

772
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:17,360
Grandfather taught me everything.

773
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:20,900
He told me to appease, not force.

774
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:22,630
It's all thanks to him.

775
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:26,770
Did you learn to talk like that
at Harvard?

776
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:28,170
You adorable kid.

777
00:46:37,215 --> 00:46:39,020

00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:41,054

<i>Honey.</i>

800
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:20,650
<i>- They really got married.

801
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:23,694

00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,830

00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:31,230

00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:56,890
You always have something you want
when you buy me jewelry.

809
00:48:57,295 --> 00:49:00,190
- What is it?
- What do you mean?

810
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:03,530
It's just that our wedding
anniversary is coming soon.

811
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:05,860
Is that what it is?

812
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:11,940
I thought you were giving me jewelry
because of Jun-su.

813
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:15,770
What do you mean?

814
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:19,240
Never mind.

815
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,950
Can I take a look at this?

816
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,450
Honey,

817
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:30,590
choose wisely...

818
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:35,160
for your father and for Donghan.

819
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:41,200
If you become the successor,

820
00:49:41,575 --> 00:49:43,370
then it becomes my husband's company.

821
00:49:44,005 --> 00:49:47,640
If Jun-su becomes the successor,
then it becomes my son's company.

822
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:50,210
Whoever becomes the successor,

823
00:49:51,215 --> 00:49:54,680
I plan on respecting
my father's choice.

824
00:49:55,615 --> 00:49:56,850
I have no courage.

825
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:04,620
I'm thankful for my father

826
00:50:05,165 --> 00:50:07,460
for entertaining me with all of this.

827
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,300
I don't care who becomes the successor,

828
00:50:13,435 --> 00:50:14,900
but I'll surely have to think

829
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:18,300
about who has been treating me better.

830
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:22,540
I don't see anything I like here.

831
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,010
Hyun-ah, is it?

832
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:32,180
Your daughter.

833
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:35,990
What is she up to?

834
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,820
She hasn't really gone crazy, has she?

835
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:43,560
I've just heard rumors that she has.

836
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:46,730
Let's get going.

837
00:51:26,305 --> 00:51:27,910
Why now?

838
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:32,240
Why?

839
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:40,220
It's all because of that woman, Bella.

840
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:43,054
Had she just accepted my offer,

841
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:45,524
my company and my daughter
would've been fine.

842
00:51:45,525 --> 00:51:47,420
That woman!

843
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:29,754
Look at that!

844
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:32,324
- No.
- Hold on.

845
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:35,124
I think this red one
would suit her better.

846
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,394
Her complexion is pale,
so the red one would suit her.

847
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:38,834
Sure, let's see.

848
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:40,034
Goodness!

849
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:42,104
You look so good in everything.

850
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:44,834
Maybe it's because you're so pretty.

851
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:47,840
I told you, I'm the one
who knows about style.

852
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:51,244
Stop bundling her up!

853
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:52,870
She won't be able to walk!

854
00:52:52,945 --> 00:52:55,344
Style, my foot.

855
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:57,780
It's cold. She needs to dress warmly.

856
00:52:57,785 --> 00:53:00,910
Yes, nice and cozy. How adorable.

857
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:04,120
Here. Give this to Seol-ah.

858
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:05,694
Don't go around

859
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:08,594
wearing Chef Moon's ugly pants.

860
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:10,494
Dress like this from now on.

861
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:14,290
It's good that we've got
a lot of clothes we don't wear.

862
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,470
Done.

863
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:25,710
Even getting out of all these
clothes is so much work.

864
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:31,154
This is for you.

865
00:53:31,155 --> 00:53:32,984
Really? It's mine?

866
00:53:32,985 --> 00:53:34,110
Yes.

867
00:53:34,785 --> 00:53:37,120
How am I going to wear these?

868
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:39,924
What's up with all the clothes?

869
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,560
Neighbors donated them to me.

870
00:53:42,495 --> 00:53:43,964
Where have you been?

871
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:45,160
Nowhere.

872
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:52,604
Don't you want some coffee?

873
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,340
Coffee? I'm fine.

874
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:56,700
Why?

875
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:01,414
I went to a cafe nearby yesterday.

876
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:04,314
There, I met an angel

877
00:54:04,315 --> 00:54:06,410
who awakened the artist's soul in me.

878
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:09,054
"Soul"? "Angel"?

879
00:54:09,055 --> 00:54:11,354
I'm actually

880
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:12,694
an artist.

881
00:54:12,695 --> 00:54:13,820
An artist?

882
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:16,764
What? A painter?

883
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,964
Yes, a painter.

884
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,594
Artist.

885
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:23,234
It's a little embarrassing
to say this myself,

886
00:54:23,235 --> 00:54:24,734
but in my teens, I was called a genius.

887
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:27,204
I swept the awards
from all contests nationwide.

888
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:29,970
In university, I was so close

889
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:31,770
to winning an award
at the national contest.

890
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:33,740
But one day,

891
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:36,684
I lost all my artistic inspiration.

892
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:40,580
Persimmon? Dried ones are my favorite!

893
00:54:41,785 --> 00:54:44,254
I'm craving some now
that we're talking about it.

894
00:54:44,255 --> 00:54:46,150
Me too.

895
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:47,890
Hey!

896
00:54:47,995 --> 00:54:49,194
Go on.

897
00:54:49,195 --> 00:54:53,360
I met my muse for the first time
in 10 years.

898
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:57,030
When I saw her, my fingertips tingled.

899
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:59,234
I had this strong desire

900

to just start painting her,

901
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:06,110
but unfortunately, I have no money
for coffee.

902
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:08,044
I'm losing my muse

903
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:10,010
just because I have
no money for coffee!

904
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:11,554
Just go and talk to her.

905
00:55:11,555 --> 00:55:13,110
Talking to her doesn't cost anything.

906
00:55:13,755 --> 00:55:16,224
"I thought I could paint you
if I did this."

907

to see the house tomorrow,

909

- Coming to see the house?
- Cleaning?

911
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:31,734
Dad, why are they
coming to see our house?

912
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:34,604
Because we're all moving to Seoul.

913
00:55:34,605 --> 00:55:37,340
But I like it here.

914
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:40,540
Right. Maybe I'll remember something
when I go to Seoul.

915

squeaky clean.

916
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:47,884

917
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:49,354
- 10 dollars?
- Yes.

918
00:55:49,355 --> 00:55:50,780
I'll see how well you do.

919
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:54,090

10 dollars if we clean well!

Look through the site thoroughly

924
00:56:18,115 --> 00:56:20,684
and check with the police
and all hospitals.

925
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:23,880
Order them to check all people
who have died around there

926
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:26,894

What's this?

1013

Why is the kitchen
so unnecessarily big?

1014
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:05,140
Seems like I'll have to rebuild
the whole house.

1015
01:04:05,385 --> 01:04:08,654

01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:32,969
I'll get out!

1080
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:44,924
(Eccentric! Chef Moon)

1081
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,420
♫ <i>I'm getting good vibes</i> ♫

1082
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,040
♫ <i>It's good looking in your blue eyes</i> ♫

1083
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,650
♫ <i>Good luck to my heart beat</i> ♫

1084
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:01,300
♫ <i>And all of those heart strings</i> ♫

1085
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,880
♫ <i>You're pulling me closer</i> ♫

1086
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,780
♫ <i>Don't want it to be over</i> ♫

1087
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,390
♫ <i>'Cause oh, you know</i> ♫

1088
01:10:08,815 --> 01:10:09,884
<i>She's alive.</i>

1089
01:10:09,885 --> 01:10:13,280
<i>She's eccentric,
just like her name.</i>

1090
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:17,054
<i>I guess you didn't learn manners
at school.</i>

1091
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:19,824
<i>You have zero manners at all.</i>

1092
01:10:19,825 --> 01:10:20,754
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

1093
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:23,424
<i>It looks so perfect on me.
I know you want to buy it for me.</i>

1094
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:24,290
<i>What do you think?</i>

1095
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:25,494
<i>Awesome!</i>

1096
01:10:25,495 --> 01:10:27,964
<i>If you can't remember,
then at least put yourself together!</i>

1097
01:10:27,965 --> 01:10:29,034
<i>How dare you talk like that?</i>

1098
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:30,600
<i>What are you doing? Get out!</i>

1099
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:35,104
<i>Why are you guys fighting?</i>

1100
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,970
<i>Is she off to somewhere?</i>

1101
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:38,204
<i>Goodness.</i>

1102
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:39,940
<i>I keep thinking of her.</i>

1103
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:43,884
<i>Make an order to find her
and kill her without anyone knowing.</i>

1104
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:45,344
<i>What are you saying?</i>

1105
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:47,750
<i>Let me introduce to you, the new Bella.</i>

1106
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,563
♫ <i>And ruin the fun, no</i> ♫

1107
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:52,966
♫ <i>'Cause oh, you know</i> ♫

1108
01:10:52,966 --> 01:10:54,334
♫ <i>I want your lips</i> ♫
