2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,523
She's alive?

3
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,419
(Episode 4)

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,615
Are you sure?

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,085
Yes.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,015
Then why...

7
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,475
Make sure to pass on what I say.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,045
Find the woman

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,575
and kill her

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,375
without anyone knowing.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,465
So you're saying, you're in love?

12
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,705
Don't say that in front
of your dad, okay?

13
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,539
I'll have to see how you treat me.

14
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,645
I'm already doing the best I can!

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,645
Oh, he's there.

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,184
Seung-mo! Byeol-na!

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,395
You're here?

18
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,755
You're late.

19
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,995
Have you eaten?

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,465
Yes.

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,695
Seol-ah ate at Yoon-ja's,

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,335
and I just had a quick meal.

23
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,235
What are you two doing, anyway?

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,775
What? What do you mean?

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,915
You were just staring at the TV
when it was turned off,

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,675
so I wondered if something was up.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,845
Nothing good was on,

28
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,315
so I just turned it off
and was going to go inside.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,755
That's exactly what I was doing.

30
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:09,595
I'm yawning. I guess I'm tired.

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,495
I should go to bed.

32
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,295
You're right.

33
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,935
- I should go to bed.
- But it's too early.

34
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,835
What are you, children?

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,375
Job Order

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,765
This doesn't look symmetrical, does it?

37
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,635
And the waistline is distorted.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,580
It's much longer than the design, too.

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,335
- What happened to the shoulder piece?
- It's in progress, ma'am.

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,245
- Hurry up.
- Yes, ma'am. I'll fix it.

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,315
- Could you hurry up, please?
- Okay.

42
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,505
They say plagiarism
is a talent as well.

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,275
I guess they're not
completely worthless.

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,695
They're not plagiarized.

45
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,440
<i>Reel it in! It's a black porgy!</i>

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,675
<i>(The Fishermen and the City)</i>

47
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,275
Gosh.

48
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,515
<i>I can do it.</i>

49
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,585
Seol-ah! What time is it?

50
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,855
I said, what time is it?

51
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,395
Do you not know numbers, either?

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,765
They said I'll learn at school.

53
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,445
<i>T</i>

54
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,745
<i>T</i>

55
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,985
Read this.

56
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,325
- "T".
- And this?

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,095
"N".

58
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,925
- Read this.
- Well...

59
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,465
- What?
- Well...

60
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,905
It's "K", for "Kim Seol-ah"!

61
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,905
Is your head a rock?

62
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,245
Gosh, I don't want to do this!

63
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,215
What are you avoiding me for?

64
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,945
When did I do that?

65
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,115
I was just trying to close it properly.

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,825
Unni!

67
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,425
I want you to teach me.
My dad is too scary.

68
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,370
Why does he keep getting mad at me?

69
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,030
Why would I need to learn if I knew?
I would be teaching, then.

70
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,700
When did I get mad?!

71
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,165
See? He keeps acting like that.

72
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,975
Unni, save me!

73
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,015
"K".

74
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,545
That's it. And then?

75
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,325
"N".

76
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,155
That's it. "N". Good job.

77
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,360
You need to have fun with it.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,400
You heard that, right?

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,125
Those who work hard
can't beat those who enjoy it.

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,665
- Sure!
- Now, let's move on.

81
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,535
"T". Right?

82
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,750
Perfect! I'm sure King Sejong
would be so proud of you.

83
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,115
Using my body helps me
remember it so much better.

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,850
Unlike someone else I know.

85
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,055
Of course.

86
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,430
You've mastered your numbers and letters
because I was the one who taught you.

87
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,590
This is why teaching methods
are important.

88
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,525
I'll study hard, teacher.

89
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,195
You are the best teacher, Unni!

90
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,395
Now, let's move on to "R".

91
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,540
Let's continue tomorrow.

92
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,304
Okay. I guess I can rest now.

93
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,775
What the...

94
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,715
So, you can do "R"?

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,585
That's why I stopped. Can't you tell?

96
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,255
I'll have to think about it.

97
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,285
Gosh, my legs hurt.

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,295
She thinks she can do "R"?

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,275
We got a homeless person and a suitable
place like you ordered, sir.

100
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,745
- Good job.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,785
Shall we go now?

102
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,385
No.

103
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,485
We need to do this properly
if we want to make it right.

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,925
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,195
Gosh, Mr. Park.

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,565
Things keep coming up, don't they?

107
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,235
Yes, I just got here.
I'll be right upstairs.

108
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,705
All right. See you.

109
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,215
You two wait here

110
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,245
and act when I tell you to.

111
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,785
Yes, sir.

112
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,025
<i>Chief Park Seong-yong</i>

113
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,595
Can you tell who this is?

114
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,065
I don't know...

115
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,295
- Who is it?
- My client is looking for him,

116
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,665
and all I know is that
he lives in Seoha Village.

117
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,635
- Seoha Village?
- Yes.

118
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,975
Officer Jo! Come here for a second.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,745
Yes.

120
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,090
Yes, sir. What is it?

121
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,690
You said your father
lives in Seoha Village, didn't you?

122
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,955
- Yes, sir. That's right.
- Good.

123
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,725
Do you know him, by any chance?
He lives in Seoha Village.

124
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:52,365
Oh, I do!
I heard he's a famous chef from Seoul.

125
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,235
- Why?
- Is that so?

126
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,635
Then can you tell us where he lives?

127
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,440
May I ask why?

128
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,410
Oh, it's nothing special.

129
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,245
He's from Seoul.

130
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,120
He'd like to ask him some questions.

131
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,385
So where does he live?

132
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,185
Well...

133
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,390
If this is Seoha Village,

134
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,830
there's a community center
right at the entrance.

135
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,960
If you go up a little
straight from there,

136
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,295
you'll see an old house on your left.

137
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,895
I believe that's where he lives.

138
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,500
That's what she says.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm going to the village today
to see my father.

140
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,435
- I can guide you there.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

141
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,105
Thank you so much, Mr. Park.
I owe you big time.

142
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,680
I'll treat you to a
fancy meal next time.

143
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,715
Gosh, it was my pleasure.

144
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,890
Don't forget about treating me out.

145
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,150
Okay.

146
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,215
See you again. Thank you.

147
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,060
- Goodbye.
- Okay, have a good day.

148
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,125
- I won't see you off.
- Okay.

149
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,425
He has sharp eyes.

150
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,795
Who's he?

151
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,365
He was my senior officer
when I worked in Seoul.

152
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,900
He runs a security company now

153
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,370
after retirement.

154
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,135
I guess he's earning loads of money.

155
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,575
I should've joined him
when he asked back then.

156
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,450
What are you doing?

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,545
Sorry?

158
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,015
Get back to work.

159
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,755
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,900
Is Uncle Da-hoon here?

161
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,935
Da-hoon went to the
market with Hyo-sook.

162
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,705
What brings you here, Seol-ah?

163
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,010
I was studying too hard
and used my brain too much.

164
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,080
I felt dizzy, so I came out.

165
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,575
What were you studying?

166
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,345
That is a "T", "T"!

167
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,220
"T"?

168
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,460
I can count up to nine.

169
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,820
I also learned how to read.

170
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,125
You learned a lot.

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,395
There's always the
right timing to learn.

172
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,665
You came here to brag about that,
didn't you?

173
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,535
I came over to ask
for a warm cup of hot chocolate.

174
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'll serve up that warm cup
of hot chocolate for you.

175
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,870
Thank you for your kindness.

176
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,435
Goodness, look at your manners.

177
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,945
I wish Hyo-sook was as nice as you.

178
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,150
I spoiled her too much
when she was young,

179
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,785
and she's a brat now.

180
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,525
Here's your warm cup of hot chocolate.

181
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,830
Seol-ah, are you
interested in makeup too?

182
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,765
No way, not me.

183
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,405
Primping oneself is nothing
to be ashamed of.

184
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,410
One should always have style.

185
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,140
Your own style, you know?

186
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,645
"Style"?

187
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,580
Let me see. Seol-ah,

188
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,490
would you like to get a makeover today?

189
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,515
- Really?
- Yes.

190
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,290
You have no clue

191
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,330
how popular I was
back in the good old days.

192
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,160
Whenever I showed up at the market,

193
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,295
all the men fell on their backs
with nosebleeds.

194
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,810
Goodness, Seol-ah!

195
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,605
I was so out of my mind.

196
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,680
Seol-ah,

197
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,350
if you wait just a bit,
Hyo-sook will show up soon.

198
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,310
Can you stay put until she comes?

199
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,780
Sure, I'll see you later.

200
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,250
Okay, thanks.

201
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,745
Goodness, I'm so out of my mind.

202
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,795
So this is the style of idol stars?

203
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,505
Gosh, what are you?

204
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,505
What?

205
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,805
My mom's such a trouble maker.

206
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,330
Seol-ah, what's wrong with your face?

207
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,230
Who did this to you?

208
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,600
And what's up with your hair?

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,995
Who made you like this?

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,100
Stop it!

211
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm going to get back at that old lady.

212
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,265
I'm going to take revenge.

213
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,505
Seol-ah.

214
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,510
Hello.

215
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,945
Yes, hello, how polite you are.

216
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,445
By the way, what happened to your hair?

217
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,115
The Teahouse lady did this to me.

218
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,885
I'm so embarrassed.

219
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,355
It was Ms. Byung-chun, right?

220
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,630
She ruined many

221
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,200
with her "style" talk.

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,895
I had no clue.

223
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,070
I'm going to take revenge.

224
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,670
Goodness, it's okay.

225
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,180
That's how you learn about life.

226
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,040
Time will cure it all.

227
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,250
How can time cure it all?

228
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
I'm just going to go to Byeol-na

229
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,750
and ask for another makeover.

230
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,075
Stop!

231
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,445
Wait.

232
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm telling you this
since you're now old enough

233
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,330
to become reasonable.

234
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,385
Excuse me? What does that mean?

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,855
Look.

236
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,625
Do you know what's
most important in life?

237
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,365
Having a nice friend around you.

238
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,010
Basically, you need to meet
the right people.

239
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,765
Take me as an example.

240
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,180
I thought the Hwang family
was a noble family.

241
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,910
So I married Hwang Jang-dan

242
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,705
but look at my miserable life now.

243
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,615
I'm sharing this only to you.

244
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,660
Stay far away from Byeol-na
as much as you can.

245
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,320
Why? I like Byeol-na unni.

246
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,930
This isn't about liking
or disliking someone.

247
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,030
What I'm talking about
is one's background.

248
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,530
Whatever.

249
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm going to hang out with Byeol-na.

250
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,200
She's fun to hang out with.

251
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,005
Goodness, you're unbelievable.

252
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,205
I really didn't want to say this,

253
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,535
but I have no choice.

254
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,445
Byeol-na was a beggar in Australia.

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,250
You know what that is, right?

256
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,750
It's someone who has nothing.

257
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,190
She had nothing to eat
and rummaged through garbage

258
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,520
to find food with rats.

259
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,085
She slept under newspapers.

260
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,730
If you hang out with Byeol-na,

261
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,725
you might end up like her too.

262
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,425
Do you see what I mean?

263
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,835
<i>Rice cakes, rice cakes on sale.</i>

264
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,035
<i>Rice cakes on sale.</i>

265
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,045
<i>Rice cakes on sale!</i>

266
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,975
<i>Rice cakes on sale.</i>

267
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,255
<i>Oh, Dad.</i>

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,525
<i>"Dad"?</i>

269
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,165
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

270
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,195
<i>but I never had such a tiny beggar</i>

271
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,205
<i>as a daughter.</i>

272
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,105
<i>No, this isn't right.</i>

273
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,815
<i>This is wrong.</i>

274
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,115
Seol-ah!

275
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,630
Hi, Byeol-na. Goodness.

276
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,865
Bye.

277
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,295
Seol-ah! Where are you going?

278
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,035
Seol-ah, wait up!

279
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,905
Wait for me!

280
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,105
Seol-ah!

281
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,575
Hey!

282
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,285
Wait for me!

283
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,585
Hey!

284
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,835
Stop following me.

285
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,665
Where are you going?

286
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:21,435
What's going on?

287
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,205
I'm not going to hang out
with you anymore.

288
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,405
Why?

289
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,690
Ms. Pi heard this from my dad.

290
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,085
It's a solid fact!

291
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,415
What is a solid fact?

292
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,619
Anyway, if I hang out with you,

293
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:38,925
I would be like you.
That's what she said. I can't.

294
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,130
"Like me"? What does that mean?

295
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,400
I won't hang out with you.

296
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,825
So tell me! Why?

297
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,095
What do you mean by that?

298
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,535
You're an Australian beggar!

299
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,145
Beggar!

300
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,645
Beggar!

301
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,715
Did you see me?

302
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,790
Beggar? And not just a regular beggar,
but an Australian beggar?

303
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,260
Well...

304
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,695
I don't think you can cook
with such poor imagination.

305
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,635
Which is probably why you are stuck
in the countryside like this.

306
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,340
You're not only talking down
but talking trash now.

307
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,440
It's not your place to say that.
You're the one talking trash about me.

308
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,280
You talk nonsense because you're jealous
of my friendship with your daughter...

309
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,505
She's not my daughter!
Jealous, my foot!

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,380
And what? "Nonsense"?

311
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,775
Of course it's nonsense.

312
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,350
Show me the proof.
If you don't have any, I will sue you.

313
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,115
This is defamation.

314
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,460
What else is it?

315
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,725
- Right. It's a rumor. It's fake news.
- I saw you.

316
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,960
What? What did you see?

317
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,865
I saw you when I visited
the Gold Coast in Australia.

318
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,265
What do you mean by you saw me there?
I don't have any memory of being there.

319
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,465
Maybe you're the one who lost memories,
not me. Why don't you go see a doctor?

320
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,805
You were in Australia. Gold Coast.

321
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,735
You bumped into me
at the street. Remember?

322
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,935
What? No. Bullsh*t.

323
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:07,101
See?

324
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:08,675
See! Now you can speak English.

325
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,240
I speak English?

326
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,069
I'm just saying
that I don't remember...

327
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,338
But I'm a human being, too!

328
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:16,939
I am thankful and sorry.

329
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,230
But this is too much,
it also hurts my feelings!

330
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,725
Did you just speak French?
You can speak French, too?

331
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,110
Don't change the subject...

332
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,535
Wait.

333
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,405
What did I just do?

334
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,375
Are your memories

335
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,645
coming back?

336
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,125
Was I then

337
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,455
really an Australian beggar?

338
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,735
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

339
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,275
It looks nice.

340
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,450
As you requested,
I did thorough research...

341
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,815
on the old restaurant project, which
was Mr. Lim's last business project.

342
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,015
Okay. How was it?

343
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,490
The sales are pretty stable,

344
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,425
so it wasn't easy to dig up dirt.

345
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,765
But then I found an
unexpected time bomb.

346
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,565
A time bomb? What is it?

347
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,865
- The menu development system.
- "Menu development system"?

348
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,765
Yes.

349
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,905
<i>Menu Development System</i>

350
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,380
Developing recipes out of the secrets
of famous long-standing restaurants

351
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,050
and making franchise restaurants.

352
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,575
That's the bottom line of
the old restaurant project. It's great.

353
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,015
But their method was very evil.

354
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,560
I told you. It's a secret.

355
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,225
This won't be aired.
We will edit it out.

356
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,965
I'm not sure if I can trust you.

357
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,565
Wait.

358
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,005
Wait. When will it be aired?

359
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,605
We will contact you.

360
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,605
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,045
Please back these up.

362
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,255
They weren't developing menus.

363
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,085
- They were stealing the menus.
- Yes.

364
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,960
To put it nicely, it's collecting data.

365
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,395
To put it boldly, it's stealing
without permission.

366
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,595
Once this gets out through media,

367
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,800
it will not only tarnish
the image of the corporation

368
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,805
but also make a legal problem.

369
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,005
- If...
- If what?

370
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,375
If they purposely
leak this to the press,

371
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,675
this can be a very good way
to put all the blame on you.

372
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,145
It can be a time bomb.

373
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,155
This is why I need you, Gun-woo.

374
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,925
Goodness. You're flattering me.

375
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,865
This is rather good.

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,575
I needed a good reason to remove
those who used to work for Mr. Lim.

377
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,345
- This could be a good excuse.
- What?

378
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,385
I get it.

379
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,585
<i>Donghan International</i>

380
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,565
It's been a long time.

381
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,365
Since the Managing Director
has changed, you look better off.

382
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,905
That's not true.

383
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,105
Mr. Lim isn't in the office at the
moment. What brings you here?

384
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,215
I would like to take a look
at Bella's fashion studio.

385
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,515
Excuse me?

386
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,255
Mr. Lim never talks
about Designer Bella at home.

387
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,560
Since the collaboration was announced,
everyone asks me about it

388
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,885
and it's quite troublesome.

389
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,955
Bella's studio is supposed to be
not open to the public.

390
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,095
Are you kidding me?

391
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,995
- Well...
- Where is it?

392
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,705
Lead the way.

393
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,105
Yes, ma'am. This way please.

394
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,985
Hello, ma'am.

395
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,195
So this is Designer Bella's work?

396
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,365
I don't get what's so special about it.

397
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,565
Don't you think?

398
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,505
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who told you to let anyone in?

399
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,905
I apologize.
I should have given you a heads-up.

400
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,505
- What are you doing?
- Yes, ma'am. Clean it up.

401
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,175
We have briefly met
at the presentation.

402
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm the former representative
of this company

403
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,990
and my husband is now
the representative of...

404
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,485
I know. You're Ms. Han Mi-young.

405
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,825
You know me.

406
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,225
Then how could you
embarrass me like this?

407
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,495
Can't you see it's troubling me?

408
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,710
Bella's entire work process is supposed
to be kept secret

409
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,405
according to the contract.

410
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,905
Even from the Chairman.
That won't change anything.

411
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,445
By the way,

412
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,845
I thought you looked familiar
at the collaboration presentation.

413
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,875
By any chance,

414
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,545
have we met before?

415
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,625
So you are

416
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,255
Team Leader Jang Sun-young
from 20 years ago?

417
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,505
You have changed a lot.
I didn't recognize you.

418
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,450
Please don't get me wrong.

419
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,550
I'm just saying that

420
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,975
you have the charisma
coming from your success.

421
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,555
Ms. Han, you have
changed a lot as well.

422
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,785
You used to be
very lovely like a little girl.

423
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,925
I can't believe

424
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,495
that I failed to recognize the person
who turned the girl into this.

425
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,365
The more I think about it,
the worse I feel.

426
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,935
I heard it was you.

427
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,905
What do you mean?

428
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,575
The person

429
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,075
who shed light on the relationship
between him and Yoo Hyo-myoung.

430
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,215
Thanks to you, I lost my husband

431
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,285
and got to meet my current husband.

432
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,055
After all, you have always been
deeply involved in my life,

433
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,555
Ms. Jang.

434
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,295
I'm not putting the blame on you.
Please don't get me wrong.

435
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,895
My current husband is

436
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,405
just as competent as Kang Min-suk.

437
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,775
You know what?

438
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,810
I wish I could talk to you more,

439
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,905
but as you know,

440
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,145
we don't have much time.

441
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,315
Right.

442
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,750
Look at us, being all nostalgic.

443
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,055
I guess we have gotten old.

444
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,785
Well, then. I'll get going.

445
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,355
By the way,

446
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,965
the girl you took with
when you went to study abroad.

447
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,295
What happened to her?

448
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,265
I'm suddenly curious about your life.

449
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,875
Next time we meet,
please tell me more stories like that.

450
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,245
Now, if you'll excuse me.

451
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,360
<i>Principal Designer Contest</i>

452
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,030
<i>A designer contest?</i>

453
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,725
<i>Yes, you should give it a try.</i>

454
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,170
<i>Unni. I can't be a designer.</i>

455
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,635
<i>Don't be like that.</i>

456
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,470
<i>I have been watching you.</i>

457
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,705
<i>You're very talented.</i>

458
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,675
<i>Still. And it kind of bothers me</i>

459
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,305
<i>that the representative of this company
is Kang Min-suk.</i>

460
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,480
<i>Right.</i>

461
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,485
<i>I'm sure it bothers you.</i>

462
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,455
<i>But does it matter?</i>

463
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,895
<i>It's not like he knows about Yu-jin.</i>

464
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,695
<i>Hyo-myoung, you should focus
only on your future for now.</i>

465
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,210
<i>Now, we're going to announce</i>

466
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,965
<i>the next principal designer
of Donghan International.</i>

467
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,905
<i>The next principal designer</i>

468
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,675
<i>is Designer Yoo Hyo-myoung.</i>

469
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,345
<i>Donghan International

470
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,785

<i>Donghan International

472
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,565
<i>Thank you.</i>

473
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,135
<i>Yoo Hyo-myoung had a daughter?</i>

474
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,880
<i>I guess I'm drunk.</i>

475
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,575
<i>I'm talking too much.</i>

476
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,745
<i>Are you the only one who knows it?</i>

477
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,685
<i>Mr. Kang knows it too.</i>

478
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,385
<i>He does?</i>

479
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,225
<i>And he seems to
feel really bad for her.</i>

480
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,125
<i>I thought that was perhaps
why he was so nice to Hyo-myoung.</i>

481
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,295
<i>I had no idea</i>

482
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,265
<i>he's the kind of person who mixes
personal feelings with business.</i>

483
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,905
<i>What do you mean?</i>

484
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,010
<i>Are you saying he and Yoo Hyo-myoung
are in a relationship</i>

485
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,975
<i>and that's why he picked her
as the principal designer,</i>

486
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,215
<i>not you?</i>

487
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,225
<i>Mr. Kang Min-suk's Shocking Love Affair</i>

<i>Mr. Kang Has a Daughter out of Wedlock?</i>

<i>Ms. Yoo, the Secret Mistress</i>

490
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,865
<i>What should I do now?</i>

491
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,175
<i>Why are such articles published?</i>

492
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,520
<i>And I think I put Mr. Kang in trouble.</i>

493
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,645
<i>What do I do?</i>

494
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,855
<i>What should I do, Unni?</i>

495
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,025
<i>What about Yu-jin?</i>

496
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,995
<i>Don't be stupid.
Don't worry about others.</i>

497
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,765
<i>You should worry about yourself.</i>

498
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,235
<i>Stay home for now.</i>

499
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,335
<i>I will come to you.</i>

500
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,105
<i>Okay.</i>

501
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,150
<i>- Do you admit the affair?
- What's your relationship with him?</i>

502
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,790
<i>- Please answer.
- What's your relationship?</i>

503
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,190
<i>Please say something.</i>

504
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,620
<i>- Please look over here.
- Sir.</i>

505
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,285
<i>Mom!</i>

506

<i>Yu-jin!</i>

<i>- What's your mother's name?
- Who is your mother?</i>

508
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,500
<i>- Is she your mom?
- Stop it!</i>

509
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
<i>- It's okay.
- Stop it!</i>

510
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,300
<i>Stop taking pictures!</i>

511
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,730

<i>Did you see the news?</i>

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,760
<i>It said Mr. Kang had died.</i>

<i>When he died,</i>

<i>he was with the principal designer.</i>

<i>Goodness.</i>

<i>Yu-jin. Go on.</i>

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,215
<i>I said I don't want to.</i>

540
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,120
<i>I said I want to live

541
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,760
<i>Don't be stubborn.</i>

542
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,795
<i>I can't raise you by myself.</i>

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800

544
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,930
<i>- I don't want to.
- Hurry.</i>

545
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,895
<i>- I don't want to go.
- Come on out.</i>

546
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,940
<i>I want to live with you, Grandpa.</i>

547
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,380
<i>- Come on out already.
- I want to live with you.</i>

548
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,180
<i>Don't be so stubborn.</i>

549
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,545
<i>- Hurry.
- No!</i>

550
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,345

"Seoha"?

554
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,515
Seoha-ri...

555
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,915
Right.

556
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,155
Seoha Village.

557
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,029
- Hey.
- Yes.

558
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:38,725
I need to stop by somewhere.

559
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,124
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,575
You should study hard

561
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,805
if you don't want to end up like me.

562
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,315
Unni!

563
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,785
I don't care if you are a
beggar or not. I like you.

565
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:10,995
Seol-ah.

566
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,825
You're the best.

567
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,765
Seol-ah.

568
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,405
- Seol-ah.
- Seol-ah! Byeol-na!

569
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,385
What a beautiful
and genuine friendship that is.

570
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,445
Hey,

571
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,255
I'm sorry.

572
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,215
What are you sorry about?

573
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,355
You're feeding
and sheltering a beggar, after all.

574
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,065
I can't believe I'm a beggar.

575
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,770
I'd rather have my memories
never come back.

576
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,035
Don't say that.

577
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,905
I'm just not entirely sure
about my memories either

578
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,705
because it was a
bad time for me as well.

579
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,580
What?

580
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,775
If you get so aggressive,

581
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,985
I might forget what I remembered.

582
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,455
So,

583
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,655
what aren't you entirely sure about?

584
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,825
Last night, memories just popped up

585
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,425
when I was going to sleep.

586
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,570
I think I did see you in Australia.

587
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,705
You saw me in Australia.

588
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,075
And I don't think you were a beggar.

589
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,505
I think I was just getting mixed up.

590
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,445
Right? I'm not a beggar?

591
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,215
I thought so!
I knew I wouldn't be a beggar!

592
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,415
I get your excitement, but let me go.

593
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,725
You have no idea how scared I've been.

594
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,765
I randomly speak English and French,

595
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,465
and I feel like I vaguely remember
being in Australia like you said.

596
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,705
But it was driving me crazy
that I couldn't remember anything.

597
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,645
Don't try too hard.

598
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,275
Your memories will come back in time.

599
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,985
Thanks, Chef Moon.

600
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,185
But

601
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,725
you gave me such a hard time.
How are you going to make up for that?

602
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,545
Unni. What is this?

603
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,290
We've hit the jackpot!

604
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,785
This is the reward for my sacrifice.

605
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,360
Chef Moon gave it to me
so that I'd feel better.

606
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,555
That's right!
Who cares if you're a beggar?

607
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,195
You're getting money, after all.

608
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,465
You're cool. You're a cool beggar.

609
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Are you teasing me? Are you?

610
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,340
I may not remember anything
but I'm in my right mind.

611
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,705
I can't stand it anymore.

612
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,835
Don't get mad.

613
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,215
Let's only think about twisted doughnuts,
hotteok, and tteok-bokki.

614
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,215
- Look!
- What is it?

615
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,420
Why do you think we will eat together?

616
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,085
I'm going to eat them all by myself!

617
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,085
Unni!

618
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,995
Why would I share?

619
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,605
Excuse me,

620
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,105
can you give me directions?

621
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,475
Sorry?

622
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,145
I don't know this area well, either.

623
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,080
- Where?
- Do you know if there's

624
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,945
a gas station
or a convenience store nearby?

625
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,285
Unni!

626
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,360
Unni! Are you really going alone?

627
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,525
Unni!

628
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,235
You greedy woman!

629
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,670
- What is it?
- Stay still!

630
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,465
- Stop it!
- Let me go!

631
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,705
Darn it.

632
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,245
My goodness! Seriously!

633
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,115
She's finally quiet.

634
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,455
Jung-tae, this isn't a joke.

635
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,055
- We're doing our job.
- Sorry.

636
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,995
- Drive quicker.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,140
I knew it!

638
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,205
I knew she had such
a bad sense of style.

639
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,975
An Australian beggar?

640
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,375
Unbelievable!

641
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,545
It's not for sure.
It's just a possibility.

642
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,785
Here.

643
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,955
Give it a try.

644
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,435
I love this perfect aroma
of Arabica coffee.

645
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,975
It's Yirgacheffe, actually.

646
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,105
Let me check on this.

647
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,580
Smells good in here.
What beans do you use?

648
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,715
Well,

649
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,890
it's Arabica coffee.

650
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,915
- We'll take two of those.
- Yes, sir.

651
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,695
You must be living here.
You're here all the time.

652
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,495
I just come here often.

653
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,835
Soon-mi,

654
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,805
don't you dare go around
meeting any men like that.

655
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,535
I have eyes, too.

656
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,710
What brings you here?

657
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,180
I wanted to see you

658
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,045
and also visit the chef's house.
You know, the one from Seoul.

659
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,615
My house? Why?

660
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,290
- Your house?
- He lives with the chef.

661
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,425
I see.

662
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,795
Then let me ask you some questions.

663
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,305
Seol-ah! What's wrong?

664
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,940
Are you here alone? Where's Byeol-na?

665
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,205
She ran away with the money, saying
she's going to eat everything alone!

666
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,115
What are you saying?

667
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,985
She got in a black van
and ran away from me!

668
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,585
What a terrible woman!

669
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,615
It must be the soy sauce.

670
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,085
I need ssi-ganjang, but...

671
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,085
- Anybody there?
- Who is that?

672
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,155
I'll be there in a second!

673
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,685
Who are you?

674
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,325
Someone I know very well
used to live here.

675
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,030
By any chance,

676
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,465
have you had any woman
come here recently?

677
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,495
Her name is Yoo Yu-jin.

678
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,205
- Yoo Yu-jin?
- Yes.

679
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,775
No, she hasn't.

680
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,820
If she ever happens to come by,

681
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,285
could you give me a call, please?

682
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,985
- Sure.
- Thank you.

683
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,600
<i>Madame Jang</i>

684
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,040
<i>Belle Ombre</i>

685
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,845
Yes?

686
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,720
I hear you're busy studying

687
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,485
the old restaurant project
that I was in charge of.

688
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,115
I've been having a lot of thoughts

689
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,025
about the company's brand value.

690
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,730
Rather than simply focusing

691
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,895
on increasing the short-term profit
of the company,

692
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,000
I think we should focus on
increasing the brand value

693
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,565
and growing together
with other businesses working with us.

694
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,035
I need to implement that well.

695
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,935
You remind me

696
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,235
a lot of my old friend, Min-suk.

697
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,405
You look like him and act like him.

698
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,580
The way you approach a business is

699
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,875
just like your birth father.

700
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,425
I've watched my mother struggle
because of my father,

701
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,455
so I hated him at times.

702
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,270
But I do look up to him

703
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,895
as one businessman to another,

704
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,665
and as the head of a company.

705
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,365
If I'm capable enough,

706
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,405
I'd like to make his
visions for Donghan

707
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,810
come true.

708
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,005
What did you just say?

709
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,150
Mother.

710
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,845
Sorry, I may have
forgotten to tell you.

711
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,685
I thought it'd be nice
if we had a family dinner.

712
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,085
Who do you respect?

713
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,595
Tell me again.

714
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,265
Mother.

715
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,265
I know you hate him,

716
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,575
but it has been 20 years already.

717
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,345
- Don't you think it's time...
- Jun-su,

718
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,015
don't you think forgiving comes

719
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,815
after an apology?

720
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,125
There's no way he
can apologize anymore,

721
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,525
and I can't forgive him.

722
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,995
For good.

723
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,110
Don't get so aggressive, we haven't had
a family dinner like this in a long while.

724
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,235
No.

725
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,305
It seems like
I've made you two uncomfortable.

726
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,615
I'll get going first, Mother.

727
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,455
Thank you for the surprise dinner.

728
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,595
It'll be near impossible

729
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,465
to make his visions
come true at Donghan.

730
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,245
There's no use raising your own kid.

731
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,555
But what can we do?

732
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,985
He's your kid.

733
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,295
Things are getting
interesting nowadays.

734
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,395
What do you mean?

735
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,165
You

736
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,275
didn't tell me

737
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,945
that Jang Sun-young is back.

738
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,320
I'm telling you,

739
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,390
she got into a black van
and drove away.

740
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,655
She just left me there!

741
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,125
What are you saying?

742
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,230
A black van? It wasn't a bus?

743
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,730
My goodness!

744
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,525
How many times do I need to tell you?

745
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,300
Give me a pen and paper.

746
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,435
Paper?

747
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,505
Seoha Teahouse

748
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,850
Could it be that Byeol-na's memories
suddenly come back to her?

749
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,375
What Seol-ah was telling me
was very odd, so I called you here.

750
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,145
By any chance,

751
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,190
did someone visit your house?

752
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,315
What?

753
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,190
Yes, someone visited me just now.

754
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,290
Right?

755
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,460
It was a middle-aged person
with white hair?

756
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,365
Yes, it was a middle-aged woman
with white hair.

757
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,565
A woman?

758
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,440
But it was a man.

759
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,470
Who?

760
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,140
There was a middle-aged man

761
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,340
that came to the police station

762
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,680
to ask where your house is.

763
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,650
He said he was a former detective
from Seoul.

764
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,875
A detective?

765
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,645
It was a woman that came to my house.

766
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,385
It wasn't a bus.
It was a car that looks like this!

767
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,485
Seol-ah,

768
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,830
is this the license plate number?

769
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,330
Yes. Byeol-na unni taught me
how to read today,

770
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,830
so this is exactly what I saw.

771
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,200
Good job.

772
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,395
Give me a moment.

773
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,575
Hello. How are you?

774
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,315
I was wondering
if you could track a car for me.

775
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,215
It's 39M 5050.

776
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,915
Yes.

777
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,955
What? It's an illegally registered car?

778
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,290
An illegally registered car?

779
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,755
Does that mean that she's kidnapped?

780
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,895
What?

781
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,935
Seung-mo, wait for me!

782
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,370
Dad, wait for me!

783
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,610
You head back to the station.

784
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,035
I'll get going right away.

785
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,090
A beggar with no friends or family
made a fire to avoid cold,

786
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,255
then the whole building caught on fire.

787
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,425
And she just happened
to die in the fire.

788
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,600
Understood?

789
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,835
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

790
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,605
Here. Get it done.

791
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,505
Sorry?

792
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,615
Yes, sir.

793
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,645
I have to go meet someone
and take care of some things,

794
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,290
so call me when you're done.

795
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,685
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

796
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,800
<i>Missing Person Report</i>

797
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,600
Someone is kidnapped here!
Shouldn't you be doing something?

798
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,710
Gosh. Exactly what?

799
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,070
What can I do?

800
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,775
- What?
- In order to report her missing,

801
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,540
we need her personal information.

802
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,950
- Do you know her real name?
- No.

803
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,245
What about her age? Her address?

804
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,445
- Well...
- Exactly my point.

805
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,215
How are we supposed to find her?

806
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,785
That's not even the issue.

807
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,390
We can't even report her.

808
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,685
How do we report it
when we have no information on her?

809
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,755
If there's a way, tell me.
I'd like to know.

810
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,955
So are you just saying that we should
do nothing and wait?

811
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,265
We need to investigate the whole area
before it's too late!

812
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,240
Mr. Oh, my instincts are
telling me something.

813
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,470
You sure we can't do anything?

814
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,540
Look at you.

815
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,065
Why are you talking nonsense too?

816
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,040
If the whole police have to be
dispatched for something ridiculous,

817
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,650
we'd need 10,000 officers
at this police station!

818
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,745
What do you know?

819
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,180
We can't report it.

820
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,550
We don't know what will happen.

821
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,350
- How is it impossible to even report this?
- Look.

822
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,820
Mr. Oh, I didn't think you'd be here.

823
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,490
Please help us out here.

824
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,155
- Mr. Hwang,
- Yes?

825
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,095
we don't know if she has been kidnapped
or if she just went out on her will.

826
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,600
We don't meet the requirements
to report her.

827
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,165
Then what do we do?

828
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,830
If you don't hear from her

829
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:17,995
within three days,

830
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,995
then come back here with her real name.

831
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,765
I will write the report then

832
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,405
as your dutiful civil servant.

833
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,615
- What happened?
- This is so frustrating!

834
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,450
I think we should
look for her ourselves.

835
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,420
And how can we do that?

836
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,660
I thought you were
capable of pulling some strings

837
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,260
because you show off about
being a civil servant all the time.

838
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,090
What are you saying?

839
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,460
If it weren't for me here,
he wouldn't even have done anything.

840
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,530
So what did he do?

841
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,025
What did he do for us?

842
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,670
If it weren't for you,
we would've ended up in prison.

843
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,995
There's a line we can't cross
as civil servants!

844
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,765
- What line? Crossing what?
- Stop it!

845
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,235
Now isn't the time to be arguing.

846
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,035
Is it?

847
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,475
I'll contact my friend
in the traffic situation room

848
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,845
to see if we can find anything.

849
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,020
Then keep me on the line

850
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,585
and look for a black van
that entered Seoha Village today.

851
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,255
All right.

852
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,655
Good.

853
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,250
The car is driving on Highway 325.

854
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,620
It's going straight,
and it's turning right at the crossing.

855
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,820
- Right turn.
- Right turn.

856
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,885
That way.

857
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,085
At the next crossing,

858
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,860
turn right.

859
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,985
No, I mean left.

860
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,455
- Left.
- All right.

861
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,715
Hey.

862
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,090
My goodness!

863
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,760
Hyung, can't you be
a little more careful?

864
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,890
Fine!

865
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,930
Look at how sharp the knife is!
You almost killed me.

866
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,195
I was thinking...

867
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,125
that you should do it.

868
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,335
What? I've never
done this before, either.

869
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,965
I don't want to.

870
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,865
Mr. Jin told you to do it, so you do it.

871
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,340
- No, you do it.
- You do it!

872
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,580
- You do it.
- Mr. Jin told you to do it!

873
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,150
- You do it!
- Let it go.

874
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,320
- Hey! Wait.
- Hyung.

875
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,415
Let go!

876
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,615
Seriously?

877
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,185
- The knife!
- Get out of the way!

878
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,955
- Darn it.
- Fire! Fire!

879
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,325
Fire!

880
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,865
Jung-tae.

881
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,065
Jung-tae. What do we do?

882
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,165
- Joo-hyuk.
- What?

883
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,765
- Let's just leave.
- Why?

884
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,775
What are you doing?

885
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,305
Stabbing her to death or
burning her to death. It's the same.

886
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,275
Let's just go.

887
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,785
Picture.

888
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,590
- We need a picture.
- Take it quickly.

889
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,485
Just a second.

890
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,925
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

891
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,950
So it's true

892
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,145
that Nonyang has
the best mandarin fish.

893
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,985
I'm having it for the first time
in a while, thanks to you.

894
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,260
By the way, what do you want me to do?

895
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,800
It's nothing like that.

896
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,030
I just came here because I missed you.

897
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,365
Come on.

898
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,235
Thank you.

899
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,735
You can't stay a public servant
your whole life.

900
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,210
Raising kids takes a lot of money.

901
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,345
Here.

902
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,120
- No, don't do this.
- Take it.

903
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,585
Just take it. It's not much.

904
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,255
You're the only one who understands me.

905
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,525
You always need
someone to have your back.

906
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,800
Right.

907
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,065
Recently, I got a
really good opportunity.

908
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,995
Let's take it together.

909
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,065
Thank you.

910
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,180
Give me a moment, I need to take this.

911
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,915
- Sure, go ahead.
- Keep eating.

912
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,515
Sure.

913
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,995
Good work.

914
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,835
We're nearing the intersection soon.
Where do we go next?

915
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,675
Wait, what? Hold on.

916
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,275
There's no footage available
for the next intersection.

917
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,675
What?

918
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,985
This is driving me crazy.

919
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,790
They're currently replacing the camera,
so they don't have footage there.

920
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,785
- Gosh.
- We have to go to the Metropolitan Police

921
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:45,395
to get the road footage
beyond this point.

922
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,925
What should we do?

923
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,610
There's no need to stop.

924
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:04,220
The car must've gone straight
since the path leads to Seoul.

925
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,545
- There's nothing on this side.
- Right.

926
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,345
- I think there's just a closed school.
- Right.

927
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,655
I smell something burning.

928
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,255
I don't smell anything.

929
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,900
- I told you to go straight!
- What are you doing?

930
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,235
- Seung-mo!
- Goodness.

931
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,720
I told you to go straight!

932
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,855
There's nothing there.

933
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,795
What's that?

934
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,325
Is that fire?

935
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,465
It's fire!

936
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,815
Why is there a fire?
No one even lives here!

937
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,420
Is this 911?

938
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,490
I'm Hwang Jang-dan
from the county office.

939
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,520
We're at the branch school.

940
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,655
Yes, the closed school!

941
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
What are you doing?
Are you trying to head in?

942
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Let me go. Byeol-na is in there.

943
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,140
What do you mean? How do you know?

944
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,775
- You can't go in!
- Why would this hairpin be here?

945
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,335
You're right.

946
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,205
Can Byeol-na really be in there?

947
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,005
Byeol-na!

948
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,775
- Seung-mo!
- Chef Moon!

949
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,605
- Chef Moon!
- Dad!

950
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:21,745
(Eccentric! Chef Moon)

951
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,040
<i>- It's a scary world indeed.
- Byeol-na!</i>

952
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,180
<i>How dare they kidnap someone
in broad daylight?</i>

953
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,080
<i>We become murderers
if we get caught, right?</i>

954
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,545
<i>Nonsense. We won't get caught.</i>

955
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,245
<i>You have to take what you want.</i>

956
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,380
<i>There's nothing wrong with that.</i>

957
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,590
<i>- Did you find the kidnapper?
- What kidnapper?</i>

958
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:58,815
<i>We're going all "CSI" on this.</i>

959
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,685
<i>- So who did Bella take from?
- What?</i>

960
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,660
<i>I was taught
that you have to take what you want.</i>

961
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,830
<i>The culprit has been caught?</i>

962
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,830
<i>You know Donghan,
the big company in Seoul!</i>

963
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,070
<i>- Byeol-na!
- A black van came</i>

964
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,500
<i>and took me...</i>

965
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,965
<i>Donghan?</i>

966
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,305
<i>Who are you?</i>

967
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,175
<i>Bella!</i>
