[ Episode 11 ]

3
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:53,640
Yes.

4
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,280
[ The outfit is ready. ]

5
00:00:58,055 --> 00:00:59,280
Good work.

6
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,250
I know I should let her rest,

7
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,450
but I want to buy her a celebratory drink.

8
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,899
Bella, you've met her before.

9
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,570
It's nice to see you again,
Ms. Han Mi-young.

10
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:56,510
You resemble your mother.

11
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:07,149
Chairman Louis will come to the boutique
tomorrow at the opening time.

12
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,790
I will personally escort him
from the airport.

13
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,420
You will be busy preparing
for the opening.

14
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,160
That will be wonderful.

15
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:18,860
What about you, Bella?

16
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,560
Chairman Louis
will be holding an interview,

17
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,300
so you don't have to worry.

18
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,200
- If so, this will be a done deal.
[ - Right. ]

19
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,710
By the way,

20
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,210
isn't this fascinating?

21
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:36,410
It never crossed my mind

22
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:42,080
you and I will be on the same side.

23
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,090
To tell you the truth,

24
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:48,490
I used to despise your mother.

25
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:50,830
[ No, ]

26
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,360
I still despise her.

27
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:55,930
- Ms. Han.
- On my way back

28
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,830
from burying my father today,

29
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,570
this crossed my mind.

30
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,010
For the sake of my father, me,

31
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:10,380
and my son, Jun-su,

32
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,850
I should bring down Lim Chul-yong.

33
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:16,080
[ To do that, ]

34
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,190
I should be able to join hands

35
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,490
with the daughter of the woman I despise.

36
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:29,870
As soon as I get Belle Ombre back,
I'll leave quietly.

37
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,100
You can despise her
to your heart's content.

38
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,110
That's reassuring.

39
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,110
I'm looking forward
to the opening of Bella Boutique

40
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,249
tomorrow.

41
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,935
[ Donghan ]

42
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,390
[ What do you mean? ]

43
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:02,100
[ There's a broadcasting company here
that we haven't invited. ]

44
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,300
Who called them?

45
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,470
I asked about it, and apparently,

46
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,840
Ms. Han did.

47
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,910
What is happening?

48
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,380
Things aren't looking good.

49
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,625
Chairman Louis is coming from France

50
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:24,050
and he called a broadcasting company
to the boutique.

51
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,094
[ But the bigger issue ]

52
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:32,530
is that there are two outfits
being displayed for the opening.

53
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:34,760
Explain properly!

54
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:36,400
Well,

55
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:40,970
the reason Sun-young called
Chairman Louis here is...

56
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:47,785
[ - Hello.
- There you are. ]

57
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,185
[ You made it. ]

58
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:50,515
[ - Hi.
- Hello. ]

59
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:51,910
[ - You made it.
- Hello. ]

60
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,380
[ - Hello.
- Hi. ]

61
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,650
...

62
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,930
He should have already been
out here by now.

63
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,875
Let me call the secretary
of Chairman Louis.

64
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

65
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,810
Please answer it. It's Mr. Lim.

66
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:24,450
Dad. What should I do?

67
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:30,020
Hello. Hi.

68
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:36,690
First of all, I'd like to thank you all
for attending today's event.

69
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,260
Hello.

70
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:43,700
I see a lot of familiar faces here today.

71
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,440
But you might be a bit thrown off
by my introduction.

72
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:52,970
I used to be the former representative
director of Belle Ombre.

73
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:54,710
My name is Jang Sun-young.

74
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:00,480
Hello.

75
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,120
You're here, too, Mr. Kim.

76
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,760
Ms. Jang Sun-young.

77
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,990
It looks like you have a lot to say.

78
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:16,605
Why don't we continue this conversation

79
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,740
after inviting in the woman
of the hour today, Bella?

80
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:22,640
Sure.

81
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,270
I give you Bella.

82
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,850
Ms. Lim Hyun-a.

83
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,750
Congratulations.

84
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:41,190
You have been working so hard
to make someone else's clothes.

85
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,290
[ - What?
- "Someone else's clothes"? ]

86
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,990
You don't have much time
on your hands now.

87
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:48,100
Enjoy this as much as you want.

88
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:49,700
[ What is she talking about? ]

89
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:09,180
I wanted to show you the minimum courtesy,

90
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,490
but let's get to the main event.

91
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,320
[ Today, at this opening event, ]

92
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:19,690
I want to expose Bella's impersonator
who has been deceiving you the whole time

93
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:25,175
and a man who put the impersonator
in Bella's place

94
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,940
and has been controlling her
behind the curtains.

95
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,270
- What?
- What's she saying?

96
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,240
There are two mannequins here.

97
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:36,680
One

98
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,710
has been made by fake Bella,

99
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,790
and the other has been made
by Bella herself.

100
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,250
[ - Hurry, everyone.
- Okay. ]

101
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:49,290
- My goodness.
- Did it start already?

102
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,090
They are going to expose
the fake Bella now.

103
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,435
My goodness. I can tell which one it is
just by looking at them.

104
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,970
I can't tell even if I'm staring at them.

105
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,829
- How can you not tell?
- What?

106
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,805
[ They are similar to our uniform. ]

107
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,205
- The one on the right.
- The right one.

108
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,775
I was just going to say
it was the one on the right.

109
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,015
I'll follow Hyo-sook
and say it's the one on the right.

110
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:11,185
[ My goodness.
Only we can tell which one is hers. ]

111
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,920
I doubt other people can tell
which one is hers.

112
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,880
I think it's the one on the left.

113
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,250
What?

114
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:23,290
- That's Bella's outfit.
[ - Let's get to the main event. ]

115
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,630
I have invited the only man

116
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,030
who can tell us
which outfit is made by Bella.

117
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,700
He had been working with Bella
for three years.

118
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:37,540
It's the chairman of the internationally
famous luxurious brand. It's Louis.

119
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,485
I give you Louis Bellemont.

120
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,510
- Louis?
- That's amazing.

121
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:32,930
I see an outfit which was made
by the Bella I know.

122
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,060
[ "I see an outfit which was made
by the Bella I know." ]

123
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,570
[ - Is this true? ]
- Really?

124
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,210
[ - She was telling the truth.
- No way. ]

125
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:02,590
Hello?

126
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,190
Has the driver arrived yet?

127
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:06,690
What?

128
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:09,560
Alright.

129
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,630
I have bad news, ma'am.

130
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,270
Just a while ago,
he left through a different gate.

131
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,915
Mr. Lim personally escorted
Chairman Louis to the boutique.

132
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,140
What?

133
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:38,130
[ That must be the real one. ]

134
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:44,570
- Is that the one?
- I guess so.

135
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,470
[ - That's it.
- That must be it. ]

136
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:54,810
[ - My gosh.
- Goodness. ]

137
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:02,220
A fake outfit was on display here.

138
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,595
[ - What just happened?
- What was that? ]

139
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,465
My goodness. What did he just do?

140
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,965
"A fake outfit was on display here."

141
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,135
[ - That was fake?
- Fake? ]

142
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,830
[ That wasn't real? ]

143
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:17,630
[ Everyone, as you can see, ]

144
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:25,040
[ the outfit on the floor ]

145
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:32,350
was made by this lady, Lim Hyun-a.

146
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:34,525
It's fake.

147
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,355
[ - That one was real?
- She was fake? ]

148
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:37,650
[ That's made by real Bella. ]

149
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,460
And the outfit I brought here

150
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,560
is made by real Bella.

151
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,390
What?

152
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,020
[ - That...
- What... ]

153
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,020
You acted like a know-it-all.

154
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,330
But Seol-a has the sharpest eyes.

155
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,665
[ My gosh. They deserve to be punished! ]

156
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,830
[ How dare they pull a stunt like this? ]

157
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:26,970
[ Goodness. ]

158
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,815
We will provide you with the details

159
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,545
in the follow-up press conference.

160
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:37,480
Let's end it here today.

161
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,880
Louis, let's get to the car.

162
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:49,795
Mr. Lim, what happened?

163
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,130
Please give us a comment.

164
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,400
Do you seriously believe that?

165
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,105
They used to be

166
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:03,500
business partners only a few months ago.

167
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,440
The biggest reason

168
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:08,915
behind Bella and Ms. Jang's breakup

169
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:12,885
was the dispute they had
as Ms. Jang pushed her

170
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,525
to continue their joint project
with Louis.

171
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,190
Are you saying that
Ms. Jang bought Chairman Louis off?

172
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:21,125
That's something you must look into.

173
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:23,625
Anyway, we didn't intend it,

174
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:26,330
but we ended up being in the limelight.

175
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,735
The bigger the buzz is,
the better marketing we get.

176
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,970
How will you confront this accusation?

177
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,105
If I confront every absurd accusation,

178
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:35,640
I'll only be fueling the fire.

179
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,240
That's probably what Ms. Jang

180
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:39,945
was after.

181
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,845
This is it for today's questions.

182
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:42,810
[ Let's go. ]

183
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:47,385
- Mr. Lim, one more question.
- A comment, please.

184
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,455
- A question.
- Sir.

185
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,180
- This is it.
- Hold on.

186
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,090
Wait...

187
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,190
Keep a straight face on.

188
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,540
[ You must've been flustered.
Try to smile. ]

189
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,470
[ It's just getting started. ]

190
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm sure Mr. Lim offered you
a very good deal.

191
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:24,050
Yes, he did.

192
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,460
He promised me a 10-year exclusive
contract with Belle Ombre.

193
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,930
It must have been hard
to turn down Mr. Lim's offer.

194
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,830
A lot of thoughts crossed my mind
on my way there.

195
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:38,500
But what I need is not Donghan.

196
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:40,400
- It's Bella.
- Right.

197
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,840
She needs to come see me this time.

198
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,610
And about the contract, too.

199
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,585
I want to renew it exclusively with Bella.

200
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,410
Don't forget this, Madam Jang.

201
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:53,550
I'm a businessman.

202
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:07,205
Louis will have
a follow-up interview tomorrow?

203
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:11,175
Yes. And the girl who claims herself
to be Bella will

204
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,130
join the interview.

205
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,445
I see.

206
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,945
As it's the day before
the shareholders' meeting,

207
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,570
depending on the interview,
it may deeply affect the meeting.

208
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,945
[ I'm not sure how I should handle this. ]

209
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:26,215
Did you look into that girl who came
to the funeral with Jang Sun-young?

210
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,255
Yes, as you expected,

211
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:31,095
she's connected to Ms. Han and Mr. Kang.

212
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:33,150
Do you think she's real Bella?

213
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:38,260
Is she the one who's claiming to be Bella?

214
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,460
It looks like that girl has been living

215
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,305
in Seoha Village, Nonyang
for a few months.

216
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,305
Find out with whom she was with

217
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,100
and how she spent her time there.

218
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,870
We must find her weak spot.

219
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,040
Now!

220
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:56,740
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:08,060
[ Chairman Louis Picks out
the Real Bella's Outfit ]

222
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:09,795
[ So she's been deceiving us
the whole time? ]

223
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,035
[ It's the fraud of the century. ]

224
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,565
[ That serves you right. ]

225
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:15,035
[ I knew it
when she was giving interviews. ]

226
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:17,800
[ The new rising con artist, Lim Hyun-a ]

227
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:57,770
Chairman Louis decided
to expose everything about Mr. Lim

228
00:16:58,145 --> 00:17:01,115
and Mr. Lim's attempts to cajole Louis

229
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,885
and buy him off in his interview

230
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,580
tomorrow night with DBC.

231
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:06,915
If that happens,

232
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,585
forget about his chance
of becoming the next chairman.

233
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,555
It will be enough to oust him
from his position

234
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,250
at Donghan International.

235
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:16,160
Even so,

236
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,035
I believe we must be careful
to the last moment.

237
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,865
It is true that Mr. Lim's people have

238
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,759
more shares than we do.

239
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:26,970
And given the will of the late chairman,

240
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,575
we are still at a disadvantage.

241
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:33,370
Public opinion is what matters to us.

242
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:37,210
If the interview between Louis
and the real Bella goes well,

243
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:40,950
the shareholders will think differently.

244
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:44,750
They're not stupid enough
to give the position

245
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,120
to a problematic person.

246
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,200
What should we do, sir?

247
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:05,870
Should we push back
the shareholders' meeting?

248
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:09,510
This is exactly what those people want.

249
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:10,815
[ They want to cause anxiety ]

250
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,810
and disrupt us from within.

251
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,820
Don't fall for it.

252
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,625
If what they're saying is true,

253
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,995
why would they need the interviews

254
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,990
and have the media involved?

255
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,660
It's because they don't have the proof.

256
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,230
If they had proof,

257
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,900
they would have sued.

258
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:35,770
- He has a point.
- Yes.

259

Let's proceed with the meeting.

261
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,180
No matter how the interview goes,

262
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:49,350
the results won't change anything.

263
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:52,820
Let's do that.

264
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,235
I'll be heading home, then.

265
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,530
Take care.

266

I found something interesting, sir.

Is it true we reached peak sales today?

279
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:12,970
Of course, it's true.

- Yes.

- Come on in.

Okay. Listen up, everyone.

00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,865
I am here to share the happy news

289
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,465
that the local broadcasting station

290
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:43,500
wants to cover Pungcheonok.

291
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,135
Are we going to be on TV? Really?

292

Why all of a sudden?

294
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,945
Chef Moon, the chief of the station

295
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,510
is supposedly good friends with Mr. Hong.

296
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:58,215
It will be good for Mr. Hong's publicity,

297
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:01,485
[ and since you are such a famous chef, ]

298
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:04,020
[ I guess the station thinks
they will benefit from that. ]

299
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,755
We can publicize the restaurant
and the gourmandism business.

300
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,520
- I guess it's not a bad idea.
- Sure.

301
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,120
What about my mother?

302
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,220
What a short temper.

303
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:47,630

and thoroughly.

Let's begin with the interview.

308
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:06,010
If you have an interview with Louis,
I may go down.

309
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,380
But it won't be easy.

310
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:12,520
It will take a long time
for everything to be revealed.

311
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:17,620
And I will be doing everything I can
to deal with it.

312
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:22,960
It will be a long lawsuit.

313
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:26,535
And even if it is revealed
that Hyun-a is fake,

314
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,440

is of great meaning to you.

I have no intention of digging into
your personal feelings.

322

Like what kind of time you spent
with whom there.

323

It's good enough that you made
some special memories.

324

00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:48,990
Yes, you're the head of Seoha Village.

720
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,805
What brings you here?

721
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,945
I heard that the gourmandism business
has been halted

722
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:59,515
and that you're working
on the clothing industrial complex again,

723
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,845
which is what brings me here.

724
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:04,480
Right, the clothing industrial complex.

725
00:52:04,615 --> 00:52:06,910
That all depends on Yu-jin.

Oh, my.

I'm guessing that you haven't heard yet.

730
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:20,630
Yu-jin holds the village very close
to her heart.

731
00:52:21,065 --> 00:52:25,130
When I said that I'd be resuming
the clothing industrial complex project,

732
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:30,770
she looked so sad as if she's going
to stop impersonating Bella.

733
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,510
What did you say to her?

734
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,120
"Is it Belle Ombre or Seoha Village?"

735
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:47,590
I told her to choose.

736
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:53,990
That was very kind of me,
considering that she's a swindler.

737
00:52:58,335 --> 00:53:00,530
How dare you call her a swindler?

738
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:02,570
You think you can get away with this?

739
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:13,880

Yu-jin...

742
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:48,460
One of Bella's worst habits is

743
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:53,270
to disappear before the event
then appears before it starts.

744
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:56,840
If we wait, she'll definitely come.

745
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:58,370
She'd better come.
