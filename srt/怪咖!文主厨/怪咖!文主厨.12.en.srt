00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,319
[ Lim Chul-yong's wife, ]

365
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,785
would love to hear.

366
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,325
What do you say? Aren't you curious?

367
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,165
I guess Chef Moon is
not coming today either.

368
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,235
Should we close the store again today?

369
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,975
Yoon-ja makes great gukbap.

370
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,949
How about we only sell gukbap today?

371
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,045
What?

372
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,789
She's right.

373
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,289
You can make gukbap, Yoon-ja.

374
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,859
What are you talking about? I can't.

375
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,125
Yes, you can.

376
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,259
Just give it a try.

377
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,269
I don't think your gukbap is

378
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,229
any worse than Chef Moon's.

379
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,265
Strictly speaking, that's not true.

380
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,435
What the...

381
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,339
It's definitely delicious though.

382
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,265
Why can't you speak more nicely?

383
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,845
So have you not heard
anything from Chef Moon yet?

384
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,845
[ Bang Da-hoon ]

385
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,989
Hey, Da-hoon.

386
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,529
- Hey!
- Goodness.

387
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,795
What happened?

388
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,325
[ Are you not coming today either? ]

389
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,965
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can today either.

390
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,095
Please tell the people for me.

391
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,035
Why did she do that yesterday?

392
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,475
Did she lie because of our village?

393
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,745
I mean, right after her interview,

394
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,475
we were told
that the construction was canceled.

395
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,815
Everyone said it was strange.

396
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,485
[ Hello? ]

397
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,989
You're not saying anything.
So I was right.

398
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,425
Hey, you're with her at the moment, right?

399
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,825
Dad, are you with Byeol-na now?

400
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,199
Please put her on the phone.

401
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,435
Tell her I miss her so much.

402
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,635
Seol-a.

403
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,905
Byeol-na isn't here at the moment,

404
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,505
so I can't put her on the phone.

405
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,745
I promise I will tell her
what you said. Okay?

406
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,975
I'll hang up.

407
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,685
Hello?

408
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,685
Did he hang up?

409
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,719
What does that mean?

410
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,389
Does that mean she lied at the interview

411
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,425
in order to save our village?

412
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,135
Seung-mo isn't saying much,
so I suppose so.

413
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,409
[ He's a horrible liar. ]

414
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,175
See? I told you something was off.

415
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,605
Goodness. What do we do?

416
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,345
Tell me about it.

417

[ Ms. Jang Sun-young ]

418
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,195
[ See you at the hotel's coffee shop. ]

419
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,065
Yu-jin?

420
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,935
If she didn't even contact you,

421
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,505
I guess she left for real.

422
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,415
May I ask

423
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,185
why Yu-jin left you,

424
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,785
Ms. Jang?

425
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,095
Yu-jin

426
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,925
believes her mother died because of me.

427
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,935
Actually,

428
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,935
she's right about it.

429
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,865
She did die because of me.

430
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:22,405
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,115
I shouldn't have said that.

432
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,144
Yu-jin must be having
a hard time at the moment.

433
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,255
The only way

434
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,255
I can apologize to Yu-jin is

435
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,854
to get Belle Ombre back

436
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,595
and give it back to her.

437
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,325
To do that,

438
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,894
I must take Lim Chul-yong down.

439
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,965
I just got a phone call from Mr. Jin.

440
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,374
He wanted a deal.

441
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,405
Excuse me?

442
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,445
[ I was right. ]

443
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,515
Lim Chul-yong hired Mr. Jin
to kill Yu-jin.

444
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,644
And he seems to have the evidence
to prove that.

445
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,555
What evidence are you talking about?

446
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,325
He said he would get back to me,

447
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,955
so I will see once I meet him.

448
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,625
Are you going to meet him yourself?

449
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,725
I should.

450
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,265
This is something I should solve myself.

451
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,605
It'll be dangerous.

452
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,275
Don't go alone on this one.

453
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,045
I'll find some people who can help.

454
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,925
[ Kang Min-suk ]

455
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,295
[ I'm finally here to see you at last. ]

456
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,935
[ When I was a kid, ]

457
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,365
[ I wondered why I didn't have a father
like everyone else. ]

458
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,005
[ I was also sad. ]

459
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,515
[ But that made me ]

460
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,585
[ that much curious about who my father
could be. ]

461
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,615
[ I'm finally getting to see you at last. ]

462
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,595
What kind of a father was he, Jun-su?

463
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,265
In my memories,

464
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,975
he was an incredible man.

465
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,145
He was a warm and compassionate person.

466
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,845
That's where you get that from.

467
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,885
Really?

468
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,295
When I see you next time,

469
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,795
do you mind

470
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,895
if I call you my sister?

471
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,005
I mind.

472
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,305
Call me Sister from now on.

473
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,175
- What?
- I'm leaving soon.

474
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,015
I don't know
when I'll get to see you next.

475
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,615
What?

476
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,645
I'm going now.

477
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,025
Thanks for bringing me to Father
before I have to leave.

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,155
Sister,

479
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,365
where are you heading to?

480
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,035
I don't know,

481
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,405
somewhere far.

482
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,585
- Yes, Chef Moon?
- Mr. Kang,

483
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,115
Ms. Jang would like to meet with us.

484
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,585
[ - Can you come with me? ]
- Why?

485
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,155
She apparently has the last weapon
that can tear down Mr. Lim.

486
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,765
Then we should definitely meet.

487
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,435
I guess Yu-jin doesn't know about that?

488
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,095
She doesn't seem like she does.

489
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,365
What? You met with Yu-jin?

490
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,175
Where is she right now?

491
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,145
She just left, saying that she was leaving
to somewhere far.

492
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,975
Enjoy your flight.

493
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,055
Chef Moon?

494
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,300
...

495
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,865
How could you just disappear like that?

496
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:12,895
Do you know how worried I was?

497
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,595
Why are you doing this?

498
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,605
Tell me!

499
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,305
When I saw you at the hotel,

500
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,245
I suddenly began to wonder

501
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,045
whether my existence is any good to you.

502
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,855
How can you be, when you just do
whatever you want all the time?

503
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,525
That's the kind of person I am.

504
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,499
I say what I want and do what I want.

505
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,895
You always have to have your way
and you're so much in trouble.

506
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,365
But

507
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,235
that's what I like about you.

508
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,445
I like you.

509
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,085
I...

510
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,105
Don't leave, Yu-jin.

511
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,755
Let's head to Seoha Village.

512
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,525
I'm not the only one

who's waiting for you.

514
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,365
Seol-a, Da-hoon,

515
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,935

516
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,505

517
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,085
[ I know you resent me. ]

518
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,255
It's not like I'm perfectly happy
with you,

519
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,225
but what's past is past.

520
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,625
I hope we can get back to being
on good terms again like before.

521
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,495
Like before?

522
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,835
[ When? ]

00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,935
Before

524
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,135
you killed Kang Min-suk?

525
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,045
Or

526
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,785
after you used that

527
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,615
to threaten me into this marriage?

528
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,515
You're drunk.

529
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,995
Looking back,

530
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,525
I was too young

531
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,695
and too scared.

532
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,765
[ That's why ]

533
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,965
I married the man who killed my husband

534
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,075
and blamed

535
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,445
Yoo Hyo-myoung for everything.

536
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,715
What are you saying?

537
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,285
[ I thought I was the last target ]

538
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,415
for your greed.

539
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,625
I had no idea that you'd go to the extent

540
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,525
to hurt my father to steal his position.

541
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,535
Come on. You knew that he wasn't healthy.

542
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,515
That's nonsense.

543
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,365
You want to lose Jun-su, too?

544
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,675
Listen carefully.

545
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,445
This is my last warning.

My back!

552
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,469
It's a relief that the restaurant is
still doing so well.

You could run this place without me.

- That's nonsense.

the other dishes.

- Anyone could be Chef Moon

how to cook like him.

Your life is the most important thing.

[ You don't need to think for old people
like us. ]

It breaks our hearts.

What are you to represent
the county office like that?

Bring the county governor here tomorrow
and have him apologize to her properly.

You idiot!

00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,879
We should celebrate.

Grab a drink, everyone.

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

This is great.

00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,115
Didn't she just say politely?

613
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,885
What?

614
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,795
Seeing everyone here,

I feel

like I made the right choice.

617
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,405
That doesn't mean that you can live on

618
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,375
and just leave the precious name
Bella behind.

619
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,145
I'm not going to design clothes anymore,

620
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,715
which is why the name Bella

621
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,485
doesn't matter to me anymore.

622
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,255
And

623
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,685
I got a new name, Byeol-na.

624
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,925
Don't say that.

625
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,425
Bella and Belle Ombre were everything
to you.

626
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,665
Even if you say you don't want it back,
I'm going to get it back for you.

627
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,675
Don't you think you're trying too hard
to be cool these days?

628
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,775
I really appreciate the thought.

629
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,815
Just wait.

630
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,345
I'll get it back for you, really.

[ - I don't want to.
- Gun-woo. ]

632
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,585
I can't and I won't.

633
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,499
- Hey!
- To be honest,

634
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,599
I came out because I thought
that you had a new business idea.

635
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,025
We're not spies.

636
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,869
And since we're on the topic,

637
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,069
I was doing so well in Australia,
but I left and came to Korea for you.

638
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,135
Now, I can't even get severance pay.

639
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,775
And yet, you've called me here again
to take revenge on Mr. Lim?

640
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,709
- Hey.
- What?

641
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,779
I'm right.

642
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,545
It was already difficult
when he was a director.

643
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,085
But he's now Chairman Lim!

644
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,185
I don't want to be involved in this.

645
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,589
Gun-woo! Wait.

646
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,155
Let me go.

647
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,625
[ Sorry I'm late. ]

648
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,895
No worries, we just got here.

649
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,595
Hello.

650
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,605
Last night,

651
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,375
I had a talk with Ms. Han Mi-young.

652
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,045
She told me that she doesn't want
to be involved in any of this anymore

653
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,475
and that she wants me to leave you out
as well.

654
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,045
Are you going to be okay?

655
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,585
I think having the whole group taken away

656
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,315
hit her quite hard.

657
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,725
I'll have a talk with her.

658
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,125
Okay.

659
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,525
That'll make me feel a lot better.

660
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,825
Yes, ma'am.

661
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,335
[ When did you get here? ]

662
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:31,465
Just now.

663
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,335
What are you doing?

664
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,775
The cleaning lady will clean it all up,
no need to clean.

665
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,445
It's okay, I just want to do this.

666
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,155
What's wrong?

667
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,725
Mother?

668
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,465
Have some.

00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,615
Yes?

671
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,785
Can you not get involved in this
from now on?

672
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:01,025
Mother, I can't give up here.

673
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,165
I can't let my grandfather's company

674
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,565
end up in the hands of someone like him.

675
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,435
Please, I'm begging you.

676
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,765
I'll get going now.

677
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,005
Don't drink too much.

678
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,605

[ Listen carefully. ]

680
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,015
I'll tell you why your father ended up
like that

[ and why he died. ]

682
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,985
I'll tell you everything.

683
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,940
I'll tell you why your father ended up
like that

684
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:38,910
[ and why he died. ]

685
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,910
I'll tell you everything.

686

[ What are you talking about? ]

687
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,600
You're saying

688
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,400
that my father didn't pass away
in an accident?

689
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,410
Why?

690
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:17,220
Why are you telling me this just now?

691
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,380
[ So that I'd stop? ]

692
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:21,250
Then you should've

693
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,090
kept it a secret from me until the end.

694
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,390
I'm sorry, Jun-su.

695
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:30,390
[ But ]

696
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,870
I can't lose you like that.

697
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:37,670
[ I was mistaken. ]

698
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,140
Lim Chul-yong is not

someone that we can battle.

700
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,720
I'm terrified because I don't know

Can you please stop here?

705
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:14,670
I

706

can't understand you.

707
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:22,750
And now,

708
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:25,320
you gave me a reason why I can't stop.

709
00:55:42,535 --> 00:55:45,000
[ He wants to meet tonight. ]

710

Are you going to keep the restaurant open?

712

Actually...

713
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,860
I thought of closing it,

714
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:17,030
but seeing everyone yesterday,
I realized that I shouldn't.

715
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:18,740
Why?

716
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:23,040
[ It's a relief that the restaurant is
still doing so well. ]

717
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:24,984
[ A week passes by so quickly ]

when the business does so well.

719
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:31,550
Pungcheonok is owned by everyone
in this village.

720
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:35,050
It's not a restaurant that I can close
as I'd like.

721
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:38,394
Then I have a share in this too, right?

722
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,720
How much of a share do I get?

723
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,330
Just eat.

00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:01,350
He won't bring the police, would he?

727
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,450
- Have you been shot in the head?
- What?

728
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,650
If we get arrested, things are
going to get more difficult for them.

729
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,620
They won't hand us over.

730
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:38,150
This is Mr. Kang Jun-su.

731
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:42,120
You're Mr. Lim's son, right?

732
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:48,360
What an honor it is for you
to come out here yourself.

733
00:57:48,695 --> 00:57:51,000
Let's cut the small talk.
Show me all the evidence.

734
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:58,170
[ I thought you made no mistakes. ]

735
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,744
[ You're the one who will be in trouble ]

736
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:03,370
[ if Sun-young finds out about Bella. ]

737
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:06,910
[ I think she's leaving for Paris tonight, ]

738
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:08,484
[ but I think it'd be best ]

739
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,550
[ if we just take care of everything
before she leaves. ]

740
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,450
[ How much do you need? ]

741
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,490
I have one more.

742
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,790
[ I didn't kill Bella. ]

743
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:24,200
[ It was ]

744
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:27,030
[ just an accident. ]

745
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:36,710
Tell me what you want.

746
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:40,414
Find me a safe way out of Korea

747
00:58:40,415 --> 00:58:43,610
and give me 10 grand for my time abroad.

748
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:46,250
Give me some time.

749
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,120
I can't give you a lot of it.

750
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:57,460
Da-hoon, you can shower now.

751
00:58:58,635 --> 00:58:59,800
I'm going to use the bathroom!

752
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:15,810
- Did you meet him?
- Yes.

753
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:17,310
Did you get the proof?

754
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:19,850
I confirmed the recordings

755
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:21,090
of Chul-yong directing murders

756
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:24,320
and Hyun-a implying
that she's not the real Bella.

757
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,190
That's good to hear.

758
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:30,360
I'll head to Seoul once I take care
of the restaurant business.

759
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:33,800
No, you should stay there
and take care of Yu-jin.

760
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:35,500
[ I'll take care of the things here. ]

761
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:38,940
I'd like to take revenge
on Chul-yong myself.

762
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,070
- What?
[ - It turns out, ]

763
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,680
my father and Yoo Hyo-myoung

764
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,080
didn't die in an accident 20 years ago.

765
00:59:48,515 --> 00:59:49,650
Then what is it?

766
00:59:50,015 --> 00:59:53,020
Chul-yong planned the murders
and made them look like an accident.

767
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:55,920
What?

768
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:07,500
My mom just told me about everything.

769
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:11,770
So, Yu-jin's mother...

770
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:22,771
<font color="#fcc89b">Subtitles by iQIYI</font>
<font color="#8080ff">Ripped by RuoXi</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">Synced by 308Moune</font>

771
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,790
[ Eccentric! Chef Moon ]

772
01:01:10,065 --> 01:01:11,564
Are you hiding something from me?

773
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:14,064
Aren't you the one hiding everything?

774
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:16,174
[ I want to be with him. ]

775
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:18,904
[ It'd be nice if we could stay happy
together like this. ]

776
01:01:18,905 --> 01:01:20,674
[ Chef Moon is very teasing. ]

777
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:23,814
That's how he snatched up her.

778
01:01:23,815 --> 01:01:26,584
Are you hiding something from me?

779
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:29,614
[ Maybe he'll propose to you. ]

780
01:01:29,615 --> 01:01:32,880
Dad, I'm Bella. I'm not Hyun-a.

781
01:01:33,085 --> 01:01:34,354
I have a bad feeling about this.

782
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:36,294
Why did you do that? Why?

783
01:01:36,295 --> 01:01:37,724
[ I don't like being exposed to danger. ]

784
01:01:37,725 --> 01:01:39,390
[ It's not like he's not returning
for good. ]

785
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:41,030
I'll be back soon.

786
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:42,930
Okay.

787
01:01:43,165 --> 01:01:45,860
[ Whoever you're waiting for isn't coming. ]
