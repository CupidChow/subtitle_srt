2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,995
Byeol-na!

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,369
- Seung-mo!
- Chef Moon!

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,439
Chef Moon!

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,709
- Dad! No!
- No, Seol-ah.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,775
- No, you can't go in there.
- Dad!

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,395
Byeol-na!

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,245
Byeol-na. Wake up!

9
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,645
Byeol-na!

10
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,225
No!

11
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:25,765
What's going to happen to my dad?

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,335
What if he dies in the fire
just like my grandparents did?

13
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,775
No, Seol-ah.

14
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,775
I'm sure your dad is going to be okay.

15
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,484
When isn't the fire department here
already? Are you sure you called them?

16
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,885
They'll be here!

17
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,755
It hasn't been long since we called.
Be patient.

18
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,355
Anyway, we can't go in there to check.
What are we going to do?

19
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,954
Seung-mo!

20
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,395
- Come on. Stop it. Not you too.
- Goodness.

21
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,435
Do you want to die too?

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,335
That's Seung-mo!

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,379
- Seung-mo!
- Chef Moon!

24
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,305
- Chef Moon!
- Chef Moon!

25
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,575
- Chef Moon!
- Chef Moon!

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,145
- Chef Moon.
- The hospital.

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,085
What did you say?

28
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,215
- Get her to the hospital now.
- Okay.

29
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,729
- Right here!
- We're right here!

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,125
Right here!

31
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,958
(Episode 5)

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,345
You

33
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,955
didn't tell me

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,515
that Jang Sun-young is back.

35
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,955
If you want me to be on your side,

36
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,365
you

37
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,465
must not hide anything from me.

38
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:28,029
It's over.

39
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,024
<i>No Caller ID: It's over.</i>

40
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,435
It's all over now.

41
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,645
Now, I just need Hyun-ah to do her part.

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,965
<i>Who are you?</i>

43
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,605
<i>Ms. Bella!</i>

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,375
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

45
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,045
<i>- I didn't mean to...
- You killed me.</i>

46
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,145
<i>Did you kill me to become me?</i>

47
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,955
<i>Is that why you've been plagiarizing
my designs?</i>

48
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,829
<i>No.</i>

49
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,025
<i>Stop pretending to be kind or innocent.</i>

50
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,355
<i>Why don't you be true to yourself now?</i>

51
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,829
<i>You're a fraud and murderer.</i>

52
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,135
<i>No. That's not true!</i>

53
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,104
<i>You're a fraud...</i>

54
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,675
<i>- No. No, I'm not.
- and murderer.</i>

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,035
No!

56
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,105
Let go of me!

57
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,665
No!

58
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,285
<i>There are no major external injuries
except for chemical inhalation.</i>

59
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,685
<i>You got her out quickly. She got lucky.</i>

60
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,125
<i>If she had been there a little longer,
she might not have made it alive.</i>

61
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,329
<i>Let's get her admitted
and observe her for a few days.</i>

62
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,265
<i>Okay.</i>

63
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,899
<i>- Okay.
- Thank you.</i>

64
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,995
<i>Thank you.</i>

65
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,635
<i>This is all thanks to you, Chef Moon.
Well done.</i>

66
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,709
<i>Come on. What did you just do?</i>

67
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,175
<i>What? I didn't do anything.</i>

68
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,475
<i>- Are you hurt?
- No.</i>

69
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,145
<i>- Hey!
- My gosh.</i>

70
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,389
<i>Goodness, Chef Moon. You're the one
who should be in the hospital.</i>

71
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,859
<i>- How did you put up with the pain?
- Doctor!</i>

72
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,925
<i>I'm fine. Go back home with Seol-ah.</i>

73
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,795
<i>- I'll keep an eye on her.
- My gosh, you.</i>

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,065
<i>Okay. I'll bring you some clothes.</i>

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,495
<i>Let's go, Seol-ah.</i>

76
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,165
<i>Dad, you must keep her safe
no matter what.</i>

77
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,939
<i>- Okay.
- We should go too.</i>

78
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,209
<i>Yes. Make sure
you get your injury treated.</i>

79
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,609
<i>Okay. Thank you. Bye.</i>

80
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,979
<i>Okay. Hey, let's go.</i>

81
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,115
<i>Officer Jo.</i>

82
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,685
<i>Can we talk?</i>

83
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,585
<i>Can you look into who this did to her
and why they tried to harm her?</i>

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,335
<i>I will.</i>

85
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,745
Everything will be okay now.

86
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,415
Byeol-na.

87
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,665
You're up.

88
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,235
Where...

89
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,104
You're at a hospital.

90
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,908
What on earth happened
to you yesterday?

91
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,575
Why did you go there?

92
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,315
By the way,
is there anything you remember?

93
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,685
A black van approached me,

94
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,189
asking for directions,
so I went up to them.

95
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,315
<i>Where?</i>

96
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,625
Then I was pulled into the van.

97
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,325
<i>Stay still!</i>

98
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,525
I can't remember anything from there.

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,569
I don't know.

100
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,495
I can't remember anything.

101
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,239
- I can't remember anything!
- It's okay, Byeol-na.

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,805
- No!
- Byeol-na!

103
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,505
- Byeol-na!
- I can't remember anything!

104
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,805
Are you all right?

105
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,645
She needs some rest.
Do you mind stepping out?

106
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,949
- Not at all.
- Take a big breath.

107
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,745
One, two.

108
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,755
Just breathe slowly. Are you all right?

109
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,355
Yes, Officer Jo.

110
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,495
The kidnappers have been caught?

111
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,349
Yes,

112
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,815
did you get home safely last night?

113
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,415
It's nothing.

114
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,459
I was just wondering
if you got in contact

115
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,659
with Moon Seung-mo yesterday.

116
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,395
<i>No, why?</i>

117
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,225
Something bad happened there

118
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,539
yesterday.

119
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,065
Something bad?

120
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,565
That's too bad.

121
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,949
By any chance, does what you do

122
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,705
have anything to do with him?

123
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,775
Mr. Park,

124
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,475
so what if I do?

125
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,515
- Sorry?
- Aren't we on the same side?

126
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,189
We talked about it yesterday.

127
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,729
Sir. Well...

128
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,525
You know that nothing comes for free.

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,525
<i>Please take care of things for me.</i>

130
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,525
<i>And also,</i>

131
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,795
let's not talk for a while.

132
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,935
<i>You know what I mean, right?</i>

133
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,205
Hello? Mr. Jin.

134
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,975
It's him.

135
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,645
That's him?

136
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,155
He turned himself in,
saying that he set the school on fire.

137
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,689
What about the kidnapping part?

138
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,529
Did this old man also kidnap Byeol-na?

139
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,829
No, he's homeless.

140
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,799
He says he made a fire
because it was getting too cold.

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,795
He keeps saying that he had no idea
that there was someone inside.

142
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,599
Then what about the car?
Did you look into that?

143
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,439
We did find the black van,

144
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,535
but it was dumped on the highway
and the guys ran away.

145
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,105
Didn't you find anything inside?

146
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,479
Let me see it for myself, please!

147
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,075
What's with all the noise?

148
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,219
Who are you?

149
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,649
This is Mr. Moon Seung-mo,

150
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,889
the man who saved Byeol-na.

151
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,059
I see. Goodness,

152
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,789
you're a hero.

153
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,889
Chief is wanting

154
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,129
to award you the Brave Citizen Award.

155
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,329
- Congratulations.
- I don't need that.

156
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,665
What about the kidnappers?

157
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,325
Have you found them?

158
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,395
Kidnapping? What kidnapping?

159
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,965
Byeol-na told me that she was kidnapped

160
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,365
in a black van
and got dragged to the school.

161
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,679
You said you found the van!

162
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,179
It's the black van
deserted on Highway 59.

163
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,505
The unregistered van, you know.

164
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,619
- That one?
- Yes.

165
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,645
What does that have anything to do
with kidnapping?

166
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,689
You're jumping to conclusions here.

167
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,659
There has never been such a case
in this district before.

168
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,189
If it's not kidnapping,

169
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,855
how did Byeol-na end up in a deserted
school on her way to the market?

170
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,565
We're going all "CSI" on this.

171
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,765
Do you think you're in a drama?

172
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,499
And how can we trust what she's saying?

173
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,569
She's out of her mind.

174
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,275
- What did you just say?
- Stop here.

175
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,209
I don't know
what else we'd be able to find,

176
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,145
but we'll look into it and contact you
when we find something.

177
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,575
Take him back.

178
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,319
- Yes.
- Seriously...

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,789
Let's head out first.

180
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,115
- That man...
- Come on.

181
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,005
Dad.

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,485
Hyun-ah.

183
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,885
This is a very important time for us.

184
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,485
What do you think you're doing?

185
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,955
Dad,

186
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,125
I don't think I can keep doing this.

187
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,125
What do you mean?

188
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,235
Living as Bella

189
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,505
is too painful to live.

190
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,165
Get it together!

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,705
We've already crossed the river.

192
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,215
Have you forgotten all the things
I've done for you?

193
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,945
Please, Dad.

194
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,885
I'm not Bella.

195
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,555
Please.

196
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,395
Hyun-ah, you wanted to be like Bella.

197
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,965
That's why I did all of this.

198
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,265
Dad, I...

199
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,405
For the past 30 years,

200
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,975
I've done my best to
serve Chairman Han,

201
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,715
because I wanted to be one of them.

202
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,289
So I endured all sorts of
degrading moments,

203
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,945
trying my best.

204
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,585
But he's still only using me.

205
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,825
You know

206
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,355
what I learned from that?

207
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,165
You have to take what you want

208
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,065
from others.

209
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,635
There's nothing wrong with that.

210
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,165
That's how the world works.

211
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,475
Understood?

212
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,219
Change up Hyun-ah's security guards
to those guys.

213
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,515
Have them guard her 24 hours a day.

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,995
<i>Yoo Byeol-na</i>

215
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,739
Here!

216
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,735
Seol-ah, wait for us!

217
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,639
Unni!

218
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,875
Seol-ah.

219
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,019
Byeol-na! Here!

220
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,049
Are you all right?

221
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,189
- Hello.
- Are you okay? What happened?

222
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,615
My goodness.

223
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,985
♪ Look how beautiful it is ♪

224
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,929
Is this really the right time
to be humming?

225
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,929
The flowers are just so pretty.

226
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,559
Can we leave flowers
in the hospital room?

227
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,929
I don't think it's allowed anymore.

228
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,155
What are you talking about?

229
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,899
Who visits the hospital without
flowers? What do you think?

230
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,539
You're right.
The flowers brighten up the room.

231
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,609
Byeol-na, what do you think?

232
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,905
Ta-da!

233
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,205
They're beautiful.

234
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,039
See? She likes them.

235
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,145
Fine.

236
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,115
It's a dangerous world out there.

237
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,349
How dare someone just kidnapped you
in broad daylight?

238
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,589
Exactly. You could've died.

239
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,755
It's a relief that you're fine.
You were so lucky.

240
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,225
That's right.

241
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,525
As long as you came out of
the fire pit alive and in one piece.

242
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,329
It wasn't just any fire.

243
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,799
- The entire building was on fire.
- Really?

244
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,495
It wasn't the whole building.

245
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,839
That's what it felt like.

246
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,239
I'm just saying. We couldn't go inside,

247
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,479
just not knowing what to do,

248
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,719
but Seung-mo jumped right inside.

249
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,615
Then what happened?

250
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,059
♪ And I will ♪

251
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,889

252
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,699
He flew out of the fire
with Byeol-na in his arms.

253
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,669
- And?
- It was amazing,

254
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,599
even in the eyes of men like myself!

255
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,399
That's right! Dad was awesome!

256
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,539
- Right?
- He's awesome, indeed.

257
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,305
I think I'm falling in love with him
just hearing this story.

258
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,605
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,145
That's not what's important.

260
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,649
His back is burnt from the fire.

261
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,958
- That's right.
- Burnt? His back?

262
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,229
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

263
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,759
Dad!

264
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,829
- Chef Moon!
- Are you all right?

265
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,569
It's just a very light burn.

266
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,129
My goodness.

267
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,639
I told you
to just bring her stuff here quietly.

268
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,899
How can I do that?

269
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,739
It's better if the whole village is
looking out for her. Isn't that right?

270
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,975
- That's right. We're family here.
- Have one.

271
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,805
Mr. Moon, please come
to the treatment room for your burn.

272
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,645
Oh, no. Is it serious?

273
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,935
That must hurt a lot.

274
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,235
Chef Moon has a nice body.

275
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,469
It's impressive.

276
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,405
Gosh, that stings. It must sting a lot.

277
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,809
- Oh, no. Goodness!
- Gosh!

278
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,909
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

279
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,815
- What are you guys doing there?
- Move. No, no.

280
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,649
- Leave now!
- I'm sorry.

281
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,585
- Go!
- I'm sorry.

282
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,389
Which course would you like today?

283
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,825
My skin feels chapped.
It must be because it's winter now.

284
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,065
Okay. I understand.
Please come with me.

285
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,779
I must have forgotten my bag.

286
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,915
- Why don't I go get it for you?
- No, I'll get it myself.

287
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,959
I should sell Donghan Food's stocks.

288
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,629
- Why?
- Their oldest son came back

289
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,095
and is doing whatever he likes
with the company.

290
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,625
They're lucky
that they only have one son.

291
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,895
It's quite a mess at our company because
my children are fighting each other.

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,569
No, he's not the only child.
They have two children.

293
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,535
Don't you remember Mr. Lim's daughter?

294
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,909
I heard he hid her somewhere because
she has some kind of mental illness.

295
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,875
What are you talking about?
They have three children.

296
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,019
- What?
- You must have forgotten

297
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,119
since it's ancient history.

298
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,049
The late Kang Min-suk
had a daughter out of wedlock.

299
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,019
She's probably old enough
to be an adult now.

300
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,385
Right. That's right.
The illegitimate child.

301
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,325
I wonder what she's doing these days.

302
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,295
I wonder about that too.

303
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,525
I'm very curious

304
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,265
about what she's up to now.

305
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,705
If you hear about her,
you should let me know too.

306
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,515
Did everyone leave?

307
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,415
You told them to.

308
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,125
By the way,

309
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,265
- are you okay?
- This is nothing.

310
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,165
Anyway, how did you
know where to find me?

311
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,105
Goodness.

312
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,705
This.

313
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,245
You're so sloppy.
You dropped this on the street.

314
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,015
Take it now.

315
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,805
How sloppy.

316
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,335
Officer Jo, any leads yet?

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,809
That's not why I called.

318
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,309
Reporters are going over there
to get an interview from Byeol-na.

319
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,475
- An interview?
- What should we do?

320
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,719
If this gets published in the
newspaper, they might come back.

321
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,015
Darn it.

322
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,525
- Did something happen?
- No, it's fine.

323
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,189
Try not to move for a second.

324
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,285
What?

325
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,702
♫ <i>When I'm looking into</i> ♫

330
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,865
Is anyone inside?

331
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,665
My gosh.

332
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,799
There's no story here. Let's go.

333
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,805
What? What are you talking about?

334
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,945
Can't you see? She has a flower
tucked behind her ear.

335
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,975
She really is crazy. Let's go.

336
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,549
Then, how are you going
to write that article?

337
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,485
There's no point. I'm sure the director
is going to kill the story.

338
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,889
Why would I waste my energy?

339
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,685
My gosh, the officer was right.

340
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,305
Take that out now.

341
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,335
No. What are you doing? I like it.

342
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,705
Suit yourself.

343
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,805
My gosh, he's so fickle.

344
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,525
Donghan Food's main project
is the old restaurant project.

345
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,899
It's one of our major businesses
as over 100 branches have opened up

346
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,625
in the metropolitan area
and major cities.

347
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,469
I believe the hard work
and effort of the executives

348
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,805
who were in charge of this project
made this all possible.

349
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,335
But you didn't devise any plan
for the illegal activity,

350
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,475
executed by the Menu Development Team.

351
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,545
As I made it clear a while ago,

352
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,215
I will not allow our
business to flourish

353
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,085
on such illegal grounds.

354
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,525
All right. Everyone,
get hands off the computers.

355
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,329
- Confiscate them.
- What?

356
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,565
- What are you doing?
- Go ahead.

357
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,169
- What are you doing?
- Hold on.

358
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,239
- You can't touch that.
- Hands off the computer.

359
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,035
It is truly unfortunate, but for
the sake of the company's future,

360
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,679
I am going to make a decision.

361
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,115
<i>Announcement of Transfer</i>

362
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,545
<i>I'd like to show my gratitude</i>

363
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,915
<i>to Junior Managing Director Jung
and directors who were in charge</i>

364
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,285
<i>of the old restaurant project.</i>

365
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,395
<i>But sadly, they must empty their seats,
so I can lead the company</i>

366
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,899
<i>with honest and upstanding projects.</i>

367
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,165
<i>Director Choi Gun-woo</i>

368
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,405
Hello, sir.

369
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,615
Let's go inside.

370
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,555
Is this the first decision you want
to make after your instatement?

371
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,365
Throwing out the employees
who have been showing good results

372
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,565
and replacing them with your people?

373
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,995
No.

374
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,105
It is true that their project
has been making profits for now.

375
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,375
They had been leading the business
by using improper means.

376
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,949
I believe that it'll be a risk
to the company in the long run,

377
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,605
which is why I made
a difficult decision.

378
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,945
Mr. Kang.

379
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,515
What risk?

380
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,819
The biggest risk here is the fact
that you're trying to fire people

381
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,155
who have dedicated
their lives to Donghan.

382
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,725
Chairman Han,
the executives are not immoral.

383
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,369
Although we violated some laws,

384
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,195
it was all for Donghan and was trivial.

385
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,165
That's your management principle,
isn't it?

386
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,475
You'll do anything for results.

387
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,875
What's wrong with that?

388
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,145
I can do anything for Donghan.

389
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,465
I can tell that you two
both love Donghan.

390
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,435
Give it a try.

391
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,735
Give it a try your way.

392
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,649
But you'll have to be responsible

393
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,775
for the actions you're taking.

394
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,415
Yes.

395
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,315
Sounds good?

396
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,255
Yes, sir.

397
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,025
You two can stop now.

398
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,155
What was Bella like?

399
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,055
What?

400
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,655
I thought I knew all about her,

401
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,855
but I want to know more.

402
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,425
Who did Bella take from?

403
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,905
I was taught that you have to take
what you want from someone.

404
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,805
What are you saying?

405
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,375
Don't talk nonsense. Just do your job.

406
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,045
Sorry,

407
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,145
I guess I was kind of
not in the right mind

408
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,885
since this is my first big project.

409
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,765
Don't you ever get so delusional.

410
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,465
Lim Hyun-ah, this isn't your project.

411
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,535
This is Bella's.

412
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,979
<i>Nonyang General Hospital</i>

413
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,075
<i>A week passes by so quickly.</i>

414
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,049
Is everything good?

415
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,249
<i>All good.</i>

416
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,019
Isn't staying there uncomfortable?

417
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,689
It's not bad. How's Seol-ah?

418
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,855
She's beside me right now.

419
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,089
Dad! How's Byeol-na doing?

420
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,699
<i>I've been reviewing</i>

421
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,029
<i>what Byeol-na taught me!</i>

422
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,129
<i>Seol-ah!</i>

423
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,299
<i>Don't snatch the phone away
when adults are talking.</i>

424
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,769
She's coming out tomorrow, right?

425
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,039
Should we go pick you guys up?

426
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,269
No, I'll take her.

427
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,709
Just have the house clean.

428
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,449
I'm always cleaning.

429
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,419
Dad, Uncle Da-hoon
hasn't been cleaning!

430
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,379
The house is a mess.

431
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,949
<i>You keep making messes everywhere!</i>

432
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,589
<i>No, Uncle Da-hoon did it!</i>

433
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,089
<i>- It was you!
- No, he was the one!</i>

434
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,319
- It was you!
- No, it was you!

435
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,489
Bye now.

436
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,325
Hello?

437
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,255
What was that?

438
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,835
Where did she go?

439
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,405
Gosh.

440
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,225
What are you doing?
Are you applying cream on your burn?

441
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,589
I'll help you.

442
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,729
I can do it.

443
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,599
Give it to me, I'll do it for you.

444
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,195
I'm really fine.

445
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,899
Take your shirt off.

446
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,035
What?

447
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,895
What's there to be
so embarrassed about?

448
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,505
What are you doing now? Hurry.

449
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,145
Come on.

450
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,955
You must've been in pain.

451
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,425
When I go into the kitchen to cook,

452
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,295
there are a lot of
dangers waiting for me.

453
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,195
There are knives, fire,

454
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,795
hot water, hot oil, and more.

455
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,235
If I zone out for even just a moment,
I'd get hurt.

456
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,545
People think

457
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,849
that one becomes a good chef

458
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,445
with some special
sense of smell or taste.

459
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,915
But that's not it.

460
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,685
Until you find your own dish,

461
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,225
you're in that danger,

462
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,059
getting injured, burnt,

463
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,255
and cut.

464
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,965
That's why you become patient.

465
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,195
Or else, you can't be a chef.

466
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,835
You're acting all tough.

467
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,035
Why go through so much pain?

468
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,345
Because I love it.

469
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,215
Because I love what I do.

470
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,895
That hurts!

471
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,969
I told you that I'd do it!

472
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,999
You should be thanking me!

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,765
Did I ask you to help me?

474
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,479
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

475
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,709
No!

476
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,305
Why are you whining when I helped you?

477
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,345
Whatever. I won't help you again.

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,059
Yes, he's one of the most
renowned chefs in and out of Korea.

481
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,455
And he's perfect
for our premium Korean food project.

482
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,165
Is something bothering you?

<i>This is Bella's.</i>

490
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,715
<i>I can see it clearly</i>

491
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,485
<i>now that I've looked into them.</i>

492
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,115
<i>They're not original.</i>

493
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,585
<i>They're plagiarized.</i>

494
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,595
<i>They say plagiarism
is a talent as well.</i>

495
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,525
<i>I guess they're not
completely worthless.</i>

496
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,085
<i>Are you mentally unstable?</i>

497
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,654
<i>I have a friend who's a doctor</i>

<i>and he can be of help.</i>

499
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,835
You'll feel well after
you get some sleep.

500
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,645
Good night.

501
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,455
Hyung...

502
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,665
We'll be framed as murderers
if we get caught, won't we?

503
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,464
What are you talking about?

504
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,365
We won't get caught.

505
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,535
You start working next week, right?

506
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,505
Yes, sir. Thank you for your concern.

507
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,345
I'll work harder.

508
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,685
I've almost finished
studying the company.

509
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,185
How much have you found out
about the collaboration with Bella?

510
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,185
I found out that we will have to build
more lines at our existing factories

511
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,095
in order to secure the supply increase
due to the collaboration,

512
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,265
and that we need to prepare
in case there is a shortage.

513
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,195
That's not enough.

514
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,839
We need to build more factories,

515
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,135
and we need more warehouses
to prepare for traffic.

516
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,775
Sir...

517
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,815
I think it may be too much, considering
it's a one-time collaboration.

518
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,175
Why don't you consider a subcontractor?

519
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,815
Who says a collaboration with Bella
will end as a one-time deal?

520
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,355
Sorry?

521
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,399
- This is...
- It's the whole district of Nonyang.

522
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,765
That's where the new warehouse
will be built.

523
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,765
Why Nonyang, sir?

524
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,685
What are you thinking about?

525
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,855
Here.

526
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,765
Just...

527
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,835
I was wondering who I really am.

528
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,075
"Was I really a beggar
who stole someone's money?"

529
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,545
"Why was I at that school?"

530
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,745
Just those things.

531
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,555
Why are you acting all serious?
It doesn't suit you.

532
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,725
Who could have wanted to kill me?

533
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,165
What if they try again?

534
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,095
Why? Do you want to
be the damsel in distress?

535
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,535
When you get your memory back,

536
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,835
it might turn out to be nothing.

537
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,775
If they come back,
I'll just save you again.

538
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,425
I can't wait to go home
and eat your food.

539
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,605

Da-hoon!

562
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,555
Where is he?

563
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,325
- Where did they go?
- Wait.

564
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,799
I know where Painter is.

565
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,935
Where is he?

566
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,545
Welcome...

567
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,649
Gosh, look who's here!

568
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,389
It's Chef Moon and Byeol-na.

569
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,215
Are you back from the hospital?
Are you all better now?

570
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,185
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,889
Seung-mo.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

572
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,555
I wanted to welcome you back at home.

573
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,195
Gosh, you're making me worried
with your painting.

574
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,665
What do you mean?

575
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,105
You always got scammed
whenever you painted for a woman.

576
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,009
You lost your academy because...

577
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,239
No! It's not that this time!

578
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,609
Gosh, you surprised me.

579
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,275
What are you guys talking about?

580
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,915
Nothing, ma'am.

581
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,415
We met last time, didn't we?
I heard a lot about you from my mom.

582
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,925
I'm...

583
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,785
Gong Da-mi.

584
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,755
Hyo-sook.

585
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,295
She's my daughter, Gong Hyo-sook.
Da-mi, my foot.

586
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,469
Are you still doing that?

587
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,869
I paid the naming center 100 dollars
for that name.

588
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,579
Why do you keep calling yourself Da-mi?

589
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,175
Mom! I paid you back that 100 dollars.

590
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,279
- Hyo-sook?
- I said it's Da-mi.

591
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,945
I'm going to change my name.
To Gong Da-mi.

592
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,049
She ran away to Seoul
with all my money,

593
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,455
saying she's going to take
modeling classes or something,

594
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,025
but she lost everything
and came back penniless.

595
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,699
Why would you say that to them?
You're embarrassing me.

596
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,629
Gosh, so you know that
you should be embarrassed?

597
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,595
But too bad. It's for a fact.

598
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,435
I'm going to make you pay for
everything, including interest.

599
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,005
Gosh, I'm leaving.

600
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,109
Hyo-sook!

601
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,845
I mean, Da-mi!

602
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,515
Where are they going?
They should be working!

603
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,585
Ms. Byung-chun, have you seen Seol-ah?

604
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,055
Seol-ah?

605
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,685
Bong-doo said
he was taking her to the market.

606
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,025
♪ Hey ♪

607
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,495
♪ What's wrong with my age? ♪

608
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,965
♪ There's no age in love ♪

609
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,905
Since I bought you snacks,

610
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,705
you have to learn Chinese from me
starting tomorrow.

611
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,175
- You promised, right?
- Sure. Okay.

612
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,155
Isn't that Yoon-ja?

613
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,165
Gosh, Chef Moon! Byeol-na.
Are you all better?

614
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,365
Yes, sir. But where's Seol-ah?

615
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,535
I met Yoon-ja on the way,

616
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,979
and she said that Seol-ah was too messy
and that she would bathe her,

617
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,775
so I dropped her off there.

618
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,045
- At Yoon-ja's place?
- Yes.

619
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,855
When will you be all grown up?

620
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,155
If you keep making a mess like this,

621
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,125
your dad will make a fuss about it.

622
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,365
Gosh, you...

623
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,539
Hurry up and take your shirt off.

624
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,509
- Am I that messy?
- Come on.

625
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,905
When did that happen?
That's so strange.

626
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,645
You must have a hole in your chin.

627
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,575
Or maybe

628
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,945
you can't see well
because your eyes are bad!

629
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,285
I'm ticklish!

630
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,525
You should come to the
bathhouse with me in the afternoon.

631
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,265
That's what you have to do in winter.

632
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,999
I'm bribing you with my kiss.

633
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,939
You smart girl.

634
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,405
Very smart!

635
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,149
How are you?

636
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,675
I'm not fine.

637
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,215
What time is it?

638
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,889
I told you not to be late.

639
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,259
Yoon-ja was nagging me to bathe.

640
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,559
You bathed at Yoon-ja's place?

641
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,259
No wonder you're sparkling
even more today.

642
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,395
Good job. Let's get studying now.

643
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,329
I don't know what Bong-doo fed her,

644
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,935
but she was a mess, so I washed her up
before sending her out.

645
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,569
I think she said that she was heading
to the village hall.

646
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,139
Is that right?

647
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,375
She had yummy food without me?

648
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,609
Who am I?

649
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,319
I'm the head of
the women's society and the village.

650
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,719
So, Seol-ah,

651
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,289
you're under two groups
that I'm in charge of.

652
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,185
Then is it okay that you can't read?

653
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,959
People are going to criticize me,

654
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,089
saying I didn't take good care
of the village.

655
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,199
Is that okay or not?

656
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,929
- It's not okay.
- That's right.

657
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,835
That's why you need to focus and learn
how to read. Understood?

658
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,799
- Yes!
- Now,

659
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,769
I taught you how to read

660
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,869
the consonants.

661
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,779
I'm going to check if you remember.

662
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,809
Let's see if you remember. What's this?

663
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,809
- K!
- Good. What about this one?

664
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,679
- N!
- Good. What about this?

665
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,119
- T?
- Perfect!

666
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,149
What's this, on top of the ribbon?

667
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,149
- R?
- You're a genius!

668
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,789
- What about this?
- B.

669
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,925
Correct. What about this one?

670
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,529
- S!
- You're doing great.

671
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,895
What's this?

672
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,329
- W?
- That's right.

673
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,169
- What about this?
- J.

674
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,595
You're doing excellent.
This one is going to be hard.

675
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,605
I was so frustrated because
I'm so busy taking care of myself

676
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,775
and I wondered

677
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,815
why Seol-ah had to come into my life.

678
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,015
That's why I got mad.

679
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,645
But...

680
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,455
I didn't do anything.

681
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,395
It wasn't me who has been
taking care of Seol-ah.

682
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,165
It was the village people all along.

683
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,335
The entire village
has been raising her.

684
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,205
You're thankful, aren't you?

685
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,205
Then why don't you do something
to express your gratitude?

686
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,845
Do what?

687
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,349
Well... Whatever

688
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,049
you do the best.

689
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,545

- Come quickly.

00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,335
Of course! They've

759
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,409
She's so excited.

760
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,149
I have to make a call
to my honey as well.

761
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,449
He's throwing a party?

762

That's so extra of him.

763
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,315
Chef Moon likes to make a ruckus,
doesn't he?

764
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,129
Yes. I was heading home anyway.

765
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,825
Wait for me.

766
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,099
- Sir.
- Yes? What's up?

767
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,765
The county chief is looking for you.

768
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,199
Why would he be looking for me?

769
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,735
I don't know. Just go to his office.

773
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,989
Hello, I'm Hwang Jang-dan.

774
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,385
Hello.

775
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,525
- Come this way.
- Okay.

776
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,659
Greet them.

777
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,665
They're guests from Seoul.

778
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,199
You know Donghan Group, right?

779
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,499
That's where they're from.

780
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,705
Yes, sir.

781
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,009
Jang-dan, you're living
in Seoha Village, right?

782
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,809
Yes, sir.

783
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,815
Then you've got a lot of work to do
from now on.

It's good!

787
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,535
Oh, meat.

788
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,915
It's good, Chef Moon!

789
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,625
- There's so much food.
- I know.

790
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,665
- There's more coming.
- Gosh.

791
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,565
- Goodness!
- Oh, gosh.

792
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,879
Goodness.

793
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,109
It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it.

794
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,345
What do you mean? There's so much food.

795
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:42,945
Gosh, by the looks of it,
I guess you're feeling all better.

796
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,089
You rude thing.

797
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,129
How can you eat like that
when the elderly haven't started yet?

798
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,659
I know. She might finish everything.

799
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,625
- Hurry up and eat.
- Yes.

800
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,369
Go on.

801
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,625
I prepared a lot, so please don't rush.

802
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,165
I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself
properly until now.

803
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,009
I was a chef in Seoul.

804
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,435
We know that, of course.

805
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,279
Your mother used to brag about you
all the time.

806
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,919
She said you were our country's
world-class chef.

807
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,875
A world-class chef! Give him a hand!

808
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,019
Look at him being shy.

809
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,549
What's this party for, though?

810
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:20,355
Chef Moon is thanking you for looking
after Seol-ah while we were away.

811
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,495
What? Then this is
all thanks to Seol-ah?

812
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,369
Gosh, this little thing
must be a lucky charm.

813
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,639
She's feeding us all this good food.

814
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,965
What are you all doing?

815
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,769
Why aren't you thanking her already?

816
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,275
- Yes, we should do that.
- Seol-ah, my lady.

817
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,009
Thank you for the food.

818
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,749
- Thank you very much, Seol-ah.
- Thank you.

819
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,149
It's no problem. Just eat up.

820
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,119
Gosh, look at you.

821
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:50,815
Anyway, look at all this.

822
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,489
I guess Chef Moon really is a chef,
after all.

823
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,429
I bet customers would rush in

824
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:59,859
from all over the country
if he opened a restaurant.

825
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,625
I'm a bit of an expert with food,

826
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,765
and his skills are too good to
be wasted in this tiny little village.

827
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,899
Yes, he's right.

828
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,365
Look at all this.
This isn't anything ordinary.

829
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,779
Eat up...

830
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:17,149
Gosh, Byeol-na. Slow down.
You're going to choke to death.

831
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,179
Goodness. Seriously.

832
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,515
Seung-mo!

833
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,045
Seung-mo!

834
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,959
What's that?

835
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,789
Ms. Pi told me to bring this over
from the village hall.

836
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,925
Gosh.

837
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,299
It's the karaoke machine.

838
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,499
We can't just sit around
and eat like animals.

839
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,865
We need to sing and digest the food.

840
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,899
Am I right?

841
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,669
- Cheers.
- Let's all have a drink.

842
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,509
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

843
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,105
- Cheers!
- Gosh.

844
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,849
All right. Thank you for your patience.

845
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,979
Now,

846
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:58,459
we will begin the party
you've all been waiting for!

847
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,989
- Hooray!
- Yes.

848
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:06,495
The first performance will be from
our village mascot, the cutie pie...

849
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,095
Please sit down, ma'am.

850

- Gosh, Seol-ah!

852
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,979
- That's my girl!
- Seol-ah, what number will it be?

853
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,779
- I don't need any music.
- What? No music?

854
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,219
Gosh, that little thing
has some nerves.

I'm going to sing my favorite song,
"Amor Fati".

878
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,835
- Not that song again!
- Not that song!

879
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,309
- I want to go first.
- What?

880
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,179
"You, Clouds, Rain" by Heize.

881
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,219
- Yes, you go next, Hyo-sook.
- All right, come on out.

882
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,649
Sing a pretty song for us.

883
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,119
Good job, Hyo-sook.

884
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,049
Your daughter is so pretty.

885
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,815
- She is, isn't she?
- Yes.

886
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,585
We're in trouble.

887
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:43,455
This is not the time for a party!

888
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,155
What's going on?

889
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,565
They're going to tear down
our whole village!

890
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,399
- What?
- What are you talking about?

891
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,065
What do you mean, "tear down"?

892
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,209
They're going to
get rid of our village?

893
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,205
Honey, can't you make it simple for us?

894
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,045
Donghan Group made the difficult
decision to invest in Nonyang.

895
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,079
They've decided to build

896
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,685
a big factory and warehouse
in Seoha Village.

897
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,759
Nonyang Warehouse Construction Map

898
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,929
It's your village, so make sure
to get the consent of your neighbors

899
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,999
so we don't have to force anything.

900
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,765
This is all for our district.
You should do what you can, don't you?

901
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,225
Yes, sir.

902
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:26,639
So all the houses in our village,

903
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,639
starting from the mountain back there,
will be torn down!

904
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,675
"Torn down"? What is he talking about?

905
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,349
Who would build a factory?

906
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,549
You know, Donghan!

907
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,479
The big company in Seoul!
Donghan Group!

908
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,655
- They're going to build a factory here!
- Donghan?

909
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,855
Donghan?

910
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,185
Donghan, you say?

915
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,429
<i>So you're saying,
they want to wipe out our village?</i>

916
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,029
<i>Here's to Donghan Group and Nonyang!</i>

917
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,399
<i>Mr. Lim! Mr. Lim!</i>

918
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,039
<i>Donghan Group is trying to
wipe out Seoha Village.</i>

919
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,865
<i>Are we just going to let that happen?</i>

920
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,335
<i>That's enough, all of you!</i>

921

922
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,975
<i>- He's the best.
- We have no hope.</i>

923
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,579
<i>Will an alternative plan work?</i>

924
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,319
<i>What's wrong, Chef Moon?
You look distracted.</i>

925
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,579
<i>What kind of fate is this?</i>

926
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,789
<i>I'm never letting them have their way.</i>

927
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,285
<i>I'll do my best to help.</i>

928
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,029
<i>What if Bella never comes back?</i>

929
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,259
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

930
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,625
<i>- Take care of it for me.
- What's this?</i>

931
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,795
