(Episode 1)

3
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,035
- Hi, Bella.
- Hey, Jang Madame.

4
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,645
"Madame Jang".
I told you to call me that.

5
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,039
How could you address me like that?

6
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,739
I'm not some waitress
from the countryside.

7
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,985
Jang Madame and Madame Jang
are the same thing.

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,709
Anyway, where are you now?

9
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,579
- Me? I'm at my studio.
- What?

10
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,949
Do you know what time it is?

11
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,309
Why are you still at your studio?

12
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,725
Oh, no!

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,489
Hey, if you miss your flight,

14
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,749
you're going to miss your world tour.

15
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,519
It takes over a day
for you to get here.

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,005
It's in Australia. Australia!

17
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,404
Okay. I got it. I was
just about to leave.

18
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,975
What about the
outfit for the finale?

19
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,929
Not yet. I'll finish it over there.

20
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,015
What?

21
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,909
How could you
not have finished it already?

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,769
Bella, are you trying
to make me lose it?

23
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,015
You do this every time...

Mom, I'm back! Give me some food!

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,215
Mom!

72
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,325
You brat.

73
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,849
That's how you greet
you mom after months?

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,795
My gosh. Mom,
you're still going strong.

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,117
You know what?

76
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:02,595
She started cooking this since
dawn because you're coming.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,235
Here.

78
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,105
Do you want some suyuk?

79
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,445
This is why my
cholesterol level is high.

80
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,975
That spoiled brat.

81
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,385
Just a few slices, then. A few slices!

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,225
You're leaving again?

83
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,195
Where to, this time?

84
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,735
Australia. There's a Korean food event
on the Gold Coast.

85
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,505
Hey, can you stop going abroad?

86
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,659
There's no space for another article.

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,205
- Don't hang it then.
- You little brat.

88
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,969
You visited all eight
provinces in Korea,

89
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,599
so you can learn about
traditional cuisine.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,685
Now, you're going abroad all the time!

91
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,209
It's about time that
we retire, you punk!

92
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,015
People live up to 100 years nowadays.
It's too early to retire.

93
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,425
No way. If you retire,
you'll age quickly.

94
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,525
Your beauty is still ever so striking.

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,325
My gosh, you and your words.

96
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,865
Seung-mo, actually,

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,259
there's a problem at our restaurant.

98
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,329
Come on.

99
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,005
I told you not to tell him that.
He's leaving for a big event.

100
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,199
Unbelievable.

101
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,769
I must tell him in person,
so this is the right time.

102
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,899
Goodness.

103
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,145
I'm not sure what
this is about, but stop.

104
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,679
I'll be there only
for a week this time.

105
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,015
Let's talk once I return.

106
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,725
Should we discuss it on a trip?

107
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,095
I'll handle all of your problems.

108
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,425
Really?

109
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,595
Hey, how about this for our trip?

110
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,365
- Doesn't this look great?
- What a cool place.

111
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,889
Where is this place?

112
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,129
She bought an old house

113
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,205
in her hometown, Nonyang.

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,629
If you take over the restaurant
and get married,

115
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,605
we'll move and live in that house.

116
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,799
We've been fixing up the place
on our days off.

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,039
Move down there after 20 years.
What's the rush?

118
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,885
20 years? You spoiled punk.

119
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,339
I can't let this be.

120
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,055
Before you go, let's settle on this.

121
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,055
Get married this year.

122
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,749
Or go and bring me a grandchild.

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,549
I'll raise the kid. Okay?

124
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,489
Write that up and sign it today.

125
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,665
Come on.

126
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,575
We didn't open the restaurant yet.

127
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,335
Hey, kid. Where're
your parents? Your mom?

128
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,315
What about your dad?

129
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,885
What?

130
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,649
So irresponsible!
How could this happen?

131
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,749
She's really not my kid!

132
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,359
As if! She says you're her dad!

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,959
Dad, that's not true!

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,135
My gosh, what are we going to do now?

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,459
All right, fine.
You irresponsible punk.

136
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,945
It's all right!

137
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,369
I could have totally taken her in.

138
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,209
Your mother is very
open-minded, you know?

139
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,015
What on earth are you saying?

140
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,685
Is that how I raised you?

141
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,549
How could you abandon
your wife and child?

142
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,879
She's not my child! She is not mine!

143
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,925
This is driving me crazy!

144
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,519
Hey, do you even know me?

145
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,225
Don't scare her like that.

146
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,365
Kid, what was your name again?

147
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,329
It's Seol-ah. Kim Seol-ah.

148
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,205
- Kim?
- Kim?

149
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,745
See? She's a Kim. She's not a Moon!

150
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,145
My grandpa told me!

151
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,969
He said that man was my dad.

152
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,915
He definitely told me
that man was my dad!

153
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,679
Oh, no. It's all right. Don't cry.

154
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,879
It's all right.

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,555
- Her grandpa must've raised her.
- Her grandpa?

156
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,795
When did you go to
Chungcheong Province?

157
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,125
Chungcheong Province?

158
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,135
Don't fall for that too, Dad.
Why would I go there?

159
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,189
I swear! She's not my kid.
You come here.

160
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,735
Hey, you'd better not lie about this.

161
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,405
Am I your dad?

162
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,615
My gosh.

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,355
I must go now to catch my flight.

164
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,325
Find her real parents before I return.

165
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,049
She's not mine. I'll be back, Mom.

166
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,059
- Hey, you!
- She's really not mine!

167
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,519
Where are you going?

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,505
- Hey. That...
- Seung-mo!

♫ <i>This emotion, this feeling</i> ♫

177
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,305
Thank you. Bye.

178
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,385
Hey.

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,649
It's ridiculous.
I can't do this anymore.

180
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,449
We go through all
this trouble every show.

181
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,579
Technology can help us in so many ways!

182
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,149
Why are you cooped up in your studio

183
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,019
and why do you fix everything by hand?

184
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,219
Working with my hands inspires me.

185
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,435
What choice do I have?

186
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,105
She's such a high-maintenance designer.

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,105
My goodness.

188
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,115
What? What is this?

189
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,679
You said inspirations
come to you there.

190
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,709
But why haven't you
finished this outfit?

191
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,549
Because you keep nagging me,

192
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,755
all of my inspirations ran away.

193
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,789
By the way, this is my last show

194
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,095
with that old geezer, Louis.

195
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,459
Is he coming to tomorrow's show?

196
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,765
You bet. It's the
last show of the tour.

197
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,499
Besides, he wants
to renew the contract.

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,129
That old geezer is stubborn.

199
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,729
I won't renew the
contract no matter what.

200
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,829
Don't fall for his tricks.

201
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,575
Okay, I got it. You're so picky.

202
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,515
Did you eat?

203
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,685
No.

204
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,485
Don't tell me you didn't eat anything.

205
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,549
Let's get you treated for anorexia.

206
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,559
You need more than water to survive.

207
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,795
It's not water.

208
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,959
It's goji juice. It's super healthy.

209
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,489
You'll die if you keep that up.

210
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,459
If you don't eat
solid food, you'll die.

211
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,805
People don't die that easily.

212
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,215
Where are you going? Finish the outfit.

213
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,869
I'll go out and get inspired.

214
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,509
Don't nag me. Just give me some time.

215
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,385
My gosh, Bella.

Come on, it's not your first time.

253
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,925
First, go after the head. Okay?

254
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,449
Strike it hard,

255
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,625
so it loses consciousness.

256
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,265

It'll flounder to live.

Listen up. Press on it

259
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,799
Go from the head to the body.

260
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,615
Slant your knife toward the body.

261
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,685
That's right. The heart.

262
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,885
Stabbing it in one go
is important. Okay?

263
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,125
No! Be careful!
The suitcase! Watch out!

264
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,555

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,850

266
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,780
Yes.

267
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm so sorry.

268
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,530
Excuse me?

269
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,795

270
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,275

She said she was okay.

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,710
<i>Police</i>

272
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,210
Leave everything on the
ground and get down now.

273
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,860
I know what it looks like
but I can explain.

274
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,840
Put the knife on the ground now.

275
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,700
Hey! I'm not a criminal! I don't
know what you think you are, man!

276
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,059
- Gosh. Hey.
- What's going on?

277
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,468
- Hey.
- Mr. Choi.

278
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,310
Do something!

279
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,720
What's going on?
He's a chef I invited from Korea.

280
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,410
- Is there any problem with him?
- Yes.

281
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,955
Mr. Choi.

282
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,979
She got the wrong idea about me.

283
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,285
- My gosh!
- Goodness. What should we do?

284
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey, that woman.

285
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,405
Mom.

286
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,645
Grandpa.

287
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,445
She's Korean?

288
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,280
It's an obvious misunderstanding.

289
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,225
He's not a threat to anybody.
I can confirm that.

290
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,650
Okay, so he's a chef.

291
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,160
I apologize for the misunderstanding.

292
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,980
I'll leave it with you.

293
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,370
- Okay.
- Thank you, bye.

294
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,999
This isn't funny.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,069
We have everything here
including the knives.

296
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,409
You always bring yours.

297
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,039
A perfect chance for
a misunderstanding.

298
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,825
You know that I need my knives to cook.

299
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,549
I brought things that
weren't on the list.

300
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,219
Bay salt from Sinan. Mushroom powder.

301
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,449
And dried vegetables.

302
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,889
Of course, I know what they are.

303
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,159
But people over here
don't know them.

304
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,465
Goodness.

305
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,069
He's having a blast

306
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,069
when his phone call
almost got me killed.

307
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,239
- Who is it?
- He's just a friend.

308
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,809
A pathetic man who
went to draw the ocean,

309
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,439
but he's only fishing.

310
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,915
He's an artist who makes me angry.

311
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,749
I cook Korean food, not Japanese.

312
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,585
Why did he ask me
about filleting a fish?

313
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,450
- How is she?
- She's malnourished.

314
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,999
What did she say?

315
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,945
She's just malnourished.

316
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,055
Malnourished?

317
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,249
I think she's staying here illegally.

318
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,855
Like a poor homeless on the street?

319
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,725
A poor homeless?

320
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,949
No way.

321
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,465
Look at her belongings.

322
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,195
I've seen a lot of people like her.

323
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,359
After studying abroad,
their standards are high.

324
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,529
But things aren't going well.

325
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,359
They can't return
because of their pride.

326
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,699
And when they start
doing drugs like her,

327
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,245
it's a fast track to this.

328
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,185
All right. We should get going now.

329
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,835
She's not answering her phone again.

330
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,435
How could she be so self-centered?

331
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,775
I've been calling her nonstop.

332
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,405
What?

333
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,515
Madame Jang

334
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,115
Come on.

335
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,785
Unbelievable.

336
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,919
- About that lady back there.
- What?

337
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,005
- The homeless lady.
- Yes.

338
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,805
Isn't she a bit too...

339
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,205
"A bit too"?

340
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,675
A bit too cautious about others?

341
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,275
Who does she think I am?
Do I look like that kind of person?

342
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,530
A little bit.

343
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,645
I'm kidding.

344
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,739
Anyway, since I helped you out today,

345
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,585
you need to help me
when I'm back in Seoul.

346
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,755
Of course. But are you coming back?

347

00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,260
<i>is unfortunately terminated.</i>

520
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>All attention is focused
on Bella's future.</i>

521
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,810
<i>(A war is raging in
the fashion industry.)</i>

522
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,855
Designer brands are fighting
to work with Bella.

523
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,760
<i>Who will have Bella joined next?
And what will she...</i>

524
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,925
All interest is on her next move.

525
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,589
Honey!

526
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,659
Come here!

527
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,735
Okay!

528
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,759
What is it?

529
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,499
You let Seung-mo take this again,
didn't you?

530
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,269
Just a tiny little bit.

531
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,399
Tiny, my foot! It's almost empty!

532
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,869
Gosh, what am I going to do with you?

533
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,079
It's not like I let him
take the whole pot.

534
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,739
We can just make some more.

535
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,085
And will you be doing that?
I'm going to have to make it.

536
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,665
Anyway, what are we
going to do with her?

537
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,965
Seung-mo insisted she's not his.

538
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,595
It has to be true, right?

539
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,275
We'll find out when he gets back
and checks properly.

540
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,175
What do you mean, "check properly"?

541
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,305
Like a paternity test?

542
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,685
- Welcome!
- I guess we have customers.

543
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,709
We're here to inspect the power.
Where is your switchboard?

544
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,579
- Gosh, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

545
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,079
If you go to the back,

546
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,609
there's a switchboard by the window.

547
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,755
All right.

548
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,395
It must be a fuss to go around
and check them all.

549
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,265
This building is old,
so you should have it checked often.

550
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,329
By the way, would you like some tea?

551
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,729
We need to get going, anyway.

552
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,475
No, it will only be a minute.

553
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,195
Thank you for trusting me
with the core of the group,

554
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,065
International.

555
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,975
Sit down.

556
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,475
If you're going to thank anyone,
it should be your wife.

557
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,185
Are you okay with it, honey?

558
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,585
I like watching operas

559
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,685
in the classy VIP seats.

560
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,665
Sir, I think that the vacancy

561
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,259
for the head of Donghan Food
should be given to...

562
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,135
He should be arriving anytime soon.

563
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,875
There you are.

564
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,075
Jun-su?
You didn't tell us you'd be coming.

565
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,585
I didn't call you on purpose
so that I can surprise you.

566
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,239
Let's see.
You've become even younger, mother.

567
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,509
You're as beautiful as ever.

568
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,495
Is that how you're going to pay
for upsetting me?

569
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,665
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

570
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,619
It's good to see you, Jun-su.
You should've given us a call.

571
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,595
We would've gone to pick you up
at the airport.

572
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,705
Have you been well, Mr. Lim?

573
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,675
Come on, now. Let's sit down.

574
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,255
We should stop the chit-chat.

575
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,485
About Donghan food.

576
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,195
I've decided to let Jun-su run it.

577
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,995
Jun-su! Really?

578
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,765
- Yes.
- That's good to hear, Jun-su.

579
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,735
Congratulations.

580
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,365
Thank you, sir.

581
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,829
Come to think of it,
you said that your daughter

582
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,945
also attends a prestigious fashion
school in Europe, didn't you?

583
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,399
No, that's not it.
She must have graduated by now.

584
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,515
Yes, sir. She graduated
and is gaining work experience,

585
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,755
so she's working for a designer brand.

586
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,225
Such a competent individual

587
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,225
would be a good partner with you
at International.

588
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,095
Yes, sir.

589
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,025
Hyun-ah, open the door.

590
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,595
How long are you going to keep this up?

591
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,255
You need to see a
counselor or something!

592
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,925
Hyun-ah!

593
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,535
What's this?

594
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,769
Honey! Wake up!

595
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,229
- What's wrong?
- Fire!

596
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,469
- What?
- Wake up! Hurry!

597
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,369
- Fire!
- Where?

598
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,185
- Honey! Hurry!
- What?

599
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,339
- What's going on?
- This way!

600
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,549
- Hurry!
- Where are you going?

601
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,709
Hurry up!

602
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,055
- Gosh!
- This way!

603
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,049
Oh, no!

604
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,019
Goodness!

605
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,019
Goodness! Oh, no!

606
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,029
What's going on?

607
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,529
- How could this be?
- Wait. The soy sauce.

608
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,835
Ssi-ganjang!

609
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,345
- Ssi-ganjang!
- Where are you going?

610
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,615
Where are you going? No!

611
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,045
Grandma!

612
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,685
Grandpa!

613
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,855
Gosh, what do we do?

614
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,443
One beef, one pajeon,
one shrimp dumpling.

615
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,079
Number 24.
Let's move, guys, move!

616
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:12,447
- Yes, Chef!
- Yes, Chef!

617
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,093
- Hey, Hugo, on the steaks.
- Yes, Chef.

618
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,235
Who is this? I'm busy.

619
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,105
Hello?

620
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,175
Is this the place?

621
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,845
I think so.

622
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,375
Let's head inside.

623
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,185
Here you go.

624
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,055
You couldn't stomach any food
by the best chefs in town,

625
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,295
but you liked the mung bean porridge?

626
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,751
Had it not been the porridge,

627
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,125
my last show would've
been a disaster.

628
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,759
I wonder what made it so good.

629
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,605
Was it made with gold or something?

630
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,329
I have no idea. Let's order first.

631
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,375
Okay.

632
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,955
How is it?

633
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,449
I think this is the place. It's good.
Try some too, Madame Jang.

634
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,325
Really? Is it really good?

635
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,635
Should we ask for some
mung bean porridge?

636
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,905
- It's not on the menu.
- We can ask.

637
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:12,798
Well, the food is great.

638
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:16,171
May I compliment the
chef in person, please?

639
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,238
Yes.

640
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,609
- Why are you doing this?
- Why not?

641
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,379
It's a good chance to meet him

642
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,255
and I'll make him our designated chef.

643
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,481
Eat up.

644
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,859
Is that the man?

645
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,835
He doesn't look like a chef.

646
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,429
- Be quiet.
- It's fine.

647
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,859
Are both of you Korean?

648
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,799
You're Korean, too? Nice to meet you.

649
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,069
It's a pleasure to meet you.

650
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,339
I'm Manager Choi Gun-woo.

651
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,215
I see. Where's the chef?

652
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,445
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,725
Our head chef had to return
to Korea recently.

654
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,285
Is that right?

655
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,725
That's too bad.

656
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,795
- Do you two know each other?
- Yes.

657
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,495
Do you feel better?

658
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,035
Yes.

659
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,555
Save us, merciful Buddha.

660
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,889
May his soul rest in peace.

661
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,389
Save us, merciful Buddha.

662
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,329
May her soul rest in peace.

663
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,159
Save us, merciful Buddha.

664
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,429
May his soul rest in peace.

665
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,545
Save us, merciful Buddha.

666
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,655
May her soul rest in peace.

667
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,755
Save us, merciful Buddha.

668
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,395
May his soul rest in peace.

669
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,759
<i>Announcement of New Team Members</i>

670
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,965
<i>Lim Chul-yong</i>

671
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,165
<i>New Managing Director of
Donghan Food, Kang Jun-su</i>

672
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,345
Come in.

673
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,225
How could you do this?

674
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,719
Sir, I...

675
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,495
It was the chairman's decision.

676
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,165
But you know how hard I worked

677
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,935
to assist you all this time.

678
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,759
There's no need to feel rushed.

679
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,975
You know...

680
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,175
what kind of things I've done for you

681
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,915
when you asked me to.

682
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,915
I still have trouble sleeping at night.

683
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,615
The Pungcheonok incident...

684
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,395
A lot of natural disasters happen
in Korea.

685
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,195
There are storms, then there are fires.

686
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,919
Let's just say that a bothersome person

687
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,835
happened to die in a flood this summer.

688
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,675
Should we feel guilty about it?

689
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,785
Let's see.

690
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,895
That guy.

691
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,135
Seol-ah, let's get out.

692
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,835
I thought it was an older person.

693
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,365
Right. He looks young.

694
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,575
Maybe he's the chef. The son.

695
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,475
I hear the family
is in grief right now.

696
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,615
Apparently, everyone died in a fire.

697
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,909
You need to be careful of fires.

698
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,639
Fires are the worst.

699
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,939
You be careful, too.

700
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,809
Don't burn your house down.

701
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,619
You shouldn't be the one to talk to.

702
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,619
We should say hi since they're new.

703
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,949
- I'll go first.
- All right.

704
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,719
- Hello!
- Hi.

705
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,659
Hello there.

706
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,365
- You must be heartbroken.
- Sorry?

707
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,659
We were just excited
that there's a newcomer,

708
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,205
but what happened is so tragic.

709
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,745
You look exhausted, it must've
been a lot for you to take in.

710
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,739
That's not me. That's my friend.

711
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,615
Right? I thought so.

712
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,155
- I heard that the new guy is handsome.
- What?

713
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,355
I see.

714
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,125
I hear he's not married.

715
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,519
I'm not married.

716
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,089
Not you, I meant your friend.

717
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,259
Yes, he's single.

718
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,675
Then who's this child?

719
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,629
I'm Seol-ah.

720
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,745
Your name is Seol-ah?

721
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,939
Who's your father?

722
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,345
Well,

723
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,715
I don't know how to tell you.

724
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:04,909
<i>Hang them well.</i>

725
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,009
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

726
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,949
<i>Seung-mo loves it
when I stir-fry these.</i>

727
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,025
<i>That's right!</i>

728
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,435
<i>You get one per day.
The rest is Seung-mo's.</i>

729
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,459
<i>Don't you dare to eat more than that.</i>

730
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,135
<i>They look great.</i>

731
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,869
<i>Did you put everything?</i>

732
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,969
<i>- Put that in the sink for me.
- Okay.</i>

733
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,155
<i>- Good job.
- This is perfect.</i>

734
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,085
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

735
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,975
<i>Keep pushing.</i>

736
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,709
<i>Come on, you can do
much better than that.</i>

737
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,855
<i>I'm trying my best.</i>

738
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,909
<i>That won't clean anything.</i>

739
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,249
<i>Stop nagging, will you?</i>

740
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:16,079
<i>How are you so weak
when you eat so much?</i>

741
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,795
<i>You're right, I do eat a lot.</i>

742
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,595
<i>We built this house too big.</i>

743
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,165
<i>Exactly.</i>

744
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,975
<i>It's hard to clean this big house.</i>

745
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,345
<i>You said you were tired.</i>

746
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,545
<i>You said you wanted to rest.</i>

747
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,585
<i>You said you'd just rest here.</i>

748
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,205
My arms are falling off.

749
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,545
Be careful.

750
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,445
You could've helped me out
instead of lying around like that.

751
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,785
I'm doing this for your parents.

752
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,155
Right. Let's see.

753
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,149
Seol-ah, put your bag in that room

754
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,035
and get ready for bed.
It's getting late.

755
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:32,435
You need to wash up and go to bed.

756
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,935
Okay.

757
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,515
Get up.

758
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,195
What are you going to do now?

759
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,695
I don't know.

760
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,665
I can't think.

761
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,095
I don't know what to do.

762
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,859
If you're busy, take the kid
and go back first.

763
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,905
Why would I take the kid?

764
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,169
And how can I, your best friend,

765
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,745
just leave you to be like this alone?

766
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,185
Right, it's not like you have
anywhere to go.

767
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,625
What are you talking about?
Unbelievable.

768
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,425
How can you say
that to your best friend?

769
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,289
I just think it's time
for me to move out

770
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,359
and it'd be nice if I live with you.

771
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,495
And...

772
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,465
Hyo-myoung,

773
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,435
your daughter, Yu-jin,
is all grown-up now.

774
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,445
I'm doing all right, right?

775
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,855
<i>I'll be fine, right?</i>

776
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,155
<i>My heart is going to explode.</i>

777
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,589
<i>Hyo-myoung, you were the best model</i>

778
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,589
<i>and now it's time for you to make
your debut as the best designer.</i>

779
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:42,765
<i>Be confident.</i>

780
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,065
<i>All right. At least I know</i>

781
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,335
<i>that you'll become
the principal designer.</i>

782
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,175
<i>Promise to take care of me
if I don't get in, okay?</i>

783
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,015
<i>Fine. You don't need
to worry about that.</i>

784
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,509
<i>- You promised.
- Of course.</i>

785
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,615
<i>Ms. Yoo Hyo-myoung?</i>

786
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,055
<i>It's your turn now. Get going.</i>

787
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,895
<i>Unni...</i>

788
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,925
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

789
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,435
<i>- I'm going.
- Good luck!</i>

790
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,335
<i>That's me.</i>

791
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,705
<i>Principal Designer Contest</i>

792
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,055
Bella, I'm heading out to meet
with Chairman Louis.

793
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,775
Did she forget something?

794
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,275
Yes, Madame Jang?

795
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,355
Sorry?

796
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,552
She won't renew my contract?

797
00:57:18,552 --> 00:57:20,470
Is she signing with someone else?

798
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,800
She hasn't decided yet.

799
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,070
Why are you doing
this with me, Madame Jang?

800
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,210
Aren't you prepared
for such a situation?

801
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,932
If I could, that would be nice.

802
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:36,810
Even I don't know what she
intends to do, so I can't say.

803
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Oh, it's Bella.
Excuse me, sir.

804
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,549
Yes, Bella?

805
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,325
We were just talking about you.

806
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,895
He's asking
who you'll collaborate with next.

807
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,389
Where are you?

808
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,789
- I'm on a plane.
- A plane?

809
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,789
Something urgent came up in Korea.

810
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,029
What are you talking about? Bella?

811
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,875
It's a long story. I'll tell you...

812
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:05,833
Excuse me.

813
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,075
I'll tell you about it all when I land.

814
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,455
<i>Ms. Yoo Yu-jin, right?
I'm Lawyer Lee Kyung-hoon.</i>

815
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,579
<i>I'm contacting you
regarding the Yoo family graves</i>

816
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,825
<i>at the hill in Seoha Village.</i>

817
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,659
<i>I'm contacting you
as the new landlord is</i>

818
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,729
<i>moving your mother's grave</i>

819
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,335
<i>if we don't hear from
you in three days.</i>

820
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,305
Mom...

821
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,689
<i>This is an avant-garde piece</i>

822
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,019
<i>that reflects the fear of uncertainty</i>

823
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,605
<i>we face as the new millennium
is approaching.</i>

824
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,505
<i>Beautiful.</i>

825
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,899
<i>We will now announce
the next principal designer</i>

826
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,445
<i>of Donghan International.</i>

827
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,875
<i>The next principal designer is</i>

828
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,185
<i>Designer Yoo Hyo-myoung.</i>

829
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,585
<i>Principal Designer</i>

830
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,549
<i>There she is!</i>

831
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,519
<i>Please answer our question!</i>

832
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,165
<i>- Can you explain to us?
- Please stay away.</i>

833
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,289
<i>- Please answer our question.
- What do you have to say?</i>

834
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,465
<i>Mom!</i>

835
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,159
<i>- How old are you?
- You're very young.</i>

836
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,699
<i>- Is she really your mother?
- What's your mother's name?</i>

837
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,545
<i>- Can you answer our questions?
- Who are you?</i>

838
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,015
Come in.

839
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,985
Hello.

840
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:30,455
The office seems brighter
with a young man in it.

841
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,209
Congratulations once again.

842
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,449
Congratulations.

843
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,655
Thank you.

844
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,489
Junior Managing Director Jung will be
of great help.

845
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,549
- Introduce yourselves.
- I'm Jung Gwang-su.

846
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,795
Nice to meet you.

847
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,465
Nice to meet you.
I look forward to working with you.

848
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,245
He looks like he lacks life experience.

849
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,185
He's Chairman Han's grandson.

850
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,555
He's no easy opponent.

851
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,779
You may never become the chairman
if you let yourself loose.

852
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,455
So, Managing Director Kang was
appointed now because...

853
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,865
The sly man is throwing a bait.

854
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:16,365
He's testing to see
who'll beat his grandson.

855
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,429
While the kid is busy getting
a hang of things,

856
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:25,805
we'll need to set our foot
with what we've prepared.

857
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,445
"What we've prepared"?

858
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,745
She should be arriving soon.

859
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,435
In my opinion...

860
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:53,159
Why don't you nullify
the existing contract

861
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,429
and sign a new contract

862
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,035
with a better offer?

863
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,575
Absolutely not.

864
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,069
I can't move anywhere.

865
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,175
Sorry?

866
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,185
I don't care how much money it'll take.

867
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:06,315
Compensate for their loss

868
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,255
and purchase the property again.

869
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,755
Let me ask something out of curiosity.

870
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,789
The land involved in this lawsuit is

871
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,549
nothing more than
a small hill in a small town

872
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,859
without much value.

873
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,529
Why do you insist

874
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,935
that you keep this land?

875
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,905
You can see my mother's hometown
from here.

876
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:35,345
I see.

877
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,509
Who purchased the hill?

878
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,469
It's someone from
Donghan International.

879
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,655
What did you say?

880
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,525
Open the door.

881
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,025
Hyun-ah!

882
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,359
Your beloved
Designer Bella is in Korea.

883
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,735
Don't you want to meet her?

884
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,635
I have a meeting with her tomorrow.

885
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,845
Are you still going
to stay in your room?

886
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,915
Bella?

887
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,945
<i>Managing Director Lim Chul-yong</i>

888
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,185
<i>of Donghan International
purchased the land.</i>

889
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,425
<i>Then...</i>

890
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,719
<i>- is it the company buying the land?
- Yes.</i>

891
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,995
<i>It'd be best if you
two meet and talk.</i>

892
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,549
<i>He's a simple man</i>

893
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,165
<i>that you can talk things out with.</i>

894
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,435
<i>Sure, then.</i>

895
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,895
How much did it cost
you to buy the land?

896
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,219
I'll give you the money.

897
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,295
No,

898
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,095
I'll double it.

899
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,959
We purchased the land

900
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,765
to expand our
manufacturing and storage.

901
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,499
It'd be malpractice if I make the call

902
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,645
based on my personal thoughts.

903
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,175
I'll triple the money.

904
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,015
Wouldn't that be a profitable deal?

905
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,185
That's not the only way
to make a profit.

906
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,655
Yu-jin,

907
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,295
no,

908
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,825
Bella Yoo.

909
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,265
Who are you?

910
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,205
Don't be too surprised.

911
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,535
I'm the only one who knows.

912
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,345
For now, at least.

913
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,045
I'll be straightforward with you.

914
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,345
I know your contract
with Louis is over.

915
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:56,455
Sign with Donghan.

916
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,125
Why should I?

917
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,695
Why not?

918
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,065
After all,

919
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,335
I know

920
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,235
all of Bella's secrets.

921
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,675
Yoo Hyo-myoung.

922
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:30,785
Your mother's death was unfortunate.

923
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,125
She was a beautiful model
and an excellent designer.

924
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,525
How did you find out?

925
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:40,859
A close friend of hers was

926
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,335
a department head here at Donghan.

927
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,035
Jang Sun-young,

928
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:47,735
Belle Ombre's current business partner.

929
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,105
You should be a detective instead.

930
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,439
A good manager needs
good information sources.

931
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,085
I'll take it as a compliment.

932
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,085
But...

933
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,395
I have no interest in working with you.

934
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,119
I think it was wise of you

935
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,165
to not show yourself in public.

936
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,659
People forget their past so easily,

937
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,875
but never forget famous
people's scandals.

938
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,915
Wouldn't it be so tragic...

939
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,255
if people began talking
about your mother's death again?

940
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,625
I've made sure that nobody can come in.

941
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,925
This is our work. Take a look around.

942
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:36,065
What do you think?

943
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,635
I'll see you at court.

944
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,575
It'd be better for my mind to sue you

945
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,805
than to work with a company like this.

946
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,149
<i>Lawyer Lee, I'm heading
to Nonyang right now.</i>

947
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,285
<i>Please get the people ready.</i>

948
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,835
I've been wanting to
meet you for so long.

949
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,305
You stopped in front of my work
back there.

950
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:21,929
I wanted to show you my other works
and hear what you think of them.

951
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,045
Who are you?

952
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:25,075
Don't you see the cars behind you?

953
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,869
I have to get going.

954
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,785
I have no time for such a talk.

955
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:34,325
Ms. Bella,

956
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:38,525
I'm actually Lim Hyun-ah,
Lim Chul-yong's daughter.

957
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:41,718
What a ridiculous family you are.

958
01:08:41,719 --> 01:08:44,435
I'm also an Antwerp alumna.

959
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,895
I've never met you in real life,

960
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:48,829
but I've been so intrigued by your work

961
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,765
that I've seen all of your shows.

962
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,285
What are you going to do now?

963
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:06,115
What?

964
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,385
You said you'll sell the place
and move to Seoul.

965
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:09,655
I don't know.

966
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,419
What about Seol-ah?

967
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,525
We'll find her mother
and send her back.

968
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,735
Right.

969
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,105
But don't you think it's weird?

970
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,928
The mom must have a reason

971
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:26,928
why she left her with you.

972
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:30,544
It's too mean to just send her away.

973
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,475
Do I look like a charity to you?

974
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:36,084
I've never seen her
and she's not even related to me.

975
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:37,954
So why should I keep her?

976
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:40,485
I don't know.

977
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,069
You'll be arriving

978
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,885
- at your destination soon.
- We're almost there.

979
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,425
So tell me,

980
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,455
what do you think

981
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,725
of my designs?

982
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,025
I was impressed at first,

983
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,765
but I can see it clearly

984
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,835
now that I've looked into them.

985
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,835
They're not original.
They're plagiarized.

986
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,405
Plagiarized?

987
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,069
What are you talking about?

988
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:42,209
And you made things worse
to cover up the plagiarism.

989
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,515
You're mistaken.

990
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:47,909
I've put in so much work...

991
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,055
Mistaken?

992
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,055
When I was graduating from Antwerp,

993
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,925
I got a call from the school,
saying that my dress

994
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,495
chosen as the best graduate work
had been stolen.

995
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,405
Was that you who stole the dress?

996
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,205
No.

997
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,745
No!

998
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,345
What are you doing?

999
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,839
Are you insane? Stop the car!

1000
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,015
What do you think you're doing?

1001
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,835
Seung-mo!

1002
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,505
- Yes?
- I can't find Seol-ah anywhere.

1003
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:38,429
What happened to her?

1004
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,935
Let's go out and look.

1005
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,475
Gosh.

1006
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,745
Kid!

1007
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,585
Kid!

1008
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,755
Seol-ah!

1009
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,115
Gosh.

1010
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,785
Kid!

1011
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,525
Kid!

1012
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,725
Seol-ah!

1013
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,295
Kid!

1014
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,305
What are you doing out here?
It's dangerous.

1015
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:16,005
A kid like you
shouldn't be out here alone.

1016
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,045
You wanted me to go.

1017
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,515
I was just happy to see my father.

1018
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,085
But you don't like me and want me out.

1019
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,085
What are you talking about?

1020
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,525
Do you really want me to yell at you?

1021
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,319
- Over there.
- What are you doing?

1022
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,395
Over there.

1023
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,365
What is it?

1024
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:59,415
(Eccentric! Chef Moon)

1025
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:15,030
♫ <i>One day, you came into my head</i> ♫

1026
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:16,289
<i>My goodness!</i>

1027
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,529
<i>- Memory loss?
- When shocked in an accident,</i>

1028
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,329
<i>people sometimes temporarily lose
their memories.</i>

1029
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,075
<i>- I've seen you somewhere.
- I'm starving.</i>

1030
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,999
<i>Chef Moon, you're the best!</i>

1031
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,939
<i>You're the best!</i>

1032
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,785
<i>I'm not here to feed you all.</i>

1033
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:30,215
<i>It's delicious.</i>

1034
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,439
<i>Why can't I remember anything?</i>

1035
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,855
<i>Seung-mo, what are you doing?</i>

1036
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,049
<i>Were you peeking?</i>

1037
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,849
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1038
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,825
<i>- You pervert!
- Pervert?</i>

1039
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,795
<i>What an eccentric woman she is.</i>

♫ <i>Can you just act like you don't know</i> ♫

1041
