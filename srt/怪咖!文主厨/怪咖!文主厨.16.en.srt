(Episode 16)

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,619
<i>Just now, the shocking deeds
of Chairman Lim Chul-yong of Donghan</i>

4
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,329
<i>have been broadcasted live
on the internet,</i>

5
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,328
<i>putting the whole country in shock.</i>

6
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,425
<i>Here is a clip from the live.</i>

7
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,465
<i>Do you know why they died?</i>

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,235
<i>Because they underestimated me.</i>

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,639
<i>Had they just listened to me,</i>

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,675
<i>they wouldn't have died so painfully.</i>

11
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,505
<i>Dad,</i>

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,675
<i>I'm not Bella.</i>

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,815
<i>Stop all of this!</i>

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,815
Hyun-ah...

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,015
<i>I'm not Bella.</i>

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,455
<i>For the past few months,</i>

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,929
- <i>under the orders of Chairman Lim</i>
- Hyun-ah...

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,585
<i>of Donghan Group...</i>

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,215
<i>(Eccentric! Chef Moon Show)</i>

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,685
Moon Seung-mo...

21
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,155
Bella...

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,734
<i>(Inspection in session)</i>

23
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,805
All right.

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,108
What?

25
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,379
They've tracked the suspect's
location with his phone.

26
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,875
Is that right? Let's get going! Hurry!

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,465
What is it?

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,705
What is it?

29
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,735
Where did he go?

30
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,295
They'll get him soon, right?

31
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,295
Don't worry.

32
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,195
There's nothing
Lim Chul-yong can do now.

33
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,335
It's all over.

34
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,045
Are you all right, Yu-jin?

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,015
I'm all right.
I guess I've been too tense.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,225
Come on, this isn't the right time.

37
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,435
- It wasn't me. It was you.
- No, it wasn't.

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,765
Should we eat something?

39
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,774
I'm good.

40
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,045
All I can do is just cook for you.

41
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,515
It's not just cooking.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,885
You're the best chef in the world,
and it's the best food in the world.

43
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,855
Whatever.

44
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,750
♫ <i>I like you so much</i> ♫

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,140
♫ <i>A person like you</i> ♫

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,230
♫ <i>I blossom like a spring flower,</i> ♫

47
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,250
♫ <i>You put on a gentle smile</i> ♫

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:05:02,340
♫ <i>Stay with me, I'll hold you</i> ♫

49
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:13,340
♫ <i>So you can forget all the hard times</i> ♫

50
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,920
♫ <i>Out of the countless stars in the sky</i> ♫

51
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,440
♫ <i>You shine the brightest,</i> ♫

52
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,040
♫ <i>Your clear and pretty face</i> ♫

53
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,830
♫ <i>I love you</i> ♫

54
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,740
♫ <i>On this silent night
when everyone is asleep</i> ♫

55
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,885
Your food always smells great.

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,555
It's to cheer you up.

57
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,525
I love it.

58
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:56,070
♫ <i>I will protect you from now on</i> ♫

59
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,805
It's warm and soft.

60
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,545
Don't have such a hard time anymore.

61
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,585
And please don't cry.

62
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,725
You too.

63
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,875
I really don't know!

64
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,885
They found a phone inside the car
Lim Chul-yong left behind.

65
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,255
<i>We can't track him anymore.</i>

66
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,325
<i>It won't be an easy search.</i>

67
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,255
Do you think he already got away
from Nonyang?

68
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,155
I don't know.

69
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,865
But it won't be easy to be on the run
without a car at night.

70
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,199
<i>We blocked all the roads</i>
to and from Nonyang,

71
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,635
and we're inspecting everyone,

72
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,335
so don't worry.

73
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,905
I hope you get him soon.

74
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,375
Oh, and how is Hyun-ah doing?

75
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,519
We're investigating her

76
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,275
based on what she said earlier,

77
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,915
so it's going to take a while.

78
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,415
You're going through so much.

79
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,255
Then I'll leave it to you and wait.

80
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,385
Get some sleep tonight.

81
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,995
I told you, no!

82
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,309
We need to bring him down

83
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,649
at this meeting,
for our company's reputation.

84
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,615
They haven't even investigated him yet.

85
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,785
We can't jump to conclusions.

86
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,385
How long are we supposed to wait?

87
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,489
Everyone's talking about it online!

88
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,195
Lim Chul-yong said it himself.

89
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,799
What else do we need?

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,999
And if the prosecutors
drop the charges?

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,835
Or if he is proved innocent?

92
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,565
Will you take responsibility?

93
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,675
I will take responsibility.

94
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,605
What brings you here, Ms. Han?

95
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,675
The chairman is away,

96
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,245
so this is obviously

97
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,415
my place.

98
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,785
What will you do?

99
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,055
I will bring up an emergency agenda
at the board meeting.

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,765
I will suspend Lim Chul-yong's position
as chairman

101
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,865
and appoint someone else
to act in his place in the meantime.

102
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,435
Who do you have in mind?

103
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,075
Mr. Kang.

104
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,645
- Mr. Kang?
- Mother...

105
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,719
Then, shall we proceed

106
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,155
and take a vote regarding Mr. Kang
taking the place as acting chairman?

107
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,429
- Mr. Kang will do a good job.
- I agree.

108
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,859
- He will do well.
- Sure.

109
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,395
- What a relief.
- Goodness.

110
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,535
- You're here?
- Yes.

111
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,475
Isn't this a bit too early
in the morning?

112
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,275
I'm sure you're all tired,
but the fashion show is this afternoon.

113
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,975
Let's do a final rehearsal.

114
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,745
In your positions, please.

115
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,985
- In position!
- In position.

116
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,785
- Let's go.
- Okay.

117
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,285
By the way, do I have to do it too?

118
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,485
You should since you got clothes too.

119
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,825
Okay. Please strut down the runway
as you learned yesterday, one by one.

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,429
- Starting with Hyo-sook.
- Sure.

121
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,025
- Goodness, am I next?
- Okay.

122
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,029
- Like this and that.
- Gosh, here?

123
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,995
Hyo-sook, you're the best!

124
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,105
Squeeze in your butt.

125
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,735
Straighten your back.

126
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,239
Come on, Da-hoon. Quit joking around.

127
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,435
Goodness, that goofball.

128
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,005
Oh, gosh.

129
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,179
- Am I doing it right?
- Yes, you're doing great.

130
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,475
Okay.

131
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,115
Hello?

132
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,385
I'm sorry, but we're
closed for the day.

133
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,055
Hello?

134
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,425
<i>It's good to see you all happy.</i>

135
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,225
<i>I'm dying to mess everything up.</i>

136
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,765
Lim Chul-yong...

137
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,665
<i>I can't go down like this alone.</i>

138
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,835
<i>Wait and see what happens.</i>

139
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,475
Darn it!

140
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,409
Officer Cho,
Lim Chul-yong just called me.

141
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,545
- <i>What?</i>
- He said he's going to mess things up.

142
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,979
He'll do something at the fashion show

143
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,375
when everyone's there.

144
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,879
I'll go to Seoha Farm,

145
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,489
where the fashion show will take place,

146
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,785
and search every corner.

147
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,085
The show must go on no matter what.

148
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,255
<i>Of course.</i>

149
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,429
Then shouldn't we tell
the village people too?

150
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,025
I don't want to make them anxious.

151
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,555
Let's keep it a secret for now.

152
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,295
Okay.

153
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,795
Good.

154
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,165
Bella, I'm hosting the event.
Do I still need to do this?

155
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,405
You should do your clothes proud.

156
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,445
We're getting better at it now.

157
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,119
Of course, we're doing great.

158
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,445
How do I look?

159
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,775
You're doing great.

160
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,245
Hello, Chef Moon. Look at us!

161
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,755
Chef Moon.

162
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,685
Are you all done?

163
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,695
- Not yet.
- Then why did you come so early?

164
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,295
To keep an eye on you
and check if you're doing okay.

165
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,265
We're doing great.

166
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,735
Chef Moon, you should be nervous.

167
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,105
Why?

168
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,405
Because I'm going to do
a better job than you.

169
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,945
There's your smile.

170
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,175
What?

171
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,515
Let's smile.

172
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,885
Everything's okay now.

173
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,485
You're right.

174
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,675
Hey, be careful with that.

175
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,285
Right, careful with the flowers.

176
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,619
- I'll put it in the center.
- Sure, in the center.

177
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,055
- Right.
- Here are the chairs.

178
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,629
- Goodness.
- Hey, hurry up with that.

179
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,259
We've finished already.
What are you doing?

180
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,255
There are three of you.

181
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,225
- Come on and hurry up.
- Gosh.

182
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,095
Oh, you're here.

183
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,239
Can you help me unpack
the ingredients if you're done?

184
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,775
Sure.

185
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,349
Dad, I'll bring the last one left

186
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,415
- in the car.
- Okay.

187
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,419
I love the colors.

188
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,385
Goodness, beautiful.

189
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,655
<i>(CHTV)</i>

190
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,565
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

191
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,935
Oh, hello.

192
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,565
- Hello.
- This way, please.

193
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,005
Over here.

194
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,045
You're here.

195
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,785
Where's Hyun-ah?

196
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,155
She has to deal with a lot of issues,

197
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,255
and it's taking much
longer than expected.

198
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,095
By the way, what can I help with?

199
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,739
- Goodness, this is unbelievable.
- What is?

200
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,539
How come there are
so many people already?

201
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,775
- What?
- What?

202
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,145
I'm so nervous.

203
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,515
All of Nonyang can't be that...

204
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,449
There are so many people.

205
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,145
This is... This is not a stage

206
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,655
for amateurs.

207
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,325
There are too many people and cameras!

208
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,025
What should we do?

209
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,029
Come on, this is manageable.

210
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,299
- What?
- Just do it like we did the rehearsals.

211
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,599
Goodness.

212
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,639
Seol-ah's the boss here.

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,065
She's the man!

214
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,069
- Gosh.
- Come here.

215
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,639
Wait, everyone.

216
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,539
Is our gift for Bella all prepared?

217
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,909
- Yes.
- Are you okay?

218
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,345
- Ta-da.
- Goodness.

219
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,745
We can show it right away
if we connect this to that laptop.

220
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,479
Take good care of that.
That's our treasure.

221
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,785
No doubt.

222
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,489
Bella can't know about this.

223
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,185
- Yes.
- Over here.

224
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,455
- Goodness, you're here.
- Hello.

225
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,895
We should do their makeup first.

226
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,569
What's "makeup"?

227
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,799
Oh, Seol-ah. Do you remember the
last time I did a makeover for you?

228
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,965
No!

229
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,965
Never!

230
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,675
My mom did a terrible makeover on her
and it traumatized her.

231
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,375
- Hey!
- Oh, I see.

232
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,515
How cute.

233
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,249
Sweetheart, your name is Seol-ah, right?

234
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,619
- Yes.
- If I do your makeup, you'll be surprised.

235
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,815
You can look forward to it.

236
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,555
I did Bella unni's makeup
when she was young as well.

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,925
Jang Madame, start with Seol-ah.

238
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,569
I'll take over the rest.

239
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,795
Okay. Let's go, princess.

240
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,739
- Okay, now.
- Let me look at you.

241
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,009
- Come here, Yoon-ja.
- Your lips are too red.

242
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,209
It's pretty, right?

243
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,839
What's this?

244
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,045
Oh, that?

245
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,745
This is...

246
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,315
If you use it like this,
it covers the light

247
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,315
and you can sleep tight at night.

248
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,559
May I borrow this real quick?

249
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,525
- What?
- Please, wait a moment.

250
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,859
Unni.

251
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,399
Hey, Seol-ah. What's up?

252
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,125
Come here and sit for a second.

253
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,235
You don't like
flashlights from cameras.

254
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,135
Dad said so.

255
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,835
You should keep this on
since they will probably be taking

256
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,405
a lot of photos today.

257
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,945
Seol-ah, how are you so kind?

258
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,715
It's all thanks to my dad.

259
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,755
Thank you.

260
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,335
Excuse me, Chef Moon?

261
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,065
Officer Cho.

262
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,405
How are things going?
Any suspicious-looking people?

263
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,775
I haven't noticed
anything in particular yet.

264
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,445
We have some detectives
in the audience as well.

265
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,685
If there's a hint of something wrong,
they'll jump right at it.

266
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,855
Good.

267
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,495
Gun-woo. Mr. Kang.

268
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,794
You came all the way here?

269
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,294
We're not too late, right?

270
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,809
We wouldn't miss a show
held by you and Noona.

271
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,064
Oh, and Chef Moon.

272
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,005
He's no longer "Mr. Kang".

273
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,605
Call him "Chairman Kang" now.

274
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,005
Come on, Gun-woo.

275
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,615
Forget about that Chef Moon.
I'm just the acting chairman.

276
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,389
Congratulations.

277
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,745
We can't let our guards down yet.

278
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,545
Lim Chul-yong's
whereabouts are unknown.

279
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,355
We should stay alert until we find him.

280
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,525
The Nonyang Police Station is
actively helping us out

281
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,755
so we'll get him soon.

282
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,395
- Okay.
- Thank you.

283
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,269
Thank you for your patience.

284
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,739
We will now begin

285
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,279
2020's spring and summer collection

286
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,539
of Designer Yoo Byeol-na

287
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,609
and Chef Moon's collaborative
fashion and food show.

288
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,579
Now taking place
at Nonyang's Seoha Village,

289
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,385
this is the Eccentric Chef Moon Show!

290
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,125
- Goodness.
- Congratulations.

291
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,365
She looks beautiful.

292
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,405
It's beautiful.

293
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,435
My goodness.

294
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,645
Please give her a round of applause.

295
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,385
They look really beautiful.

296
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,385
They are just like models.

297
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,825
My goodness.

298
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,695
They are mother and daughter.

299
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,495
They look so beautiful.

300
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,455
Oh, my goodness!

301
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,555
That's so sweet.

302
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,399
You guys look great together.

303
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,365
Please give them
another round of applause!

304
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,865
Here comes the head of Seoha Village!

305
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,035
- Oh, my.
- So beautiful.

306
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,345
- Gon-sook!
- You look so beautiful!

307
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,679
- Gon-sook!
- You look beautiful.

308
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,645
And her husband, Mr. Hwang!

309
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,585
Gosh, he looks great.

310
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,555
Aren't they a lovely couple?

311
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,625
Stop fighting.

312
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,735
Mr. Cho Chul-nam is coming!

313
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,609
The Iron Man of Seoha Village,
Cho Chul-nam!

314
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,435
- He looks great.
- He could be a model.

315
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,245
You look awesome!

316
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,849
- He looks adorable.
- He looks really nice.

317
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,045
- I love his outfit.
- This is awesome.

318
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,155
- Goodness.
- He looks great.

319
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,585
Now, here comes the most
beautiful princess in the world!

320
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,895
You look beautiful!

321
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,055
My goodness.

322
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,799
- Oh, my.
- She's so cute.

323
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,199
You look beautiful.

324
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,065
- My gosh.
- You look so pretty.

325
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,279
She's so adorable.

326
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,305
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

327
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,845
- How adorable.
- You look so pretty.

328
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,745
She's so cute.

329
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,415
Please give her a round of applause!

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,135
Seol-ah!

331
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,465
Seol-ah!

332
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,509
Who are you? Who sent you?

333
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,645
Wait. He's a detective.

334
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,829
I'm sure you're surprised.

335
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,859
Well, the thing is,
she's a very special person.

336
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,665
That's why she made
a very special appearance.

337
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,169
She's the designer who made those
awesome clothes for the villagers.

338
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,535
Meet Designer Yoo Yu-jin!

339
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,405
Unni, close your eyes.

340
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,995
I'm fine.

341
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,835
Yu-jin.

342
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,945
Let's go.

343
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,835
Please give them
a big round of applause!

344
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,285
- Yu-jin, are you all right?
- Teacher!

345
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,155
My heart was pounding so much
it almost jumped out of my mouth.

346
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,695
Would you like to take some rest now?

347
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,195
No.

348
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,069
This is fun.

349
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,475
- Yu-jin.
- Chef Moon.

350
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,205
Thank you.

351
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,345
- Are you okay? The flash.
- Yes.

352
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,445
I'm okay.

353
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,835
It's not over yet.
Please stay focused until the end.

354
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,209
It's time for our Chef Moon
to show off his skills.

355
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,035
No. It's time for us
to show off our skills.

356
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,875
Turn this on. Chairs.

357
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,935
- Let's go.
- This is exciting.

358
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,165
- Here.
- Thank you.

359
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,305
This way.

360
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,739
Yes, here it comes.

361
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,275
Goodness.

362
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,745
Gosh. It looks great.

363
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,575
Chef Moon.

364
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,689
Are you leaving already?

365
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,755
I'm afraid I have to.
I have work to do.

366
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,555
Why don't you have some food
before you go?

367
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,289
I wish I could.
I don't get to eat your food often.

368
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,555
What a shame.

369
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,865
But there's nothing we can do about it.
He's the chairman now. He's busy.

370
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,735
Come on, Gun-woo.
I will come back some other time.

371
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,299
Okay.

372
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,139
I heard Hyun-ah was released
from the police station.

373
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,535
So I think I should go.

374
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,675
- Chef Moon, sorry I have to leave early.
- Don't worry.

375
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,915
- Keep me updated.
- I will. Let's go.

376
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,315
Okay. We will get going then, Chef.
We'll be going, Noona.

377
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,889
- The soup smells great.
- Come on.

378
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,985
Bye.

379
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,629
Guys, I think we should get started.

380
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,629
- Okay.
- When should we start?

381
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,429
Two dishes after this,
we're getting desserts.

382
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,639
When we get the desserts, we will
introduce Chef Moon and Byeol-na.

383
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,069
- Then boom!
- Exactly.

384
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,339
That's the moment of tears.

385
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,575
- Exactly.
- Right.

386
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,345
Now, let's start getting ready.

387
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,275
Gosh, this is exciting.

388
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,485
What's wrong?

389
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,959
We are in trouble.
The flash drive is gone.

390
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,359
- What?
- Hey!

391
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,829
Did you search everywhere?

392
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,659
- It's gone.
- What do we do now?

393
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,999
Does that mean we can't play it now?

394
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,599
But now is the perfect time to play it.

395
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,199
I have the file at home.
I will quickly go and get it.

396
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,309
Da-hoon, let me come with you.

397
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,539
No, you're too slow.

398
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,935
But I can't trust you!

399
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,339
What if you drop it somewhere
on your way back?

400
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,279
- Hurry up.
- Just go already. We don't have time.

401
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,715
- Make sure to come back in 10.
- Now go.

402
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,315
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

403
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,099
This is why I said I can't trust you.

404
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,605
Seol-ah, I don't think I can do this.

405
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,139
Go and bring the laptop on my desk.

406
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,505
Okay. You can count on me!

407
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,875
Who are you?

408
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,159
- What do we do?
- What's taking them so long?

409
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,825
The dinner is almost over.
Why aren't they coming?

410
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,895
Call him.

411
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,605
Hold on.

412
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,679
He left his phone here.

413
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,149
When they get back,
no one will be left here.

414
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,579
What should we do?

415
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,279
- I guess it's time for me to step up.
- What?

416
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,915
I, Bong-doo, am the master of stalling.

417
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,055
Ladies and gentlemen.

418
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,855
- Well...
- Fire!

419
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,569
- What?
- Pungcheonok!

420
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,969
- There's a fire at Pungcheonok!
- What?

421
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,299
- What?
- But Da-hoon and Seol-ah are there!

422
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,905
- What?
- What happened?

423
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,509
Did Seol-ah and Da-hoon
go to Pungcheonok?

424
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,935
- Yes.
- They went there to bring something.

425
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,139
My goodness.

426
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,279
Chef Moon.

427
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,849
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

428
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,345
- Come on!
- Let's go!

429
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,415
What's taking her so long?

430
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,885
Da-hoon!

431
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,089
What are you doing here?

432
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,289
I'm waiting for Seol-ah.

433
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,259
I got tired, so I asked her
to bring my laptop.

434
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,385
Hey!

435
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,299
You sent her home alone?

436
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,425
Yes.

437
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,065
What's the matter?

438
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,765
You idiot.

439
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,165
Seung-mo!

440
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,135
Darn it.

441
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,585
Seol-ah.

442
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,725
Dad!

443
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,425
Seol-ah, are you all right?

444
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,195
Dad, the house is...

445
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,065
I'm glad you're all right. Let's go.

446
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,275
Oh, my.

447
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,345
If it isn't Chef Moon Seung-mo?

448
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,185
Seung-mo!

449
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,089
Da-hoon.

450
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,159
Take Seol-ah and go.

451
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,859
Seung-mo.

452
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,025
Go.

453
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,565
How does it feel

454
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,505
to see your precious things burn?

455
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,445
Do you now understand how I felt?

456
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,785
Tell me how you feel.

457
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,825
I don't feel anything.

458
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,309
Why can't you feel anything?

459
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,505
Why?

460
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,075
Why can't you feel anything?

461
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,505
Why?

462
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,905
You're only pretending you're fine.

463
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,115
I can tell by looking at your eyes.

464
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,385
I know you want to kill me right now.

465
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,425
This reminds you of how your parents
were burnt to death, doesn't it?

466
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,075
This is more like it.

467
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,375
Hit me.

468
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,745
Hit me again.

469
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,515
Hit me.

470
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,325
You and I are the same.

471
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,335
All humans are the same.

472
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,005
Revenge, fury, and selfishness.

473
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,175
Am I wrong?

474
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,015
Yes, you are.

475
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,845
I hit you so you come to your senses.

476
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,695
Because I'm really fine.

477
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,665
I have something
more precious than this.

478
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,445
Chef Moon!

479
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,645
- Chef Moon!
- Are you okay?

480
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,789
Chef Moon! What happened?

481
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,184
Are you all right?

482
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,585
Chef Moon!

483
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:36,724
Oh, my goodness!

484
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,625
My gosh.

485
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,735
Hurry up!

486
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,335
<i>I hate fire so much.</i>

487
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,079
<i>But the villagers</i>

488
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,309
<i>looked after me and my dad.</i>

489
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,815
<i>That, I liked.</i>

490
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,615
<i>So I wasn't scared at all.</i>

491
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,449
<i>And the bad man...</i>

492
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,315
<i>Here's today's first news.</i>

493
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,889
<i>The former chairman of Donghan
International, Lim Chul-yong,</i>

494
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,729
<i>was caught red-handed
for committing arson</i>

495
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,425
<i>in an old house
in Seoha Village, Nonyang.</i>

496
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,699
<i>Crimes he committed in the past
are also being uncovered,</i>

497
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,195
<i>which is shocking the nation.</i>

498
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,039
<i>- Would you like to say a word?
- A word please?</i>

499
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,265
<i>Please hang on.</i>

500
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,565
<i>He got caught.</i>

501
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,975
<i>And as for my first love,
the handsome guy...</i>

502
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,575
Donghan International will do away

503
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,175
with the conventional
management system,

504
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,779
and adopt a new management system

505
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,815
with management specialists.

506
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,915
I would like to make the new Donghan

507
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,655
together with you.

508
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,935
<i>He's become even cooler.</i>

509
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,065
<i>And as for Byeol-na unni,
who used to say she would leave...</i>

510
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,369
Seol-ah.

511
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,905
<i>She didn't leave and
she's staying here, which is great.</i>

512
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,175
What are you doing?

513
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,775
I'm writing in my diary.

514
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,819
Wow, you can even write now.

515
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,945
Yes. I learned it all
while you were gone.

516
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,659
I'm really smart.

517
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,785
Yu-jin.

518
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,655
Would you like to go for a short walk?

519
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,355
Right now?

520
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,795
Why are we taking a walk so suddenly?

521
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,465
Just because it's nice outside
and I wanted to walk with you.

522
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,875
We met in the fall,
and it's already spring.

523
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,505
You're right.

524
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,185
I changed so much after meeting you.

525
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,085
I'm no longer anorexic,

526
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,755
and I'm no longer afraid
of cameras flashing.

527
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,025
And you're now a designer with a face.

528
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,525
You changed a lot, too.

529
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,525
How?

530
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,765
You're now a dad.

531
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,405
You're right.

532
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,275
Before I met you,

533
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,605
I was just a wandering chef.

534
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,985
But now, I'm rooted in Seoha Village,

535
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,315
am a father of a child,

536
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,485
have represented the village,

537
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,385
own a restaurant
where everyone works together,

538
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:02,865
and I have Yoo Byeol-na's love.

539
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,495
You're right.

540
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,665
To be honest,

541
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,965
I never thought I'd
become who I am now.

542
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,005
Even as a child, I was more
comfortable away from home.

543
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,845
Once I decided to become a chef,

544
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,485
I rarely came home
and traveled all across the country.

545
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,185
That's when I met great people

546
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,555
like Mr. Song.

547
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,055
After learning to cook Korean cuisine,
I went abroad.

548
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,165
I wanted to make Korean food for people
who don't even know where Korea is.

549
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,935
But isn't it weird

550
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,675
that all that time away from home,

551
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,475
I never thought I was lonely,

552
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,145
because I knew that my parents are
always here

553
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,275
and that there is Pungcheonok.

554
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,815
I realized this only recently.

555
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,555
The reason I could
do whatever I wanted is

556
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,895
because I knew

557
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,365
that I had a home to come back to.

558
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,735
What are you saying?

559
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,005
Everyone is talking

560
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,175
about how the genius designer Bella is
reborn as Yoo Yu-jin.

561
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,045
They're all waiting for her next show.

562
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,415
- Chef Moon, I...
- I thought about it,

563
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,355
and this is

564
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,955
the only thing I can do for you.

565
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,935
Yu-jin,

566
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,265
don't worry and just leave.

567
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,135
Do whatever you want,

568
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,645
make whatever clothes you'd like,

569
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,445
and then come back

570
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,185
home.

571
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,665
The village people have prepared
something for you.

572
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,565
Let's go.

573
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,995
<i>- Would you look at that?
- How adorable.</i>

574
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,639
<i>We told her to pick an object</i>

575
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,709
<i>and she's going right to her mom.</i>

576
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,039
<i>Right.</i>

577
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,849
<i>You look so happy
seeing your granddaughter.</i>

578
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,975
<i>That's right.</i>

579
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,515
<i>- Are you that happy?
- Yes.</i>

580
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,419
<i>Yu-jin, come here.</i>

581
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,889
Grandfather...

582
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,129
<i>Over there.</i>

583
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,129
<i>Look at that!</i>

584
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,425
<i>- Adorable.
- There you go.</i>

585
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,895
<i>She chose the thread!
She will have a long life.</i>

586
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,139
<i>No, she grabbed the thread
because her mom is a model.</i>

587
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,339
<i>She's going to make clothes for her!</i>

588
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,935
<i>- Is that right?
- Indeed.</i>

589
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,579
<i>How adorable.</i>

590
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,679
<i>Yu-jin,</i>

591
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,745
<i>are you going to make
clothes for me? That's so sweet!</i>

592
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,719
<i>Then become a designer,</i>

593
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,515
<i>so that you can make me
many pretty clothes, okay?</i>

594
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,485
<i>There you go.</i>

595
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,959
<i>This is so cute.</i>

596
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,229
<i>Just look at her.</i>

597
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,125
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

598
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,235
<i>Look here and smile!</i>

599
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,305
<i>Sir, you look so happy.</i>

600
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,275
<i>Bring some makgeolli!</i>

601
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,145
<i>Let's party all night long.</i>

602
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,515
<i>You're the best, sir.</i>

603
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,235
Thank you, everyone.

604
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,245
Seol-ah.

605
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,155
What's wrong?

606
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,695
Seol-ah.

607
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,175
Here, take this.

608
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,145
You're giving this to me?

609
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,615
You know

610
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,885
how much I love this necklace, right?

611
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,485
- Yes.
- Why then

612
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,425
would I give it to you?

613
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,425
I don't know.

614
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,225
Because I'm going to come back for it.

615
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,005
I love the necklace so much,

616
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,275
so I'm leaving it with you
to come back for it later.

617
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,715
I'm leaving.

618
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,215
You're leaving? Where to?

619
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,385
Don't leave!

620
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,655
Please don't leave.

621
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,765
Seol-ah, don't cry.

622
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,645
I'm not going to take this.

623
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,245
Seol-ah...

624
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,115
Give it to me when you come back.

625
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,725
Promise me that you'll be back.

626
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,855
Here.

627
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,389
Da-hoon, here.

628
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,599
Hold on.

629
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,959
I've got some Nonyang garlic
that Bella loves so much.

630
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,869
Here are some dumplings too.

631
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,039
- Hey, there.
- This is some gochujang.

632
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,969
That's good.

633
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,769
Koreans can't live without gochujang.

634
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,109
That's right.

635
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,509
Should we pack her some more, then?

636
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,075
So, this is the end.

637
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,075
It won't be if you come back.

638
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,245
What's that?

639
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,885
Were you planning on
never seeing us again?

640
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,015
I don't do that.

641
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,855
If it's the end, it's the end.
If it's not, it's not.

642
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,195
Let's not make a promise.

643
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,155
That way,

644
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,995
we'll try our best.

645
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,735
I love you.

646
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,535
What?

647
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,515
I love you.

648
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,755
How can I leave with you saying that?

649
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,055
We can't have

650
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,425
either of us regretting anything.

651
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,595
So, here I am,
checking for the last time.

652
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,210
♫ <i>Love came</i> ♫

653
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,280
♫ <i>From my empty heart</i> ♫

654
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,030
♫ <i>Love has given me a warm hand</i> ♫

655
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,095
Me too.

656
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,665
Checking for one last time.

657
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,275
Goodbye.

658
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:44,500
♫ <i>My dear</i> ♫

659
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,145
Goodbye, everyone.

660
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,445
- Yes.
- Of course.

661
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,585
Seol-ah, you too.

662
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,095
Bye, Seol-ah.

663
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,625
Bye now.

664
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,235
Drive safe.

665
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,639
Bye.

666
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,005
- Bye now!
- Drive safe.

667
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:23,785
<i>(Six months later)</i>

668
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,429
Hello!

669
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,259
You're back from school!

670
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,355
Yes, I am.

671
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,729
I hear that the kitchen renovation
at Pungcheonok is all done.

672
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:38,799
Yes.

673
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,499
All we need is the ssi-ganjang, then.

674
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,709
Let's start with the Hwangs.
I'll lead the way.

675
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,935
Do you really think there's something
so precious as the ssi-ganjang

676
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,539
in our village?

677
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,335
Exactly.

678
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,349
My heart was broken

679
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,849
when all of our ssi-ganjang dried out

680
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,245
from the kitchen fire at Pungcheonok.

681
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,545
That's why I'm going to try to look

682
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,555
for our own ssi-ganjang in the village.

683
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,119
That's meaningful, too.

684
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,589
Come on in first.
We have some old ganjang at home too.

685
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,099
Come and give it a try.

686
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,195
Let's go.

687
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,625
May I give it a try?

688
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,525
Of course.

689
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,235
We don't even need to try it.

690
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,535
This isn't it.

691
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,705
But you still have to give it a try.

692
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,005
Here.

693
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,609
Chef Moon, here.

694
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,949
Where's the next house?

695
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,305
Ms. Byung-chun's house.

696
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,149
Let's start over there
and make our way down.

697
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,515
Sure.

698
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,115
- This is not it.
- That's too bad.

699
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,419
Hyung-nim.

700
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,325
You're here.

701
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,355
- What are you doing?
- Hey there.

702
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,255
I'm just getting my husband lessons.

703
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,299
What are you saying?

704
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,665
- You're looking for the ssi-ganjang?
- Yes.

705
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,215
Is this not it?

706
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,189
Come this way.

707
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,759
This family has good ganjang too.

708
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,155
Hyuk's mom!

709
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,629
Well, in that case, right this way.

710
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,325
Here.

711
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,365
Jang-su!

712
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,869
I'm here.

713
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,809
Hello there.

714
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,869
Thank you so much. Bye now!

715
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,179
You can stay for longer.

716
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,335
This way.

717
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,945
Bye now.

718
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,549
Goodness.

719
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,245
Bye!

720
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,745
This isn't it either?

721
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,945
Yoon-ja's home is the only one left.

722
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,585
Come on. Let's go.

723
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,825
Let's go.

724
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,685
- Sure.
- When are we going to find it?

725
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,999
Let's go.

726
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,095
It's that way.

727
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,899
It smells good.

728
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,999
- What?
- What?

729
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,269
Dad, it smells very similar

730
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,969
to the old ssi-ganjang.

731
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,135
Really?

732
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,695
I think we've found it.

733
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,895
Really?

734
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,009
My grandmother made this ssi-ganjang,

735
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,775
and I've just been adding more to it
when I run out.

736
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,575
Is this really good?

737
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,405
The secret behind your amazing food was

738
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,349
this ganjang all along?

739
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,915
If you'd let me,

740
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,315
I'd like to use this
as Pungcheonok's ssi-ganjang.

741
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,549
Goodness!

742
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,115
Pungcheonok belongs to all of us.

743
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,589
If we can re-open the restaurant
with this ssi-ganjang,

744
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,655
I'd be more than happy to see that.

745
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,755
Does that mean that we can open
Pungcheonok once again?

746
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,095
- Awesome!
- Great!

747
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,599
We found it!

748
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,469
It was right here all along.

749
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,739
What a surprise!

750
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,775
Let's all try some.

751
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,025
Yes, Jang Madame?

752
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,475
Yes, Jang Madame?

753
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,179
I told you,

754
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,045
it's Madame Jang.

755
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,179
Who says Jang Madame?

756
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,979
That doesn't sound respectable at all.

757
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,945
Jang Madame, Madame Jang, same thing.

758
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,019
I'm busy designing
some things. What's up?

759
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,615
Let's make this brief.

760
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,685
Why did you have to buy a winery
all the way in Australia?

761
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,795
There are so many
wineries in France too.

762
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,929
You used to give me such a hard time

763
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,799
because you couldn't work anywhere else
other than at your studio,

764
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,735
<i>but now, you're always there.</i>

765
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,865
<i>You're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?</i>

766
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,265
This is so frustrating.

767
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,235
Stop beating around the bush.

768
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,105
Why did you call?

769
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,305
What?

770
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,205
Right.

771
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,079
When are you going to come back?

772
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,619
It takes over 24 hours

773
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,519
to get from the Gold Coast to Paris.

774
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,889
<i>You should've prepared sooner!</i>

775
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,815
Stop nagging!

776
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,915
I'm not a kid.
I can take care of it on my own.

777
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,285
I'm sick of your nagging.

778
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,185
You're sick of it, aren't you?

779
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,455
I'm mortified by it.

780
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,069
Had I picked up a rock from the ground

781
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,029
and gave it as much attention
as what I've given you,

782
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,895
the rock would've been
flying in the air by now.

783
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,535
Fine.

784
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,635
I'm going to start packing now.

785
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,805
By the way,

786
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,545
how is the other rock doing?

787
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,945
Is she good?

788
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,345
The other rock is quite a girl too.

789
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,389
She struggled at first,

790
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,985
but she's doing quite well now.

791
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,385
She's now used to working here.

792
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,795
We're going to take her with us
starting with the Rookie Designer Show.

793
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,795
<i>If we find anyone with potential,
we'll have them as Hyun-ah's apprentices.</i>

794
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,269
At least that rock listens to me well.

795
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,565
Not all rocks are like you.

796
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,709
There's nobody in this world

797
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,175
that can make my blood
boil like you do.

798
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,235
Come already!

799
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,375
I'm having a hard time putting up
with Ms. Jang's anger.

800
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,775
She's hitting her menopause.

801
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,445
Just try to be good to her.

802
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,485
Right? I thought so.

803
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:29,585
Hey! Yoo Yu-jin! Lim Hyun-ah!

804
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,825
I didn't say the menopause part.

805
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,525
It was Ms. Yu-jin, not me.

806
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,325
<i>I have no idea why I'm here</i>
doing this with you guys.

807
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,035
It's like the whole universe
is forcing us to stay together.

808
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,535
Exactly.

809
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:48,379
Let's be done with this relationship
in this life, okay?

810
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,275
That's my one and only wish.

811
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,175
Hey,

812
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,715
do you not keep in touch

813
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,815
with Chef Moon in Korea anymore?

814
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,815
Why ask?

815
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,725
<i>We sent him an invitation
to your last show,</i>

816
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,859
<i>but he didn't respond.</i>

817
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,095
He didn't respond?

818
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,325
Then he must be over me.

819
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,495
How can you be so ruthless
with your words?

820
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,565
Anyway, come quickly! Bye now.

821
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,505
All right.

858
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,639
- Why did you call me?
- Come and take this.

859
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,339
- Hey there.
- Yes?

860
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,935
- Come here.
- It looks amazing.

861
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,605
Let's put it here.

862
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,225
Chef Moon, I'm hungry.
Give me some food!

863
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,125
Look at who it is!

864
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,495
- Unni!
- Seol-ah!

865
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,939
- Look who it is!
- It's Bella!

866
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,805
- Finally.
- You're here!

867
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,649
Bella is here, everyone.

868
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,475
What took you so long?

869
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:30,989
You're even prettier now.

870
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,089
- Bella is here!
- Have you been staying healthy?

871
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,759
Yes, have you all been well?

872
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,385
- Of course.
- Of course.

873
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,325
Where's Chef Moon?

874
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,015
Yu-jin?

875
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,025
Have you been well?

876
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,885
Unni, you won't
leave again, will you?

877
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,985
Then teach me how to make clothes.

878
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,495
Seol-ah, do you want
to become a designer?

879
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,655
Yes!

880
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,995
- What kind of clothes do you want to make?
- Dresses.

881
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,795
What kind of a dress?

882
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,869
You know, the ones that
people wear at weddings.

883
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,305
Why wedding dresses?

884
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,205
So that Unni won't leave.

885
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,775
What about mine?

886
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,185
Don't worry. I'll make
some for you too.

887
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,285
- Seol-ah.
- Yes?

888
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,425
Here.

889
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,235
You're really giving it to me?

890
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,695

01:03:12,506 --> 01:03:16,209

♫ <i>You keep coming into my eyes</i> ♫

894
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:25,018
♫ <i>Shaking up my heart once again</i> ♫

895
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:28,422
♫ <i>Something feels uncomfortable</i> ♫

896
01:03:28,422 --> 01:03:30,691
♫ <i>Something is making me anxious</i> ♫

897
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:32,793

902
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:48,680

903

♫ <i>How can this be?</i> ♫

905
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,484
♫ <i>Why is this happening to me?</i> ♫

906
01:03:57,484 --> 01:03:59,210
♫ <i>I try to act like everything's fine</i> ♫

907
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,888
♫ <i>But why do you keep shaking me up?</i> ♫

908
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:06,326
♫ <i>Do you still not know my heart?</i> ♫

909
01:04:06,326 --> 01:04:08,662

910
01:04:08,662 --> 01:04:10,764

911
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,134
♫ <i>Will you come to me now?</i> ♫

912
01:04:14,134 --> 01:04:19,339
♫ <i>I want to comfortably hold you</i> ♫

913
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:22,542
♫ <i>Forever</i> ♫
