1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,744
I haven't seen him lately.

2
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,039
-Yes, thank you so much.
-Yes.

3
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,001
What do we do?

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,712
If we don't find him
before the investigation, we're screwed.

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,006
He has been off the grid for days.

6
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,551
He didn't just run off somewhere, right?

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,527
Hello, Mr. Do Ra-ik?

8
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,863
Police station speaking.

9
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,573
Sorry, what?

10
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:18,161
POLICE STATION

11
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,752
Are you his guardian?

12
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,256
I am his lawyer.

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,008
He refused to give his address

14
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,345
and yelled that he had nowhere to go.

15
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,430
Please take him home.

16
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,439
Let's just drop him home.

17
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,566
If we leave him nearby,
he'll go in on his own.

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,111
They said he refuses to go home.

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,614
After all that, how could he return there?

20
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,033
It's his problem!

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,701
So you're taking him to your place?

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,703
There are plenty of motels
or saunas around.

23
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,331
I'll take him somewhere…

24
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,500
If it's too much, hand him over.
I'll carry him.

25
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,336
Forget it, no way you can carry this lump.

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,005
We are almost here, and you say that now.

27
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,389
Is he really an idol? Why is he so heavy?

28
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,940
What kind of torture is this?

29
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,945
This is not right.
Let me just take him to my place.

30
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,281
How could he stay at your place?

31
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,616
You have wiretaps
and all sorts of shady stuff there.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,452
Come out, hurry.

33
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,290
-Still he is a guy, you are not…
-Just go.

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,375
Fine, I'm going.

35
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,879
You don't even offer me
a glass of water.

36
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,806
Is that the only reason?

37
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,851
What is with that disrespectful stare?

38
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,603
I just thought

39
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,189
it's the perfect excuse to unpack
all those sticky personal feelings.

40
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,316
That's not an excuse.

41
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,236
If we dump him anywhere
and he vanishes, we're done.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,864
Seriously, aren't you scared at all?

43
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,324
Scared of what?

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,620
What?

45
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,580
You mean Ra-ik might be a killer?

46
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,790
Yes. Honestly, you don't know yet.

47
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,251
Aren't you scared?

48
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,253
I'm scared.

49
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,130
Right, so then--

50
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,424
Of course, I thought

51
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,885
what if he really did it.

52
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,474
What if all the support I poured into him
helped turn him into a monster.

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,601
That is what really scares me.

54
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,646
But that's a different matter.

55
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,148
Right now, I'm his lawyer.

56
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,402
So I must protect my client to the end.

57
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:10,833
EP03
BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP FOR DEATH

58
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,028
I can't believe

59
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,156
Ra-ik is lying in my house,

60
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,034
in my room, on my bed.

61
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,784
Don't go.

62
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,374
Don't go.

63
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,921
Please don't go.

64
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,111
What?

65
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,714
Are you awake?

66
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,553
That is a relief.
I thought you might not wake up.

67
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,932
What am I even saying?
Get a grip, stay calm.

68
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,438
Nice to see you again.

69
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,233
Mr. Do Ra-ik,

70
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,444
welcome to my home.

71
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,497
Do you not remember?

72
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,250
The police called me last night about you.

73
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,377
You…

74
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,761
The police called me yesterday.

75
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,431
They said you were found drunk in a park.

76
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,351
I didn't know your door code,

77
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,603
and it felt wrong to drop you
at some random motel.

78
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,855
So I brought you here first.

79
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,359
Wait a second!

80
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,487
Wait a second!

81
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,447
It's a summons from the prosecutors.

82
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,451
If you refuse again, they may request
a warrant, and you might be detained.

83
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,621
You can go if you want,
but you still need to take my calls.

84
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,249
If you vanish again, it will drag me down…

85
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,350
Where are you going?

86
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,108
Attorney Maeng!

87
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,154
You're letting him go just like that?

88
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,878
The direct cause of death

89
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,007
is massive blood loss
from this stab wound to the chest.

90
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,219
There are no defensive wounds.

91
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,642
When he was attacked,
the victim was totally unguarded.

92
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,020
So either he never sensed the attacker

93
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,650
or the attacker was someone he trusted.

94
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,276
I knew it.

95
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,613
I keep telling you it was someone he knew.

96
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,741
But here is the odd part.

97
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,829
The blade went cleanly
between the fourth and fifth ribs,

98
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,748
piercing the heart.

99
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,961
That means one single strike
caused a fatal wound.

100
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,758
Didn't you say his blood alcohol level
was high at the time of his arrest?

101
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,845
Plus, he had anti-anxiety meds
and sedatives in him.

102
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,016
How could someone in that state
land such a precise attack?

103
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,561
Well, maybe he just
swung here and it slid in.

104
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,147
It could sort of happen.

105
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,401
In general, it is very hard

106
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,737
to carry out something this exact,
while completely drunk.

107
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,030
You're right.

108
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,451
You said the autopsy
would give us something.

109
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,121
Yet we have nothing solid.

110
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,499
The suspect interview is coming up
and we have no card to play.

111
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm sure that lunatic did it though.

112
00:11:55,673 --> 00:12:00,261
You said no weapon was found at the scene
and Kang Woo-seong's phone is missing too.

113
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,432
If no one else went in or out,
where did all that go?

114
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,268
None of this adds up.

115
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,980
We are widening the CCTV range
and the time window right now.

116
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,025
It rained that day,
so the footage is hard to secure,

117
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,403
but we will get something soon--

118
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,697
You know that in a case

119
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,324
where the suspect denies,
evidence is everything, right?

120
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,659
Of course.

121
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,829
So bring me proof
that ties him to the crime.

122
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,832
-Then we will force a confession.
-Yes.

123
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,213
Execute Do Ra-ik!

124
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,340
-Execute him!
-Execute him!

125
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,093
Bring Kang Woo-seong back to life!

126
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,887
-Bring him back!
-Bring him back!

127
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,639
Execute Do Ra-ik!

128
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,183
-Execute him!
-Execute him!

129
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,643
Bring Kang Woo-seong back to life!

130
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,688
It's like that every day.

131
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,983
Until recently,
I was busy pulling off fans

132
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,652
who kept saying they loved Ra-ik.

133
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:04,366
Hello, I am Jang Han-gu, Ra-ik's manager.
We talked on the phone.

134
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm Attorney Maeng representing Do Ra-ik.

135
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
Yes.

136
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,789
Please have a seat.

137
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,294
Jang Han-gu,

138
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,173
he's been with Gold Boys from the start,

139
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,052
and fans know him for his bad reputation.

140
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,804
F***! Get out of here!

141
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,848
Out!

142
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,105
It must have been rough.

143
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,858
I heard you found
the scene first that night.

144
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,945
Well, yes.

145
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,239
I still can't believe it.

146
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,575
There was someone else there too, right?

147
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,160
The housekeeper at Do Ra-ik's place.

148
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,328
Mrs. Cheongju?

149
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:53,123
I heard she is the only one
with a key card to his place.

150
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,252
I'm wondering if she has ever lost it.

151
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,422
I don't think so, she's very thorough.

152
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,758
She has been working at Ra-ik's place

153
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,428
for nearly ten years
and nothing like that has ever happened.

154
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,681
That's why he trusts her.

155
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,936
He's right.
She's well-known among the fans too.

156
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,274
Ra-ik always mentioned her
whenever he thanked people.

157
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,318
You can come in.

158
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,743
Sir, this is Attorney Maeng Se-na.

159
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,542
Hello.

160
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,502
Hello.

161
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,089
Geum Bo-sang, CEO of Goldie Entertainment.

162
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,432
He squeezed every last drop
out of our boys with no days off,

163
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,643
and this is how luxuriously he lives.

164
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,064
And the second the scandal hit,
he hurried to review the contract.

165
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,235
What a heartless bastard.

166
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,363
No, it's just a rumor.

167
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,534
We did review terminating
our contract with Ra-ik,

168
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,077
but never carried it out.

169
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,663
Nothing has been proven yet.

170
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,832
But I saw a press release

171
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,752
saying you were canceling
your exclusive contract with him.

172
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,296
Calming the shareholders
had to come first.

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,798
We needed to show

174
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,010
the company was responding quickly
to the incident, that's all it was.

175
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,767
The night it happened,
you two were together right?

176
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,393
Yes.

177
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,648
We had to settle accounts
after the concert.

178
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,402
Did anything else happen that day?

179
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,198
Anything like Do Ra-ik
and Kang Woo-seong fighting or something…

180
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:54,578
No. They have never fought. Not once.

181
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,458
I even spoke with Woo-seong
briefly that night,

182
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,627
and he sounded totally normal.

183
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,713
Around what time did you two talk?

184
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,507
I don't know.

185
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,052
What time was it? Let me check.

186
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,053
Yes.

187
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,725
You're here. Have a seat.

188
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,103
It's Jae-hee and Young-bin.

189
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,565
They're in Gold Boys
with Ra-ik and Woo-seong.

190
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,777
This is Choi Jae-hee and Lee Young-bin.

191
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,280
No one knows those two
better than they do.

192
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,782
So I called them in.

193
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,623
I am Attorney Maeng Se-na
from Cheon-un Law Firm.

194
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,333
I am representing Do Ra-ik in this case.

195
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,672
Thank you for your time.
I already had some questions.

196
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,966
To understand what happened,

197
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,593
we need a clear picture
of before and after.

198
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:57,307
I heard you all met at Ra-ik's concert
the day before the incident.

199
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,019
Could you tell me
more about what happened then?

200
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,820
There was nothing special.

201
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:18,787
But I heard all the members
were set to guest at his concert,

202
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,998
and it was cancelled

203
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:25,085
-because of a conflict among the members.
-Who said that?

204
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,046
How was your relationship
with Ra-ik usually?

205
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,464
We were fine. Why?

206
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,883
-Jae-hee.
-She keeps asking weird questions.

207
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,387
I read all the gossip about you.

208
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,807
You free criminals all the time,
and people tear you apart for it.

209
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,768
-How can someone do that?
-Choi Jae-hee!

210
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,728
Woo-seong is dead!

211
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,981
Because of that psycho.

212
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,068
Everyone knows

213
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,154
what he is like, how violent he was.

214
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,949
He would smash things and swear
whenever he didn't like something.

215
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,993
He even beat me up on the concert day too.

216
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,203
Beat him up?

217
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,290
Then the rumor about Ra-ik
hitting the members was true.

218
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,125
Once you see this,

219
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,044
there is no way
you can defend that bastard.

220
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,465
Look. See what he did to Woo-seong.

221
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
-Ra-ik.
-Woo-seong! I'm…

222
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,724
You didn't tell me…

223
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,769
Don't try to control everything yourself…

224
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,901
There is no one. No one.

225
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,239
No one who truly believes
he's not the killer.

226
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,534
The mother of singer Do Ra-ik,
identified as a murder suspect,

227
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,913
has released a statement
about his alleged charges, causing a stir.

228
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,457
In an interview, she insisted

229
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,003
her son would never do such a thing
and firmly defended his innocence.

230
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,422
But she added that
if he did commit any wrongdoing,

231
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,134
he should come clean even now
and atone for it…

232
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,094
You should've prevented that!

233
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,056
Because of that article,
our market cap dropped by 10%.

234
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,228
Fine, I will deal with
cutting him loose or whatever.

235
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,397
Just focus on shutting down
those reports for now.

236
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,024
Wait…

237
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,652
I'll call you back.

238
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,907
It's okay.

239
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,372
Where have you been all this time?
You wouldn't answer your phone.

240
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,667
I've been looking for you.

241
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,253
Why?

242
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,297
So you can cancel my contract?

243
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,801
Tell me what happened with Woo-seong.

244
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,261
If I explain,

245
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,805
will you even believe me?

246
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,808
That depends on the story you tell.

247
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,313
Right now, just cleaning up the mess
from your ruined solo promotions

248
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,442
-is already costing us this much--
-Woo-seong is dead!

249
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,737
He's dead, and you care only about money?

250
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,991
To you, is that all he was?
Just another loss?

251
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,284
What about you?

252
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,703
To you, what was Woo-seong?

253
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,872
What are you talking about?

254
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,334
-You know that he and I--
-No, I know nothing.

255
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,670
You are the only one
who knows what happened that night

256
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,839
and who can prove that you are innocent.

257
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,343
Until that is proven,
there is nothing we can do for you.

258
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,887
Not even believe you.

259
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,558
So, in the end,

260
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,144
you are just throwing me away.

261
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,107
By now,

262
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,320
your house and car are probably
all under provisional seizure.

263
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,282
Your mom took out too many loans
under your name.

264
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,536
With this case, they think
you will never be able to pay it back,

265
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,039
so the creditors are moving very fast.

266
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,379
Even now, your mother is…

267
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,926
taking money
and giving interviews everywhere.

268
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,181
I'm doing everything I can
to contain that.

269
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:14,106
This is the last thing I can do for you.

270
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,340
Mrs. Do Mi-kyung?

271
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,637
"Maeng Se-na"?

272
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,307
You came running the moment I called.

273
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,018
How did you even get my number?

274
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,645
You left your contact in a lot of places,

275
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,147
volunteering for interviews.

276
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,150
It's my son. I have to give my side too.

277
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,276
Is that so wrong?

278
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,155
If you keep giving interviews
in the middle of all this,

279
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,491
it can spread wrong information
or twist how people see the case.

280
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
Twisted?

281
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,414
I know my son better than anyone.
That is why I talk.

282
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:18,253
There is no one else on this planet
who would take that brat's side but me.

283
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,299
I gave him everything he has,

284
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,551
and all I got back was betrayal.

285
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,723
He sued his own mom for a bit of money.
There's nothing he wouldn't do.

286
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,894
Ma'am, nothing has been proven yet.

287
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,354
Yes, not yet.

288
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:41,443
But he might have done it.
Then what? If he did wrong, he should pay.

289
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,072
That is how I raised him.

290
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,658
But still he's my son.

291
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,787
How much can I get?

292
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,874
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

293
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,753
I know you're trying to make a living too.

294
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,674
Truth is always made
out of money anyway. Right?

295
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,595
I'm just asking for a little courtesy.

296
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,559
Are you asking me for a payoff?

297
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,522
My mouth's gotten pretty valuable lately.

298
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,524
Even reporters are paying me.

299
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,954
There's a song your son composed
on Gold Boys' first album.

300
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,583
He said he wrote it
thinking about his childhood.

301
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,587
I finally understand
why it sounded so sad.

302
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,050
I don't know everything between you two.

303
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,055
But there is one thing I do know for sure.

304
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,641
Your son sang for people,

305
00:23:55,892 --> 00:24:00,063
so they could endure, lean on something,

306
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,108
so they could find hope again.

307
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,819
But it seems that song

308
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,905
never reached you.

309
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,574
Sadly.

310
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,951
What are you talking about?

311
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,208
From now on, I strongly advise you
to stop talking to the press.

312
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:24,421
If another interview comes out
that harms Do Ra-ik even a little,

313
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,882
I will file criminal charges
for defamation

314
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,967
and claim damages.

315
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,636
I will use every legal option I have.

316
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,930
Then.

317
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,352
Hey!

318
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,531
How can people all be like this…

319
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,915
Yes, Chung-jae.

320
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,042
What?

321
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,300
What do we do?
I told you to keep a close eye on him!

322
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:14,512
He went in through the back door,
so I thought he would come out that way!

323
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,934
If you had told me about the GPS earlier,

324
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,143
we would not be doing this!

325
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,353
If I told you,

326
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,272
you would just call me a stalker again.
How was I supposed to say it!

327
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,690
Anyway, just get here fast!

328
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,163
-So you didn't text the others at all?
-I told you I didn't.

329
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,124
If we said we'd meet yesterday,
you should've reached out right away.

330
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,377
-Then you ask them to meet.
-Then what's the point?

331
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,546
I mean, I was going to say…

332
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,340
Those looks familiar…

333
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052
What?

334
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,766
-Look at that.
-What is it?

335
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,226
You idiot! Look close.

336
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,103
Those are Nice Universal Gold Limited.

337
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
Wow, you're right.

338
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,940
-Only a hundred exist worldwide, right?
-Right.

339
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,900
-They must be fake.
-Let us check.

340
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,002
Hey!

341
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,213
Take them off.

342
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,091
-What?
-Take them off.

343
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,343
-I can tell if they are real.
-I'm sure they're fake.

344
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,470
That's not Universal Gold.
It's fake, right?

345
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,978
Even trash like this gets to breathe.

346
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,022
This punk lost his mind.

347
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,190
Hey.

348
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,026
-You got a death wish?
-Yes.

349
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,111
Right.

350
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,780
I do want to die.

351
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,116
So help me out.

352
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,368
Kill me.

353
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,495
Go on. Kill me!

354
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,416
Wait, aren't you…

355
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,463
Right? You're the Gold Boys guy
who killed someone?

356
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,548
Holy crap!

357
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,300
Really?

358
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,302
Yeah, wow!

359
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,018
Damn it.

360
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,066
Stomp him!

361
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,154
Damn you.

362
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,073
Murderer!

363
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,824
Damn.

364
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,753
Hey! Your salary is down by 20%!

365
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,258
Why is it my fault he went that way?

366
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,637
Let me come with you!

367
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,448
Should I sell this?

368
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,868
-This video will blow up.
-I am telling you these are the real deal.

369
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,828
Let me try them on.

370
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,954
-Get lost!
-Excuse me.

371
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,041
Where is the owner
of those shoes right now?

372
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,295
-Who's this lady?
-I'm the owner of these shoes. Why?

373
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,134
You want to hang out with me, right?

374
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,386
You want to check out my shoes…

375
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,055
-What the heck!
-Why are you blocking the way?

376
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,766
Let go! Damn it!

377
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,851
Move out!

378
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,438
Who are you? Why are you picking a fight?

379
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
You bastard!

380
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,865
-I am so sorry.
-What is wrong with you?

381
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,032
We don't have time. Talk.

382
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,746
Where is the owner of
those Nice Universal Gold Limited's?

383
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,136
Ra-ik?

384
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,138
Are you okay?

385
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,848
Are you hurt badly?

386
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,392
Lift your head a little.

387
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,395
-It is too loud.
-What?

388
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,064
It's so loud, I'm going crazy.

389
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,860
This damn song just won't stop.

390
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,571
It keeps repeating in my head.

391
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,990
Saying it should've been me who died.

392
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,076
To end everything right now.

393
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,914
But why am I such an idiot?
I can't even do that.

394
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,516
I know it was something…

395
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,020
unbearably painful and horrible.

396
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:22,445
I know you want to give up everything.

397
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,247
But still…

398
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,252
for the sake of the person we lost,

399
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,754
we have to find the truth of that night.

400
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:46,803
We cannot give up… until the end.

401
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,434
Until then…

402
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,981
I will stay by your side.

403
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,944
Until you get every answer back.

404
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,880
PROFILE: GWAK BYUNG-GYUN

405
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,800
So the suspect is denying the crime?

406
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,302
Yes.

407
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,721
Right now, there isn't enough evidence
to get a confession.

408
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,600
And the defense is pushing that
a third party may have entered the scene,

409
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,602
which seems somewhat plausible.

410
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,896
We may have to redirect
the investigation that way.

411
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,774
So the prosecutor
is redirecting the investigation

412
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,027
based on the defense's claims.

413
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,706
Byung-gyun.

414
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,750
Yes.

415
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,335
What do you think a prosecutor is?

416
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,088
A prosecutor is a guardian of the law

417
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,840
-who seeks justice and truth--
-No.

418
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,342
That's not what a prosecutor is.

419
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,262
A prosecutor is someone
who gets a confession.

420
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,893
With or without evidence,
once they choose a suspect,

421
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,772
they don't let go
until that person confesses.

422
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,274
That's a prosecutor.

423
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,360
Yes.

424
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,405
It's a case of two people,
and one ends up dead.

425
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,075
What's so hard about that?

426
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,038
I apologize.
I tried to consider other possibilities.

427
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:19,998
You know…

428
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,044
how much effort it took
to get this case assigned to you, right?

429
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,131
A case you can win
without lifting a finger,

430
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,843
and with this much
public attention doesn't come often.

431
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,513
If you play it right,
and raise your value,

432
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,266
it'll lead you straight into politics.

433
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,812
I handed you the prey everyone wanted.

434
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,899
-Finish it without a mistake.
-I will keep that in mind.

435
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,654
And that defense lawyer…

436
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,906
She went to the same high school as you.

437
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,075
Is that so?

438
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,828
But with over five hundred in a grade,

439
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,080
-I can't know everyone--
-Among those five hundred,

440
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,249
she kept taking first place over you.

441
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,293
Until she dropped out.

442
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,173
Her name was Maeng Se-na, right?

443
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,595
Maeng Se-na.

444
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,473
Maeng Se-na.

445
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,101
Stinky.

446
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,313
Stinky.

447
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,230
KILLER

448
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,987
What now, Maeng Se-na?

449
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,655
Poor thing.

450
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,244
Stinky.

451
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,499
Your eyes are seriously scary.

452
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,043
What?

453
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,463
Thinking of taking someone down too?

454
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,227
Damn it.

455
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,484
Talk about bad timing.

456
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,239
Why did it have to rain that night?

457
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,703
I keep replaying it,
but there's nothing to see.

458
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,416
If the NVR hadn't broken,
this would've been an easy case.

459
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,502
-What about the residents?
-Same as always.

460
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,881
Whenever I try to ask around,
they panic about property prices dropping.

461
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,635
-No one gives a straight answer.
-Rookie, you got anything?

462
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,304
Yes, sir.

463
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,181
Can you look at this? Something feels off.

464
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,434
What is it?

465
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,985
That night, he said he went to
the convenience store while drinking.

466
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,653
To buy more alcohol.

467
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,824
Right, but that's way outside
the estimated time of death.

468
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,035
Yeah, but this part is just weird.

469
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,788
He said he went out to buy alcohol,
but he didn't buy anything.

470
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,373
He just left.

471
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,709
And

472
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,086
he definitely came in from the right side,

473
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,547
but he went out from the left.

474
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,800
So I checked the map,
and that path is actually a hiking trail.

475
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,468
Nothing around it.

476
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,305
That's strange.

477
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,058
Why would he take a mountain trail
when there's a good main road?

478
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,351
Maybe it's just a habit?

479
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,729
He's an idol,
so maybe for body management.

480
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,773
Nothing happens just because.

481
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,276
Everything has a reason.

482
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,196
Pull every CCTV within five kilometers

483
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,490
between this store and that trail.

484
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,117
Okay?

485
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,912
There's definitely something there.

486
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,699
Back then…

487
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,915
it felt like there was no place anywhere
in the world for me.

488
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,792
GOLD CABARET

489
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:38,714
In a world so sorrowful

490
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:43,386
With so many people breaking apart

491
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,100
After countless years had passed

492
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:55,815
A love suddenly appeared

493
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,401
Maybe things will change
if I stand up there?

494
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,279
One that had given its own life

495
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,328
Come out for a second.

496
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,288
-Why?
-Hurry!

497
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,123
Okay.

498
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:19,672
A rose of love blooms only in a heart

499
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:26,178
That knows true, sincere love

500
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:32,935
Without hatred

501
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,603
So I tried standing there once.

502
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,023
When you give love endlessly

503
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,816
Only then did people finally look at me.

504
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,907
Hundreds of flowers bloom

505
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,993
Ra-ik is really good.

506
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,705
You can go to my beautiful
Long-yearned starland

507
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,665
Awesome, Ra-ik!

508
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,043
But…

509
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,182
Hey, sit here.

510
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,645
Stay here.

511
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,029
The place I had wanted so badly
suddenly grew too big for me.

512
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,539
It slowly started to swallow me whole.

513
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,750
I don't like that now.

514
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,919
I don't like doing this.

515
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,221
Ra-ik, you like singing.

516
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,268
I already got paid in full by Mr. Geum.

517
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,442
So you have to be worth the money.

518
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,419
By the time, I realized
that everything I had was already gone.

519
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,432
PEPPER FESTIVAL

520
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,308
A TROT PRODIGY - DO RA-IK

521
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,519
GOLD CABARET

522
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,450
You bastard!

523
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,794
That's when I met him.

524
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:15,139
That idiot who stood beside me
and took every blow the world threw at us.

525
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,735
Let's go.

526
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,990
Take me with you!

527
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,418
Thanks to that annoying kid,

528
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,213
I could endure everything.

529
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,310
The failures…

530
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,318
and the successes.

531
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,631
When we were together,
there was nothing to be afraid of.

532
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,717
There really wasn't.

533
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,144
When did it become like this?

534
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
Anyway, that's all.

535
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,036
That night, Woo-seong and I just drank.

536
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,706
We listened to music,

537
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,126
laughed, and talked.

538
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,471
Then can you tell me…

539
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,475
Do I have such a control?

540
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,855
What happened that day?

541
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,900
Where did you get this?

542
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,113
Where it came from isn't what matters.

543
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,743
What matters is
that someone saw you two fighting.

544
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,411
We were not fighting.

545
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,372
When we practice, we bicker
and snap at each other sometimes.

546
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,543
The concert was close and I was on edge.

547
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:55,966
Are you sure?

548
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,011
Yes, I'm sure.

549
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,016
Saying it out loud makes it clearer.

550
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,560
I'm not the killer.

551
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,729
So just like you said,

552
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,650
I'll get my memories back.

553
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:22,743
And my place got seized or whatever.

554
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:27,081
So I think
I'll have to stay here for a while.

555
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,291
What? What did you say?

556
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,543
Like you said,
if I stay at a hotel or something

557
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,171
and run into people, it'll get noisy.

558
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,092
And I don't want to be alone
in some unfamiliar place either.

559
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,261
You said you'd stay by my side.

560
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,392
MAENG SE-NA'S PERSONAL RECORD

561
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,726
PROSECUTOR GWAK BYUNG-GYUN

562
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,146
How did that face turn out like this…

563
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,857
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

564
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,944
Summon Do Ra-ik to appear.

565
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,862
If he ignores it again,
we'll seek a warrant.

566
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,077
Prosecutor Gwak. Are you busy?

567
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,662
Always.

568
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,548
Wow, what a wide window.

569
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,885
And the sunlight… amazing.

570
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,303
Is that marble?

571
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,935
Come on, just once.

572
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,688
You know my father-in-law
is a major figure in the business world.

573
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,358
Get close to our family and your career
becomes a highway, an Autobahn--

574
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,820
Then why is your career path
like some winding mountain pass?

575
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,615
Hey, don't be like that.
My sister-in-law is really pretty.

576
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,919
Why should I show you my dashcam?

577
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,463
You got a warrant?

578
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,133
That damn warrant.

579
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,845
Boss, he's not picking up?

580
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,682
What is he doing? I'm going nuts.

581
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,066
I've met Chairman Hong
a few times in private.

582
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,570
He's been close with my father for years.

583
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,782
And I went to law school
with your brother-in-law,

584
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,118
so we've got quite a connection.

585
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,120
So I only get one hour with you?

586
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,331
Sorry?

587
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,878
Family, job, weather,
even if we squeeze all of that,

588
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,298
it barely lasts an hour.

589
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,218
I heard prosecutors go on blind dates
three or four times a week.

590
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:49,515
So I thought you just wanted
to rush through another boring one.

591
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,644
Then what should we talk about
to make it fun?

592
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,811
Well…

593
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,150
What about the case you are handling now?

594
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,069
I don't think that's a fun topic.

595
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,279
Is that idol actually the killer?

596
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,908
I can't talk about the case.
It could be an info leak.

597
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,035
I don't think he did it.

598
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,870
It's too obvious.

599
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,542
Real life is not like a story.
Most cases do have obvious answers.

600
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,212
But the arrest warrant was denied
for lack of evidence.

601
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:26,301
Isn't the denial rate only about 20%?

602
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,345
You broke that statistic.

603
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,474
You know quite a bit about the law.

604
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,894
I studied hard
because I was curious about you.

605
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,564
We might end up sharing a bed for life.

606
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,234
I always want my team to win.

607
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,237
Then you don't have to worry.

608
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,864
For prosecutors like me,

609
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:52,744
one touch of the file,
and I know if it's indictable or not.

610
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,163
Same with suspects.

611
00:47:55,664 --> 00:48:01,712
One look in their eyes
and I can tell if they did it or not.

612
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,382
Isn't that a bit arrogant?

613
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,509
What if they're proven innocent?

614
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,969
That won't happen.

615
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,472
That idol is the culprit.

616
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,185
Your phone's been buzzing for a while.

617
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
You're right. Excuse me.

618
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,459
About Do Ra-ik's routes
I mentioned last time…

619
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,085
That mountain detour.

620
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,130
We found a taxi
that passed there around that time.

621
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:50,719
But the driver won't cooperate.
Feels like he's hiding something.

622
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,930
So you need a warrant right now?

623
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,267
Yes, right away. Are you out somewhere?

624
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,187
Got it. I'll request a warrant
and call you.

625
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,421
RECEIPT

626
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,641
I can't.

627
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,853
This isn't right.

628
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,816
How am I supposed to face…

629
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,069
Did you do something wrong?

630
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,491
You said you did nothing wrong.

631
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:43,582
If you don't go,
people will misunderstand you even more.

632
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,712
And this is your friend's last farewell.

633
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,007
You will regret it

634
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,885
if you don't say goodbye.

635
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,282
From now on,

636
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,452
focus on just one thing.

637
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:24,247
CHURCH

638
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,216
Erase every emotion from your face.

639
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,886
Mr. Do Ra-ik, do you admit to the charges?

640
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,514
Do you admit to the charges?

641
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,182
Please say a few words.

642
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,310
How do you feel at this moment?

643
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,160
Wipe out all fear
and anxiety from your heart.

644
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,171
Focus only

645
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,884
on your own heart.

646
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,261
KANG WOO-SEONG

647
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,014
Think only of this last greeting…

648
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,934
to the person in front of you.

649
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,319
Mr. Do Ra-ik, please say a word.

650
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,945
-Mr. Do Ra-ik!
-Mr. Do Ra-ik!

651
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,323
Please say a few words.

652
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,245
I am sorry, but Mr. Do Ra-ik
is here to mourn Kang Woo-seong today.

653
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,080
If you have questions,
ask the prosecution…

654
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,587
Woo-seong was my one and only friend.

655
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,673
I will do everything I can

656
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,801
so the real killer will be revealed.

657
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,721
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation in every way I can.

658
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:48,391
I will find the killer to the very end.

659
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,908
I found it!

660
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,827
Seriously.

661
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,412
Hurry, look.

662
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,289
What is it?

663
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,461
Here, this is Do Ra-ik.

664
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,631
-But then…
-Yes.

665
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,841
I knew there was something…

666
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,803
Wait, what is that?

667
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:48,201
What's his game?
Why isn't he investigating?

668
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,247
You must be very busy.
We'll come back another day.

669
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,456
Where are you from?

670
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,917
Sorry?

671
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,460
Not you.

672
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,629
I meant the attorney.

673
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,339
You look familiar.

674
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,260
I won't answer personal questions.

675
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,513
Of course. That would be rude of me, okay.

676
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,184
Still the same. Arrogant and prickly.

677
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,311
Excuse me?

678
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,396
I said, have a seat.

679
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,356
I have something to show you.

680
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,566
Have a seat please.

681
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,077
You said you went
to the convenience store that night

682
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,622
because you ran out of alcohol, right?

683
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,207
But it shows

684
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,752
you left empty-handed.

685
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,593
I couldn't find what I was looking for,
so I just left. Took a shortcut.

686
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,847
You mean that hiking trail
with no CCTV and no streetlights?

687
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:55,894
But the thing is,
it takes you farther from your house.

688
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,106
On a dark night,
with a friend waiting at home,

689
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,816
you chose a longer detour.

690
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,527
Isn't that odd?

691
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:09,407
Prosecutor, your question
is based on subjective speculation.

692
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,076
Please refrain from that conjecture.

693
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,369
My apologies.

694
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,663
But in our line of work,

695
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:20,794
we take past events and drag them back
into the present every day,

696
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:24,714
piecing them together
in a way that makes sense.

697
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,176
To reveal the truth
someone is trying so hard to hide.

698
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,477
It took you about 40 minutes
to get back home.

699
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,772
Even with the detour,

700
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,068
it shouldn't have taken
more than 20 minutes.

701
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,029
Why did it take so long?

702
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,784
As you know,

703
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:57,413
any inconsistency in your client's story
is being recorded right now.

704
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,792
How the court will see that,
is up to the judges.

705
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:07,841
Let's not rob your client
of his last chance to be honest.

706
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,053
I'll ask again.

707
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,013
Mr. Do Ra-ik,

708
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,474
think carefully before you answer.

709
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:23,148
Why did you go there that night?

710
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,123
I told you.

711
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,959
You have to tell me everything!
That's the only way I can help you!

712
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,210
I told you, I forgot.

713
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,171
How do you forget
something that important…

714
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,340
You didn't forget, did you?

715
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,802
You are hiding something
from me, right? What is it?

716
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,262
I already told you.

717
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,807
I went to the convenience store.
They didn't have what I needed, so I left.

718
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,935
-I took the long way back for exercise.
-You expect me to believe that?

719
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,612
Mr. Do Ra-ik, hey!

720
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,538
Is the interrogation already over?

721
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,665
Why? Did you find something?

722
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,627
We found it.

723
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,670
But…

724
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,465
-We found something and…
-What is it?

725
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,425
Well…

726
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,596
There's someone he met that night.

727
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,475
And that person is…

728
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,022
Mr. Do Ra-ik…

729
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,567
wait.

730
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,823
I'm your attorney.

731
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,077
Do you not remember
the one condition I gave you?

732
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,330
You were to tell me everything as it is,
what you saw, what you heard,

733
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,124
even what you dreamed
on the night of the incident.

734
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,585
I said I wouldn't take the case
without that.

735
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,712
But if you are already
hiding things from me--

736
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,005
I'm not hiding anything.

737
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,009
I just got confused.
Everything's all mixed up in my head--

738
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,136
No, you are lying.

739
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,806
Your neck is turning red
and your eyes are darting.

740
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,391
That's your lying habit!

741
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,020
How do you know that?

742
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,482
Only people really close to me
know about that.

743
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,363
Attorney Maeng!

744
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:07,979
Ra-ik!

745
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,203
We thought that person
was Do Ra-ik's accomplice.

746
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,999
But it looks like…

747
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,261
She was trying to kill him.

748
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,676
Feelings don't matter.
Ah, he's a guy too.

749
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:07,140
At his age,
you think he's never dated anyone?

750
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,474
What are you doing?

751
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,143
Get it together, Maeng Se-na!

752
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,436
He's just a client.

753
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,312
I saw it that night.

754
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,230
Answer me!

755
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,356
Where were you that night?

756
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,400
Do you realize
how cornered you are right now?

757
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,069
How am I supposed to trust you
and defend you, Mr. Do Ra-ik?

758
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,696
If I could,

759
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,407
I want to be distant again.

760
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:30,663
