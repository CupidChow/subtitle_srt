1
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,345
How did you get here?

2
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,765
Were you checking up on me?

3
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,896
What about you?
I was so worried about you,

4
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
and you were here, like this?

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,357
Since when?

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,944
I told you already.
Don't come near me again.

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,237
Answer me first!

8
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,782
How long have you been here
with that woman?!

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,241
Why does that matter?

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,037
We were over a long time ago.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,373
-You can't just show up like this--
-We never broke up.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,251
How…

13
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,545
How could we ever be over?

14
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,052
Back then, I was too scared.

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,597
I thought letting you go was the only way.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,934
So you could be happy.

17
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,103
But things changed.

18
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,480
You're hurting so much now.

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,442
You need me.

20
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,947
No.

21
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,117
No, I don't.

22
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,245
When you left me, you said

23
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,249
I ruined your life.

24
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,167
You were right.

25
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,586
You can't make that same mistake.

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,091
-La-ik, that's not--
-Right now, I don't need help.

27
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,301
I don't need your care.

28
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,430
So leave me alone.

29
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,808
Please.

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,394
Then what about her?

31
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,273
What is she to you?

32
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,570
Why are you keeping her by your side?

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,241
She's the only one I can trust right now.

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,082
After we ended that way,
I struggled a lot.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,587
So I tried treatment, meds, everything…

36
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,798
but nothing worked.

37
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,012
But lately, I've been off my meds.

38
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,473
Even after losing Woo-seong,
even when it almost killed me…

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,352
I'm still standing,

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,396
thanks to her.

41
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,275
So if you do care about me…

42
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,237
don't ever show up in front of me again.

43
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,562
You don't have to worry anymore.

45
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,371
Why did you act like you didn't know?

46
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,915
You knew everything. Why?

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,001
Was it fun?

48
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,671
Knowing everything
I'd done behind your back,

49
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,548
pretending you didn't,
acting like you cared about my feelings.

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,636
It must have been fun for you.

51
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,185
I tried to protect you.

52
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,522
What?

53
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,486
Both of us.

54
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,700
If that article came out,
your family would never let this slide.

55
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,578
I couldn't ruin your life
over something like that.

56
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,914
Ruin my life?

57
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,877
You already did.

58
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,341
I ended up being like this
all because of you.

59
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,511
You abandoned me!

60
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,930
You ignored me and left me alone!

61
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,563
Right. You're right.

62
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,649
This is all my fault.

63
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,989
I'll walk away. If that's what you want…

65
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,245
Walk away?

66
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,539
And what would you be then?

67
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,626
Don't flatter yourself.
You're nothing to me.

68
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,715
I gave you a little attention
and you thought you were someone?

69
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,427
You were a kid dragging debt

70
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,346
behind a gambling addict mom,
performing in shabby venues.

71
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,807
Got famous and now you think
you're special?

72
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,061
Why would you say it like that?

73
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,563
You could just say you're sorry!

74
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,316
Why should I be sorry? You should be!

75
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,363
I was here the whole time!

76
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,657
You acted like I didn't exist.

77
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,535
You lied to the world about me!

78
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,219
Was I really…

79
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,388
nothing to you?

80
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,769
Hye-joo, please.

81
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,943
Can't you see me?
The real me, not the shell.

82
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,153
Can't you love me that way?

83
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,324
And what is there…

84
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,995
besides that shell?

85
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,473
Mr. Nam,

86
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,060
did you look into the lawyer I mentioned?

87
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,812
We're in contact with Yultae.

88
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,856
We should be able to wrap it up soon.

89
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,316
Make sure they've got
over ten years on the bench.

90
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,571
And La-ik's house,
it's under seizure, right?

91
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,824
Check the debt too.

92
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,117
Yes.

93
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,190
Attorney Maeng?

94
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,900
You awake?

95
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,952
You said it'd help
tomorrow's interrogation,

96
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,538
so I wrote down people around me.

97
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,750
I'll leave it here.

98
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,229
You were startled earlier?

99
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,568
Sorry.

100
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,279
I don't know why,

101
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,031
but I fall apart around you.

102
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,204
But I guess I really have no shame.

103
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,958
Inside this fence you built for me,

104
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,128
I feel lighter than I have in a long time.

105
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,923
So I want to stay a little longer.

106
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,386
I know it must be exhausting for you
to defend someone like me,

107
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,641
but I'll try my best too.

108
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,803
DO LA-IK'S RELATIONSHIP CHART

109
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,391
HONG HYE-JOO, NOT RELATED.

110
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,363
Anyway, remember three things.

111
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,866
First, don't get defensive when responding
to Choi Jae-hee's statement.

112
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,243
Just answer what you know.

113
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,161
Second,

114
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,873
if you don't understand a question,
ask what it means first.

115
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,418
What? Did you buy a new car?

116
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,504
No. It's just a rental for now.

117
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,964
You sure you can drive?
Do you want me to do it?

118
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,883
I'm fine. I can handle it.

119
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,475
-You're really okay?
-Yes.

120
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,519
And lastly, the most important part.

121
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,898
Since he's close to you,
it might be emotionally difficult.

122
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,192
No matter what he says,

123
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,944
don't lose your temper.

124
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,113
Come on, what would I get upset about?

125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,241
Don't worry.
There's no way that'll happen.

126
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,744
Hey! Stop lying!

127
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,206
See? He was always like this.

128
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,835
With Woo-seong, he'd blow up like that
and pick fights all the time.

129
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,422
-They even got physical more than once.
-When did I ever!

130
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,926
So he frequently had conflicts
with Kang Woo-seong?

131
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,179
Yeah. He was a tyrant.

132
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,932
He'd threaten Woo-seong,
saying he'd kill him.

133
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,308
That's a biased claim.

134
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,229
And the witness already
has a history of lying about his alibi.

135
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,814
This is a one-sided statement

136
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,984
-with zero credibility--
-We're saying it because we have evidence.

137
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,989
Mr. Do La-ik?

138
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,617
I heard you had contract issues
with Goldie Entertainment.

139
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,662
According to Choi Jae-hee,

140
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,664
you were preparing to quit the group.

141
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,501
Wow… You still believe that trash rumor?

142
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,627
It's not a rumor.

143
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,797
I heard it myself.

144
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,924
What?

145
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,509
That day, Woo-seong found out

146
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,637
this jerk was planning to leave Gold Boys.

147
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,766
He knew he'd already been talking
to another agency.

148
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,226
He went to stop him.

149
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,729
What are you… Jae-hee.

150
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,439
Please, stop lying.

151
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,524
You stop lying!

152
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,026
That day…

153
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,785
Here.

154
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,001
Why is that psycho
so obsessed with me all the time!

155
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,503
He never did that.

156
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,421
He cares about you so much.

157
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,132
Cares?

158
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,010
Someone who cares doesn't sneak around.

159
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,179
He already signed

160
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,517
a secret solo deal with another company.

161
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,103
That's why our comeback was canceled,
and he released his solo.

162
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,564
He wants one big score before running.

163
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,816
Where did you hear that?

164
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,613
My friend works
in the support team of that company.

165
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,158
It is confirmed.
He already took a huge advance.

166
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,537
I'm going to leak this
to the press tomorrow.

167
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,747
This is straight-up tampering.

168
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,500
-Once this comes out, he's finished.
-No.

169
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,252
What?

170
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,296
It is not confirmed yet.

171
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,800
I'll talk to La-ik tomorrow
and check it myself.

172
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,803
So don't tell anyone until then. Got it?

173
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,685
What are you doing, guys?

174
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,771
What are you talking about?

175
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,106
Nothing.

176
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,734
He went to meet that jerk…

177
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,445
and he ended up like that.

178
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,450
He definitely killed him!

179
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,579
If everything he was scheming came out,

180
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,455
his life would've been over,
so he took out…

181
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,915
No.

182
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,751
No. I never killed him.

183
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,461
Do Mi-gyeong is your mother, right?

184
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,842
We checked the transfer
of the advance payment to her account.

185
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,262
You used her account

186
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,264
so it would not trace back to you?

187
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,839
I will find out what happened.

188
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,633
Do you know…

189
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,346
where my mom is right now?

190
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,308
INTERROGATION ROOM

191
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,609
Thank you for your time.

192
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,863
We may question you again later,
so keep that in mind.

193
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,533
-This way.
-Wait a moment, please.

194
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,702
You're questioning me again?

195
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,413
Why? I already told you everything.

196
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,417
What you say and what we judge
are different.

197
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,212
You said as long as I gave my statement,
I'd be in the clear.

198
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,339
That's why I told you the tampering,

199
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,549
and said that La-ik is the culprit.
So why now?

200
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,634
Mr. Choi…

201
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:13,222
Giving a statement does not free you
from legal responsibility.

202
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,725
Of course, what you testified about him

203
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,811
can be taken into consideration.

204
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,230
But that doesn't mean
it grants you immunity.

205
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,983
Aren't you changing your words
a little too much?

206
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,068
You're the one changing your words.

207
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,905
You admitted your alibi was a lie.

208
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,993
The truth is always relative.

209
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,620
There's no such thing as absolute truth.

210
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,414
It changes depending

211
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,582
on how you look at it.

212
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,129
And depending on how I see you,

213
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,717
the whole situation
can look very different.

214
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,219
So be careful.

215
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,514
Cooperating fully with the investigation

216
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,434
will be better for you.

217
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,153
Are you okay? Let's go.

218
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,209
Jae-hee.

219
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
Why can't I win?

220
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,601
Damn it.

221
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,271
Hey!

222
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,650
Let go!

223
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,861
It was just starting to hit.

224
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,491
How are you still living like this?

225
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,327
Do you know
how hard it is to get a machine that hits?

226
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,122
And it's still nothing compared
to the money you made using my name.

227
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,123
Isn't it?

228
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,210
Be honest.

229
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,170
Did you sign with another company
under my name?

230
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,048
Did you?!

231
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,342
Fine, I took some money!

232
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,929
I made that name for you,
why can't I use it?

233
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,598
What, should I starve to death instead?

234
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,101
Is that what you should say?

235
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,438
Because of that,
your son became a murder suspect.

236
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,483
And you act like nothing happened?

237
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,320
I am sad, so sad!

238
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,865
How did my son become someone so vicious?

239
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
Because of you,

240
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,328
I had to go to the prosecutor's office
to be questioned!

241
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,996
Do you know how much I cried?

242
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,833
The prosecutor told me,

243
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,168
if you turn yourself in now,
you'll only serve ten years…

244
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,256
How could you…

245
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,967
How could you not trust me!

246
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,722
During your questioning,

247
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,475
did you also mention
which company you signed with?

248
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,020
You must not reveal
anything from the questioning.

249
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,649
If it leaks,

250
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,235
you may be charged
with breaking confidentiality.

251
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,700
Then what happens to my son?

252
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,536
Since he was drunk, and if we charge this

253
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,708
as an unplanned, impulsive killing,
his sentence will be around ten years.

254
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,586
That is only if he turns himself in now.

255
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:36,049
The longer he drags this out,
the higher the sentence

256
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,887
I'll be seeking.

257
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,519
I don't know.

258
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,813
I left the contract and card somewhere.

259
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,358
I can't find them.

260
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,985
Then what about a phone number?

261
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,155
If you got paid,
you must have their contact.

262
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,575
I don't have that either.
I changed my phone recently.

263
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,912
Look, if you are a lawyer,

264
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,164
don't let my son push you around.

265
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,625
Convince him to turn himself in. Please.

266
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,212
Go.

267
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,006
It's over. Go.

268
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,218
Go. Just go now!

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,879
Where are we going?

270
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,383
To the place you want to go the most.

271
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,442
Where are we going?

272
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,154
Come on. There's no time.

273
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,958
It's about to start.

274
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,008
You remember that place, right?

275
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,428
The practice room
where you and Woo-seong first met.

276
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,684
GOLD BOYS - LATE KANG WOO-SEONG

277
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,477
The Gold Boys Fans raised money

278
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,105
to put up that ad themselves.

279
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,067
It is partly to honor the late Woo-seong.

280
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,322
And partly to show
that there are still fans

281
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,741
who believe in you and are waiting.

282
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,412
For you.

283
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:19,463
There was an interview once,
where you said that…

284
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,549
…that sometimes you wish

285
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,885
you could go back…

286
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,723
to the beginning.

287
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,352
This is the past.

288
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,940
Every joy, every sorrow,

289
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,901
and every pain…

290
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,946
it's all still here.

291
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,787
The past doesn't flow away.

292
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,082
It stays exactly

293
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,250
where it is, unchanged.

294
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,797
But what matters more than that is…

295
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,013
…whether it's back then or now,

296
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,600
there are so many people
who still believe in you

297
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,478
and cheer for you, no matter who you are.

298
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,111
LA-IK,
WE WILL WAIT

299
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,707
Why are you acting like this?

300
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,418
It is not like I made anything up.

301
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,880
You still should have talked
to CEO Geum first.

302
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,300
I did. He told me not to say anything,
so I kept my mouth shut until now.

303
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,552
And look what happened.

304
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,345
Now they suspect me.

305
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,722
You went to the prosecutors

306
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,350
and booked interviews
with unconfirmed info?

307
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,145
What will you say?
That La-ik is the killer?

308
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,689
Why do you keep taking his side?

309
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,442
He went behind our backs
and tried to sign with another company!

310
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,862
-Why defend someone like that?
-Because it was not La-ik!

311
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,082
If it was not him, who was it?

312
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,461
Anyway, what happened
at the prosecutor's office must not leak.

313
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,298
The CEO Geum will not let it slide.

314
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,842
Let him not slide it.

315
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,179
If he wants me to stay quiet,
tell him this.

316
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,639
If he refuses my renewal
and leaves me hanging like this,

317
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,266
I will not stay quiet.

318
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,477
I will tell everything
I know to the press.

319
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,729
Fine.

320
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:45,150
I'll try to get the contract renewal
for you and Young-bin.

321
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,484
There is no need.

322
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,617
I'm not doing it.

323
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,784
-What?
-Hey.

324
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,579
What are you talking about?

325
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,957
Last time, La-ik came to see me.

326
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,293
That day…

327
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,755
I could not even look him in the eyes.
I felt too guilty.

328
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,340
Guilty about what?

329
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,634
-He is the one who--
-Stop please!

330
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,221
You know it too.

331
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,973
How close La-ik and Woo-seong were.

332
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,102
You know he would never do
something like that.

333
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,148
Know what?

334
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,401
You know nothing.
So what makes you think you…

335
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,403
You are right.

336
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
I don't know anything.

337
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,116
But

338
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,245
I do know this one thing.

339
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,789
We can't keep

340
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,792
going like this.

341
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,129
Jae-hee,

342
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,508
how did we end up like this?

343
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,684
Hey!

344
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,270
Young-bin!

345
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,861
YOU SHINE BRIGHTER THAN ANY LIGHT

346
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,030
You held a face-to-face interrogation?

347
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,282
Yes.

348
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,410
The witness admitted
lying about his alibi.

349
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,831
So we plan to investigate
both the witness and the suspect.

350
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,541
What does that mean?

351
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,085
The one who was at the scene

352
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,838
and the one who lied about the alibi.

353
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,216
One of them is likely hiding something.

354
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,887
In the end, once we find
solid evidence on either one,

355
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,265
-we can--
-Either one?

356
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,020
That vague approach is exactly
why the investigation is wobbling.

357
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:49,316
A prosecutor isn't someone
who picks one of two options.

358
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,653
He points to one truth with conviction.

359
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,574
But the key witness lied.

360
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,617
La-ik's lawyer will attack that.

361
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,079
So I thought we should consider--

362
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,414
So what,

363
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,709
you will switch suspects
and start over with someone else?

364
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,756
Then switch again
when the evidence is lacking?

365
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,049
But

366
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,343
if La-ik is really not the culprit--

367
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,055
That fragile mindset
is why your case keeps drifting.

368
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,933
You pick your target from the start,

369
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,977
and you push all the way through.

370
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,774
-Yes.
-Every time you flip suspects,

371
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,527
you damage not just yourself,
but the entire prosecution.

372
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,239
And if his side releases an article

373
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,993
claiming the prosecution failed early on

374
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,537
and accused an innocent man?

375
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,540
Then you are finished.

376
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,924
An investigation is no different
from a hunt.

377
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,262
Once you pick your prey,
you chase until you catch it.

378
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,349
That is how you earn your trophy.

379
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,645
Yes. I understand.

380
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:32,377
My mom did take the advance,
so some of what Jae-hee said wasn't wrong.

381
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,340
I asked Chung-jae to track down
the company she allegedly signed with.

382
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,094
Even if the deal went through,
you did not sign it.

383
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,805
We can void it easily.

384
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,350
The issue is countering
the narrative of conflict

385
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,018
with Goldie Entertainment.

386
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,812
I'll talk to CEO Geum first.

387
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,524
-CEO Geum?
-Yeah.

388
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,276
He knows.

389
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,530
I was sick of him
and was planning not to renew,

390
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,866
but I had to keep going with Gold Boys.

391
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,076
We were negotiating the renewal again.

392
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,245
If we can prove that…

393
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,999
Then we can break a big part
of Jae-hee's statement. But…

394
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,042
Will he actually help us?

395
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,213
I don't know. He is impossible to predict.

396
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,021
Get some rest.
I need to step out for a bit.

397
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,022
Where are you going?

398
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,109
I will be back soon.
If you are hungry, eat something first.

399
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,893
I'm sorry about that day.

400
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,896
I just panicked.

401
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,066
It's okay.

402
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,859
I just hope

403
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,987
you didn't misunderstand.

404
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,740
I brought Do La-ik to my place

405
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,160
because his home
and everything in it had been seized,

406
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,246
-so he had nowhere to stay.
-I know.

407
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,835
His house was seized, his company was
already considering ending the contract.

408
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,421
A hotel would draw too much attention,

409
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,842
and leaving him alone felt dangerous.

410
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,469
So you took him in. Right?

411
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,310
I'm sure you already know this firm.
It's the best in the country.

412
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,647
Their managing partner wants to meet you.

413
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,359
He has been interested
in La-ik's case for a long time.

414
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,364
Nothing will change.

415
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:10,410
You will still be the lead attorney.

416
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,329
You'll just have more help.

417
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,836
I'm sorry, but I don't work that way.

418
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,213
Could you at least let me help
even in a small way?

419
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,050
La-ik and I have been together…

420
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,889
for over ten years.

421
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:37,228
We were apart for a few years,
but that kind of time means nothing to us.

422
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:43,151
For La-ik, I've always been his only love,

423
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,028
and it is the same for me.

424
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,198
If I can't even help with this,

425
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,993
I don't think I can bear it.

426
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,625
If I need help,

427
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,544
I will definitely contact you.

428
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,758
Are you sure you'll be okay
meeting him alone?

429
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,511
If someone else is there,
CEO Geum will not say anything.

430
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,180
It is better if I go by myself.

431
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,601
Still, just in case, I will wait outside.
Call me if anything happens.

432
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,686
I will be fine.

433
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,487
Attorney Maeng!

434
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,075
Thank you.

435
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,152
Thanks.

436
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,160
I was going to call you,
funny, we ran into each other.

437
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,747
What brings you here?

438
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,457
Nothing much. Just…

439
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,878
This place is nice.
You see all the celebrities.

440
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
So what brings you here?

441
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,676
Is it about a client?

442
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,430
Yes. Our client needs
to meet with CEO Geum.

443
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,855
Well…

444
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,442
you don't need to drop

445
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,153
Do La-ik's case.

446
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,197
Long time no see.

447
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,742
How have you been?

448
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,163
You look a bit worn out
since I last saw you.

449
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,292
Even now, all you notice is my face.

450
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,837
What, worried I won't sell anymore?

451
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,134
You're not here to pick a fight.

452
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,306
I heard you had
a face-to-face interrogation with Jae-hee.

453
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,187
Jae-hee keeps saying weird things.

454
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,648
That I tried to sign with another company.

455
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
Did you know about that, too?

456
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,988
-No.
-You know that is not true.

457
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,950
We were going back and forth
with drafts for my renewal.

458
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,160
I know.

459
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,873
I know you were trying
to protect Gold Boys until the end.

460
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,961
You said you would not renew
unless every member got a contract.

461
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,755
Jae-hee still doesn't know that.

462
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,340
That's probably why he thinks that.

463
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,341
Then…

464
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:59,430
Everything you and I discussed
is in the draft.

465
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,600
That you had no intention
of leaving Gold Boys.

466
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,186
And how you really feel about the members.

467
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,397
Anyone who reads it will understand.

468
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,110
If needed, I can testify in court.

469
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,695
Officially,

470
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,032
you are still under my label.

471
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,744
And I have known you

472
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,123
for almost 20 years now.

473
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,210
If I had married and had a kid,

474
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,462
he would probably be about your age.

475
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:38,761
As long as it does not harm the company,

476
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,764
I will help however I can.

477
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,353
But that is as far as I can go.

478
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,438
Proving your innocence

479
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,440
is something you have to do.

480
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,782
Last time

481
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,327
after what you said,
I have been thinking a lot.

482
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,623
I was the one preaching that

483
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,584
you must trust your client no matter what,

484
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,878
but I realized

485
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,672
I was the one who forgot that.

486
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,965
I feel ashamed

487
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,676
when I see you.

488
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,722
Even if nobody else noticed,
I should have.

489
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,766
You only took big money cases

490
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,896
because of me and the firm.

491
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,772
You were trying to clear my debts.

492
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,777
What are you talking about?
That's not what it was.

493
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,571
Do not brush it off.

494
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,240
You saying that
just makes me feel smaller.

495
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,994
After I left like that day,

496
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,788
all those old memories came back.

497
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,918
Back then,
I didn't even have a proper car,

498
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,379
so we always took the bus everywhere.

499
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,798
Every time we went to see your father,

500
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,552
I kept telling you not to come.

501
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:06,390
But you still followed me
all the way out there every time.

502
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,642
Well,

503
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,188
I can still see it.

504
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,233
That bus that never came
even when we waited forever.

505
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,738
Then a random truck would pass
and cover us in white dust.

506
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,991
If it rained, you stood in the rain.

507
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,536
If it snowed, you stood in the snow,

508
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,747
shivering

509
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,167
in that remote place.

510
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,172
Sometimes I wonder
how I could live like that.

511
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,717
Why are you bringing
all that up now? Seriously.

512
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,852
For you, it is not just the past.

513
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,358
This case, the reason you can't let it go

514
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,652
is your father, right?

515
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,508
This case and your father's case

516
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,135
have a lot in common.

517
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:29,015
At first, I couldn't get
why you were acting like this.

518
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,810
But watching you,
it started to make sense.

519
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,858
I still think

520
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,944
about that day sometimes.

521
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,949
The last day I went to see my dad.

522
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,868
Say it's not you.

523
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,245
Tell me you didn't do it. Now.

524
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,205
I'm sorry.

525
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,166
Don't say you are sorry.

526
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,753
Why won't you say it?!

527
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,759
If I say I didn't, will you believe me?

528
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,472
If I say I didn't do it,

529
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,390
will you believe me?

530
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,394
In the end

531
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,855
I couldn't say it.

532
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,067
"I believe you."

533
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,778
That simple line.

534
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,363
No.

535
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,823
Se-na.

536
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,035
I really…

537
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,955
didn't do it.

538
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,042
And…

539
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,296
that's how he passed away

540
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,466
with that hurt look on his face.

541
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,064
My dad,

542
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,609
even after the whole world
threw harsh words at him,

543
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,529
even when I resented him,

544
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,990
you were the only one
who stayed by his side

545
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,575
until the end.

546
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,664
Because he was someone I could trust.

547
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,708
I still believe that.

548
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,795
From what I saw of Maeng Ji-yong,

549
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,464
there's no way
he'd ever do something like that.

550
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,843
For you,

551
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,220
Do La-ik is that kind of person now.

552
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,100
That's why you want to stay
by his side to the end.

553
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,654
Anyway,

554
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,534
I won't nag you about this case.

555
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,328
Don't end up like me and regret it later.

556
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,538
See it through to the end.

557
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,748
I will cover you if anything happens.

558
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,542
Got it?

559
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,465
I'm leaving.

560
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,831
Aren't you going to sleep?

561
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,126
I can't sleep with the lights on.

562
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,588
You told me to work here
so you won't be alone.

563
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,132
No, I didn't mean you should leave.

564
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,334
-Do you have something to say?
-No.

565
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,169
Then why do you keep sneaking looks at me.

566
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,963
Me? When?

567
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,800
What?

568
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,845
What?

569
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,224
I can see everything…

570
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,851
how you feel right now,

571
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,811
what is going through your head.

572
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,731
What are you, some mind reader?

573
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,985
From here…

574
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,072
you just look tired.

575
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,198
Go to sleep.

576
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,367
Wait a minute!

577
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,288
-Are you very busy right now?
-Why?

578
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,290
If you are not,

579
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,667
maybe we could talk.

580
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,668
Talk about what?

581
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,003
You know, just…

582
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,506
I'm busy.

583
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,258
No, I don't know anything, that's why.

584
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,597
I realized I have never asked about you.

585
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,058
Why? What made you curious now?

586
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,768
I mean, think about it.

587
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,353
You just look at my eyes

588
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,229
and know how I feel
and what I am thinking.

589
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,357
But I know little about you.

590
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,941
It feels pretty unfair.

591
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,991
I don't like personal questions.

592
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,495
It's not like I want to dig that deep.

593
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,416
What do you do when it's tough?

594
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,543
-I work.
-Not that.

595
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,755
Like hobbies. You got none?

596
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,007
Well…

597
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,679
DO LA-IK'S IT'S ME VIDEO PHOTOSHOOT

598
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,638
What?

599
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,723
Not really.

600
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,141
Then what do you live for?

601
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,353
Okay then, what about food?

602
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,730
What food do you like?

603
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,150
Anything quick and easy to eat?

604
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,443
No, I mean specifically!

605
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,987
Gimbap?

606
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,159
So you like things
that take a lot of work. Just like me.

607
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,870
Well, I mean,

608
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,792
it has all the main nutrients balanced.
Everyone likes gimbap.

609
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,461
Then what do you do to relax?

610
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,005
Watch TV, read, listen to music?

611
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,218
I love you, Do La-ik!

612
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,139
I don't listen to music.

613
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,640
-You don't?
-Not really.

614
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,851
How can a person not listen to music?

615
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,686
No wonder your life feels so dry.

616
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,855
No, this won't do.

617
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,025
-Get up.
-Sorry?

618
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,745
Hey, Do La-ik. Where are we going?

619
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,540
Come over here for a bit.

620
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,585
Why here in the middle of the night?

621
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,463
Because there is music here.

622
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,601
What if someone sees us?

623
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,330
Come on. Sit.

624
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,753
You said you don't listen to music.

625
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,423
I will show you why people do.

626
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,442
Music is this.

627
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,905
It doesn't lie.

628
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,574
You can't fool anyone with it.

629
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,160
Because music is all about…

630
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,755
harmony…

631
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,720
and melody.

632
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,975
Music is simple and clear.

633
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,602
That's why it can reach anywhere.

634
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,397
Even the deepest part of someone's heart.

635
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,113
That's why you need it.

636
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,993
A song you can listen to
whenever the hard memories come back.

637
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,999
So tell me…

638
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,296
What?

639
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,673
I was thinking…

640
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,635
You always do things for me,
and I've done nothing for you.

641
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,972
I hate feeling like I owe someone.

642
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,642
Right now,

643
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,728
this is all I can give.

644
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,232
So hurry up
and tell me what you want to hear.

645
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,155
But…

646
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:34,202
we're not music.

647
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:39,416
That's why we're always lying.

648
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:45,589
What if you found out
that someone you really trusted…

649
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,178
told you a huge lie.

650
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,473
What do you think you would do?

651
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,184
What could I do?

652
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,896
That's all they do.

653
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,025
I don't really expect much from anyone.

654
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,111
So I doubt it would hurt that much.

655
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,336
Just listen.

656
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,797
You have had a rough day.

657
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:04,918
Rain is falling in your small heart

658
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:12,300
On the day your whole world
Starts to fall apart

659
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:19,933
I can feel your footsteps
As you wander

660
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:26,606
Searching for a place to lean on

661
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:36,241
I'll hold you in my arms

662
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:43,373
You who are worn out from so much pain

663
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,923
In the deepening night

664
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:58,847
A shining star will light your sky

665
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,310
And I'll be here

666
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:10,233
So the rough waves
Never shake you again

667
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,653
Please, turn your eyes to me

668
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:22,329
If the rain ever falls
On your heart once more

669
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:30,670
I promise I'll be right by your side

670
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,278
I found him.

671
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,821
Are you sure?

672
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,032
Yes. He's from Achi Entertainment's
management support team.

673
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,077
He has a history with shady contracts.

674
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,539
He likely handled
the Gold Boys contract too.

675
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,708
Should I approach him?

676
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,335
No. I'll meet him myself.

677
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,880
Okay.

678
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,309
-You are heading out now?
-Yes.

679
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,936
Then give me the door key before you go.

680
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,187
The key? Why?

681
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,024
You know, I might go out for a walk,

682
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,901
maybe stretch a little.

683
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,444
I can't stay inside all day.

684
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,488
Well…

685
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,409
You can't get seen or photographed.

686
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,493
Fine.

687
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,455
-Be careful.
-Okay.

688
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,139
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

689
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,726
Give it to me so I can scan it.

690
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,617
LA-IK

691
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,963
Oh, my God, look who it is!

692
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,925
-How have you been?
-How do you think I've been?

693
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,470
You little brat.
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

694
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,890
You must've gone through a lot
because of me.

695
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,143
You even had to go in for questioning.

696
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,978
With what?

697
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,063
You are the one having the hard time.

698
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,943
At Woo-seong's funeral,

699
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,903
you looked like a ghost.

700
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,823
Because of reporters,
I couldn't even say hello.

701
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,703
Hey, why are you crying?
If you cry, I'm hanging up.

702
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,080
Who's crying?

703
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,166
Anyway, are you eating properly?

704
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,044
That's actually why I called.

705
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,839
You know… that thing.

706
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,133
What thing?

707
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:50,346
When I felt down, you used to make gimbap
with lots of ham and burdock.

708
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,390
It was nothing like the store-bought ones.

709
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,892
I wanted to know how you made it.

710
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,143
Why?

711
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,437
Craving gimbap?

712
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,147
Should I bring you some?

713
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,693
No. I want to make it myself for someone.

714
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,070
Make it? For who?

715
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,823
There is someone.

716
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,118
Someone who loves gimbap more than anyone.

717
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:17,207
Actually, our legal team was planning
to reach out to Mr. Do La-ik.

718
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,794
The contract is already signed
and the advance payment has been made.

719
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,380
Recent incidents demand
a talk about termination.

720
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,635
This contract can't be legally recognized.

721
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,637
So there's no need to discuss termination.

722
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,721
Sorry?

723
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,349
A contract signed without
the party's consent is void.

724
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,142
The actual party is Do La-ik,

725
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,437
yet you signed it with his mother,
who is a third party.

726
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,648
She is not his legal guardian.

727
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,400
-Well, that's because--
-Also, the one who received the deposit

728
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,194
was not Do La-ik, but Do Mi-gyeong.

729
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,113
He doesn't need to return the obligation.

730
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,324
We understand the legal issue,

731
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,910
-but we are victims too--
-Victims?

732
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,080
You are the one who signed
without the artist's consent.

733
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,291
Why would you proceed
with something so reckless?

734
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:04,045
Because we trusted them.

735
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,630
They approached us,

736
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:09,134
saying they were looking
for a company willing to take Gold Boys,

737
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,637
so things naturally moved forward
from there.

738
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,181
We assumed everything
was already arranged.

739
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,350
Agreed with whom?

740
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,601
His mother?

741
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,937
No. With Kang Woo-seong.

742
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,190
What?

743
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,817
Okay.

744
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,278
Seaweed,

745
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,698
burdock, ham…

746
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,076
and…

747
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:38,997
Wait. Rice.

748
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,293
No. Rice.

749
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,775
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

750
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,906
JERK KING

751
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,372
Hello?

752
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,291
I wanted to ask you something.

753
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,210
Is there rice in this house or not?

754
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,336
Rice?

755
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,380
Are you hungry?
If you're hungry, just order something.

756
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,007
No, do we have it or not?

757
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,927
I don't know. Maybe in the attic?

758
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,845
Ask Attorney Maeng.

759
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,889
Attic? Okay.

760
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,380
The best subject award…

761
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,632
THE BEST SUBJECT AWARD

762
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,399
COUPON FOR DISHWASH

763
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,278
DAD IS A SUPERMAN

764
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,247
The one who arranged the deal
was Kang Woo-seong.

765
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:12,627
He was sure he could bring Do La-ik to us.

766
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,004
So we coordinated the deal.

767
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,341
Because Do La-ik is top tier,

768
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,551
we were in a hurry as well,

769
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,637
which is why we first signed
with his mother.

770
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,683
Everything had already been
agreed with Kang Woo-seong.

771
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,124
Do La-ik?

772
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,669
Do La-ik!

773
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,744
Do La-ik…

774
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:33,791
Tell me.

775
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,088
Explain what all this is.

776
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,944
Explain it.

777
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,890
THANK YOU TO ACTOR PARK WON-SANG
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

778
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,598
I can't believe any of it.

779
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,892
-La-ik.
-You're fired.

780
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,771
I hope the two of you never meet again.

781
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,818
Don't you see how worried I am?

782
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,238
How would I know where Jae-hee is?

783
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,907
We need to get to him
before the police do.

784
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,994
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

785
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,746
We found him.

786
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,794
