1
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,955
Choi Jae-hee,
a member of the idol group, Gold Boys,

2
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,709
who has been questioned as a witness
in the murder case of the late Woo-seong,

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,962
was involved in a car accident last night
and is now confirmed to be

4
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,964
in critical condition and unconscious.

5
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,717
Authorities are currently investigating

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,428
the exact circumstances
and cause of the accident.

7
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,348
Witnesses report
that Mr. Choi had been showing

8
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,809
signs of instability
following the incident,

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,812
and a document believed to be a will
was found at the scene,

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,273
prompting investigators
to consider the possibility…

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,776
We controlled the bleeding
through a craniotomy

12
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,360
and removed the hematoma.

13
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,988
For now, all we can do
is keep him sedated in the ICU

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,491
and monitor his condition closely.

15
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,575
Then,

16
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,745
what's going to happen to him?

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,999
If the damaged area
of the brain continues to swell

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,001
and the pressure compresses the nerves,

19
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,295
he could suffer neurological damage.

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,922
What does that mean?

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,465
La-ik.

22
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,468
What happened?

23
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,513
I said, what happened?

24
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,556
Hey, come here. Let's talk over here.

25
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,601
I need to see him.
I have to see him myself…

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,229
Hey! You can't be here right now!

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,108
-You need to get out before the reporters…
-That's what you're worried about?

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,445
Jae-hee ended up like that!

29
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,572
Why would he…

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,074
Why would he try to kill himself?

31
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,159
They found a note.

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,208
A suicide note saying
he'd confess to everything.

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,335
What?

34
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,883
How is Choi Jae-hee doing?

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,885
They say he might not make it
through the day.

36
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,764
And when we checked his call log,

37
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,060
he had tried calling
quite a few people besides you.

38
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,106
He called Do La-ik,
he called Geum Bo-sang.

39
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,277
The only person
he actually got through to was Bo-sang,

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,072
but apparently, he hung up right away
without saying much.

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,366
People tend to do that
before attempting suicide.

42
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,743
They cling to their phones
because they're distressed…

43
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,497
I heard they found
a suicide note at the scene.

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,084
We secured his phone.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,714
Everything was written in there.
"I killed Kang Woo-seong.

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,467
"I will atone with my death.
Do not forgive me."

47
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,222
But something's bothering me.

48
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,640
Why would Choi Jae-hee

49
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:07,103
call you at the very end?

50
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,564
It's not like you two were close.

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,483
I don't know.
I've been wondering that too.

52
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,530
Actually…

53
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,200
he left me a voice message that day.

54
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,660
He did?

55
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,084
CHOI JAE-HEE - VOICE MESSAGE

56
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,712
Why aren't either of you picking up?

57
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,339
Are you with La-ik right now?

58
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,674
I'm in a situation, and I need some help.

59
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,636
There's something
I forgot to tell you earlier.

60
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,653
About the day
when that happened to Woo-seong.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,915
I called Woo-seong again at dawn,
in the parking lot.

62
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,011
I'm sure it was his ringtone.

63
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,936
But thinking about it now,
I think that ringtone

64
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,272
came from the garden side.

65
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,983
Yes, understood.

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,040
He probably mistook it for another sound.

67
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,043
Maybe. But doesn't it seem strange?

68
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,422
A man who left a suicide note
confessing to everything,

69
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,549
says something like that
right before he died.

70
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,343
You're saying Choi Jae-hee
wasn't the real culprit?

71
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,806
If the sound he heard
really was Woo-seong's phone,

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
then it means the killer took his phone

73
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,103
and fled in that direction.

74
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,902
Could you ask the residents over there
if they noticed anything that night?

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,779
Let's stop this.

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,659
You're not La-ik's lawyer anymore.

77
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,956
Do you remember?

78
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,417
You told me once,

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,502
"If you keep holding on to the past,

80
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,463
you're the only one
who ends up stuck there."

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,590
"You need to step out of it."

82
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,511
This is your second time already.

83
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,347
You do know repeated offenses
come with heavier penalties?

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,059
What else can I do?
I have to make a living.

85
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,066
Anyway,

86
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,694
what goes through your mind
when you stand in front of it?

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,031
-What?
-You said you remember me.

88
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,659
We see each other at the columbarium
every year, must be the same memorial day.

89
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,370
When you stand there,

90
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,624
in front of the one you lost,
what do you think about?

91
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,958
Why are you asking me that?

92
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,545
Because if I were you,
I'd be ashamed to be living like this.

93
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,132
-Excuse me?
-The reason your sentence was reduced

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,010
was because of the difficult life
you'd been through.

95
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,387
But that doesn't excuse anything.

96
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,057
No matter how hard your past was,

97
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,352
using it as a shield to justify
the way you live is self-deception.

98
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,937
You don't know anything about me.

99
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,606
I'm not the one treating you carelessly.
It's you.

100
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,906
Whenever I stand

101
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,452
in front of that place,
I make the same promise.

102
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,414
THE LATE MAENG JI-YONG,
THE LATE PARK SU-HEE

103
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,167
As long as I'm alive,
I'm going to live with dignity.

104
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,341
If you keep clinging to the past,

105
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,802
you're the only one
who ends up stuck there.

106
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,683
People who lean on their misery
to live their lives,

107
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,726
I can't defend people like that.

108
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,905
After you said that,
I really tried to live differently.

109
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,742
I tried to bury the past
and keep my eyes forward.

110
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,873
So why are you the one
clinging to the past now?

111
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,960
Why are you stuck on Do La-ik?

112
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,588
You told me not to do that.

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,217
Do La-ik…

114
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,928
is already gone.

115
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,264
He was never part
of our world to begin with.

116
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,254
I heard they caught the culprit.

117
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,884
The suspect confessed, but he's in a coma.

118
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,345
The investigation will be on hold
until he wakes up,

119
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,431
and if he dies, the case will be closed.

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,808
So what's your plan?

121
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,903
If you only play safe
and defensive like this,

122
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,572
there comes a moment
where you can't attack at all,

123
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,033
and all you can do is throw in the towel.

124
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,498
That girl you investigated last time,
Hong Hye-joo.

125
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,668
You do know she's the daughter
of Chairman Hong of Imhwa Group?

126
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,963
Yes, I'm aware.

127
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,677
Chairman Hong was furious.

128
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,887
Seems the girl…

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,349
had some sort of relationship
with Do La-ik,

130
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:23,020
and the chairman despised it.

131
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,443
If we'd pinned everything on him

132
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,697
and gotten him 20 years,

133
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,991
I would've made
a clean entrance into politics,

134
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,119
and you would've strengthened
your hold on the prosecution.

135
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,164
It would've been the perfect scenario.

136
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,584
A shame it didn't work out.

137
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,257
I had no idea you had such intentions.

138
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
Byung-gyun.

139
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,723
A long time ago,

140
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,727
I went through something similar.

141
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,563
We had a suspect.

142
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,441
Motive was solid, but no evidence.

143
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,651
And he wouldn't confess.

144
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,323
No matter how hard we pressed,
he kept insisting he was innocent.

145
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,950
Then…

146
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,619
he hung himself

147
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,246
in prison.

148
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,541
It caused quite the commotion.

149
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,418
They called it coercive interrogation,

150
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,631
and almost cost me my badge.

151
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,592
But then…

152
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,553
how do you think I ended up sitting here?

153
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:45,853
If you want,

154
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,440
you could throw in the towel here
and end the game.

155
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,109
But there's still a chance left.

156
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,572
It depends entirely on you.

157
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,255
Hello, this is Choi Jae-hee.

158
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,885
The real person who killed Kang Woo-seong

159
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,012
wasn't Do La-ik. It was me.

160
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,518
My fear and anger over a bleak future

161
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,104
ended up
driving me in the wrong direction.

162
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,024
I made a mistake I can never undo.

163
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,359
MISSING CALL: CHOI JAE-HEE

164
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,661
I'll apologize to Woo-seong in person.

165
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,289
I'll be able to see him soon anyway.

166
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,794
And…

167
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,800
please tell Do La-ik that I'm sorry.

168
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,680
My death is entirely my own doing.

169
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,101
No one else is responsible.

170
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,482
I will atone with my life.

171
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,694
Please, don't forgive me.

172
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,499
I had nowhere else to go.

173
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,797
I didn't know where I was supposed to be.

174
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,216
So I just walked.

175
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,638
And ended up here.

176
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,104
Everyone says Jae-hee is the killer now.

177
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,068
Not me, but him.

178
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,070
JAE-HEE'S CONFESSION NOTE
SHAKES UP THE CASE

179
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,116
I can't believe it.

180
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,703
Why would he…

181
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,581
They found a knife,

182
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,501
presumed to be the murder weapon,

183
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,964
and a suicide note in his car.
You heard that, right?

184
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,551
The note says

185
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,303
he killed Woo-seong.

186
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,433
The police consider it decisive evidence.

187
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,103
And with his suicide attempt confirmed,

188
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,942
the case will be closed.

189
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,028
How does that make any sense?

190
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,324
The prosecution won't reopen the case.

191
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,703
They're already being criticized
for focusing solely on you

192
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,371
and missing the real culprit.

193
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,166
If they reopen the case now,

194
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,794
it's basically admitting
their entire case was a mess.

195
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,546
I don't care about any of that.

196
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,631
I just want the truth.

197
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,343
Tell me.

198
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,972
Do you really think he's the culprit?

199
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,186
The police, the prosecution,
everyone outside,

200
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,855
they can say whatever they want
and believe whatever they want.

201
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,775
But not you.

202
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
You were our fan.

203
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,572
You must've seen him more than anyone.

204
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,115
Does this make sense to you?

205
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,702
Does he seem like…

206
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,205
someone who could do something like that?

207
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,796
I can't believe it.

208
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,632
He isn't that kind of person.

209
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,802
And even if he really
did that to Woo-seong,

210
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,679
I need to know why, what pushed him there.

211
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,890
There has to be a reason.

212
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,309
Right?

213
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,478
With the suicide note discovered,

214
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,689
the investigation into the initial suspect
is being called into question.

215
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,776
How do you respond to claims
you got the suspect wrong from the start?

216
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,070
-Please say something!
-A comment, please!

217
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,201
Prosecutor, just one comment, please!

218
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,539
So this is how
the great Byung-gyun goes down, huh?

219
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,457
Isn't this a fatal blow?

220
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,793
A fatal blow? He's beyond recovery.

221
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,420
He kept beating on the same guy,
and now it's blown up.

222
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,132
Do La-ik was found at the murder scene.

223
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,926
So, of course,
he dug only in that direction.

224
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,470
But does the public care about that?

225
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,682
The media already slapped a frame on it
that it was a botched investigation,

226
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,226
saying there were clear mistakes
in naming the suspect.

227
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,564
If Do La-ik starts shouting
about coercive interrogation or whatever,

228
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,233
he's finished.

229
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,528
He'll be completely shut out.

230
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,239
Politics? Please.
He won't be able to open a law office.

231
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,367
-How did it come to this?
-He'll figure it out somehow.

232
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,581
Sir, it's too much right now.

233
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,416
Having La-ik prepare
for a comeback already…

234
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,793
This isn't a matter of choice.

235
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,964
La-ik knows that too. To survive here,
he knows what he has to do.

236
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:40,012
The public may hate a perpetrator,
but they love someone who's been wronged.

237
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,265
There's no better timing

238
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,102
-for his comeback than right now.
-But Jae-hee is…

239
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,273
With everything going on,
how can he stand in front of people?

240
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,403
-Han-gu.
-Yes.

241
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,825
When did I ever ask for your opinion?

242
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,079
Go bring La-ik.

243
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,415
I'll handle convincing him.

244
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,333
I'll go check it out and let you know
if there's any progress.

245
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,919
I'm going with you.

246
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,632
With me?

247
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,553
I'm the one who asked you.
I can't let you go there alone.

248
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,558
Is it uncomfortable being with me?

249
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,230
I want to see it for myself.

250
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,150
Where Jae-hee was last.

251
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,570
What happened there.
I need to see it with my own eyes.

252
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,215
I think this is the place.

253
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,968
According to the news,

254
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,680
there isn't any CCTV around here at all,
so nothing about the crash was captured.

255
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,599
The dashcam was dead too.

256
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,939
-Where are you going?
-Don't follow me. It's dangerous.

257
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,944
Are you going down there?

258
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,457
I said don't follow me.

259
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,168
I'm not following you.
I want to take a look…

260
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,520
Take my hand.

261
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,968
I think it's there.

262
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,977
That's a pretty sharp slope.

263
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,396
But doesn't something feel off to you?

264
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,983
Like the police said,

265
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,360
if Jae-hee really intended
to take his own life,

266
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,406
he would've floored the accelerator.

267
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,449
But seeing it in person,

268
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,620
the point where the car fell
seems too close.

269
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,593
HONG HYE-JOO

270
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,652
You're still listening to that?

271
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,823
No, it's just…

272
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,118
So, you're all done?

273
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,079
Yes. I'll hand it over to the prosecution.

274
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,416
And really,
don't think too much about that.

275
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,878
He just said it
because he thought he was in trouble.

276
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,967
You know,
real culprits use that trick all the time.

277
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,429
Well…

278
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,612
This is the place.

279
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,322
According to the article,

280
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,325
Jae-hee stayed here
for a few days before the accident.

281
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,995
He was here?

282
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,957
Yes. Why?

283
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,545
Nothing.

284
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,530
Welcome.

285
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,241
Hi, I wanted to ask you something.

286
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,743
Sure, go ahead.

287
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,331
Aren't you La-ik?

288
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,254
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

289
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,965
I already told the police everything.

290
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,384
That's really all I know.

291
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,138
So you're saying he suddenly showed up
on the night of the 13th?

292
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,224
Yes. I saw him myself.
I was on the night shift that day.

293
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,854
He came alone without a reservation
and asked for a room.

294
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,731
At first, I wondered who he was,

295
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,566
but when I looked closely, it was Jae-hee.

296
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,987
I've been a fan of you guys for ten years.

297
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,533
Did you notice anything unusual about him?

298
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,496
Nothing besides his expression.
He didn't look well.

299
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,998
I even wanted to ask for an autograph,

300
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,126
but he looked so down,
I couldn't say anything.

301
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,047
Did he meet anyone?
Or did anyone come looking for him?

302
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,548
No, no one.

303
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,593
I even swapped shifts
so I could stay the whole time,

304
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,553
and he never left the room.

305
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,724
Then suddenly, he went out,
and the next day…

306
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,102
that article came out.

307
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
Is there any CCTV footage?

308
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,107
The police already took everything.

309
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,362
And all the belongings he left
in his room too.

310
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,155
They took it all.

311
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,699
-He left his things?
-Yes.

312
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,910
Just one bag,

313
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,871
but he didn't pack anything.
He left it there and walked out.

314
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,043
Anyway, are you okay?

315
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,587
Please take care of yourself.

316
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,006
We're all rooting for you.

317
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,063
He didn't know anyone here,
and he wasn't here to meet anyone.

318
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,276
So why did he stay in this place?
Was it really just a coincidence?

319
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,403
It wasn't a coincidence.

320
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,366
I think I know why he came here.

321
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,624
CHUN-HYANG TRADITIONAL FESTIVAL

322
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,560
Nothing has changed here.

323
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,862
CHUN-HYANG TRADITIONAL FESTIVAL

324
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,452
This was Gold Boys' first stage.

325
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,582
Even after we debuted, nobody called us.
We just kept busking on the streets.

326
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,459
This was the first venue that invited us.

327
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,196
It looks okay now.

328
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,282
Back then, the equipment,
the sound system, everything was a mess.

329
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,369
Performing on the street was easier.

330
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,498
They didn't even set up the instruments,
so we pretended to play over the MR.

331
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,166
I was so pissed that day.

332
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,376
I know.

333
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,796
The grandmas kept shouting
for Kim Seong-jun to come out…

334
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,016
Still, it was good.

335
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,601
What the hell!

336
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,980
-Bring Kim Seong-jun!
-Back then, just being on a stage

337
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,940
was all we ever wanted.

338
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,776
Hello, we're Gold Boys!

339
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,494
And that hotel earlier,
CEO Geum arranged it for us

340
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,079
since it was our first performance.

341
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,583
It was the best day ever.

342
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,296
I think that's why Jae-hee came here too.

343
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,757
And he wanted to see that.

344
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,140
There's a secret here.
Something only we know about.

345
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,242
Where are we going?

346
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,328
Almost there.

347
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,591
THE FOREST OF WISHES

348
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,388
It should be around here somewhere.

349
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,891
This is the secret?

350
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,187
When we came here
for our very first performance,

351
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,022
we wrote down our wishes.

352
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,735
This is it!

353
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,714
They're hanging them on the tree.

354
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,300
Hey, there's an empty spot.

355
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,886
-Where?
-There!

356
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,306
Last one to hang it up is dead last…

357
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,184
Okay, this one's mine.

358
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,104
Yeah, hang it there.

359
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,235
Hang it well. Don't let ours fall.

360
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,821
-Right.
-Okay.

361
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,323
"Billboard," Jae-hee!

362
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,783
Stop!

363
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,996
PLEASE LET ME MAKE A LOT OF MONEY - LA-IK

364
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,916
Jae-hee once told me something.

365
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,087
Whenever things got tough,
he'd come back here.

366
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,924
He said it helped him feel at ease.

367
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,678
PLEASE LET US GET ON BILLBOARD - JAE-HEE

368
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:44,897
Woo-seong, La-ik, Jae-hee, Young-bin.
Forever one.

369
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,315
Huh? This…

370
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,777
So he really did come here.

371
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,200
I should tell the police…

372
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,327
Wait.

373
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,462
Don't look.

374
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,547
I won't.

375
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,552
Once the police investigation starts,
people might find out about this place.

376
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,263
So I want to make my wish before that.

377
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,350
Wishes only come true
when no one knows about them.

378
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:53,257
MAY EVERYONE I LOVE
BE HAPPY IN MY MEMORIES

379
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,686
Isn't the case already closed?

380
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,940
The deputy chief told us

381
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,067
to put the investigation on hold.

382
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,029
There's nothing much.

383
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,078
According to the report, he seems
to have taken pills before the accident,

384
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,372
and they found a suicide note.

385
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,667
REPORT

386
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,463
DRUG TOXICOLOGY REPORT

387
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,218
-Mr. Heo.
-Yes.

388
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,512
Where is Do La-ik's toxicology report?

389
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,140
Oh, Mr. Do La-ik's? Just a moment.

390
00:35:56,028 --> 00:36:00,491
REPORT

391
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,619
SODIUM OXYBATE DETECTED

392
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,873
SODIUM OXYBATE DETECTED

393
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,794
The substance detected
in Choi Jae-hee's blood

394
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,213
was Tri-Oxibate.

395
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,049
It has anxiolytic effects, induces sleep,

396
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,094
and suppresses the central nervous system.

397
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,181
How much do you estimate he took?

398
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,766
Based on the blood concentration,

399
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
at least ten tablets, maybe more.

400
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,063
But it's not the kind of drug
that knocks you out instantly.

401
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:36,527
It usually takes 20 to 30 minutes
for consciousness to gradually decline.

402
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,446
If he was driving,

403
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,907
he would have had trouble
with basic actions like braking.

404
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,784
The same substance was detected

405
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,578
in Do La-ik when he was arrested.

406
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,080
Yes. But he also said

407
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:52,293
he'd been taking psychiatric medication
for panic disorder.

408
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,714
This drug is pretty commonly prescribed
here and abroad.

409
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,969
So you still think
Do La-ik is the culprit?

410
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,976
If you play it too safe,

411
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,770
you'll end up throwing in the towel.

412
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
Chief.

413
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,085
How many investigators
do we have available right now?

414
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,880
None at the moment.
The whole team's been reassigned.

415
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,466
Then gather a few people
who can move off the record.

416
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,301
Sorry? What?

417
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,074
Hey…

418
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,126
I guess we stayed in here too long.

419
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,422
The management office is…

420
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,339
Wait.

421
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,967
Walk…

422
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,094
with me for a minute?

423
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,609
I can finally breathe.

424
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,573
It's been a long time
since I've been somewhere this quiet.

425
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,702
I always wanted to take a walk somewhere

426
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,747
with no one around.

427
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,243
Here.

428
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,953
It's okay. I'm not cold.

429
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,331
No worries. Consider it a favor for a fan.

430
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,585
I'm not your fan anymore.

431
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,923
-I think you've got the wrong idea…
-Really?

432
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,509
Is that why you threw everything out?

433
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,551
What?

434
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,471
I saw it in front of your place.
You tossed all of it.

435
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,181
My albums, the merch…

436
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,353
You must have spent a lot.

437
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,438
Looked like you'd been collecting
since my debut.

438
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,944
It's just…

439
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,155
It's not worth that much.

440
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,908
So what did you like so much?

441
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,289
Me. Why did you like me that much?

442
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,339
I just…

443
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,967
did.

444
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,136
Just because.

445
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,763
There's no reason for liking someone.

446
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,936
I know the reason.

447
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,441
The red hat.

448
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,988
The one I gave you.

449
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,293
I kept thinking I'd seen it somewhere.

450
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,378
And then it hit me.

451
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,964
That hat was mine when I was a kid.

452
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,758
And then I remembered

453
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,429
who I gave it to.

454
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,811
That day…

455
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,564
I was having a really hard day too.

456
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,149
So I remember it.

457
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,575
This is really all you made?

458
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,082
What does your agency even do, huh?

459
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,878
Do they think making you sing out
on the street brings in money?

460
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,673
You know how much you made
from those gigs?

461
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,969
Idol or whatever.
You're just getting silly ideas.

462
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:55,971
I'm leaving.

463
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:57,973
Mom.

464
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,855
It's been months since I saw you.

465
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,983
You know that?

466
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,947
I know.

467
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,949
But…

468
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,034
we've both been busy.

469
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,827
I'm sick.

470
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,208
I have a fever, I'm coughing.

471
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,044
I'm really sick.

472
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:32,049
Just hang in there a little longer.
Once I make money, I'll come pick you up.

473
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,302
I'm not leaving you to rot like this.
You know that, right?

474
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,950
Spring had come,
but it didn't feel like spring.

475
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,870
That day was unusually cold.

476
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,735
When life felt unbearably miserable,

477
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,362
when I couldn't understand…

478
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,365
what I was even living for.

479
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,453
When I wanted to give everything up…

480
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,055
that's when I saw

481
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,266
someone who looked
even more dejected than me.

482
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,829
So I couldn't just look away.

483
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,601
Because I saw myself in you.

484
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,354
I guess I wanted to comfort you.

485
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,109
That was the first time…

486
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,992
The first time I ever felt like my heart
actually reached someone.

487
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,542
I'd always thought
I was meaningless, useless.

488
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,005
But in that moment, I realized
I could be a comfort to someone,

489
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,090
even if just for a single second.

490
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,598
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize you.

491
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,271
I honestly never imagined it was you.

492
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,985
But you've really changed a lot.

493
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,661
Why were you like that?

494
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,209
That day. Why were you hurting so much?

495
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,225
My father…

496
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,354
had died in prison.

497
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,946
He was charged with murder
and sentenced to life.

498
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,199
He kept insisting he was innocent

499
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,827
and then he hanged himself.

500
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,040
My mother couldn't take the shock
and passed away soon after.

501
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,170
And just like that,
I was alone in that house.

502
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,927
I was suddenly left alone in the world.

503
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,931
No matter how much I thought about it,

504
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,058
I couldn't find a reason to live.

505
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,105
But that day,

506
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,942
when I heard you singing,

507
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,486
I thought…

508
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,322
"Live.

509
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,659
"Just try living."

510
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,287
"If I keep going,

511
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,206
maybe someday I'll find a reason."

512
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,210
"So let's…

513
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,255
not give up."

514
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,632
"Let's live…

515
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,428
to the very end."

516
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:17,102
So I decided to try living.

517
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,982
And I made it all the way here
thanks to you.

518
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,697
Do you know

519
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,617
how happy I was when you debuted?

520
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,911
I was happier than
when I passed the bar exam.

521
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,873
I liked you that much.

522
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,762
Saying it all out loud
makes me feel lighter.

523
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,476
I'm sorry I hid it.
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

524
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,354
Thank you.

525
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,526
For being the one who cheered the loudest
when I shined.

526
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,571
For staying by my side

527
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,908
when things were hard.

528
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,370
For…

529
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,706
not forgetting me and watching over me.

530
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,710
I truly thank you.

531
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,373
What are you doing there?

532
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,754
I asked what you were all doing.

533
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:13,009
Why are you here this late at night?

534
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,683
If the door was locked,

535
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,936
you could have used your phone
and called someone.

536
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,397
So why were you two doing something

537
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,482
all secretive in there?

538
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,784
My phone battery died.

539
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,081
Hello.

540
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,753
What?

541
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,635
You're here? Over here.

542
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,933
-Is this him?
-Yes.

543
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,519
-Hello.
-Hello.

544
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,021
Please, have a seat.

545
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,817
After you visited last time,

546
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,153
I thought maybe there was something
I could do to help.

547
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,114
So I went around and talked
to every staff member

548
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,824
who worked the day Jae-hee stayed here.

549
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:22,704
And he said he heard
something strange that day.

550
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,665
Something strange?

551
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,585
Yes. That day,

552
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,378
I went in to clean…

553
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,381
What good is it to you knowing where I am?

554
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,926
Don't pretend you care now.

555
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,846
I heard someone talking on the phone.

556
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,556
Me too.

557
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,434
I need time too!

558
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,187
So please, just leave me alone.

559
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,440
Stop coming to find me!

560
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,068
He was really worked up.

561
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,572
I didn't want to get mixed up in anything,

562
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,449
so I gave the police a short statement.

563
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,328
She really pestered me.

564
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,249
Did you happen to hear
what he said on the call?

565
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:11,753
I'm not one to meddle
in other people's business,

566
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,964
so I didn't listen closely.

567
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:18,468
But he was yelling at someone he called
the CEO or something.

568
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,514
The CEO?

569
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,267
He kept saying, "CEO,"

570
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,852
and asking

571
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,396
what good it was for them
to know where he was.

572
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,107
Telling them not to come.

573
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,734
So I figured

574
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,280
maybe it was just
some kind of lovers' quarrel.

575
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,837
When I went to the police station

576
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,463
for Jae-hee's witness interview,

577
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,591
the detective told me clearly that

578
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,093
the CEO talked to Choi Jae-hee,

579
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,804
but claimed the call was nothing special
and they just hung up.

580
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,808
Then he lied about the call?

581
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,269
Why would he do that?

582
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,282
Attorney Hwang had been digging around.

583
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,951
Apparently, sometime
before Kang Woo-seong's murder,

584
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,495
Gold Boys' contract

585
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:31,708
was being quietly re-examined
by their legal team.

586
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,920
What they focused on the most

587
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,756
was the clause about breach of trust.

588
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,384
As if someone in the group
was going to betray them and they knew it.

589
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:48,016
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

590
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,188
Before that,

591
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,067
there's something you need to know.

592
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,111
Something very important.

593
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,325
CHANGES IN PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT LA-IK

594
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,370
This shows public opinion
based on SNS and online reactions.

595
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,497
POSITIVE 68%, NEGATIVE 32%

596
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,376
Support for Do La-ik's return is steadily
increasing, especially among the fandom.

597
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,585
But before that,

598
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,254
we need to closely examine
how the public feels

599
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,881
about Kang Woo-seong and Choi Jae-hee.

600
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,053
Sir?

601
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,099
Sir?

602
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,357
Get a clear response guide ready
for any questions related to the case.

603
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,735
Adjust it carefully, so we can avoid

604
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,240
-any unnecessary controversy.
-Yes sir.

605
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,752
I can't believe this. Why would Woo-seong?

606
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,549
I couldn't believe it either.
That's why I kept it from you,

607
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,301
at least until I understood
the whole situation.

608
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,345
I worried it would be too much for you.

609
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,889
So if you're right

610
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,975
and Woo-seong really did the tampering…

611
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,352
Then the whole context
of the case changes.

612
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,605
CEO Geum Bo-sang knew all of this.

613
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:25,488
He tried to handle the contract issue
in complete secrecy.

614
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,159
But Jae-hee became a variable.

615
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,412
I'm sure that's why he lied to the police

616
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,289
about the phone call.

617
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,583
Probably.

618
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,877
And to know for sure…

619
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,756
We have to ask him ourselves.

620
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,592
So…

621
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,511
you came here to confirm that?

622
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,895
I was told you testified to the police

623
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,565
that your call with Jae-hee
was nothing special.

624
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,068
But that day,

625
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:06,196
a witness near the scene said

626
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,491
he heard him repeating
the words "CEO" several times,

627
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,951
and that the two of you
sounded like you were arguing.

628
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,834
Can we ask what
you actually talked about that night?

629
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:26,382
Are you suspecting me?

630
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,012
Woo-seong talked to you.
And so did Jae-hee.

631
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,265
And after those calls,
you know better what happened.

632
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,229
Answer me. What did you talk about

633
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,356
with Woo-seong, and with Jae-hee?

634
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,693
Why were you on the phone
with Woo-seong so late?

635
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,321
And why didn't you tell me
you talked to Jae-hee?

636
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,573
If I had told you,

637
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,119
too many people would've gotten hurt.

638
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,665
Especially you, La-ik.

639
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,501
You would have been hurt the most.

640
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,796
That's why I hid it.

641
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,506
What?

642
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:11,052
You think you know everything
about Woo-seong, don't you?

643
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,140
What are you talking about?

644
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,809
I'm asking you

645
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,770
if you're ready to face the truth,
whatever it is.

646
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,358
Some truths

647
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:30,613
come with pain.

648
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,241
So much…

649
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,328
that you'll wish you never knew them.

650
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,084
One last time,

651
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,796
can you really…

652
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,467
handle the truth?

653
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,981
Tell me.

654
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,610
What are you hiding?

655
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,797
What do you think would happen
if La-ik found out?

656
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,092
I'd want to kill you.

657
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:17,095
It's okay to be sad.

658
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,722
We can start over from the beginning.

659
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,725
Jae-hee would never kill himself.

660
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,270
Step back cleanly.

661
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,521
Just be grateful.

662
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,939
That's it.

663
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,693
Having these feelings right now,
I think I must be crazy.

664
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,362
My feelings just won't stop.

665
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:40,493
