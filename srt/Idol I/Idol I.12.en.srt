1
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,712
No, no.

2
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:53,219
<i>To meet the Gold Boys,</i>
<i>who are too busy with their world tour,</i>

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,763
<i>I've flown all the way to New York.</i>

4
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>Gold Boys, it's great to see you!</i>

5
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>- Two, three.</i>
<i>- Hello, we're Gold Boys.</i>

6
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,730
First of all, congratulations.

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,026
I heard every show on your world tour
has completely sold out,

8
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,903
and thanks to the overwhelming response,

9
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,405
the tour has even been extended.

10
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:16,701
Before we dive in, could you say
a few words to your Korean fans, Goldy,

11
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,995
<i>who've been eagerly waiting for Gold Boys?</i>

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>Everyone.</i>

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>I hope you're all doing well.</i>

14
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,711
<i>Even when we're not there, I believe</i>
<i>you'll take good care of yourselves.</i>

15
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,256
<i>We're working hard so we can come back</i>
<i>to you as soon as possible.</i>

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>So until then, make sure you eat well,</i>

17
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>don't get sick,</i>

18
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,472
<i>and stay healthy.</i>

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,642
<i>- I really miss you guys, Goldys.</i>
<i>- Chicken delivery!</i>

20
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,770
<i>Shall we talk about your new album now?</i>

21
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,690
<i>I heard all the members took part</i>
<i>in writing and composing this time.</i>

22
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,610
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,493
I still have a bit to pack,

24
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,370
and I wanted to grab
some chicken with you.

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,040
Anyway, congrats
on deciding to retry the appeal.

26
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,335
What about you?
How's everything? Getting ready?

27
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,586
I'm opening my office soon.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,588
I even printed business cards.

29
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh! Let me see.

30
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,509
Ta-da!

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,511
Wow.

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,598
Drop by the opening.
Maybe help promote it a bit.

33
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,605
You're giving me the drumstick?
That's new.

34
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,232
You've got your own place now,

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,567
starting your own business.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,235
- I'm so proud of you.
- Hey!

37
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,112
Your hands are oily.

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,864
Stop, enough.

39
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,699
Come on. I'm an adult too.

40
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,826
I can't live off you forever.

41
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,915
Did you know
I've lived here for over five years?

42
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,917
Already?

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,797
It was fun.

44
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,091
We bickered all the time,

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,719
like friends, like family.

46
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,473
Me too.

47
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,894
Spending time with you,
like friends and family…

48
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,066
I felt really reassured.

49
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,945
You stayed by my side
when things were hard

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
and took care of me without a word.

51
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,159
That's how I got through it.

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,165
And now that you're gone,
I have no one to boss around.

53
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,333
It feels strangely empty.

54
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,587
Right? You must be super bored without me.

55
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,923
Call me anytime.

56
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,717
If you need anything for the retrial,
just call me.

57
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,095
My worth has gone way up, by the way.

58
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,388
Oh, yeah?

59
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,723
I'm a proper detective now.

60
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,189
Ugh, it's warm.

61
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,524
You still drink it warm?

62
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,415
These are all the records
from your father's case.

63
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,087
And these are the contacts
of the people who testified back then.

64
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,465
You kept all this until now?

65
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,970
It's a case that's always weighed on me.

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,057
And I knew

67
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,518
you would take it on someday.

68
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,231
I'm just getting started.

69
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,068
You'll do well.

70
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,945
Come on. I know what you're capable of.

71
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,281
Even the Do La-ik case,

72
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,491
everyone said it was impossible,

73
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:47,620
but you kept pushing
and proved him innocent.

74
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,124
You'll do the same for your father's case.

75
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,422
If you need anything, just tell me.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,764
Sir.

77
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,267
Thank you.

78
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,063
I wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

79
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,024
Come on.

80
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,735
You know,

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,737
though I graduated top of my class,

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,906
I turned down all those great jobs
and came to your firm. Because--

83
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,824
I know.

84
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,035
Of course I know.

85
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,371
I took care of you
when you were a student,

86
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,956
fed you all the time,

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,043
bought you books for the bar exam…

88
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,713
I'm basically your second father,

89
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,881
aren't I?

90
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,342
You really had to spill everything?
I was going to say my part.

91
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,554
Oh, yeah? Did I make it too obvious?

92
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,728
Anyway,

93
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,022
don't act like you're gone for good.

94
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,941
I'm not sending you away.

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,278
Finish your father's case

96
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,030
and come right back.

97
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,617
- Okay?
- Yes.

98
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,453
All right.

99
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,164
<i>She became a high-profile lawyer</i>
<i>thanks to the Do La-ik case,</i>

100
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,418
- and now she's taking leave?
- Exactly. When her value is at its peak.

101
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,421
If it were me, I'd open my own office

102
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,050
with my name on the door
and really cash in.

103
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,094
No, no, no.

104
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,720
Absolutely not.

105
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,140
This isn't about money.

106
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,102
A retrial, of all things, a family case!

107
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,939
Bringing hidden truth to light,
restoring justice…

108
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,025
That is the sacred duty of a lawyer!

109
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,863
You seem really happy
about snagging the partner spot

110
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,657
while she's gone.

111
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,952
What? Happy?

112
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,162
No, I meant…

113
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,414
- As a colleague…
- Yeah, sure.

114
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,209
- No, Ye-sol, as a colleague…
- Yeah, sure.

115
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,629
Whatever…

116
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,554
Ye-sol, I organized the documents.

117
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,347
Could you stop by my office later?

118
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,765
Yes!

119
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,022
And…

120
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:26,362
I know I've caused you
some trouble and worry.

121
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,407
Thank you

122
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,410
for understanding.

123
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,672
Did she just thank us?

124
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,799
Never thought I'd live
to hear her say thank you.

125
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,897
THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING LA-IK

126
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,996
I'm here to pick up the documents.

127
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes. Here you go.

128
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,127
Do you want some help?

129
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,296
No, I'm finished.

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,341
But, Ye-sol.

131
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,636
Thank you for everything.

132
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,639
I would've had
a really hard time without you.

133
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,850
I didn't do anything.

134
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,394
Actually…

135
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,775
there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

136
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,319
Remember when I once said

137
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,905
I'd explain everything later?

138
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,074
Thank you, Ye-sol.

139
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,326
I'll explain everything to you later.

140
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,203
Yes.

141
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,748
I kept thinking about
how I wasn't honest back then.

142
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,793
And…

143
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,589
The truth is…

144
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,093
I'm also…

145
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,097
- Goldy.
- Sorry?

146
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,934
I'm Goldy, a hardcore Gold Boys fan.
And my favorite is La-ik.

147
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,645
- What?
- I'm really sorry I hid it.

148
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,898
It's not like I meant to…

149
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,233
I thought it'd be a problem

150
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,111
if people knew the lawyer
was a fan of her client.

151
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,863
And I have this rule about keeping
my fangirling secret.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,198
Actually…

153
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,201
I knew.

154
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,998
Well, I couldn't be sure, but…

155
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,334
I had a pretty good idea.

156
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,920
No way.

157
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:54,302
You may think you hid it perfectly, but…

158
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,430
Here you go.

159
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,684
<i>Even before the Do La-ik case…</i>

160
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
Attorney Maeng, you got mail.

161
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,917
<i>Every time La-ik posted a story on SNS,</i>
<i>your alert went off whenever mine did.</i>

162
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,419
GOLDYS - HAVE A GREAT DAY!

163
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,134
<i>And all over your office,</i>

164
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>there were purple items,</i>
<i>his signature color.</i>

165
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,100
They say you can't hide
a cough and fangirling.

166
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,979
I just thought,
"Yep, fans are everywhere."

167
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,651
I tried so hard to hide it.

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,029
I only knew because I'm Goldy too.

169
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,117
So I was always grateful.

170
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
You let me help La-ik from afar,

171
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
and because of you,

172
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,168
Gold Boys could come back together.

173
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,630
You know…

174
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,298
For fans,

175
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,717
if our favorite is happy, that's enough.

176
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,136
That's all we ever want.

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,431
Is for them to be happy,

178
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,643
wherever they are.

179
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,066
<i>La-ik,</i>

180
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,405
<i>how have you been?</i>

181
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,330
FROM THE FIRST TRIAL

182
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,629
THE PRIME SUSPECT - MR. MAENG

183
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,593
<i>My days have been so hectic lately.</i>

184
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,932
Did their conflict seem serious enough
to become a motive for murder?

185
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>Sometimes time flies by so fast,</i>

186
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,257
<i>and other times it moves so slowly</i>

187
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,636
<i>that I can't even see the end of it.</i>

188
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,439
<i>A behind-the-scenes video</i>
<i>of Gold Boys' overseas tour just dropped!</i>

189
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,528
<i>Whenever that happens,</i>

190
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,572
<i>I look at you.</i>

191
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,452
<i>And…</i>

192
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,789
<i>even from far away,</i>

193
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>it feels like you're right beside me.</i>

194
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,886
<i>Like your voice</i>

195
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,433
<i>is telling me,</i>
<i>"It's okay. You can do this."</i>

196
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,566
CRIMINAL CASE FILING

197
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,817
PETITION FOR RETRIAL

198
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,027
PETITIONER - MAENG SE-NA

199
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,906
<i>That's what gives me</i>
<i>the strength to get through today…</i>

200
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,307
<i>and the courage to face tomorrow.</i>

201
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,445
I miss you,

202
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,615
La-ik.

203
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,160
WITNESS STATEMENT - HONG HYE-JOO

204
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,580
This case is finally over.

205
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,999
She really held out until the very end.

206
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>She didn't say a single word</i>
<i>during the final appeal.</i>

207
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,006
She must've known it too

208
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,800
that a lie can't beat the truth.

209
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,510
Sorry?

210
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,472
- Is this everything related to the case?
- Yes.

211
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,058
Anyway, thanks to you,
her conviction was finalized.

212
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,476
That's worth celebrating, right?

213
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,687
I'm not so sure. It feels a bit lacking.

214
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,441
She was put in a psych facility
because of her mental evaluation.

215
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,110
I think she should've gone to prison.

216
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,738
Well, a win is a win.

217
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,198
How about we go out for a drink?

218
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,450
Should I make a reservation?

219
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,537
Let's do it next time.
I have something important today.

220
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,164
Okay.

221
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,531
Counsel,

222
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,785
please summarize the grounds
for your retrial petition.

223
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,960
Your Honor,

224
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,255
this is a petition for retrial

225
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,590
in the case of the late Maeng Ji-yong,

226
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,135
who received a life sentence
for murder 15 years ago.

227
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,848
The original ruling found him guilty.

228
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,227
However, it has now been revealed
that the key witness,

229
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,521
whose testimony
was central to that conviction,

230
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,482
gave false statements
under the prosecutor's coercion.

231
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,194
And major discrepancies have been found
among the primary pieces of evidence.

232
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,574
These issues undermine the basis
on which the guilty verdict was reached.

233
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,914
Your Honor,

234
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,711
before he passed away,

235
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,213
Mr. Maeng Ji-yong maintained

236
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,341
his innocence

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,636
to the very end.

238
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,600
Today, as the petitioner

239
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,477
and as his surviving family,

240
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,607
I stand here to prove
his innocence and to restore his name.

241
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
I respectfully ask

242
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,450
the Court to open retrial proceedings,
so that the truth may be established

243
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,619
and the values of justice

244
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,414
and the law may be upheld.

245
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,143
Prosecutor Kwak!

246
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,452
I…

247
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,999
have been reviewing
Attorney Maeng's case for her.

248
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,087
Since it's a murder case,

249
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,381
I need to go through everything carefully.

250
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,425
And, well, I owe her a bit too.

251
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,971
If you look it over properly,
it will really help the case.

252
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,433
But are you okay with this, Prosecutor?

253
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,145
Once the retrial starts,

254
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,439
your father's name
will definitely come up.

255
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,025
Well…

256
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,778
That's something my father has to face.

257
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,114
I mean,

258
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,201
you seem more relaxed these days.

259
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,789
Ever since you caught her
and became a big-name prosecutor

260
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,792
what, did you get
a big promotion or something?

261
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,670
No.

262
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,381
I'm transferring to a regional office.

263
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,299
What?

264
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,384
My mother is in
a nursing facility out there.

265
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,180
Work kept me from visiting her often,

266
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,349
so now I want to stay by her

267
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,478
and live my life a bit.

268
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,237
About back then, I'm sorry.

269
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,784
I thought that was the only way to win.

270
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,789
But in the face of truth,
winning or losing means nothing.

271
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,125
Back then,

272
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,794
I just didn't see it.

273
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,840
In this war-like world,

274
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,343
I thought the only way to survive
was never backing down.

275
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,889
I feel the same.

276
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,016
But…

277
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,353
in the end, we did win.

278
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,064
We caught the real culprit.

279
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,607
Cheers!

280
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,949
So good.

281
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,910
Chug it!

282
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,955
Please look at the camera!

283
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,420
Attorney Maeng, the court
has officially approved the retrial today.

284
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,964
Could you share how you feel?

285
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,135
I'm grateful to have the chance
to set my father's case right

286
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,303
before it's too late.

287
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,305
As an attorney

288
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,182
- and as Mr. Maeng's daughter…
- Let's go.

289
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,059
…I will uncover the truth,

290
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,686
and I intend to prove

291
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,607
that even if justice comes late,
it always returns in the end.

292
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,153
Oh? It's Do La-ik.

293
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,239
- It's Do La-ik!
- Where?

294
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,684
Congratulations.

295
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,702
You can't just show up without calling!

296
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,912
My heart nearly jumped out of my chest!

297
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,665
I wanted to surprise you.

298
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,295
If I'd gotten here a little earlier,
I could've watched the hearing.

299
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,173
But the flight was delayed. Sorry.

300
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
But don't you still have tour dates left?

301
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,511
They were canceled
because of local circumstances.

302
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,347
In a way, it worked out.
I got to come here.

303
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,434
Today was such an important day for you.

304
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:37,439
There were many people and reporters.
You can't just appear like that!

305
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,733
The internet's gonna go crazy.

306
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,152
- Please be careful…
- I missed you.

307
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,238
I missed you so much.

308
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,868
How about you? Didn't you miss me?

309
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,790
Well… I…

310
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,335
Of course, I missed you.

311
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,377
What?

312
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,464
What was that? I couldn't hear you.

313
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,509
I said I missed you!

314
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,310
Get in.

315
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,853
But where are we going?

316
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,398
To say hello.

317
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,750
- Hey!
- Hey!

318
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,627
You!

319
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,463
- Who are you?
- Hands off…

320
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,590
La-ik's private life!

321
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,508
Don't film him.

322
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,010
How dare you point a camera at him?

323
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,401
THE LATE MAENG JI-YONG,
THE LATE PARK SU-HEE

324
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,490
I figured you'd want to see
your parents most right now.

325
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,748
But how did you know about this place?

326
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,376
I asked your old tenant a while back.

327
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,879
Oh, Chung-jae…

328
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,978
It's an honor to finally meet you.

329
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,315
Father, Mother.

330
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,984
I'm sorry for coming so late.

331
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,613
My name is Do La-ik.

332
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,703
Today, Attorney Maeng achieved
something truly remarkable.

333
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,872
I'm sure you saw it.

334
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:03,418
Please keep watching over her
so she can see this through to the end.

335
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,130
And please don't worry
about your daughter.

336
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,383
I'll stay by her side

337
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,094
and make her happier than anyone.

338
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm sorry

339
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,942
for not being there

340
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,486
when things were hardest.

341
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,492
From now on, I'll always be with you.

342
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,619
Let's…

343
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,454
be happy together.

344
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,480
While I was on tour,
everything was nonstop.

345
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,943
But whenever I was alone in my hotel room,

346
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,405
all those old memories
would come back to me one by one.

347
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,661
Do you remember
what you told me back then?

348
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,042
After I was cleared and everyone
started calling, asking me to return,

349
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,380
I told you I was scared
to stand in front of fans again,

350
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,716
and you said that to me.

351
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,429
I like Do La-ik.

352
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,103
See?

353
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,896
I like you, La-ik.

354
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,359
The way you worry

355
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,654
about going back onstage

356
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,034
might hurt your fans,

357
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,618
I like that about you.

358
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,872
And…

359
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,626
I like the La-ik on stage, too.

360
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,380
Because up there,

361
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,549
you look truly free.

362
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,302
So…

363
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,306
for now,

364
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,019
just listen to your heart.

365
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,815
The answer's already in there anyway.

366
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,206
<i>If you hadn't said that back then,</i>

367
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,042
I don't think I could've performed again.

368
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,462
Thank you

369
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,798
for giving me courage.

370
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,345
I should be thanking you.
For finding the courage to sing again.

371
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,515
While preparing for the retrial,

372
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,893
whenever things got too hard
I watched your performances.

373
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,730
Seeing you sing with your whole heart

374
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,690
helped me keep going.

375
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,902
Really?

376
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,450
Sometimes a single line from a song

377
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
can comfort you more than anything else.

378
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,958
That's why I'm so glad
that you're singing again.

379
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,861
We're already here.

380
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,197
Yeah, we got here fast.

381
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,744
Go on in first.

382
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,456
I'll go in after you leave, La-ik.

383
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,207
Yeah.

384
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,543
All right.

385
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,297
Sleep well, I'll go.

386
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,357
Good night!

387
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,326
Now I can't leave.

388
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,624
- Let's take a picture.
- Me too!

389
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,418
Wait, Han-gu.

390
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,879
Come on.

391
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,797
One, two, three.

392
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,428
What is this?

393
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,472
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

394
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,018
Ever since I took you guys back,
I haven't had a single break. Look.

395
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,269
LA-IK HEADS STRAIGHT TO SE-NA

396
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,272
Who cares. Everyone already knows.

397
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,774
La-ik is totally in love mode right now.

398
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,485
Right.

399
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,655
Fans love her too.

400
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,199
They call her La-ik's lifesaver.

401
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,784
It's not the fans I'm worried about.

402
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,703
It's the reporters grilling him nonstop.

403
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,374
Don't worry. If they cross the line,
the fans will handle it in the comments.

404
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,753
Seriously, our Goldys are no joke lately.

405
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,838
They even have a privacy protection squad.

406
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,965
If it's not official, they won't show up.

407
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,384
Even if they run into him,
they pretend not to know him.

408
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,510
See?

409
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,680
I just posted on Babble
that I finally had Korean food again

410
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,474
and uploaded a photo of the restaurant.

411
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,351
Look.

412
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,352
No one showed up.

413
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,317
Maybe you're just not as popular anymore.

414
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,574
Anyway,

415
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,452
where the hell is La-ik?
Why hasn't he shown his face?

416
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,957
- What?
- He's probably…

417
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,875
very busy right now.

418
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,503
Oh, no!

419
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,555
- What? What is it?
- Don't talk to me right now, I'm busy!

420
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,234
Wait.

421
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,820
You shoved me aside
and ran out here for this thing?

422
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,071
This thing?

423
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,907
It's a rare chance
to buy the Japan-only merch.

424
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,117
How is that "this thing"?

425
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,622
I can just give you one.

426
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,380
Fans work their butts off to get merch.

427
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:33,136
Using a personal connection to snag it
without any effort? Unthinkable.

428
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,225
Go stand over there. I need to focus.

429
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,153
Wait a minute.

430
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,785
"Random photocard and limited bonuses may
be omitted for international shipping"?

431
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,957
And they still charge per-item fees?
What kind of nonsense…

432
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,428
PURCHASE PROZY SERVICE

433
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,805
SHIPPING FORWARDING REQUEST

434
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:23,978
After everything we did last night,

435
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,981
you just… no afterglow? Nothing?

436
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,817
I'll feel the afterglow in a minute.

437
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,905
So you're going to keep acting like this?

438
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,450
Add another.

439
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,917
Ta-da!

440
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,001
INVITATION TICKET

441
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,798
Now you're looking at me.

442
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,678
What is that?

443
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,014
Is it…

444
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,934
We locked in our domestic concert dates.

445
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,186
We wanted to thank the fans.

446
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,689
I set aside some seats
where you can watch comfortably.

447
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
Here. You'll come, right?

448
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,821
INVITATION TICKET

449
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,828
<i>Isn't it hilarious?</i>

450
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,747
I offered her merch, an invitation ticket,
but she refused them all.

451
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,167
She said it only feels good
if she earns fan goods on her own.

452
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,836
She's unusual. Right?

453
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,255
Not unusual, special.

454
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,967
See? She likes kimbap so much

455
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,346
that you came all the way here
at dawn to learn how to make it.

456
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,683
I'm going to make it for her from now on.

457
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,310
Because you make the best kimbap in Korea.

458
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,650
And you think
you can just toss this ticket at me

459
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,152
and wipe your hands clean, huh?

460
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,612
No! That one's set aside just for you.

461
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,826
It's a festival, you can sit back
on the grass and enjoy. You have to come.

462
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,745
I don't know. I'm so busy these days.

463
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,415
Maybe I should sell it on Pumpkin Market?

464
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,791
Hey!

465
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,751
Hey, you're hurting my ears.

466
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,921
Fine, I'll go.

467
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,133
I'll see for myself how good
that big voice of yours really is.

468
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,388
If you hit one wrong note,
I'll make you eat goat soup.

469
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,185
Am I doing right?

470
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,311
Just make it roughly.

471
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,063
Come on. It's falling apart
because I made it roughly.

472
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,649
She'll eat it with love.

473
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,541
I'M IN FRONT OF YOUR PLACE
CAN YOU COME OUT FOR A MINUTE?

474
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:05,932
La-ik!

475
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,395
Se-na!

476
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,488
- What?
- It's insane.

477
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,075
So handsome.

478
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,871
What is this? Why do you look so good?

479
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,623
Anyway,

480
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,459
how did you come out so fast?
I just texted you.

481
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,587
Were you already getting ready?
Did you know I was coming?

482
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,965
No, it's not like that.

483
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,343
- Why did you suddenly come?
- Get in. We're going on a picnic.

484
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,763
I have plans today.

485
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:55,982
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRAND OPENING

486
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,111
It's been a long time.

487
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,862
Yeah.

488
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,322
A very long time.

489
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,617
So I heard you became a detective?

490
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,743
PARK CHUNG-JAE

491
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,161
Can't you tell by looking?

492
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,373
If you have anything you want to dig up,
call me. I'll give you a discount.

493
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,459
I heard you moved out of Se-na's place.

494
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,295
Best news I've heard in a while.

495
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,464
I didn't completely move out.

496
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,343
As you can see,

497
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,014
if there aren't any visitors,
I can always go back.

498
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,977
Stop eating that.

499
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,188
I woke up at dawn to make those
for our picnic today.

500
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,608
So that's why
the sides are all burst open.

501
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,324
But I'm glad that you came back.

502
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,536
Making kimbap at dawn for Se-na,

503
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,706
caring for her,

504
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,167
it's a relief.

505
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,921
I really thought you'd never come back.
You're such a big star now.

506
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,090
Why would I not come back?
That only benefits you.

507
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,386
And for the record,
I was always a big star.

508
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,727
Even so, thank you

509
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,022
for looking after Se-na
when I wasn't here.

510
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,192
And for helping
with my case until the very end.

511
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,319
I didn't do it for you.

512
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,741
It just felt like the last thing
I could do for her.

513
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,703
Do you remember

514
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,039
when I told you she didn't like you?

515
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,336
That she only liked you as a fan,
so don't get the wrong idea?

516
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,339
I remember.

517
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,133
That wasn't true.

518
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,345
I just didn't want to admit it.

519
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,767
I thought I should be the one by her side.

520
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,479
But I was wrong.

521
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,231
It's been you for her

522
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,149
the whole time.

523
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,654
Whether I liked it or not.

524
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,914
- You're here.
- What?

525
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,791
What were you two talking about?

526
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,835
Nothing much.

527
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,839
- Have some kimbap.
- How is it? Is it good?

528
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,966
Of course it is. I made it.

529
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:27,883
Chung-jae,

530
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,927
you eat too.

531
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,387
Eat up.

532
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,888
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

533
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,141
How is it?

534
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,478
Come on, we're Gold Boys.

535
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,189
Of course it should be gold. Yellow.

536
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:48,112
Hey, we still have to consider the TPO.
Let's go with white.

537
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,659
You two never agree.
Just do half and half.

538
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,204
Gold.

539
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,415
White.

540
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,295
Please make it a nice half-and-half.

541
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,550
KANG WOO-SEONG

542
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,851
Sorry it took us so long to come.

543
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,936
We're doing well.

544
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,982
We were terrified
to go onstage without you,

545
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,152
but we finished the whole world tour.

546
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:34,158
Woo-seong, we put all the songs
you left in the cloud onto the album.

547
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,784
We did good, right?

548
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,245
It's a good thing you found the cloud.

549
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,792
If you hadn't, we might never have heard
Woo-seong's last song.

550
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,006
He should've let us hear it earlier.

551
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,176
It's such a good track.

552
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,513
You know how secretive he was.

553
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,557
Even when he was struggling,
he never said a word.

554
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,143
He was the kind of guy
who let everything out onstage.

555
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,271
<i>Pain or misery,</i>

556
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,483
<i>the moment he stepped onto the stage,</i>
<i>he forgot it all.</i>

557
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,237
Remember our first concert?

558
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,533
Right before going up, he kept saying
he felt like throwing up.

559
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,786
But once he was onstage,
he jumped around the most.

560
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,288
Yeah.

561
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,208
And the moment he got offstage,
he threw up right away.

562
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,420
He really was such an idiot.

563
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,924
It would've been so nice,
if he were still with us.

564
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,886
He is.

565
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,017
When we worked on the album
with his songs,

566
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,186
I kept asking myself,

567
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,189
"What would he have done?"

568
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,944
And it felt like
we were making it with him.

569
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,696
YOUR TIME LIVES ON IN YOUR SONG

570
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,117
As long as we don't forget him,
he will always be with us.

571
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,815
So you remembered

572
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,151
that today is Woo-seong's Memorial Day.

573
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,653
How could I forget?

574
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,283
You look better. It's good to see.

575
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,580
So your concert's coming up?

576
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,625
How's the preparation going?

577
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,792
Well…

578
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,588
- thanks to you.
- Don't say that.

579
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,760
When we left the company,

580
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,721
you handed over the trademark
without asking for anything.

581
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,266
We could come back together.

582
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,227
What could I have done
with that name without you guys?

583
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,897
But…

584
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,941
seeing how well things are going now,

585
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,738
I almost regret letting you go. Maybe
I should've held on tighter back then.

586
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,496
I watched all your tour performances.

587
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,166
You looked free.

588
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,795
It reminded me of when I first met you.

589
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,508
I don't know when it started,

590
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:44,556
but seeing you become someone
who holds in the pain and forces a smile,

591
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,184
it felt like it was my fault.

592
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,019
It bothered me.

593
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,564
It's all in the past.

594
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,944
And back then, I didn't understand
why things had to be that way.

595
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,987
Now I do.

596
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,031
Running a company…

597
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,783
it's not easy.

598
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,618
Now you get it?

599
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,916
Thank you…

600
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,255
for being the first to acknowledge me
when I was a nobody.

601
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,007
No.

602
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,719
I wasn't the first.

603
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,513
Your mother was.

604
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,992
<i>The moment she saw you singing,</i>
<i>she told me that she's a singer too,</i>

605
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,370
<i>but you were going to become a real one.</i>

606
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,873
<i>She said I should take you</i>
<i>and train you as a singer.</i>

607
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,919
I don't know if it was
about money or something else,

608
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,047
but thanks to your mother,

609
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,635
a guy like me, singing at local clubs,
got to meet someone like you.

610
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,558
Go visit her.

611
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,102
She's probably waiting for you.

612
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,740
Ms. Do Mi-gyeong?

613
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,117
It's you, right?

614
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,664
Please take this.

615
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:34,917
What is it?

616
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,336
You'll know once you open it.

617
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,378
What,

618
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,547
is it another fine or something?

619
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,591
I'm not taking it.

620
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,176
No! It's not that.

621
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,135
I'm not taking it!

622
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,804
My first case won't be complete
unless you accept it!

623
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,307
What?

624
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,392
Anyway,

625
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,145
how did you even know I was here?

626
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,441
This is what I do for a living.

627
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,406
Anyway! Delivery completed!

628
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,122
What the…

629
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,677
INVITATION TICKET

630
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,189
Gift card charged, done!
Pop-up blocker off.

631
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,276
Server time synced. Perfect.

632
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,446
Please let me succeed!

633
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,204
All right.

634
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,000
LET'S GO TO THE GOLD BOYS' CONCERT!

635
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,796
Now!

636
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,508
YOUR QUEUE NUMBER - 486

637
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,595
486?

638
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,016
486!

639
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,563
Sorry.

640
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,365
<i>Hey, my phone and laptop both kicked out.</i>

641
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,868
<i>Why is the universe doing this to me?</i>

642
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,495
<i>It's okay, Like.</i>

643
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,789
<i>I got in around the 400s.</i>

644
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,916
<i>I'll try to grab two seats.</i>

645
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,919
<i>Would you want to go with me?</i>

646
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,340
YOU'RE IN THE QUEUE DUE TO HIGH TRAFFIC

647
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,842
TWO SEATS

648
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,095
PAYMENT COMPLETED

649
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,362
It's here!

650
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,873
I mean,

651
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,418
they said the item just got to Korea.

652
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,087
How did it arrive already?

653
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,589
The delivery was lightning fast.

654
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,219
Let me see.

655
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,973
Wow!

656
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,393
These look amazing in person.

657
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,188
Good thing they arrived without a scratch!

658
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,003
<i>I walk a path</i>
<i>That's neither warm nor cold</i>

659
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:11,007
<i>After walking alone for so long</i>

660
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,803
<i>I start to mistake the creeping unease</i>

661
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,347
<i>Sometimes it feels like</i>
<i>It'll never end</i>

662
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,309
<i>And even the broken moments of rest</i>

663
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,980
<i>Were never truly mine</i>

664
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:30,485
<i>I can't live mindlessly</i>

665
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,572
<i>The way the world wants me to</i>

666
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,282
<i>I'm in front of the ticket booth.</i>

667
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,950
<i>I'm holding a lilac umbrella.</i>

668
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,201
<i>Where are you?</i>

669
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,327
<i>Me too!</i>

670
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,497
<i>I'm carrying the Japan-only Gold Boys bag!</i>

671
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,173
Excuse me,

672
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,009
are you Like?

673
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,230
Ye-sol?

674
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,482
Attorney Maeng?

675
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,710
I knew you were a fan,

676
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,631
but I never imagined you were Like.

677
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,469
And I never dreamed it was you.

678
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,515
I should've guessed when you said
you were going to collect evidence

679
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,602
and sue every single hater.

680
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,071
Come to think of it,
we've never met offline, have we?

681
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,078
Thank you for the ticket.

682
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,546
Wait, back then…

683
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,133
<i>Like,</i>

684
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,845
<i>can I ask you one thing?</i>

685
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,689
<i>Hey! Why'd you disappear?</i>
<i>You even deleted your account!</i>

686
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,982
<i>What's going on?</i>

687
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,608
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

688
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,443
<i>Sorry to bother you out of nowhere,</i>

689
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:40,657
<i>but about that hidden message you said</i>
<i>was in Woo-seong's song,</i>

690
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,909
<i>can you tell me more about it?</i>

691
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,582
<i>Oh, that?</i>

692
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,585
The one who told me
about the secret in Woo-seong's song!

693
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,467
It wasn't really me.
It was all thanks to you.

694
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,554
Gold Boys were able to come back together
thanks to you.

695
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,896
Looks like the wait time is up.

696
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,063
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

697
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,241
When we move into the second song,
smooth the chord transition.

698
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,452
Got it. Just give me the cue
and I'll go right in.

699
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,372
And for the tempo lift in the last chorus,
you take the lead, Jae-hee.

700
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,667
Okay. But if I get too hyped,
I might throw my sticks.

701
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,420
Throw them after playing.

702
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,173
Today, for Woo-seong's share too,

703
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,467
let's fill that stage completely.
All right?

704
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,676
Of course.

705
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,262
Let's make sure no one
feels the empty spot he left.

706
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,266
You ready? Let's go!

707
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,447
Let's go!

708
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,397
Hello, we're Gold Boys!

709
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:45,782
- I love you, Gold Boys!
- I love you, Gold Boys!

710
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:54,290
<i>No name, fading streets</i>

711
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:58,753
<i>And something I can't erase</i>
<i>Rises in my mind</i>

712
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,505
World's best Do La-ik!

713
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:04,718
<i>The ticking hand keeps pressing on me</i>

714
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,306
<i>As if the doors are about to close</i>

715
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,142
I love you, Do La-ik!

716
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:18,106
<i>A melody I thought I forgot</i>

717
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:23,111
<i>Circles in my ears again</i>

718
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:27,198
<i>I'll run to you, even out of breath</i>

719
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,534
<i>Before this night comes to an end</i>

720
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,704
<i>The memories left somewhere behind</i>

721
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,540
<i>Are calling out to me</i>

722
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,334
<i>In the cracks of time</i>

723
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:43,465
<i>I'll sing the last song</i>

724
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:47,177
<i>We left behind</i>

725
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,888
- I love you, Gold Boys!
- I love you, Gold Boys!

726
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:55,185
<i>I'll close the torn page now</i>

727
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:59,898
<i>And let everything rewind to the start</i>

728
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:06,613
<i>You're still the same</i>

729
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:11,201
<i>Just like that very first day</i>

730
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:18,541
<i>Even if you burn bright</i>
<i>Like a flame and disappear</i>

731
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:23,379
<i>Being you was more than enough</i>

732
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,884
<i>Even out of breath, I'll run to you</i>

733
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,386
<i>Before this night ends</i>

734
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,763
<i>There are days like that.</i>

735
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,681
<i>The memories left somewhere</i>

736
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,351
<i>Days when I dreamed about you.</i>

737
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,395
<i>Are calling out to me</i>

738
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:44,442
<i>I'll sing the last song</i>

739
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,820
<i>We left behind</i>

740
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,571
<i>And on those days,</i>

741
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,157
<i>I can't help falling</i>
<i>into foolish little fantasies.</i>

742
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,708
<i>In twisted time</i>

743
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,169
<i>When I look at you,</i>

744
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,839
<i>and you look back at me,</i>

745
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,884
<i>even that thought alone</i>
<i>is enough to make me happy.</i>

746
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:17,308
<i>And then I realize…</i>

747
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,897
<i>none of this is a dream</i>
<i>or a fleeting fantasy.</i>

748
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:28,111
<i>It's the day we shaped together,</i>

749
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:33,658
<i>and the tomorrow</i>
<i>we'll keep creating, together.</i>

750
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,119
Idol I.

751
