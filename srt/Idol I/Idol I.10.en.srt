1
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,955
I like you.

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,880
Having these feelings right now,

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,841
I think I must be crazy.

4
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,219
But I can't hide it anymore.

5
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,266
My feelings just won't stop.

6
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,653
I like you.

7
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,240
I…

8
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,869
like you, Se-na.

9
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,800
Do La-ik, I…

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,472
I'm sorry. It's just…

11
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,142
This is so sudden.

12
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,232
I'm not even sure what these feelings are.

13
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,068
I'm just really…

14
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,779
confused right now.

15
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,823
Yes.

16
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,492
It's okay.

17
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,204
I'm not asking you to answer right away.

18
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,875
I'll wait…

19
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,255
until you sort out your feelings.

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,969
I'll wait as long as it takes.

21
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,494
I'm going to sleep.

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,747
Okay. Good night.

23
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,582
<i>What do I do?</i>

24
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,254
<i>What do I do?</i>

25
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>What do I do?</i>

26
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,925
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

27
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>How am I supposed to look him in the face?</i>

28
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,939
<i>I really need the bathroom.</i>

29
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,154
<i>Wait.</i>

30
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,241
<i>Let's just calm down.</i>

31
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,245
<i>Calm down. Wipe my eyes.</i>

32
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,669
La-ik?

33
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,107
<i>Se-na.</i>

34
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,277
<i>I figured you'd be feeling uneasy,</i>

35
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,739
<i>wondering how to face me,</i>
<i>and then you'd come across this letter.</i>

36
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,827
<i>So I left without saying anything.</i>

37
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,498
<i>I was afraid</i>

38
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,209
<i>that seeing you would shake my decision</i>

39
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,836
<i>to return to my place.</i>

40
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,217
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

41
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,970
<i>I have the courage to face my reality.</i>

42
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,687
<i>I want to get my life back on track,</i>

43
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,398
<i>so I can stand before you and myself</i>
<i>without shame.</i>

44
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>Whatever choice you make,</i>

45
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>I'll be here,</i>
<i>with these feelings unchanged.</i>

46
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,035
<i>Thank you for helping me get back</i>
<i>on my feet when I was at my lowest.</i>

47
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>From the bottom of my heart.</i>

48
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
<i>I like you.</i>

49
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,465
I…

50
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,219
like you, Se-na.

51
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,726
<i>No way.</i>

52
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,687
<i>How could La-ik…</i>

53
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,189
<i>That La-ik…</i>

54
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>likes me?</i>

55
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>No, that can't be it.</i>

56
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,538
<i>Well…</i>

57
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,874
<i>He's going through a lot right now.</i>

58
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,587
<i>He must've leaned on me</i>
<i>without realizing it.</i>

59
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,131
<i>He just mistook that feeling.</i>

60
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>Yeah, that's what it is.</i>
<i>Let's just think of it that way.</i>

61
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,311
<i>But what about me?</i>

62
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,278
Do I like him?

63
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,870
If you've finished
reviewing the response brief

64
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,123
for Ms. Kim Ha-jin's case,
they're asking for it to be filed today.

65
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,500
DO I LIKE?

66
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,302
Here.

67
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,391
This looks like the sentencing opinion.

68
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
Here it is.

69
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,596
<i>They moved Jae-hee to a general ward.</i>

70
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,724
<i>He's out of the ICU for now.</i>

71
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,561
<i>But there's been no improvement.</i>

72
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,439
<i>And they say it's unlikely</i>
<i>he'll regain consciousness.</i>

73
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,191
<i>Everyone's pretty much given up.</i>

74
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

75
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,002
You always loved this song.

76
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,259
I told you to give La-ik's case to Jang.
Why are you holding onto it?

77
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:10,933
Sir,

78
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,561
please review this once before you do.

79
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,187
JAE-HEE'S VEHICLE FORENSICS REPORT

80
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,689
What is this?

81
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,443
REPORT

82
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:24,905
What is this?

83
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,408
And this is for what?

84
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,994
This is solid evidence proving

85
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,955
that Do La-ik is deeply involved
in both Woo-seong and Jae-hee's cases.

86
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,374
If we merge the charges,

87
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,669
Woo-seong's murder
and the attempted murder of Jae-hee,

88
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,588
we have a real shot at winning in court.

89
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,590
No, absolutely not.

90
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,885
The higher-ups want this
wrapped up quietly.

91
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,054
Sir, if we bury this case now,

92
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,725
we will never clear our name
from accusations of mishandling the case.

93
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,020
We have enough evidence.

94
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,733
Statements, situational proof,
multiple direct and indirect materials.

95
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,153
We can fight this in court.

96
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,363
I'll take full responsibility.

97
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,804
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU UP?

98
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,351
AD,
SAME-DAY TRANSFER WITH NO NEED TO VISIT

99
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,804
Seriously,

100
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,686
how could he leave
something this important here?

101
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,608
So careless.

102
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,071
What am I supposed to do with this?

103
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,198
I mean,

104
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,577
why leave this with me?
What am I supposed to do?

105
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,456
I can't go deliver it myself.

106
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,209
God…

107
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,545
It's not like this thing has legs

108
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,422
and can walk itself over.

109
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,717
Should I have it couriered?
No, that would make me nervous.

110
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,928
It looks expensive.

111
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,642
Something like this goes missing
and it will bother him all day.

112
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,310
He won't be able to focus on anything.

113
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,981
And now it's a headache for me too.
Well, no choice.

114
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,984
I'll just take it to him myself.

115
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,084
Okay, that's too much, Se-na.

116
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,802
What am I doing?

117
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,987
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

118
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,212
No. I said I'd wait.

119
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,757
Let's go.

120
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,056
Did he really leave?

121
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,527
Hey!

122
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,446
What are you doing?

123
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,783
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean,

124
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,079
I heard Do La-ik left, so I thought
I'd celebrate by eating chicken.

125
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,138
But where are you going in that
at this late hour?

126
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,559
Well…

127
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,478
That's Do La-ik's hat, isn't it?

128
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,149
Yes. Seriously…

129
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,527
he left it at my place. Such a hassle.

130
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,779
A hassle?

131
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,867
Give it here. I'll drop it off.

132
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,704
No. Don't bother.

133
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,416
Just eat dinner.
I'll take it to him real quick.

134
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,678
Okay, let's just check if she's asleep.
Just to the door.

135
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,680
Just a quick look.

136
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,564
It's not like…

137
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,401
I have to give this to him face-to-face.

138
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,946
I could just leave it at the door.

139
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,415
Whose car is this?

140
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,044
I've never seen it before.

141
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,801
Only residents are supposed to park here.

142
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,021
Because of cars like this,
there are never any parking spaces left.

143
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,481
Let's see the plate number.

144
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,946
- La-ik?
- Yes, Se-na.

145
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,448
Hi.

146
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,450
What are you doing here?

147
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,580
The weather's nice.

148
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,625
So I thought I'd go for a drive.

149
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,921
What about you?

150
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
Huh?

151
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,845
Here.

152
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,306
You left this.

153
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,853
Why did you bring this to me?

154
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,981
What do you mean?

155
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,649
It was at my house.

156
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,987
It looked expensive. So I brought it.

157
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,947
This? Now?

158
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,532
At this hour? To me?

159
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,367
Yeah…

160
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,620
Well…

161
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,956
the weather's nice…

162
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,127
Thought I'd go for a little drive too.

163
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:44,261
Anyway, I gave you the hat,
so I'll go now.

164
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,387
Sure.

165
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,995
You're…

166
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,999
still…

167
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,172
waiting, right?

168
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,343
Sure.

169
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,017
Okay then.

170
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,397
Bye.

171
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,812
Stop it.

172
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,772
Stop.

173
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,428
She's killing me, seriously.

174
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,030
Attorney Maeng has been
coming in late these days.

175
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,159
Yeah.

176
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,161
She used to get here at dawn.

177
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,204
Now she just comes in on time.

178
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,708
It's weird. Her expression too.
Lately, something's off.

179
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,087
Right? She's been making
mistakes she never makes.

180
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,756
Wait, is she dating someone?

181
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,884
Come on. That's impossible.

182
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,596
If she starts dating,
that's a miracle for humanity.

183
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,598
- Oh, my god!
- What?

184
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,932
Something funny?

185
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,810
What?

186
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,314
What?

187
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,440
Look.

188
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,692
What is this?

189
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,937
Oh, my god.

190
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,733
With the client?

191
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,921
- Attorney Maeng, did you see the article?
- What article?

192
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,590
Something ridiculous came out.

193
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,092
It says you and our La-ik…

194
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,719
I mean,

195
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,889
you and Do La-ik are living together…

196
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,479
What do we do?

197
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,608
Should we demand they take it down
immediately and threaten legal action?

198
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,081
Attorney Maeng,

199
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,834
you need to take action right away.

200
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,252
For the client's sake…

201
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,464
and for your own.

202
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,178
Thank you, Ye-sol.

203
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,806
I'll explain everything to you later.

204
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,071
Hello, what's up?

205
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,699
<i>Hey! Why weren't you picking up?</i>

206
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,327
- I was in the shower.
- What's between you and that attorney?

207
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,788
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

208
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,124
You've been living with her
this whole time?

209
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,168
What?

210
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,601
MAENG SE-NA

211
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,145
<i>She looks awful in real life.</i>

212
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,191
LIVING WITH HIS ATTORNEY IS NOT OKAY

213
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,734
WHAT'S HE THINKING?

214
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,238
MR. DO LA-IK

215
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,248
<i>- Yes, La-ik.</i>
- Attorney Maeng

216
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,626
Are you okay?

217
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,838
You saw the article, huh?

218
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,216
<i>I'm fine.</i>

219
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,218
What about you?

220
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,931
I'm just sorry. Because of me…

221
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,100
because I was staying there…

222
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,144
No, it's not that. But for now,

223
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,107
until things calm down a little,
you shouldn't go outside.

224
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,278
And you can't go looking
for Reporter Baek again, okay?

225
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,240
<i>It will only make things worse.</i>

226
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,286
Why aren't you answering? Okay?

227
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,914
Okay.

228
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,251
I get it. But what about you?

229
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,714
Every time something like this happens,
you're the one who deals with everything.

230
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,675
It makes me angry.

231
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,679
And the fact that I can't do anything…

232
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:44,973
makes me feel pathetic.

233
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,767
Don't think like that.

234
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,687
I'm really okay.

235
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:56,109
People always make a fuss
and then forget in a few days.

236
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,528
I'll just stay off
the Internet for a while.

237
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,948
If anything happens,

238
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,869
don't handle it alone.
Call me right away, okay?

239
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,163
Yeah. I will.

240
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,457
I'll call you.

241
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,417
Yeah.

242
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,314
Chung-jae, it's me.

243
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,399
Se-na, did you see the article?

244
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,692
<i>Yeah, I saw it.</i>

245
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,361
I'll head over right now…

246
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,573
No need to come to me. But…

247
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,993
I need a favor. It's about Do La-ik.

248
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,330
<i>I'm worried about him.</i>

249
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,248
Can you keep him
from going out for a while?

250
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,542
It's better if he's not seen right now.

251
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,003
You worry about him, even now?

252
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,173
Attorney Maeng!

253
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,966

Living together? Is he out of his mind?

Seriously!

267
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,983
Who ruined Woo-seong's life?

268
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,777
Exactly. And who is this lawyer woman?

NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO ACT

275
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,297
Damn it.

276
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,301
This…

277
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,971
isn't like you at all, Attorney Maeng.

278
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,558
The Attorney Maeng I know
always keeps a clear head,

279
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,852
always knows where the line is
and never crosses it.

280
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,229
I'm truly sorry.

281
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,232
No, I'm not asking for an apology.

282
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,945
I'm worried about you.

283
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,449
I hate seeing people
talk about you like this.

284
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,579
What happened? Why did you do it?

285
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,333
Do you remember

286
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,378
what you once asked me?

287
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,507
How I managed to stay standing

288
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,469
after what happened to my father.
How I didn't fall apart.

289
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,388
The truth is…

290
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,894
I did fall apart a lot.

291
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,229
But…

292
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,525
I survived because of Do La-ik's music.

293
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,444
I was…

294
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,155
a longtime fan.

295
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,659
What?

296
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,955
So when this incident happened,

297
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,582
I wanted to see for myself

298
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,585
whether he was capable
of something like that. And if he wasn't…

299
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,423
then this time, I wanted to be the one
to keep him from falling apart.

300
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,387
Oh, my…

301
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,431
I see.

302
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,354
What do we do now?

303
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,445
Sir. You might want to come out here.

304
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,793
Daughter of a killer! Step down!

305
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,837
- Step down!
- Step down!

306
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,298
Look.

307
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,135
She's really stirred things up this time.

<i>The wireless cutomer</i>
<i>you are calling is unavailable.</i>

311
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,399
- Where are you going?
- Move.

312
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,110
Se-na told me not to let you go outside.

313
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,322
If you show up there now,
it will only make things worse.

314
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,075
- I'll go to her instead…
- I said move.

315
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,452
What are you going to do?

316
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,081
Don't you get it?
This happened because of you!

317
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,585
Do you even know how she has lived?

318
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,006
Sleeping a few hours a night,
never getting to enjoy things.

319
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,466
That's how she has lived.

320
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,469
Why do you think she worked that hard?

321
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,971
Because she wanted
to escape from her past.

322
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,058
Because she wanted to stand tall
in front of the world.

323
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,684
But now, all of that…

324
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,855
All of it is on the verge
of collapsing because of you!

325
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,815
Do you know that?

326
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,651
I know.

327
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,654
That's why I'm doing this.

328
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,658
I wanted to protect her
but I never managed to do that.

329
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,787
Just this once…

330
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,998
I don't want to leave her alone.

331
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,137
What do we do now?

332
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,974
Looks like people have completely
surrounded the whole building.

333
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,851
There's no way
they'll come up here, right?

334
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,772
Hey!

335
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,654
Do you know what it's like outside?
This whole mess is because of you!

336
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,073
Attorney Hwang, that's enough. Stop.

337
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,161
I'm sorry. This is all because of me.

338
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,121
Forget it.

339
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,914
Things will calm down soon enough.

340
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,083
There's no calming down!

341
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,918
We can't get anything done anymore!

342
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,171
I said that's enough.

343
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,174
This all happened because of me.

344
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,842
So I'll handle it.

345
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,095
I'm really sorry.

346
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,642
I'm truly sorry, everyone.

347
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,522
No, wait.

348
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,317
Don't go out there! Attorney Maeng!

349
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,111
Hey.

350
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:46,579
- Come out!
- Show yourself!

351
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,229
This is my workplace.

352
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,273
What you're doing here
is interfering with our operations.

353
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,652
- I'm asking all of you to leave.
- Is it true you were living with La-ik?

354
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,706
As Mr. Do La-ik's attorney,

355
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,542
it's my duty to protect my client
and fulfill my responsibilities.

356
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,796
How I determine
the appropriate method in doing so

357
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:40,174
is entirely a matter
of my professional judgment.

358
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,593
So I ask that you refrain

359
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,346
from unfounded personal questions
and speculative…

360
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,224
Anyway, did you live together or not?

361
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,643
What is your relationship with him?

362
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,772
- We…
- Your dad was a murderer!

363
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,732
- What?
- Really?

364
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,401
A murderer?

365
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,489
How does a killer's daughter
get to defend anyone?

366
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,294
<i>Did you hear? Her dad killed someone.</i>

367
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,503
<i>I know, right?</i>

368
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,672
She's stinky.

369
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,174
She might have the same genes.

370
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,885
- She might kill someone too.
- Exactly.

371
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,429
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

372
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,354
It's Do La-ik!

373
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,148
- What?
- It's La-ik!

374
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,734
- Hey!
- La-ik!

375
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,460
What are you doing?

376
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,628
What are you doing here, Do La-ik?

377
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,714
I told you,

378
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,716
don't come outside until things calm down!

379
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,217
- So why are you…
- And I told you,

380
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,054
if anything happens,
don't deal with it alone.

381
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,057
And? Coming here fixes what, exactly?

382
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,268
I hate running away and avoiding things.

383
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,353
But…

384
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,899
because of you, it looked like we ran away
from all those people. Do you get that?

385
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,735
It wasn't avoiding anything
or running away!

386
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,947
I don't care what anyone else says.

387
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,658
What matters most to me right now…

388
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,827
is you.

389
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:40,086
Standing by and watching you get hurt
is avoiding and running away to me.

390
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
Just once…

391
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,802
Just for today,

392
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,054
can't you think about yourself first?

393
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,849
Just for today, please.

394
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,269
Let me take care of everything else.

395
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,366
"NO PERSONAL FEELINGS," - YET SEEN
LEAVING THE SCENE TOGETHER

396
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,082
SOMETHING WAS ALWAYS UP

397
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,208
BAD TIMING

398
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,167
CARELESS FOR A CELEB

399
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,210
SHE QUIT TO DATE HIM?

400
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,354
Where are we going?

401
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,243
SO-SEUL MOUNTAIN CABIN

402
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,061
Excuse me,
do you have any rooms available?

403
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,188
Huh?

404
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,078
Most people make reservations
before coming.

405
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,956
How do you two even know about this place?

406
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,669
Someone who was supposed to come today
canceled, so I was cleaning up.

407
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,546
You know "no-show," right?

408
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,465
This was gonna go to waste anyway.

409
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,634
If you wanna eat, go ahead and eat.

410
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,019
I don't know what happened to you two,

411
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,854
but just take your time and rest.

412
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,902
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

413
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,948
What a beautiful day.

414
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,502
You're really something,

415
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,504
Maeng Se-na.

416
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,265
These are all the materials required
for filing the indictment.

417
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,767
We meet all the conditions
for prosecution, but…

418
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,687
are you truly going through with this?

419
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,694
Let's begin.

420
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,153
SEOUL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR

421
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,989
DEFENDANT DO LA-IK

422
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,701
Wow, this looks good.

423
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,578
Hurry and eat.

424
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,749
You can eat at a time like this?
Pork belly can really go down your throat?

425
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,169
In emergencies like this,
you have to eat first.

426
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,921
You need strength to fight.

427
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,215
Fight who, exactly?

428
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,509
At least you know it's an emergency.

429
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,014
We should stay here for today.

430
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,643
You really shouldn't have come
to the office, though.

431
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,563
I know. But I can't undo it now.

432
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,315
The fans were…

433
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,817
Eat first.

434
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,485
You can scold me later.

435
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,663
Wow, this is insane.

436
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,540
It's so good.

437
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,334
Are you not gonna eat?

438
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,669
Then I'll eat everything.

439
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,962
No. I'm hungry too.

440
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,065
A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER DEFENDS A MURDERER

441
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,519
Thank you.

442
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,407
I'm sorry.

443
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,580
It all feels like it's my fault.

444
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,917
If it weren't for me,

445
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,713
people wouldn't have found out
about your father.

446
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,139
I'm sorry too.

447
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:30,352
For running away and avoiding things.

448
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,230
That's actually me.

449
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,494
I think I'd forgotten for a while.

450
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,538
That…

451
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,667
what it feels like

452
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,755
to be called a murderer's daughter.

453
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,093
At some point,

454
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,222
I got used to living just enough.

455
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,144
Keeping people at a safe distance,

456
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,730
pretending to be a little confident,

457
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,565
a little sharp around the edges.

458
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,025
Living like that…

459
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,446
wasn't so bad.

460
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,411
I became a lawyer

461
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,663
because of my father.

462
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,919
To clear his name.

463
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,255
But I kept delaying the retrial
all this time…

464
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,093
saying I needed more time,
that it had to be perfect.

465
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:50,265
But today, I realized,

466
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,685
I was just running away.

467
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,857
I was scared…

468
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,361
of being called that name again. So I hid.

469
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,072
Pretended nothing happened.

470
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,284
And lived like a coward,
forgetting everything.

471
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,549
That's not cowardice.

472
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,971
You weren't running away.

473
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,139
You were holding on.

474
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,141
To survive.

475
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,564
No one can live every day
picking at their own wounds.

476
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,318
You endured
because you needed to remember,

477
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,321
and to remember,

478
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,241
you had to live.

479
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,703
That's how…

480
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,373
you made it through.

481
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,085
<i>I like you.</i>

482
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,256
I like you, Se-na.

483
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,449
I'm sorry.

484
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:37,909
Good night.

485
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,653
Come here. Have some coffee.

486
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,025
The birds sound…

487
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,487
sound really nice here.

488
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,364
And the air is really fresh.

489
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,410
Yeah.

490
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,206
Feels like
it's just the two of us in the world.

491
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,932
Why are you looking at me like that?

492
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,602
Do I have something on my face?

493
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,899
Should we stay here one more night?

494
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,156
How can someone be…

495
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,118
this transparent?

496
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,912
Yeah? Me?

497
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,288
Yes.

498
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,292
When I think about it,

499
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,213
you've always been honest
about your feelings.

500
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,924
- Surprisingly honest.
- And?

501
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,510
You don't like it?

502
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,637
I like it.

503
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,477
At first, I was confused.
But now, I get it.

504
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,398
Whether you're on stage
or standing in front of me,

505
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,276
you're still the same Do La-ik.

506
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,448
I like you.

507
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,286
All of you.

508
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,082
Just the way you are.

509
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,515
Yes, sir.

510
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,934
I'm sorry. I couldn't come in…

511
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,811
No, coming in isn't the issue right now.

512
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,732
- Sorry?
- We received an indictment for Do La-ik.

513
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,777
The prosecution
has officially charged him.

514
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:07,572
- What?
- That bastard, Prosecutor Kwak.

515
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,699
He clearly waited for this moment.

516
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,703
<i>You two are in the middle of a scandal,</i>
<i>the public is against you,</i>

517
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,163
<i>and he slips this in right now.</i>

518
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,001
What are we supposed to do?
We can't just sit back and take this!

519
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,636
- Please, just one statement!
- Prosecutor Kwak!

520
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,971
You've filed charges
against Do La-ik today.

521
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,767
It's been reported that a note was found
in which Choi Jae-hee confessed.

522
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,435
What is your reason for indicting him?

523
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,604
The investigation
must rely on objective evidence.

524
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,441
We have secured substantial physical
and circumstantial evidence,

525
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,485
and regardless of Mr. Choi's note,

526
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,946
we are confident in proceeding
with the prosecution.

527
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,447
- Move, please.
- Prosecutor Kwak!

528
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,533
Just one comment, please!

529
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,284
Just a quick comment, please!

530
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,702
You can't just leave like that!

531
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,914
Please say a little more, Prosecutor!

532
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,707
Prosecutor!

533
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,628
If they've indicted him,

534
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,256
that means they've got something, right?

535
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,883
They wouldn't move this fast
without evidence.

536
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,387
But in a situation like this, is it okay
for Attorney Maeng to handle the case?

537
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,806
Articles are saying
they are living together,

538
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,183
and now her past is being dragged out too.

539
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,935
No way she can keep going.

540
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,479
Even for her,
this has to be too much mentally.

541
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,148
She can't do it.

542
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,117
- Can I see the indictment right away?
- Sorry?

543
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,785
Yes!

544
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,247
I need you to request access and copies
of evidence the prosecution submitted.

545
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,790
All of it, as quickly as possible.

546
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,625
Yes.

547
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,642
<i>I wanted to protect her</i>
<i>but I never managed to do that.</i>

548
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,312
<i>Just this once…</i>

549
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,315
<i>I don't want to leave her alone.</i>

550
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,701
LA-IK - OFFICIALLY INDICTED
FOR THE MURDER OF KANG WOO-SEONG

551
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,703
The prosecution
has officially indicted you,

552
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,914
we can't avoid this fight anymore.

553
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,919
This is where it really begins.
Are you ready?

554
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,088
What do you need me to do?

555
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,469
First, we need to fact-check
every single claim the prosecution made.

556
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,471
See if their statements match the evidence

557
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,973
and whether anything
was omitted or distorted.

558
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,684
Whatever I can do, I'll do it.

559
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,686
Then…

560
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,147
there are a few things
I need you to confirm.

561
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:24,477
<i>And no matter what,</i>
<i>I'm going to break away from you.</i>

562
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,939
<i>Then we can live the way we want.</i>

563
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,568
<i>Fine, do it. Let's do this.</i>

564
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,654
<i>It's going to be a big fight.</i>

565
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,449
<i>Be ready for it.</i>

566
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,576
CALL RECORDING - WOO-SEONG

567
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,994
Did you hear it?

568
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:42,954
Huh?

569
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,832
Here, this part.

570
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,418
Listen carefully.

571
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,089
<i>Be ready for it.</i>

572
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,466
There.

573
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,094
Isn't that a door-lock keypad sound?

574
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,640
I asked Director Geum
for the raw audio file,

575
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,602
<i>in case something in the recording</i>
<i>might help recreate the events.</i>

576
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,021
<i>I found it</i>
<i>while I was making the transcript.</i>

577
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,399
But there isn't a door-lock
in Director Geum's office.

578
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,860
If what we're thinking is right,

579
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,405
this could be circumstantial evidence

580
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,532
that someone else
entered your home that day.

581
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:24,245
Then we might be able to prove
the culprit was someone else?

582
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,332
But before that…

583
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,547
these are additional materials
the prosecution submitted.

584
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,216
It's the forensics report
on Jae-hee's car accident.

585
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,846
There are several indicators suggesting
it might not have been a suicide.

586
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:45,642
It looks like the prosecution plans
to use that to build their case.

587
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,018
Yeah…

588
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,729
He'd never kill himself.

589
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:54,192
But during questioning,
why didn't you say where you were?

590
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,902
Where were you?

591
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,030
Where do you think?

592
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:02,533
That was when you left my house, right?
Were you at your dorm?

593
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,666
Sorry?

594
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,214
I was following you.

595
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,256
Following…

596
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,094
Me?

597
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,054
When?

598
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,973
Not like a stalker or anything!

599
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,394
I just happened to be near your office.

600
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,978
And you were getting off work.

601
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:34,357
So I thought, "Where is she going?"

602
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,027
And then, you were drinking beer.

603
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:41,823
What?

604
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,164
Well, well.

605
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,222
So…

606
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,391
So what exactly did you see?

607
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:11,769
Just you chugging beer,

608
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,980
yelling your lungs out on the way home,

609
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,108
dumping all my merch
in front of your house.

610
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,192
So you saw everything.

611
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,573
You have to explain all of that in court!

612
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:27,577
Why would you follow me like that?

613
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,165
Because I missed you.

614
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,627
Because I wanted to see you.

615
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,175
But why did you go to the place
where I played piano for you?

616
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:59,066
Were you maybe
missing me a little that day?

617
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,330
Come on, what's that reaction?

618
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,081
What is it? Huh?

619
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:18,294
You did miss me, didn't you?

620
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:22,089
Se-na? Why can't you say it?

621
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,591
I missed you!

622
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,519
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

623
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,232
You didn't need to say it that honestly.

624
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,326
What's this?

625
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,205
That's the evidence inventory.

626
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,541
The items the police took from your place.

627
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,627
We didn't request them back,
so they're still at the station.

628
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,923
Wasn't this your signature accessory?

629
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:08,135
You wore it every day for ages,
but not so much recently.

630
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,932
ONE METAL PIERCING

631
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,604
Why? Is it important?

632
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,190
This…

633
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,876
Sir, can you hear me?

634
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,730
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

635
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,923
So there was one more of this?

636
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,300
I…

637
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,427
think I know.

638
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:32,887
What?

639
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,266
I…

640
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,602
think I know the person

641
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,688
who came to my place that day.

642
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,544
<i>No matter how painful the truth is,</i>

643
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,588
I won't run away anymore.

644
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:53,092
Woo-seong had a habit of
recording everything.

645
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,594
<i>I can't figure out the password.</i>

646
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,348
Woo-seong said he hid a secret message
in one of his songs.

647
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,393
<i>I'm leaving now. Take care.</i>

648
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,480
Byung-gyun, can you really live
with a clear conscience?

649
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,692
<i>I want to hear from you directly</i>
<i>why you did it.</i>

650
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:15,948
