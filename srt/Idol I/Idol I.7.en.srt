1
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,258
Do La-ik?

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,678
Do La-ik!

3
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,537
Do La-ik…

4
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,292
Tell me.

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,088
Explain what all this is.

6
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,017
Explain it.

7
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,396
Why is this here?

8
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,570
From the start, something felt off.

9
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,406
Do lawyers normally go this far?

10
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,123
Even if it's your job,

11
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,252
believing me no matter what,
protecting me like that.

12
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,672
It didn't make sense. But then--

13
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,591
-La-ik, that's not what--
-Then what is it?

14
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,394
It's…

15
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,066
true I was your fan.

16
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,362
But that wasn't the reason
I took your case.

17
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,114
Then why did you?

18
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,076
And why did you hide this?

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,625
If you'd just been honest
from the beginning,

20
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,627
I could've handled it.

21
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,590
I wouldn't have relied on you like this.

22
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,844
This was the first time in my life

23
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,472
someone defended me.

24
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,893
Someone simply said they believed me.

25
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,522
That they were on my side. I was grateful.

26
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,568
Not because I'm Do La-ik from Gold Boys,

27
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,363
but because I thought you saw just me.

28
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,033
So…

29
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,161
for the first time,
I trusted someone without a doubt.

30
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,246
I believed everything I saw.

31
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,751
But I guess I was wrong.

32
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,803
If…

33
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,562
I wasn't Do La-ik of Gold Boys,

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,275
would you still have defended me?

35
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,736
Would you still…

36
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,782
have believed me?

37
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,989
When did it start?

38
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:12,979
What if you found out
that someone you really trusted…

39
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,692
told you a huge lie?

40
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,028
What do you think you would do?

41
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,366
Since when…

42
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,127
has she been lying to me?

43
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
MANAGER HAN-GU

44
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,910
Attorney Maeng, why are all the doors…

45
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,499
What is all this? Why is this…

46
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,751
La-ik knows everything.

47
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,419
What?

48
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,718
He saw all of this?

49
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,143
I told you I should've thrown it out.

50
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,313
-If I had, none of this would've happened.
-Don't touch it.

51
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,358
I'll do it.

52
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,237
I…

53
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,532
I can do it.

54
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,450
If you could,
you would've done it already.

55
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,744
What did you tell me, huh?

56
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
"No personal feelings."

57
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,374
"I took the case as a lawyer, not a fan."

58
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,000
And you can't even throw this out?

59
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,961
I was going to throw it away!

60
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
I tried to let go
of my feelings for La-ik.

61
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,980
No, I already had.

62
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,816
I had to, if I wanted to take his case.

63
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,152
But…

64
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,823
But…

65
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,244
This…

66
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,123
I just

67
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
couldn't throw it away.

68
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,432
If I did…

69
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,104
then the time in my life
when I liked someone for the first time…

70
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,766
DO LA-IK

71
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
THE UNIVERSE THAT LED US
BACK TO EACH OTHER

72
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,103
LA-IK'S FACE IS INSANELY GORGEOUS

73
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,534
So cute!

74
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,791
It felt like all those moments
would just vanish into nothing.

75
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,521
Like

76
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,484
the happy version of me back then
would disappear too.

77
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,532
And that terrified me.

78
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,335
So…

79
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,008
I hid it away, deep down…

80
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,141
and told myself
I'd never look at it again.

81
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,686
I thought I'd be okay, but…

82
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,658
You didn't hear from him either?

83
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,493
With how things
are between Jae-hee and me,

84
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,078
why would he call me?

85
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,623
Even Young-bin doesn't know?

86
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,790
He doesn't.

87
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,877
Right before Young-bin was about to move
his stuff out of the dorm,

88
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,296
he told Jae-hee he was quitting and left.

89
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,213
Why Young-bin?

90
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,758
He told me he was sorry for doubting you.

91
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,302
Guess that made it awkward
for him to stay with Jae-hee.

92
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,811
What do we do? The prosecution called.
They want him in for questioning.

93
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,397
Jae-hee? Why?

94
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,149
Wasn't he already questioned?

95
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,859
I don't know.

96
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,529
They said you'll be summoned soon, too.
Didn't your lawyer tell you?

97
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,041
He's not saying anything.

98
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:11,837
Where he's been,
why he suddenly fell out with his lawyer,

99
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,089
he won't talk at all.

100
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,175
I don't know if he doesn't trust me.

101
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,429
For now, I told him to stay at the dorm.

102
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,766
Young-bin's gone home anyway, so…

103
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,518
Find him now.

104
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,103
Sorry?

105
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,229
Jae-hee.

106
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,147
Find him however you can.

107
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,526
We need to get to him
before the police do.

108
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,157
Hello.

109
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,660
What?

110
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,125
-Attorney Maeng.
-How long has he been in there?

111
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,753
It's been about two hours.
But the detective called yesterday.

112
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,215
They were looking for Jae-hee.
Did something happen?

113
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,300
They said you'd know.

114
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,469
I'll explain it soon.

115
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,474
How would I know

116
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,642
where Jae-hee is?

117
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,897
After he finished
his face-to-face questioning with you,

118
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,356
he completely disappeared.

119
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,486
He won't answer his phone,
and no one around him knows where he is.

120
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,531
-Quite the coincidence, isn't it?
-What do you mean?

121
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,576
He gave a statement that was
extremely damaging to you and vanished.

122
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,996
Hard to call that

123
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,332
a coincidence, don't you think?

124
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,627
Are you

125
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,338
seriously asking if,

126
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,258
because he accused me,
I did something to him?

127
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,094
Where were you after
the face-to-face questioning?

128
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,140
Why can't you answer?

129
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,102
-Where were you?
-Hold on!

130
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,984
What do you think you're doing?

131
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,444
Doing what, exactly?

132
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,489
If you question a suspect
without their lawyer present, coercively,

133
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,575
anything you obtain in that process
will be considered illegally--

134
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,035
Your client

135
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,080
agreed to be questioned without counsel.

136
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,207
He consented to it.

137
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,376
Isn't that right?

138
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,174
If you stop the questioning now,

139
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,552
you'll be overriding

140
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,513
your client's own voluntary choice.

141
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,099
Depending on the situation,

142
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,769
a suspect can waive
the right to counsel, right?

143
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,336
Wait.

144
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,130
Please talk to me.

145
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,507
La-ik.

146
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,355
I know you're disappointed in me.

147
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,692
But if you keep getting questioned
without your lawyer,

148
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,069
-you won't be protected--
-Stop.

149
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,531
Whatever comes out
of your mouth right now,

150
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,451
I can't believe any of it.

151
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,708
You're right. I was your fan.

152
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,970
It's true, that's why I took an interest
in the case at first.

153
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,723
But the moment
I decided to be your lawyer,

154
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,683
I put all of that away.

155
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,477
I took this case

156
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,772
because something felt off,
the investigation had holes,

157
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,900
your statement was credible.

158
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,735
Work is work,
and personal is personal.

159
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,279
The one I liked was La-ik of Gold Boys.

160
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,656
But the one I'm defending…

161
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,701
is Do La-ik, the person.

162
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,496
For me,

163
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,748
those two are different people.

164
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,833
Is that still not enough?

165
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,211
That's exactly why it's not enough.

166
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,132
I want to be able to do that too.

167
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,094
Work is work, and personal is personal.

168
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,098
It would be nice if I could draw
a line that clearly.

169
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,641
But the problem is…

170
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,481
I'm not acting like this

171
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,694
because I think you lied to me.

172
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,073
It's because you made me believe you.

173
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,411
You're fired.

174
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,810
La-ik. What did they say?

175
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,271
Where's your lawyer?

176
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,066
Did you call her here?

177
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,652
Don't contact her again.

178
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,238
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

179
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,888
I'm not acting like this

180
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:40,017
because I think you lied to me.

181
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,772
It's because you made me believe you.

182
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,416
People are too mean.

183
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,135
If someone doesn't get
on the elevator, they should at least ask,

184
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,387
"Not getting on?"

185
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,723
Everyone only thinks about themselves.

186
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,851
Your client, too.

187
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,563
After all you've done for him,
he decides to fire you now?

188
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,483
I guess he thought
the attorney's fee was a waste?

189
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,527
Not busy enough?
Want me to make you busier?

190
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,946
No, I'm plenty busy already.

191
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,865
Choi Jae-hee has gone missing.

192
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,286
Pretty wild timing, isn't it?

193
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,206
We don't know
if he's missing or just ran off.

194
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,500
But you talk like the case
is already closed.

195
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,169
If you really think his disappearance

196
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,339
is connected to La-ik,
why don't you open a proper investigation?

197
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,092
Right. You can't.

198
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,803
If you poke the wrong place
and the suspect changes,

199
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,265
you'd have to admit
your entire investigation was a mistake.

200
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,602
Always quick on the uptake, aren't you?

201
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,896
But you know how it works.

202
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,024
Whatever pieces show up,

203
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,485
I'm the one who decides

204
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,612
how to weave them together.

205
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,450
You're just like him. Your father.

206
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,412
-What?
-The prosecution's job

207
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,622
is to prove charges,
not decide the verdict

208
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,583
and then force the evidence to match.

209
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,293
But

210
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,546
that's exactly what you're doing.

211
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,630
Just like your father.

212
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,008
Whatever the truth is,

213
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,052
what matters is what gets proven in court.

214
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,264
You should know that
after what your father went through.

215
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,434
Once the verdict is out, that's it.

216
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,896
Your father was guilty in the end,

217
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,148
and Do La-ik will be no different.

218
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,026
No matter how hard you fight,

219
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,739
back then or now, you'll never beat me.

220
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,661
Not getting on? Go ahead.

221
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,667
Head down.

222
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,921
And don't come crawling back up.

223
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,676
Pathetic.

224
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,983
It's me. I'd like to see you now.

225
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,200
A former chief prosecutor
will be joining the case.

226
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,412
We'll also bring in
a retired high-ranking official,

227
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,291
and we're reaching out to someone
who's won a similar case.

228
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,711
If there's anyone you prefer,
we can hire externally as well.

229
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,672
I won't be joining.

230
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,677
My retainer has already been terminated.
It was Mr. Do La-ik's decision.

231
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,053
What?

232
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,514
Things are moving too fast.

233
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,684
Leaving him without counsel right now
is extremely dangerous.

234
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,813
You need to make sure he signs
with a new attorney as soon as possible.

235
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,606
Don't worry about that.

236
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,775
But first…

237
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,111
I want to know why.

238
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,405
Why did he suddenly do that?

239
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,536
I broke my client's trust.

240
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,374
Please make that clear
to whoever takes over.

241
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,169
I wasn't removed
because the case is unwinnable,

242
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,129
but solely because of my own mistake.

243
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,756
I will.

244
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,760
Once you finalize the retainer,

245
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,179
I'll compile everything
and send over the case files.

246
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,931
Then…

247
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,767
Attorney Maeng.

248
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,818
Thank you
for handling La-ik's case so sincerely.

249
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,530
From here on, I'll take care of it.

250
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,449
I hope

251
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,409
the two of you never meet again.

252
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,289
Don't worry.

253
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,124
That won't happen.

254
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,262
Jae-hee?

255
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,852
I saw him at the dorm
right before I headed home.

256
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,688
I haven't talked to him since. Why?

257
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,566
He didn't say he was going somewhere?

258
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,985
No, nothing. Why?

259
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,071
Did something happen?

260
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,367
The manager seemed weird yesterday, too.
Is something going on with Jae-hee?

261
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
No. If he contacts you,
call me right away.

262
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:49,678
Mr. Choi Jae-hee is a crucial witness
who can prove your guilt.

263
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,640
If he disappears right now,
the person who benefits the most,

264
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,351
wouldn't that be you?

265
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,770
-He definitely killed Woo-seong.
-No!

266
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,023
I never killed him.

267
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,569
-I believe…
-I believe…

268
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,779
…in Do La-ik.

269
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,903
Why are you so late?
Do you know what time it is?

270
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,656
Hurry up, let's eat.
I'm seriously about to die from hunger.

271
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm hungry,
Attorney Maeng, let's eat.

272
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,712
Don't look at stuff while you're eating.
Just eat.

273
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,133
I am eating. Slowly.

274
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,052
Here. Eat up.

275
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,554
I should eat slowly.

276
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,890
Hurry and eat before I finish everything.

277
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,136
Jae-hee's completely cut contact.
He's gone off the grid.

278
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,930
Why else would he do that?
He's hiding something!

279
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,308
That still isn't proof he's the culprit.

280
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,352
Look, he could've run.

281
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:29,898
He lied about his alibi,
and no one can confirm he was at the dorm.

282
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,900
We should issue a warrant and find him…

283
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,195
From the beginning,
we've been investigating Do La-ik

284
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,738
as the sole suspect.

285
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,202
If we announce a new suspect now,
do you think the media will stay quiet?

286
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,374
They'll say we targeted the wrong person,
that it was a biased investigation.

287
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,669
And then neither of us
will be able to avoid responsibility.

288
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,549
The best option is to handle this quietly
on our end.

289
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,177
Quietly? That's impossible.

290
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,680
The reporters are circling like sharks.
How are we supposed to stop them?

291
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,642
It would be better if we moved first.

292
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,603
We need a warrant now

293
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,440
and need to start searches for everything.
His phone, his bank records, his car.

294
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,985
If he slips abroad,
what are you going to do, huh?

295
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,699
Every time you flip the suspect,

296
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,120
it's not just you,
the entire prosecution loses credibility.

297
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,375
Once you set a target,
you never change it.

298
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,626
You never let it slip.

299
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,004
There will be no change
in our investigation.

300
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,298
You can issue a warrant. That's fine.

301
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,218
But our primary suspect is still Do La-ik.

302
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,973
Tracking down Choi Jae-hee will be framed
as part of strengthening the case

303
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,268
against Do La-ik, officially.

304
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,645
Hello?

305
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,983
Hello? Are you listening?

306
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,820
You knew all along, didn't you?

307
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,239
About the tampering.
That it was Woo-seong.

308
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,618
Don't even think about lying.

309
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,747
I figured it out
from the way the manager was acting.

310
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,791
Do La-ik said he would never do it.

311
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,794
Young-bin doesn't have it in him,
and I know it wasn't me.

312
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,213
So who's left? It's only Woo-seong.

313
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,549
Am I wrong?

314
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,678
Then why did you tell me
not to say anything to the police?

315
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,639
Where are you right now?

316
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,244
AGREEMENT FOR TERMINATION
OF THE MANDATE CONTRACT

317
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,039
THE PARTIES AGREE TO TERMINATE
THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT.

318
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,417
PRINCIPAL: DO LA-IK
ATTORNEY IN CHARGE: MAENG SE-NA

319
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,403
CALL

320
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,828
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

321
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,127
-SE-NA, WHERE ARE YOU?
-I'M HOME

322
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,334
ATTORNEY LEE JEONG-HA

323
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,010
Attorney Maeng Se-na gave you my number?

324
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,553
Yes.

325
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,891
She contacted us herself
when she stepped down.

326
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:40,398
I think she was worried about you
since you're still without counsel.

327
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,028
We're very interested in your case.

328
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,239
If you need any legal advice,

329
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,408
please don't hesitate to reach out.

330
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,619
I'll do my best.

331
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,955
Sorry.

332
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,291
I don't need a lawyer.

333
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,531
I heard you turned him down?

334
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,993
I went through a lot to bring him in.

335
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,414
-You're really going without--
-It was you.

336
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,125
I knew it.

337
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,337
It was strange
that he contacted me out of nowhere.

338
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,797
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

339
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,759
I thought
if I said I'd get you help, you'd hate it.

340
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,678
If you knew I'd hate it,
why did you do that?

341
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,305
Attorney Maeng Se-na came to see me.

342
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,475
She asked me to find you a lawyer.

343
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,607
Can't you just think of it
as a friend trying to help?

344
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,070
As a friend,
isn't this the least I can do?

345
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,823
You can't.

346
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,076
If I accept someone's feelings,
I have to return them.

347
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,998
And I…

348
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,751
don't have anything left in me
to give back anymore.

349
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,297
So don't do this anymore.

350
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,925
Please.

351
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,344
Is it because of her?

352
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,265
Do you…

353
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,436
like her?

354
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,199
You don't look well at all.
Let's just rest today, okay?

355
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,410
I'm fine.

356
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,621
Fine? You don't look fine at all.

357
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:45,583
You haven't been eating,
you haven't been sleeping.

358
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,836
How long are you going to keep this up?

359
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,758
I can't stand this,
because it's so frustrating.

360
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,262
You're not feeling well. So just rest.
Stop pretending you're okay.

361
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,850
If I don't keep moving,

362
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,645
I feel like I'll fall apart.

363
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,899
If I stay still, I start thinking.

364
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,904
And if I think, I start regretting.

365
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,448
And if I regret…

366
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,036
I can't bear it.

367
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,379
And… you can't see me?

368
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,446
Don't you see

369
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,158
how worried I am about you?

370
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,079
Can't you lean on me
at least when it's this hard?

371
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,417
I know you think of me like family.

372
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,086
But…

373
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,978
Chung-jae.

374
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,191
I understand what you mean.

375
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,067
But we…

376
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,529
can't cross that line.

377
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,910
THE LATE MAENG JI-YONG,
THE LATE PARK SU-HEE

378
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,607
So it was you.

379
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,903
You don't remember me?
I've seen you before.

380
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,822
What's your registered address?

381
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,825
I don't have one. I drift around.

382
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,622
I don't have anywhere to go.
I just live wherever my feet take me.

383
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,636
We split the water bill 50:50.

384
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,014
Gas comes on a separate notice.

385
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,350
Rent is due at the end of every month.

386
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,684
That's all.

387
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,852
Hey…

388
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,646
Why are you helping me?

389
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,566
I'm not helping you.

390
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,153
I just didn't want
the spare room going to waste.

391
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,282
And if you're ever late with the rent,
I'll take it in labor, just so you know.

392
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,707
Attorney Maeng, I brought the documents
for the embezzlement case.

393
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,709
Just leave them there.

394
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,839
So…

395
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,590
Are you okay?

396
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,761
I mean, I thought you weren't going home.

397
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,806
I still have some work left. Go ahead.

398
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,947
She's working late again?

399
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,033
She's been pushing herself like crazy.

400
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,743
She has to.

401
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,955
Everyone in Seocho heard
she got dropped from the case.

402
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,708
Come on, it was just one case.
Does she have to go this far?

403
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,377
It was a huge case.

404
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,088
She needs to grab another big one
and rebuild her name.

405
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,423
I don't think that's it.

406
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,135
She's been really strange lately.

407
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,431
She hardly talks, just works nonstop.

408
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,059
It's like she has no emotions left.

409
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,228
Like she's hollow inside.

410
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,356
Let's just keep quiet. Take care.

411
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,568
Bye.

412
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,631
Are you busy?

413
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,343
I'm just finishing this up before I leave.
What brings you here?

414
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,969
Nothing…

415
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,517
Then, do you have a minute?

416
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,694
This is good.

417
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,448
I was surprised to hear
you quit the case all of a sudden.

418
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,578
I didn't quit, I was fired.

419
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,916
Fired? Why?

420
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,835
I told my client…

421
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:32,216
a lie I shouldn't have.

422
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,926
You?

423
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,140
How did things get so tangled like this?

424
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,895
Actually,

425
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,565
there's something that bothered me.

426
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,400
So I've been looking into that.

427
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,693
Something bothered you?

428
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,280
You remember we ran into each other
at Goldie Entertainment?

429
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,573
Yes.

430
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,241
Attorney Hwang

431
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,578
had been digging around, trying to verify

432
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,080
what Choi Jae-hee said
about the tampering issue.

433
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,666
And it turns out
a little before the murder case happened,

434
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,210
Gold Boys' contract

435
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,381
was being quietly re-examined
by their legal team.

436
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,509
What they focused on the most

437
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,345
was the clause about breach of trust.

438
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,974
As if someone in the group
was going to betray them and they knew it.

439
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,393
Mr. Kang Woo-seong said

440
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,980
he'd already worked things out with La-ik
and pushed hard for the contract.

441
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,817
He was the one who handled
the entire negotiation.

442
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,489
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

443
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,285
If he thinks anything threatens
his company, he'll go straight

444
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:46,540
to lawsuits, smear campaigns,
push people to the edge until they break.

445
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,251
It felt off to me,

446
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,338
so we were planning to cut ties
with Goldie's legal team as well.

447
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,300
I was going to tell you
once everything was sorted out,

448
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,260
but you suddenly dropped
the case so quickly.

449
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,643
Still, even if you're stepping away,

450
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,146
don't you think
your client should know this?

451
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,649
It might help him.

452
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,575
Well, you said you couldn't drink.

453
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,702
You're quite the heavy drinker.

454
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,560
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

455
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,323
The caller cannot get to the phone…

456
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,370
MR. DO LA-IK

457
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,665
La-ik, I have something to tell…

458
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,293
Where is she going?

459
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,175
Cut the useless talk

460
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,928
World-best Do La-ik!

461
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,764
This is where it starts

462
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,906
I'm not yours, so stop saying it

463
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,492
Nothing you say can change…

464
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:03,750
…so leave me alone, yeah!

465
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,131
Like the stars shining brightly

466
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,925
In the night sky

467
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:16,430
I'll be free

468
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,490
I'm not yours, so stop saying it

469
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:40,328
I don't want to hear anything

470
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,846
What am I doing?

471
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,538
She threw everything out?

472
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,082
CHOI JAE-HEE

473
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,502
MISSED CALL

474
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,546
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

475
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,259
You're late.

476
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,557
Work must be keeping you busy these days,
coming home this late.

477
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,813
You've been giving me a lot of work.

478
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,402
So what brings you all the way here?

479
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,863
Because it's hard to see your face.

480
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,698
You never show up at home.

481
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,953
So you came here because you missed me?

482
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,917
Hye-joo, do you know something?

483
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,169
You only smile at me when you're lying.

484
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,924
No need to look so shocked.

485
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,135
You were questioned by the prosecution,

486
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:45,639
hired an attorney because of Do La-ik.

487
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,848
You think I wouldn't know?

488
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,686
I've secured a position
at the California branch.

489
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,899
I'll take care of everything here,
so go back to the States.

490
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,986
Why?

491
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,572
Sending your disgraceful daughter

492
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,282
away again?

493
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,867
I'm doing this for your sake.

494
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,203
No. It's for the family's reputation.

495
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,414
As always,

496
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,918
you were always so busy hiding me,

497
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,711
the mistress's child,

498
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,297
worried I might embarrass the family.

499
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,342
-Hye-joo--
-Why do you think I don't go to the house?

500
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,305
Was there a single person
who welcomed me there?

501
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,100
And the one person

502
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,353
who did love me,

503
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,647
what did you say you'd do to him?

504
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,526
You threatened to ruin him.

505
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,568
Hong Hye-joo.

506
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,405
I did everything you asked!

507
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,456
You told me to break up, I did.

508
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,585
You told me to go to America, I did.

509
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,464
So can't you just pretend
you don't see this one thing?

510
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,841
He's a murder suspect.

511
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,552
And you got dragged into an investigation.

512
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,887
Do you know how hard I worked
to cover up those articles?

513
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,143
See?

514
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,022
Yet, you still care more
about what others think.

515
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,902
You remember

516
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,947
how broken I was in the States.

517
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,368
If you go after La-ik,

518
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,122
I'll be worse this time.

519
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,749
Far worse.

520
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,916
You!

521
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,252
Dad.

522
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,049
You love me.

523
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,137
You can't lose

524
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,474
someone you love again.

525
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,560
Not like Mom.

526
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,898
Right?

527
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,403
Pull over for a sec.

528
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,655
Here?

529
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,365
Why?

530
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,576
I need to use the restroom.

531
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:14,746
Just stop the car, you talk too much.

532
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,624
Where are you going to find
a restroom around here.

533
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,418
There. Pull over there.

534
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,478
When are we even getting home…

535
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,069
What is that?

536
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,030
Sir!

537
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,116
Come here!

538
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,325
What is it?

539
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,962
What is that?
Did we get any accident reports today?

540
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,547
No, none.

541
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,801
Is that a person?

542
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,720
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

543
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,088
CHOI JAE-HEE

544
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,094
Choi Jae-hee, where are you?

545
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,263
Yes, Young-bin.

546
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,225
What?

547
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,003
MISSED CALL - CHOI JAE-HEE

548
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,134
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

549
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,432
DETECTIVE YU NAM-SIK

550
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,354
Hello?

551
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,647
This is Detective Yu.

552
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,152
I need to confirm something.

553
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,282
You got a call
from Choi Jae-hee last night, right?

554
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,950
Why are you asking?

555
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:42,120
Did you happen to speak with him?

556
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,500
What is this about?

557
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,918
It's that…

558
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,713
Choi Jae-hee was just found.

559
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,631
What?

560
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,801
We found him.

561
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,847
Breaking news just in.

562
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,808
Choi Jae-hee,
a member of the idol group Gold Boys,

563
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:08,521
who has been questioned as a witness
in the murder case of the late Woo-seong,

564
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:14,068
was in a car accident last night
and is currently unconscious.

565
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,195
Authorities are currently investigating

566
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,281
the circumstances
and cause of the accident.

567
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,785
Witnesses report
that Mr. Choi had been showing

568
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,455
signs of instability
following the incident,

569
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,207
and a document believed to be a will
was found at the scene,

570
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,545
prompting investigators to consider
the possibility of an attempted suicide.

571
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,798
OPERATING ROOM

572
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,121
La-ik?

573
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,633
La-ik!

574
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,487
For staying by my side
when things were hard.

575
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,656
I'm not your fan anymore.

576
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,701
-Prosecutor!
-But there's still a chance left.

577
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:13,039
Jae-hee left me a voice message that day.

578
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:17,710
You think you know everything
about Woo-seong, don't you?

579
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,714
There's something you need to know.
Something very important.

580
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,635
I want to know the truth,
what really happened.

581
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,723
