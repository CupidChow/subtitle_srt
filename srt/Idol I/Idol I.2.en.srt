8

12

No.

13
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,111
That can't be.

14
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,446
Why…

15
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,991
Why would Woo-seong die?

16
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,785
Why Woo-seong?

17
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,204
No way.

18
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,086
I know it's hard to believe,
but this really happened.

19
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,590
Early this morning, Mr. Kang Woo-seong…

20
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,178
was murdered at your house.

21
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm Maeng Se-na from Cheon-un Law Firm.

22
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,564
I'm not sure if you're aware,

23
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,942
but our firm handles the legal counsel

24
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,193
- for your agency.
- Stop.

25
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,195
Stop it.

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,655
Right now, the police

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,783
consider you the prime suspect.

28
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,119
They have made
an emergency arrest of a public figure.

29
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,955
- There must be significant evidence--
- I said stop!

30
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,082
Enough with that crazy nonsense!

31
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,917
Why would Woo-seong be dead?

32
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,962
Just last night
we were drinking together, singing,

33
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,047
planning the concept for our next album!

34
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,552
It's a lie.

35
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
It's a lie!

36
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,640
It's a lie, right? It's a lie, isn't it?

37
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,649
This makes no sense.

38
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,985
Why Woo-seong…

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,989
To find that out, I need your statement.

40
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,992
{\an8}I need to know exactly what happened,

41
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,453
{\an8}whether anyone else came by,

42
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,540
or if there's anyone who might have held
a grudge against you or Woo-seong.

47
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,844
Hey!

53
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,941
Hey, Do Ra-ik!

54
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,026
Who do you think made you this successful?

55
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,320
That's right. We made you.

56
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,240
Your name, your popularity,
everything you're enjoying right now.

57
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,575
We made all of it.

58
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
You could never get rid of us.

59
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,039
Not until we're done with you.

60
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,166
You can't run!

61
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,627

Your fans?

66
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,935
Fans or whatever,
those crazy fangirls did it!

67
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,021
They follow me everywhere,
screaming their heads off,

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
calling and texting me every day,
driving me insane all day.

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,902
They even broke into my house recently.

70
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,029
It was them! It was those psychos!

71
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,867
I knew it, those insane bit****.

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,454
They act all sweet to my face, f**k,

73
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,791
but behind my back,
driving me f**king insane.

74
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,711
When they broke into my house,
I should've had them thrown in jail.

75
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,879
Not doing it, that's my biggest regret.

{\an8}- With whom?
- Come on.

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,563

80
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,649
{\an8}There she is.

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,742
{\an8}Hey!

82
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,664
{\an8}How did you know to come here?

83
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,208
{\an8}Did that jerk, Assistant Jang, report it?

84
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:36,961
{\an8}Hey!

85
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:41,090
{\an8}You know, jumping
a potential client like that

86
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,509
is against the legal ethics code, right?

Why'd you give up so easily?

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,745
Did he confess?
Is he saying he really killed him?

95
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,639
Don't come in without permission.

96

<i>That's enough.</i>

101
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,240

00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,331
<i>I'll show you that this world</i>

181
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,792
<i>Is a stage made only for me</i>

182
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,420
<i>I just wanna be the rockstar</i>

183
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>Cut the useless talk</i>

184
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,802
<i>This is where it really begins</i>

185
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>Let's go rock 'n roll</i>

186
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,933
<i>I'm the rockstar…</i>

187
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,187
<i>Because you're the one</i>

188
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
<i>who made me see that.</i>

189
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,489
<i>I was… able to stay alive.</i>

190
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,450
<i>But…</i>

191
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,039
<i>It's just because he went through</i>
<i>something awful,</i>

192
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,917
<i>he'd never…</i>

193
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,045
He'd never do something like that.

194
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,964
Right?

195
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,050
I don't know.

196
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,763
You tell me.

197
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,681
Which one am I?

198
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,561
You created me.

199
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,858
{\an8}So you should decide the answer.

200
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,321
{\an8}Which one do you want?

201
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,074
{\an8}A wrongfully accused victim?

202
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,160
{\an8}Or…

203
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,455
{\an8}a murderer with two faces?

204
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,376
{\an8}I…

205
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,547
{\an8}What I want is…

206
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
{\an8}the real you.

207
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,262
{\an8}The real Ra-ik.

208
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,057
{\an8}The real Ra-ik?

209
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,606
{\an8}No…

210
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,819
{\an8}That's not Ra-ik, he's…

211
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,489
{\an8}My Ra-ik is…

212
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,824
{\an8}It's not?

213
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,201
{\an8}Then who is it?

214
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,954
{\an8}Who is

215
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,957
{\an8}the real me?

216
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,988
Eat.

217
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,325
You need a bit of carbs in you

218
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,161
for your brain to work properly.

219
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,954
It helps bring back memories,

220
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,499
and lets you figure out
what's actually good for you.

221
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,500
Here.

222
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,963
Let's keep the current stance, all right?

223
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,674
Answer only with "yes" or "no,"
keep it short.

224
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,927
It's been hard, hasn't it?

225
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,056
Mr. Kang Woo-seong
really didn't deserve to die.

226
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,683
No one has a bad word to say about him.

227
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,687
Kind, diligent,
and on top of that, incredibly talented.

228
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,107
I heard he was a leader
the whole team depended on.

229
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,361
But

230
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,198
why would you fight
with someone like that?

231
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,326
- No, the reason we fought was--
- So there was a fight.

232
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,204
- You acknowledge there was a dispute.
- All right.

233
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,208
Don't get dragged in, understand?

234
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,755
He's famous for digging into people
until he gets the statement he wants.

235
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,006
Hey!

236
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,217
Was it me who got under your skin?

237
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,719
No, Kang Woo-seong did.

238
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,433
Look, murder is actually pretty simple.

239
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,103
Friends drink together and start arguing.

240
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,272
"You're wrong," "No, you're wrong,"
and then,

241
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,900
someone gets stabbed.

242
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,153
Guys like Kang Woo-seong
are always a bit annoying, right?

243
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,197
Looking down on people
because he's the leader,

244
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,157
acting like he knows better…

245
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,160
Don't you dare talk when you know nothing.

246
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,622
{\an8}Don't frown.

247
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,543
You'll get wrinkles on that pretty face.

248
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,130
I won't ask for the cleaning fee.

249
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,091
In exchange, I'll add another charge.

250
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,926
- Obstruction of official duties.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,346
If you keep losing your temper…

252
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,098
What kind of person are you?

253
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,101
You're supposed to be my lawyer.
So why aren't you defending me?

254
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,146
Please, calm down first.

255
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,611
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

256
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,407
The prosecution is
about to request an arrest warrant.

257
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,952
So if you're going to confess,
you'd better hurry.

258
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,413
You'll need that sentence reduction.

259
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,843
You quit defending Mr. Do Ra-ik?
How could you do that?

260
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,766
Why? You thinking of taking him in?

261
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,853
Forget it. He's rotten fruit.

262
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,981
With the arrest warrant about to be filed,
how can you just quit now?

263
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,401
You said it was your big chance,
so you wouldn't even let me near it.

264
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,155
Mr. Do Ra-ik is about to go to trial
without a lawyer, do you get that?

265
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,784
Hey, and what about you?

266
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,120
- Didn't you step away knowing it all?
- Knowing what?

267
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,958
The prosecutor in this case.
It's that hard-headed Kwak Byung-gyun!

268
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,252
Didn't you back off knowing everything?

269
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,048
- Who?
<i>- Hard-headed Kwak Byung-gyun.</i>

270
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,927
<i>The golden boy of the High Prosecutor</i>
<i>Kwak Jong-chul's family.</i>

271
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,386
<i>You've never heard of him?</i>

272
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,979
<i>An elite three-generation legal family</i>
<i>dating back to the first president.</i>

273
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,856
<i>You know,</i>

274
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,984
<i>that family's been desperate to get</i>
<i>into politics for years, don't you?</i>

275
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,904
He's using this case to boost his name,
so he can waltz into politics.

276
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,991
If I try too hard to win,
the High Prosecutor will blacklist me.

277
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,953
If I go easy and lose,
the press will chew me up.

278
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,166
So really, who in their right mind
would take on a mess like this?

279
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,992
DO RA-IK, HE WAS TRASH FROM THE START
MURDER IDOL

280
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,938
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,399
- Find the killer!
- Find the killer!

282
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,235
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

283
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,279
- Reveal the truth!
- Reveal the truth!

284
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,199
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

285
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,950
- Find the killer!
- Find the killer!

286
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,120
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

287
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,997
- Reveal the truth!
- Reveal the truth!

288
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,125
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

289
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,044
- Find the killer!
- Find the killer!

290
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,214
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

291
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,090
- Reveal the truth!
- Reveal the truth!

292
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,467
Find the real killer!

293
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,801
I LOVE YOU, KANG WOO-SEONG

294
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,386
MAY YOU BE HAPPY IN A BETTER PLACE.

295
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,096
YOU'LL ALWAYS SHINE IN MY HEART.

296
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,224
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

297
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,351
- Reveal the truth!
- Reveal the truth!

298
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
Woo-seong…

299
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,488
How could he…

300
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,491
How could he do that to a person?

301
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,576
The investigation isn't over yet.

302
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,497
- Ra-ik could be a victim too.
- A victim? What victim?

303
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,211
All the police are saying
that lunatic is the killer.

304
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,840
And think about it.

305
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,219
{\an8}Someone was dying right outside,
there's no way he wouldn't have known.

306
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,637
{\an8}Does that make any sense to you?

307
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,598
{\an8}GOLDIE ENTERTAINMENT'S STOCK PLUNGES
AFTERMATH OF THE IDOL MURDER CASE?

308
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,724
All right.

309
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,936
I understand what you're saying.

310
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,315
But until we finish sorting out
our official position internally,

311
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,652
make sure you all keep your mouths shut.

312
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,821
And…

313
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,447
REPORTER BAEK

314
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,953
Take the boys back to the dorm.

315
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,205
- Sir…
- I said take them.

316
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,249
Yes.

317
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,423
Hey, let's go.

318
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,342
What do you mean
by sorting out our position?

319
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,677
Let's go outside for now.

320
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,891
Sir!

321
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,310
Reporter Baek.

322
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,732
We agreed a long time ago, didn't we?

323
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,028
No matter what happens,
we would never contact each other again.

324
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,739
Yes, I was going to stick to that too,

325
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,450
but something important came up.

326
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,994
You should've received
a photo just now, right?

327
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,712
You know Ra-ik had a fan meeting
before the incident, right?

328
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,964
That person was there that day too.

329
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,009
<i>Isn't it all a bit too coincidental?</i>

330
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>I wondered, if just like back then,</i>

331
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,474
this person might be connected somehow.

332
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,358
You were right.

333
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,614
It looks like

334
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,283
Woo-seong really is dead.

335
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,082
I thought about it over and over.

336
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,501
- And that day--
- No.

337
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,419
Please don't say anything.

338
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,757
I'm not your attorney yet.

339
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,345
I'll ask you one simple question.

340
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,686
From this point on,
look straight into my eyes

341
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,648
and answer only with "yes" or "no."

342
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,069
Did you kill

343
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,488
Mr. Kang Woo-seong?

344
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,869
- If I say no, will you believe me?
- I won't ask a third time.

345
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,288
Did you kill him?

346
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,040
No.

347
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,042
No, I didn't!

348
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,212
How many times do I have to answer?

349
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,714
I swear I didn't!

350
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,010
I even questioned myself.

351
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,805
What if I really did that to Woo-seong?

352
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,766
But no, no way.

353
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
<i>I don't believe him.</i>

354
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,147
<i>Clients always lie for their own gain</i>

355
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,442
<i>exaggerating whatever helps them</i>
<i>and burying anything that doesn't.</i>

356
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,737
<i>But there's one thing I'm certain of.</i>

357
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,947
<i>Hey!</i>

358
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,115
NEVER MET A WOMAN LIKE HER

359
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,706
<i>You're the first woman</i>
<i>who's ever called me "hey."</i>

360
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,836
<i>I sat through that drama where you did</i>
<i>all that bad acting, so I know.</i>

361
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,753
- Cute.
<i>- Do Ra-ik.</i>

362
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>You could never act this well.</i>

363
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,428
I like you.

364
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,768
<i>The law protects us all</i>

365
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:44,482
<i>A better world is</i>
<i>One where the law is alive</i>

366
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,403
<i>And within the law,</i>
<i>We can all be free…</i>

367
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,322
It's the prison wake-up song.

368
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,034
And if things go wrong,

369
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,746
that's what you'll be hearing
every morning at 6 a.m.

370
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,543
Of course, things would be different
if I took on your case.

371
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,383
But before we sign a retainer agreement,
I have one condition.

372
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,763
If you agree to that one condition,

373
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,598
I'll prove your innocence,

374
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,226
without fail.

375
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,943
That woman is completely crazy.

376
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,820
Where did you even find someone like that?

377
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,030
Is she really a lawyer?

378
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,330
Anyway, get me another lawyer.

379
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,873
Someone expensive and competent.

380
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,834
She's the only one.

381
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,796
No one else is willing to take your case.

382
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,216
And…

383
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,679
I can't help you anymore either.

384
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,974
The CEO ordered the legal team

385
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,518
to look into your contract
to terminate it.

386
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:08,149
- What?
- Why did you do that?

387
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,737
Why…

388
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,042
<i>You can say no.</i>

389
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,380
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>you won't be able to refuse.</i>

390
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,341
<i>With all the attention</i>
<i>this case is getting,</i>

391
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,260
{\an8}<i>the public pressure will only grow.</i>

392
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,803
{\an8}IS THIS THE END FOR GOLD BOYS?

393
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,722
<i>Especially the prosecutor on this case,</i>

394
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,183
<i>he has a vicious temperament</i>
<i>and can't stand losing.</i>

395
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,438
<i>And with the powerful backing he has,</i>
<i>no lawyer will step up easily.</i>

396
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,107
Punish Do Ra-ik!

397
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,069
{\an8}Severely punish Do Ra-ik
for killing Kang Woo-seong!

398
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,904
- Punish him!
- Punish him!

399
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,284
<i>As time goes on, your chances</i>
<i>will only keep getting smaller.</i>

400
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,453
A public defender
would say something like this.

401
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,413
The evidence is just too clear.

402
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,667
If we insist on claiming innocence,

403
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,337
and it turns out otherwise,
things will get much worse for you.

404
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,174
It's better to acknowledge it
as an impulsive act committed

405
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,761
- under diminished capacity, and--
- Claim self-defense and intoxication.

406
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,348
You think I killed him too, don't you?

407
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,850
If you accept charges
and ask for leniency,

408
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,770
the sentence will likely end up
around 15 years.

409
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,940
How can I confess
to something I never did?

410
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,529
Just go.

411
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,573
I already have an attorney.

412
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,578
<i>Prosecutors have requested</i>
<i>an arrest warrant for Do Ra-ik,</i>

413
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,748
<i>a member of the popular idol group</i>
<i>Gold Boys, on charges of murder.</i>

414
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,460
<i>The pre-arraignment hearing,</i>
<i>also known as the warrant review,</i>

415
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,171
<i>is scheduled to take place tomorrow</i>
<i>at around 2 p.m.</i>

416
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,465
<i>Through this hearing,</i>
<i>the court will determine</i>

417
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,717
<i>whether Mr. Do's arrest is necessary…</i>

418
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,761
- Yes, Ye-sol.
<i>- Attorney.</i>

419
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,597
I just got a call
from Gangseo Police Station.

420
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,682
<i>It's about Mr. Do Ra-ik…</i>

421
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,272
Please prepare and submit
his attorney appointment form.

422
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,316
Yes.

423
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,069
I'll be going in later this afternoon.

424
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,947
Before then, I need you
to request an attorney visitation.

425
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,451
And arrange a meeting with the CEO.

426
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,079
Yes, I'll see you later.

427
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,790
Get up.

428
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,918
Get up!

429
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,799
- What is it?
- Let's go.

430
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,925
Go where?

431
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,926
To work.

432
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,814
You said you completely quit the fandom!
You even cleared out all your merch.

433
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,359
I didn't take this case as a fan.
I took it as a lawyer.

434
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,237
Because even one person
being wrongfully accused is unacceptable.

435
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,822
Innocent?

436
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,658
- It's obvious he's the culprit!
- Is that so?

437
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,870
Then it should be easy to find evidence
that he's the culprit.

438
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,080
A little before the incident,

439
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,875
some girls apparently broke into his house
without permission.

440
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,626
They seemed like obsessive fans,

441
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,045
but he didn't report it
because he didn't want the drama.

442
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,631
The security guards there
might know something.

443
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,675
Go talk to them, and track down

444
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,011
the identities of those obsessive fans,
no matter how.

445
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,220
Before the warrant review.

446
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,639
What? Wait…

447
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,392
Seriously…

448
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,948
<i>A luxury villa</i>
<i>surrounded by vast green space.</i>

449
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,583
<i>And among them,</i>
<i>the scene of the incident is</i>

450
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,376
<i>over there, Building 103, fourth floor.</i>

451
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,712
<i>Ra-ik's home.</i>

452
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,802
<i>And on the second floor of Building 102,</i>
<i>is the dorm shared by Gold Boys members</i>

453
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:09,682
<i>Kang Woo-seong, Choi Jae-hee,</i>
<i>Lee Young-bin.</i>

454
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,229
<i>According to Do Ra-ik's statement,</i>

455
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,856
<i>on the day of the incident,</i>
<i>at around 8:10 p.m.,</i>

456
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,820
<i>the victim, Kang Woo-seong,</i>
<i>visited the suspect's residence.</i>

457
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,330
<i>About ten minutes later,</i>

458
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,791
<i>the housekeeper, Seo Hyeon-suk, went home…</i>

459
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:03,862
<i>leaving only Kang Woo-seong</i>
<i>and Do Ra-ik inside.</i>

460
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,703
<i>This is where the murder took place.</i>

461
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,250
<i>The estimated time of death</i>
<i>is between midnight and one a.m.</i>

462
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,383
<i>A sudden downpour began around that time,</i>

463
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,136
<i>and someone brought</i>

464
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,306
<i>Kang Woo-seong to his death.</i>

465
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,148
<i>Was it Ra-ik?</i>

466
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,570
<i>And if it wasn't him,</i>
<i>if it were a third party,</i>

467
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:51,534
<i>how did that person manage to get in here?</i>

468
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,912
Thank you for your service.

469
00:31:55,997 --> 00:32:00,209
Kwak Byung-gyun, Criminal Division three,
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

470
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,336
Good to meet you.

471
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,591
The police line
should've been lifted by now.

472
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,803
It feels like a case I need to watch
to the very end.

473
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,930
All right, then.

474
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,142
Seeing it in person makes it harder
to find an answer, Attorney Maeng Se-na?

475
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,691
You're very considerate.

476
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,236
Remembering
the opposing counsel's name already.

477
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,782
I've heard plenty of things about you.

478
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,959
This is a simple case,

479
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,336
so let's not wear ourselves out.

480
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,631
One person died in a closed space,

481
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:50,301
and there was only one person
there at the time.

482
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,680
That'll be clear
after further investigation.

483
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,520
The only person
who had a master key to this house

484
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:05,650
was the housekeeper,
and her alibi has already been confirmed.

485
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,486
According to statements
from people around him,

486
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,906
the only person who knew the door code

487
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,534
was Mr. Do Ra-ik.

488
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,912
And as you can see,
there's no sign of forced entry.

489
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,872
<i>Those crazy obsessive fangirls!</i>

490
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,749
They even broke into my house recently.

491
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,795
Meaning, on that night,

492
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:31,592
the only people in this place
were the victim and the suspect.

493
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,472
I hear your client
is still claiming he's innocent.

494
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:41,144
You and I both know how irrational

495
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,688
{\an8}and reckless that is.

496
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,483
So try to convince him…

497
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,949
So annoyed.

498
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,451
It stinks.

499
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,661
Kwak Byung-gyun

500
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,589
That won't do for me.

501
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:18,264
I'm the type who actually enjoys
doing irrational, crazy things.

502
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,061
See you at the warrant hearing.

503
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,988
Interesting.

504
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,908
Are you crazy?

505
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,047
I mean,

506
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,425
even if you're Maeng Se-na
the lone-wolf hyena, this is too much!

507
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,761
You do know Attorney Hwang
advises Goldie, right?

508
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,972
With the entertainment debating
whether to cut Do Ra-ik off,

509
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,184
coming out with an innocence claim
from the same law firm is just--

510
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,812
- Are you that afraid of Chief Kwak?
- Come on!

511
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,524
Yes.

512
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,530
Because of that snake of a man,
I had to endure all that humiliation…

513
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,283
You know exactly
why I turned down judgeships,

514
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,537
prosecutor jobs, and every big law firm

515
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,042
to join your tiny firm back when
you were barely surviving in Seocho.

516
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,171
I don't know!

517
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,174
You always bring that up
whenever things don't go your way.

518
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,011
Kwak Jong-chul is going to twist this case
to his advantage again.

519
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,681
He'll stir up the media,
get himself a friendly judge.

520
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,975
And then, once again,
an innocent person will--

521
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,894
No, I'm not listening!

522
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,023
There are too many inconsistencies
in this case.

523
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,110
I haven't seen the case files yet,
so it's not clear,

524
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,695
but I'm certain there's something.

525
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,906
Why are you so hung up on this case?

526
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,449
Do you have some kind of certainty?

527
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,452
I just…

528
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,455
There's something
I want to check for myself.

529
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,047
I don't know! I can't do anything to help.

530
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,633
And if something goes wrong,
it's all on you, okay?

531
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,718
Yes.

532
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,012
You can talk just fine.

533
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:26,726
What do you need?

534
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,313
Nothing.

535
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,733
Just keep giving me free rein,
stay out of my way

536
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,985
like you always do,
and let me work however I want.

537
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,659
Knock it off.
What are you here to gawk at?

538
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,330
The ones who can't work
always look for someone else's weakness.

539
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,917
Ears perked up, hoping to catch something.

540
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,509
You may have heard already,
I'll be handling Mr. Do Ra-ik's case.

541
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,261
I need all related case files compiled.

542
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,304
Sure.

543
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,482
Come in.

544
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,158
These are the notes
from Attorney Hwang's last meeting

545
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,369
and the suspect's interview records.

546
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,080
I thought they might be helpful.

547
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,585
How did you get this?

548
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,462
There's no way
he handed it over willingly.

549
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,841
I stole it.

550
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,720
I wanted to help.

551
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,017
I'd like to become your legal assistant.

552
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,565
I'm a fan of Gold Boys.

553
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,988
Don't ever do this again.

554
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,324
If something happens because of this,
I won't be able to protect you.

555
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,868
- You can go now.
- Yes.

556
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,957
Before the warrant hearing,

557
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,627
we only have the suspect's testimony,
no investigation records, so it's tough.

558
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:21,048
Find me similar cases or precedents
where a not-guilty claim was upheld.

559
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,341
As many as you can.

560
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,679
And you can sign the NDA
and put it on my desk by tomorrow.

561
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,805
Yes!

562
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,703
Hey, did you get Jin-taek's number?

563
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,205
Almost, he's going live today.

564
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,085
- I'm going to call him right then.
- Nice.

565
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,093
You're Kim Hee-young, Choi Ha-neul, right?

566
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,471
Who are you?

567
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,681
Do we know you? Do you know this person?

568
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,310
Hello, obsessive pests…

569
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,937
I mean, obsessive fans. Nice to meet you.

570
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,647
Mind if we have a little chat?

571
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,402
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

572
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,116
No, we are not!

573
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,785
Too loud, you.

574
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,788
We're not obsessive fans.

575
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,832
{\an8}We're TMB fans.

576
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,668
<i>Hands off! Record it!</i>

577
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,213
<i>- Get out!</i>
<i>- I'll call the police!</i>

578
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,548
<i>- Oppa!</i>
- You still deny it?

579
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,759
<i>How could you do this to your fans?</i>

580
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:47,843
So what?

581
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,473
Yeah, we snuck in, but he said it was fine
and told us to leave!

582
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,392
Things are not fine anymore.

583
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,562
A murder took place
in the very place you trespassed into.

584
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,731
And I don't think
those two events are unrelated.

585
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,903
What is she talking about?

586
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,823
{\an8}That day Woo-seong ended up like that,

587
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,325
{\an8}- we were tailing the TMB boys.
- Right.

588
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,828
{\an8}How did you even find us?

589
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,998
{\an8}Is it okay for you
to go after unrelated people like this?

590
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, whether there's a connection or not

591
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,586
can change a lot
depending on the angle you look from.

592
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:28,050
Not reporting it
doesn't make your crime any lighter.

593
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,012
Being fans doesn't mean
you get to do whatever you want.

594
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,975
And I fully intend to make you understand

595
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,686
just how serious your actions were.

596
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,607
You've seen how this case
shows up in real-time headlines

597
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,401
every morning and night, right?

598
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,736
With the case blowing up like this,

599
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,574
what do you think will happen
when reporters find out

600
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,076
two people trespassed
into Mr. Do Ra-ik's house?

601
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,247
They'll love it, right?

602
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:04,587
I'll file the lawsuits one at a time,
at a very slow pace

603
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,131
and watch the attention grow even bigger.

604
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:12,011
Then it won't be him appearing on TV
in real time anymore.

605
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,180
It'll be you guys.

606
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,891
And the forums will go crazy
digging up your information.

607
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,477
People will be curious.

608
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,730
Like, who are these girls,

609
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,609
and how were they sneaking in and out
of his house without anyone noticing?

610
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,069
- And how did they know the passcode?
- It's not…

611
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,698
I wasn't asking you to answer.

612
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,827
All I have to do is sit back and wait.

613
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:43,584
The reporters will get
all the answers for me anyway.

614
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,794
Relentlessly.

615
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
Excuse me!

616
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,472
We only went there
because someone told us about it.

617
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,224
It was just curiosity.

618
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,020
How?

619
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,523
It's…

620
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:14,490
<i>The security guards switch shifts</i>
<i>from 11:50 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.</i>

621
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,913
<i>That's when we go in.</i>

622
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,168
<i>We already know</i>
<i>all the CCTV locations anyway,</i>

623
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,296
<i>so avoiding them is a piece of cake.</i>

624
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,191
<i>We just wait for the right moment,</i>
<i>and when the door opens, bam!</i>

625
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,403
<i>We slip in, and that's it. Game over.</i>

626
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,160
<i>Because of resident privacy,</i>

627
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,663
<i>there are no CCTVs</i>
<i>in the hallways or stairwells.</i>

628
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,805
<i>And the last step is waiting on the stairs</i>
<i>with the motion-sensor light disabled.</i>

629
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,183
<i>If it turns on by accident, we're screwed.</i>

630
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,313
<i>So we set everything up</i>
<i>before Ra-ik gets home and wait.</i>

631
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,941
<i>That way, we can safely watch</i>
<i>and figure out the passcode.</i>

632
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,453
<i>Once we get the passcode,</i>
<i>we wait for a day he's out</i>

633
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,539
<i>and the housekeeper's off, then we go in.</i>

634
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,541
<i>As long as he doesn't change the code,</i>

635
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,918
<i>we can come and go whenever we want,</i>

636
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,171
<i>as long as we don't get caught.</i>

637
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,634
You two are real professionals.

638
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,888
So after figuring out
the passcode to his place,

639
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,391
you went back on another day,
snuck into his house

640
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,809
and he caught you?

641
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,687
- That day, you filmed the video of him?
- Yes.

642
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,982
It's because he called us cockroaches.

643
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,651
- Right?
- Yes.

644
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,195
But…

645
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,031
{\an8}Did he really kill Woo-seong?

646
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,867
That's your big question, you stalker?

647
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,244
I told you, we're not stalkers!

648
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,539
We did it because we love him!

649
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,501
Isn't that what love is?

650
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,338
Wanting to get closer,
wanting to see him,

651
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,548
- wanting to take care of him more.
- No.

652
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,176
That's not love. That's hunting.

653
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,136
Because it was fun,

654
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,098
threatening someone's life
and making them suffer.

655
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,140
Violently.

656
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,396
If you truly loved him,
you could never do something like that.

657
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,277
Real love is…

658
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,993
<i>watching the path he walks</i>
<i>from far, far away…</i>

659
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,247
<i>supporting him,</i>

660
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,333
<i>and wishing</i>

661
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,002
<i>for his happiness…</i>

662
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,589
<i>with all your heart.</i>

663
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,466
Bring him back to life!

664
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,593
- Bring him back!
- Bring him back!

665
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,304
Execute Do Ra-ik!

666
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,806
- Execute him!
- Execute him!

667
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,236
- Here he comes!
- Just say one word!

668
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,280
How do you feel right now?

669
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,865
Keep your head up.

670
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,158
COURT

671
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,912
{\an8}You look like guilty
if you keep your head down.

672
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,540
{\an8}Lift your head, and stand tall.

673
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,793
I don't know.

674
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,797
I don't remember.

675
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,093
No matter how hard I try,
I can't remember.

676
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,347
It wasn't me.

677
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,392
It really wasn't.

678
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,481
But what if it was?

679
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,443
What if I was the one
who did that to Woo-seong…

680
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,778
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

681
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,449
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

682
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,457
{\an8}As long as I'm representing you,

683
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,876
you will be found innocent.

684
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,253
I'll make sure of it. Understood?

685
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,884
So repeat after me, "I, Do Ra-ik."

686
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,056
I said repeat after me, "I, Do Ra-ik."

687
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,433
I, Do Ra-ik.

688
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,978
"Did not kill Kang Woo-seong."

689
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,818
Did not kill Kang Woo-seong.

690
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,989
{\an8}"I do not admit to killing
Kang Woo-seong."

691
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:12,204
I do not admit to killing Kang Woo-seong.

692
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,710
Counsel, please state your position.

693
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,594
Your Honor,

694
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,139
the prosecution's sole basis
for labeling the defendant a murderer

695
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:36,812
is just one claim that no third party
entered the scene of the crime.

696
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:40,065
However, two weeks before the incident,

697
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,943
the defendant was the victim
of an illegal home intrusion

698
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,653
committed by obsessive fans.

699
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:48,991
Because of his status as a public figure,
an official police report was not filed,

700
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,910
but the fact of the illegal intrusion
by obsessive fans

701
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,830
has already been sufficiently
and objectively proven.

702
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,456
Therefore, the prosecution's premise

703
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,584
that no third party entered the residence

704
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,460
has effectively lost
its credibility, and--

705
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,962
That claim is unverified.

706
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,966
It's the prosecution
that is making unverified claims.

707
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,928
Your Honor, the prosecution has stated

708
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,390
that all forensic processing
of the defendant's home is complete.

709
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,726
But according to the warrant application,

710
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,145
there is no mention whatsoever
of the weapon presumed

711
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,106
to have been used in the crime.

712
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,318
Prosecutor,
do you have an explanation for this?

713
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,861
Regarding that,

714
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,071
it's still under investigation.

715
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,823
I can't disclose any specific details.

716
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:35,078
But the forensic results show
that there were no signs of external--

717
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,789
Your Honor,
on the night of the incident,

718
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,917
record-breaking heavy rain
began to fall at midnight.

719
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,504
Therefore, the possibility that traces
of an intrusion were erased by the rain

720
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,882
- must be carefully reconsidered.
- Your Honor,

721
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,509
the defense is engaging
in baseless speculation.

722
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,305
It is the prosecution's responsibility
to prove whether it is speculation or not.

723
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,018
According to the defendant's
interrogation record,

724
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,937
{\an8}<i>they repeatedly questioned him</i>
<i>with things like,</i>

725
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,357
{\an8}<i>"There were signs</i>
<i>that the place had been searched.</i>

726
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,484
{\an8}<i>What exactly were you looking for?"</i>

727
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:10,489
{\an8}This means the presence of search traces
at the scene cannot be excluded.

728
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,283
In general, search traces

729
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,371
are marks left when an offender is trying
to find or hide a particular item.

730
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,041
So they can serve as strong evidence
that someone other than the defendant,

731
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,545
specifically, someone unfamiliar
with the space

732
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,507
was present at the crime scene.

733
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,219
Prosecutor, was any such trace
found at the scene?

734
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,058
Yes, there was.

735
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,520
Your Honor,

736
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,897
under the fundamental principles
of criminal procedure,

737
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,360
a guilty verdict must be based on evidence
that leaves no room for reasonable doubt.

738
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,613
Therefore, since the prosecution
has failed to present

739
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,074
any clear evidence proving
the defendant's alleged crime,

740
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:58,954
the request for an arrest warrant
to detain the defendant must be denied.

741
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,957
Accordingly,

742
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,085
based on the presumption of innocence,
the defense strongly urges

743
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,421
that the defendant not be detained.

744
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,056
That stings.

745
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,313
You're throwing counterpunches
from the very first round.

746
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,231
Pardon?

747
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,444
A counterpunch

748
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,989
is when you strike back
against an incoming attack.

749
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,908
I didn't really see anything
I'd call an attack.

750
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
So that was just a couple of jabs?

751
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,162
That's right.

752
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,830
Compare them next time,

753
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,458
how a jab differs from a counterpunch.

754
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,586
I'm going to knock you out then.

755
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,770
How do you overlook
something that important?

756
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,607
If they didn't report it,
how would I know?

757
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,986
- This just got complicated, seriously.
- It's fine.

758
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,906
It was just a blank.
It fired, so that's good enough.

759
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,244
{\an8}He talks well.

760
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,890
The results will come out later.

761
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,561
You can go home now
since the forensic work is done.

762
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,899
Do you have anyone to contact?
Someone you trust.

763
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,609
I'll have them come pick you up.

764
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:07,123
{\an8}<i>The arrest warrant for singer Do Ra-ik</i>
<i>has been dismissed.</i>

765
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,794
{\an8}<i>In today's closed warrant review hearing,</i>

766
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:15,549
{\an8}<i>the court determined that he doesn't pose</i>
<i>a risk of destroying evidence or fleeing.</i>

767
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,802
{\an8}<i>As a result of this decision,</i>
<i>he will remain out of custody</i>

768
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,638
<i>as the investigation continues.</i>

769
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,307
<i>However, the case is not over yet.</i>

770
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:29,020
<i>The prosecution is working</i>
<i>to secure additional evidence</i>

771
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,899
<i>to determine the cause of Kang's death</i>
<i>and to uncover the full circumstances…</i>

772
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,671
Pull over for a moment.

773
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,711
MURDERER

774
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,535
Why are you being like that to Jae-hee?

775
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,079
He cares about you so much.

776
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,914
But why doesn't he call me?

777
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,543
It's not that he doesn't like you.
Just hurry up and open it.

778
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,669
- Hungry, right?
- Yes.

779
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,631
I'm going in first!

780
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,872
- You still can't stay on pitch.
- Then you do it.

781
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,671
You try it.

782
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,260
Come on, I searched so much for it…

783
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,097
I've got this.

784
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,976
I told you it's not.

785
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,521
- Isn't this how it's supposed to be done?
- No.

786
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:50,073
- You have to lift your pinky!
- All right.

787
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,699
I'll try again.

788
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:58,975
Did you wake up?

789
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,647
That's a relief.
I thought you might not wake up.

790
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,527
It's good to see you again,

791
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,155
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

792
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,240
Welcome…

793
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,244
to my home.

794
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,927
{\an8}<i>I'm Do Ra-ik's lawyer right now.</i>

795
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,012
{\an8}<i>I have to protect my client to the end.</i>

796
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,431
{\an8}<i>Is that really the only reason?</i>

797
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,475
{\an8}<i>Ugh, Maeng-byeon, seriously.</i>

798
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,643
{\an8}Aren't you scared?

799
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,602
{\an8}Punish Do Ra-ik.

800
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,397
{\an8}<i>Given the distance, you should have been</i>
<i>back within 20 minutes at the latest.</i>

801
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,233
{\an8}You're hiding something from me, right?
What is it?

802
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,526
{\an8}<i>Will you even trust me?</i>

803
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,986
{\an8}Until the end.

804
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,196
{\an8}I'll stay by your side.

805
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,031
{\an8}<i>I will find my memory back somehow.</i>

806
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,158
{\an8}<i>No matter what.</i>
