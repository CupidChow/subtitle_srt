1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,910
I…

2
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,872
think I know.

3
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,207
Sorry?

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,797
The person who came to my place that day,

5
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,759
I think I know who it was.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,895
Yes, Young-bin.

7
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,106
What?

8
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,030
Mr. Choi, can you hear me?

9
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,657
If you can, blink once.

10
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,080
- Jae-hee!
- Jae-hee.

11
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,581
Are you starting to come around?

12
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,769
Jae-hee.

13
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,896
La-ik.

14
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,314
Yes.

15
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,109
Why am I here?

16
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,320
Where's Hye-joo?

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,582
I'm sorry,

18
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,086
but the patient needs rest.

19
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,712
Please step outside.

20
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,059
Why would he ask for Hye-joo?

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,019
What happened that night?

22
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,146
Yeah, what happened?

23
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,816
Do you know something?

24
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,498
It's a relief that Jae-hee woke up.

25
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,009
About that accessory,

26
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,845
that…

27
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,224
was something Hye-joo and I got together.

28
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,147
What's this?

29
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,691
These are our matching piercings.
Cute, right?

30
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,568
So beautiful.

31
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,903
I worked so hard to get these!

32
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,238
<i>She ordered them herself.</i>

33
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>I heard only two existed</i>
<i>in the whole country.</i>

34
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,827
Let's wear these every day.

35
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>When we broke up,</i>

36
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>I took mine off and locked it in my safe.</i>

37
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,297
Then the one the police seized
wasn't yours.

38
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,969
We can't be certain yet, but…

39
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,097
if Hye-joo entered your house that night,

40
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,184
it could be connected
to the door-lock sound we heard.

41
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,317
La-ik.

42
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,197
I think we should tell the police.

43
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,036
Yeah. We have to.

44
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,498
I don't have time to waver now.

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,416
We came this far

46
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,794
to find the truth.

47
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,428
It's late. You should go in.

48
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,474
Go ahead.

49
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,771
Okay. Get home safe.

50
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,158
Bye.

51
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,881
Yes, Chung-jae.

52
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,550
<i>If you're still up,</i>
<i>could you come down for a minute?</i>

53
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,677
<i>There's something I want to show you.</i>

54
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,597
What is it?

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,266
You told me to check
with the residents last time,

56
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,226
so I looked into it.

57
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,687
Turns out the first floor
is pretty close to the garden.

58
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,231
And I remembered Jae-hee
saying he heard something outside.

59
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,567
So I kept digging.

60
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,613
I found a house with a security camera
facing that direction.

61
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,699
So I pulled the footage.

62
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,293
Did you see it? This part.

63
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,130
If that's a person, it's weird
they're walking around

64
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,715
in heavy rain with no umbrella.

65
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,762
Comparing with the structure beside them,
height is maybe low-160s.

66
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,931
Pretty small build.

67
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,808
If it's a man, he's very small.

68
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,309
And if it's a woman?

69
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,690
Hye-joo may have been
at La-ik's house that night.

70
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,568
Hye-joo?

71
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,696
But didn't she say
she met La-ik outside that night?

72
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,577
And earlier, when Jae-hee woke up,

73
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,038
the first person he asked for was Hye-joo.

74
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
It's not definitive yet,

75
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,253
but this could also
be circumstantial evidence.

76
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,382
Given everything, I'll dig further.

77
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,135
Thank you.

78
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,430
I just don't like him, okay?

79
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,684
La-ik needs to be cleared fast
so he can disappear from your life.

80
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,020
Then maybe I can…

81
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,022
What?

82
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,276
Anyway, I'll tell you if I find more.

83
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,363
I backed up the footage.
Share it with the investigation team.

84
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,328
We actually thought it was strange too,

85
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,000
the way he asked for Hye-joo
the moment he woke up.

86
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,628
And with this footage
and the accessory you found,

87
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,800
we should look into that angle.

88
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,765
But Prosecutor Kwak
is still insisting on indicting La-ik.

89
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,643
He says Jae-hee's statement alone
isn't enough to change the suspect.

90
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:02,106
And even if Hye-joo
is connected to Jae-hee's case,

91
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,446
it doesn't directly tie her
to Woo-seong's murder.

92
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,199
But wasn't Do La-ik indicted

93
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,826
because he believed
La-ik was involved in Jae-hee's case?

94
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,161
Exactly.

95
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,829
But…

96
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,082
Prosecutor Kwak keeps pushing
this forced indictment.

97
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,752
No idea if it's pride or what,

98
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,213
but he won't back down.

99
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,926
Excuse me.

100
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,930
Hello.

101
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,727
Jae-hee?

102
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,104
Yeah.

103
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,530
You're here.

104
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,491
Where's Choi Jae-hee?

105
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,784
He's waiting for you inside.

106
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,497
He keeps insisting
he'll only give his statement to you.

107
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,249
Open the door.

108
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,557
CHOI JAE-HEE

109
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,849
It's just…

110
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,103
I don't really remember

111
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,398
what happened.

112
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,365
I don't even know

113
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,242
why I woke up here.

114
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,663
So please, just leave me alone.

115
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,622
<i>That night…</i>

116
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,541
Stop coming after me!

117
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,210
<i>After I hung up with Director Geum,</i>

118
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>Hye-joo contacted me.</i>

119
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>Out of nowhere, she wanted to meet me.</i>

120
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,453
It's been a while.

121
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,622
Three years?

122
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,959
Yeah. I got back to Korea not long ago.

123
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,380
But what's going on?

124
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,762
Woo-seong's death was shocking enough.

125
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,388
Then you and La-ik.

126
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,558
It's all over the news.
I was really worried.

127
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,853
Are you okay?

128
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,359
What happened?

129
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,111
What's going on?

130
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,322
Tell me.

131
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,533
It's complicated.

132
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,744
I don't know what's going on either.

133
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,002
Is that why you came out here?

134
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:16,217
This place is near
where you guys had your first show.

135
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,260
Right.

136
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,930
I just really missed Woo-seong.

137
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,892
And I didn't have anywhere else to go.

138
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,521
The prosecutors keep treating me
like I'm the culprit.

139
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,190
That's ridiculous.

140
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,318
There's no way.
You're too soft-hearted for that.

141
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,406
But still, it feels like
everyone suspects me.

142
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,074
I'm really not.

143
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,202
I know. You'd never do it.

144
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,459
But that night, you went to La-ik's place.

145
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,630
I think that's
why people are misunderstanding.

146
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,218
But it will clear up.
They'll see you're innocent.

147
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,266
How do you know
that I went to his place that night?

148
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,817
What do you mean? It was on the news.

149
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,319
The news?

150
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,615
Of course. How else would I know?

151
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,493
Jae-hee.

152
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,621
You probably haven't eaten, right?
Let's get dinner.

153
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,666
Okay.

154
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,797
You go first, I'll follow.

155
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,383
Let's get something nice.

156
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll treat you.

157
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,197
<i>Something felt wrong…</i>

158
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,699
<i>that night.</i>

159
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,291
Woo-seong said

160
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,919
he was going to meet La-ik,

161
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,796
<i>so I waited at the hospital.</i>

162
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,714
STILL TALKING?

163
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,466
<i>But he never called, so…</i>

164
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,594
<i>I went by La-ik's place for a moment.</i>

165
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,646
Woo-seong!

166
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,398
But I never told anyone that.

167
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,568
I was afraid people would suspect me.

168
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,822
But I'm not sure how Hye-joo knows that.

169
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>I'm in a situation, and I need some help.</i>

170
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,536
Yeah, so…

171
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,664
Aren't you leaving?

172
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,581
I'll go.

173
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,848
<i>After that,</i>

174
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,726
<i>I don't remember anything.</i>

175
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,146
But thinking about it,

176
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,608
the fact that she suddenly asked to meet,

177
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,863
me waking up here afterward,

178
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,031
none of it makes sense.

179
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,244
Prosecutor,

180
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,456
do you know why I'm telling you all this?

181
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,918
You once told me

182
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,422
that even if someone's innocent,

183
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,717
everything depends

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
on how you choose to see it.

185
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,138
There is no such thing
as an absolute truth.

186
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,765
The truth is always relative.

187
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,559
Depending on your perspective,

188
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,728
it can change.

189
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,691
You said there's no absolute truth.

190
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,319
But you're wrong.

191
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
Truth is singular.

192
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,867
And I never wrote a suicide note.

193
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,619
I never attempted suicide.

194
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,788
That is the truth.

195
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,626
So please,

196
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,920
look at what's real.

197
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,840
Don't turn innocent people…

198
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,801
into criminals.

199
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,772
<i>I looked into Hong Hye-joo.</i>

200
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,982
<i>It's not directly related to the case,</i>

201
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,525
<i>but I think you should see this.</i>

202
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,194
PATIENT MARKED EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE

203
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,082
Yes, La-ik.

204
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,668
I'm at the hospital right now.

205
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,630
The police and the prosecutor are here,
so I wanted to check if you knew.

206
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,132
I heard that
at the police station earlier.

207
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,259
They said he's giving his statement now.

208
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,389
Since I'm involved in the case,
I guess I'm not allowed to see him.

209
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,935
But Young-bin's here,
so I thought I'd check in on him.

210
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,187
Are you okay?

211
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,107
Yeah.

212
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,943
But…

213
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,196
if Hye-joo really has
something to do with Jae-hee,

214
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,657
<i>shouldn't we tell the prosecution?</i>

215
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,952
She said she was leaving the country soon.

216
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,747
Young-bin's here.
I'll call you back later.

217
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,542
Okay. Call me later.

218
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,338
MEDICAL REPORT

219
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,096
The doctor said
we don't have to worry too much.

220
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,435
He's fully conscious now,
and he's slowly recovering.

221
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,024
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,113
Why would you be sorry?

223
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,782
I just…

224
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,201
feel like all of this is my fault.

225
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,040
I've done nothing but hurt you guys.

226
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,711
I had no idea how hard it was for Jae-hee

227
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,714
or what you all were going through.

228
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,760
Not knowing any of that.

229
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,601
Don't say that.

230
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,023
We didn't understand
what you were feeling either.

231
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,361
And Jae-hee's probably feeling
sorry toward you too, deep down.

232
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,535
But seriously, what did happen that night?

233
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,414
If only we had Woo-seong's phone…

234
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,879
He used to record everything out of habit.

235
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,508
If anything was saved on there,

236
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,135
we'd finally know the truth.

237
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,979
<i>Prosecutor,</i>

238
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,108
I've told you everything I know.

239
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,278
Please investigate
Hong Hye-joo properly,

240
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,531
so the truth can come out.

241
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,786
Sir.

242
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,081
Attorney Maeng Se-na is here.

243
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,262
This is all circumstantial.

244
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,722
Nothing here objectively proves anything.

245
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,225
- It's just speculation…
- I heard you met Jae-hee.

246
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,272
He testified that he met
Hong Hye-joo right before the accident.

247
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,815
And these,

248
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,485
the sound from the last call
between Director Geum and Woo-seong,

249
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,030
the silhouette caught near the scene,

250
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,449
the trace evidence,

251
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,034
and this piercing…

252
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,496
don't these strike you as strange?

253
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,541
Not to me. I don't see anything unusual.

254
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,216
No. You do know.

255
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,803
You know the path you're choosing

256
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,181
might be the wrong one.

257
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,560
If the truth gets buried like this,

258
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,855
someone innocent will live
their whole life carrying a crime.

259
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,814
And I…

260
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,818
I know exactly what that life is.

261
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,698
A life where all you can do…

262
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,702
is endure.

263
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:07,748
Byung-gyun.

264
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,833
Can you…

265
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,003
really live with yourself
after pushing someone

266
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,631
into that kind of misery?

267
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:21,470
Can you carry that weight
for the rest of your life?

268
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,229
Hye-joo is leaving the country soon.

269
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,148
We don't have much time.

270
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,116
Kwak Byung-gyun.

271
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,203
You…

272
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,164
don't have to live the way
your father did.

273
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,982

<i>Byung-gyun, you know</i>

281
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,999
I once dealt with something a lot like
what you're facing now.

282
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,835
There was a suspect.

283
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,713
No hard evidence, but a damn clear motive.

284
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,924
But he wouldn't confess.

285
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,551
No matter how hard we pressed,

286
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,595
he kept claiming he was innocent.

287
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,764
And then one day…

288
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,933
that guy…

289
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,519
went and hung himself in prison.

290
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey, wasn't that girl so pretty?

291
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,361
- Come on.
- Hey.

292
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,831
My father is not a murderer.

293
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,167
- What?
- And your father knew that,

294
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,628
but he still drove mine off a cliff.

295
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,923
- What are you talking about?
- You want to be a prosecutor?

296
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,510
I hope you make it.

297
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,679
Because I want you to watch me

298
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,223
set everything right.

299
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,116
Kwak Byung-gyun.

300
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,118
You…

301
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,705
don't have to live the way
your father did.

302
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,689
Yes, Detective Yu. It's me.

303
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,197
Hello, La-ik.

304
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,991
I saw your text message.

305
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,118
Are you flying out today?

306
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,788
Yeah. I'm leaving in a bit.

307
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,878
I called because I need
to ask you one last thing.

308
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,464
Something to ask?

309
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,299
What is it?

310
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,177
That night…

311
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,513
The night Woo-seong died,

312
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,849
did you come to my place?

313
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,395
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

314
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,481
Were you at my place?

315
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,320
No. I wasn't.

316
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,908
I don't know what you heard
or who said what,

317
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,119
<i>but just remember this.</i>

318
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,873
Whatever people are saying,
none of it is true.

319
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,541
You know that, right?

320
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,193
Hong Hye-joo!

321
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,104
I couldn't reach you at all,
I got worried…

322
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,576
What's wrong? Did something happen?

323
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,829
No.

324
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,664
I just…

325
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,958
missed you so much.

326
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,878
And then you showed up.

327
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,464
That's all.

328
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,174
What's wrong?

329
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,095
You said you'd call me back,
but then you wouldn't answer.

330
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,722
You were on the phone the whole time.

331
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,519
Come in.
There's something I want to show you.

332
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,363
So you're saying Woo-seong's phone

333
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,741
might have been automatically synced
with this cloud storage?

334
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,287
Woo-seong used to record everything.

335
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,249
And the more I thought about it,
if someone took his phone,

336
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,293
maybe there was something on it.

337
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,881
So I've been trying to get into this. But…

338
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:55,799
WRONG PASSWORD

339
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,676
I can't crack his password.

340
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,889
I thought I knew him better than anyone,

341
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,809
so I tried everything I could think of.

342
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,186
But nothing works.

343
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,690
I told you to answer clearly!

344
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,404
Where exactly were you on the night
Choi Jae-hee had the accident?

345
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,072
I already told you.

346
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,492
I attended a company event
and went straight home.

347
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,954
You can check the CCTV.

348
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,249
Oh, right.

349
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,543
Did you fail to secure that?

350
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,464
We secured something better than CCTV.

351
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,551
Choi Jae-hee's statement.

352
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,888
He woke up.

353
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,765
Yesterday.

354
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,686
Did he?

355
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,274
That's good to hear.

356
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,777
According to him,

357
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,071
he met you that night,

358
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,323
right before the crash.

359
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,658
And…

360
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:05,869
these.

361
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:11,791
A figure passing near the scene
whose build matches yours.

362
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,960
A piercing found at the site

363
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,630
that belongs to you.

364
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,093
All of this is pointing straight at you.

365
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,680
How do you explain that?

366
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,479
Are you shaken by that kind of evidence?

367
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,690
- What?
- Jae-hee named me

368
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,152
because he knows I gave a statement
that wasn't in his favor.

369
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,030
And that piercing?

370
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,867
I gave it to La-ik myself that night.

371
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,912
We argued, and I was furious.

372
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,416
Prosecutor…

373
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,297
I didn't do it.

374
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,342
And honestly…

375
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,803
you're better off if I'm not the culprit.

376
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,473
Wouldn't you agree?

377
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,733
Wow, she's no ordinary one.

378
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,444
If we could get a confession,
we might get something.

379
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,374
What do you think you're doing?

380
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,836
Release Hye-joo. Right now.

381
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,170
I can't do that.

382
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,216
She's a prime suspect.
And we have evidence.

383
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,969
It's not decisive evidence!

384
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,474
I told you.

385
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,687
Cases aren't won with evidence.
They're won by pushing through with power.

386
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,983
Release her immediately--

387
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:00,900
Father.

388
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,445
Is this how you've lived your entire life?

389
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,075
Suppressing the truth with force?

390
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,536
Then teach me.

391
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,622
Teach me how to pretend
I don't see the truth.

392
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,583
How to look the truth in the eye

393
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,835
and still act like I know nothing.

394
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,380
Please teach me.

395
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,976
She will be released soon.

396
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,354
There weren't even enough grounds
for an emergency arrest.

397
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,067
What you're doing isn't an investigation,
it's a tantrum.

398
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,862
And no matter what it takes,

399
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:50,199
I will stop
this stupid mistake you're making.

400
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,662
So you're saying you'd block your own son

401
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,582
if it meant protecting your success.

402
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,544
I see. Thank you.

403
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,756
That last little bit of doubt I had,

404
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,507
you just erased it completely.

405
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,595
What?

406
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,680
You walk your path, Father.

407
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,183
And from here on, I'm going to walk mine.

408
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,811
And I'll fight you.

409
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,230
For the first time in my life.

410
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,378
KANG WOO-SEONG

411
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,468
<i>The secret in Woo-seong's song.</i>

412
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:58,768
<i>Do you know where that post about</i>
<i>Woo-seong's hidden secret is?</i>

413
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,896
LIKE

414
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,777
<i>Like, can I ask you one thing?</i>

415
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,209
<i>Hey! Why'd you disappear?</i>
<i>You even deleted your account!</i>

416
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,919
<i>What's going on?</i>

417
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,004
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

418
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,756
<i>Sorry to bother you out of nowhere,</i>

419
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,718
<i>but about that hidden message you said</i>
<i>was in Woo-seong's song,</i>

420
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,512
<i>can you tell me more about it?</i>

421
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,974
<i>Oh, that?</i>

422
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,060
<i>It's only in the album.</i>

423
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,311
<i>The album?</i>

424
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,856
<i>Yeah, it's only on the CD.</i>

425
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,620
Yes, La-ik, can you come over
for a moment?

426
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,123
I think I might've found something.

427
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,003
Yes.

428
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,634
My friend said

429
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,762
Woo-seong hid a secret message

430
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,723
in one of the songs he composed.

431
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,558
- A message?
- Yes.

432
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,854
It's not in the streaming version.
You can find it if you listen to the CD.

433
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,022
If you pay attention,

434
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,567
there are tracks where a high-frequency
tone repeats at the end.

435
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,372
<i>And when you run that tone</i>
<i>through a decoding app…</i>

436
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,457
PLAY

437
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,294
<i>…a hidden message appears.</i>

438
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,135
SECOND FULL ALBUM

439
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,348
These are the messages I've found so far.

440
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,146
But these are way too long
to be passwords.

441
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:08,940
Right?

442
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,360
Still, I'll check every track,
just in case.

443
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:35,508
It feels kind of weird,
listening to our song like this together.

444
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,178
Why? It's my favorite song.

445
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,855
I had no idea
Woo-seong hid anything in his music.

446
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,818
And the fact that fans figured it out,
that's insane.

447
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:00,199
Fans want to know everything.
Even the tiniest little things.

448
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,369
Every shade of meaning in a lyric,

449
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,164
every tremble in a voice,

450
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,749
every look onstage.

451
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,668
Because all of it is him.

452
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,596
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

453
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,481
PLAY

454
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,620
Aren't these album titles?

455
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,460
Look! The first letters.

456
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,638
- It's the name of the first full album!
- Right.

457
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,765
And here.

458
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,229
That's the second album, <i>Forward.</i>

459
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,356
And this one.

460
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,071
It's the third album, <i>Lonely.</i>

461
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,662
No, not that kind of thing.

462
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,665
Our next full album
is our 10th anniversary one.

463
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,917
We should do something really fresh.

464
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,962
I heard that cyberpunk is the trend.

465
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,382
Not that, since it's our 10th anniversary,

466
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,176
I want something with a message.

467
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,303
A message?

468
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,180
Like what?

469
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,120
It worked!

470
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,309
These are the files uploaded
on the day of the incident.

471
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,310
VOICE RECORDING

472
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,813
I think the time is almost the same
as the estimated time of the event.

473
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,908
VOICE RECORDING

474
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,747
<i>Since things have turned out this way,</i>

475
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,876
<i>I'll take responsibility</i>
<i>for what I've done.</i>

476
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,546
And no matter what it takes,
I'm going to break free from you.

477
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,676
Only then can we live the way we want.

478
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,094
- Kang Woo-seong?
- Why are you here?

479
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,476
What are you doing?! Why are you…

480
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,312
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to see La-ik.
La-ik!

481
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,564
He's really drunk. He's asleep right now.

482
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,651
La-ik.

483
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,611
Why are you acting like this?

484
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,738
Move.

485
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,326
You haven't changed at all.

486
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,413
Look who's talking.

487
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,835
Drinking with him, pretending to listen,
pretending to care.

488
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,546
You're still leeching off him, huh?

489
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,588
What?

490
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,882
La-ik!

491
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,509
I said stop it!

492
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,511
Why? Who do you think you are?

493
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,265
I want to see him,
who do you think you are, stopping me?

494
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,818
This is why I said stop, because of you!

495
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,200
Do you know how much he has suffered
because of you?

496
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,953
How much pain you put him through?

497
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:03,169
Hye-joo, you push people until they break.

498
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,882
No matter how much love he gives you,
you want more and more.

499
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,843
Because you never got any love growing up.

500
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,772
It's over.

501
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,150
And like I told you before,

502
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,320
he has moved on.

503
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,199
He doesn't love you anymore.

504
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,143
Hye-joo, you need to…

505
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,896
You…

506
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,565
What are you doing?

507
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,069
You said it's over.

508
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,197
Without him,

509
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,284
maybe it's better
if everything ends here too.

510
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,662
Hey!

511
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,541
Drop the knife! Drop it!

512
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,585
Woo-seong.

513
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,600
Woo-seong.

514
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,893
Woo-seong!

515
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,021
Woo-seong!

516
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,651
Woo-seong!

517
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,030
Woo-seong!

518
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,338
<i>Woo-seong.</i>

519
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,090
<i>No, Woo-seong!</i>

520
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,598
Maybe we should stop here?

521
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,678
Woo-seong!

522
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,687
Woo-seong!

523
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,913
Woo-seong!

524
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,675
Woo-seong!

525
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,347
CHOI JAE-HEE

526
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:09,988
La-ik.

527
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,415
I kind of…

528
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,709
expected it.

529
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,171
I hoped I was wrong.

530
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,855
If this recording is released,

531
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:48,151
the truth about you and Hye-joo
will become public too.

532
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,697
Are you okay with that?

533
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,703
No.

534
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,334
But I'll face it.

535
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,799
I'm done running.

536
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,302
No matter how painful the truth is,

537
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,013
we agreed to bring it to light.

538
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,892
Because that's the only thing I can do

539
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,438
for the people who loved me,

540
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,191
and for the people who loved Woo-seong.

541
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,623
<i>This morning, prosecutors sought</i>

542
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,626
<i>life imprisonment</i>
<i>for the defendant, Ms. Hong,</i>

543
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,546
<i>who has been indicted for murder</i>
<i>and attempted murder.</i>

544
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,797
<i>It has been confirmed</i>

545
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,259
<i>that she is the illegitimate daughter</i>
<i>of Chairman Hong of the Imhwa Group.</i>

546
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:11,067
Hong Hye-joo keeps insisting
it wasn't premeditated.

547
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:15,822
But when it comes to Choi Jae-hee,
it's pretty clear.

548
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,450
<i>She'd been getting sedatives</i>
<i>from her hospital,</i>

549
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,953
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>she slipped them to Jae-hee.</i>

550
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,082
She probably wanted
to frame him as the culprit.

551
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,966
Thank you.

552
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,303
I know you were under a lot of pressure

553
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,597
pushing this case forward
and getting her into court.

554
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,642
And when I asked you for help,

555
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:47,395
you made the call before it was too late,
so we could catch the real culprit.

556
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,442
So, really. Thank you.

557
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,653
I should be the one thanking you.

558
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:57,948
Honestly,

559
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,284
this case tormented me the whole time.

560
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,996
I couldn't admit I might be wrong,

561
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,167
but if an innocent person
could end up paying for my mistake,

562
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,920
I didn't know how I'd ever live with that.

563
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,047
It scared me.

564
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,387
But thanks to you, we caught the real one.
And I'm on the news too.

565
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,724
I'm a hotshot prosecutor, thanks to you.

566
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,108
I'm sorry.

567
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,070
Your father's case,

568
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,406
I really hope the truth comes out soon.

569
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,118
Really.

570
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,125
Anyway, I've said what I needed to say.

571
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,795
I'm leaving. Take care.

572
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,602
KANG WOO-SEONG
YOUR TIME LIVES ON IN YOUR SONG

573
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,010
Why are you here?

574
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,847
Did you come to watch me fall apart?

575
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,058
No.

576
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,726
I came to ask you why.

577
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,314
Why did you do that?

578
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,607
I wanted to hear it from you.

579
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,276
And you think I owe you an answer?

580
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,948
Fine. I'll answer it.

581
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,245
You want to know why?

582
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,794
Because of you.

583
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,131
All of this…

584
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,258
is because of you.

585
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,722
I didn't go abroad after we broke up.

586
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,726
I was in a hospital.

587
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,562
<i>A psych ward.</i>

588
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,276
<i>I tried to take my life more than once</i>
<i>after we broke up.</i>

589
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,999
<i>But…</i>

590
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,629
<i>you were smiling.</i>

591
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,342
<i>So brightly.</i>

592
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,972
I just…

593
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,518
wanted you back.

594
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:20,233
If you hadn't pushed me away so coldly,
I never would've gone to that house.

595
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,985
And if Kang Woo-seong…

596
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,281
hadn't made such a big deal out of it,
none of this would've happened.

597
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,951
This is all because of you.

598
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,831
I hope you never forget me.

599
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,544
I hope you dream of me every night

600
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,380
and can't sleep.

601
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,092
I want you to hate me

602
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,636
and yourself…

603
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,805
forever.

604
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,976
No.

605
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,105
I won't waste my time hating you.

606
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,986
There's one thing
I could never wrap my head around.

607
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,699
Why did you take that knife?

608
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,995
If you'd just left it there,

609
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,122
I would've taken the fall.

610
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,500
It would have ended clean and easy.

611
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,294
So why didn't you?

612
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,049
If you want to say you did it
because you loved me,

613
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,637
I want to tell you you're wrong.

614
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,140
That's why I came here.

615
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,559
That wasn't love.

616
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,439
<i>Real love is</i>

617
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:46,402
<i>cheering someone on</i>
<i>no matter where they are</i>

618
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,697
<i>or who they become. Believing in them.</i>

619
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,408
<i>Wishing them well with your whole heart.</i>

620
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,370
<i>Wanting their happiness.</i>

621
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,121
ONE YEAR LATER

622
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,133
No, no.

623
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:56,598
<i>To meet the Gold Boys,</i>
<i>who are too busy with their world tour,</i>

624
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,933
<i>I've flown all the way to New York.</i>

625
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,019
<i>Gold Boys, it's great to see you!</i>

626
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,439
<i>- Two, three.</i>
<i>- Hello, we're Gold Boys.</i>

627
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,067
First of all, congratulations.

628
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,447
I heard every show on your world tour
has completely sold out,

629
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,240
and thanks to the overwhelming response,

630
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,368
the tour has even been extended.

631
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,039
Before we dive in, could you say
a few words to your Korean fans, Goldy,

632
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,458
<i>who've been eagerly waiting for Gold Boys?</i>

633
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,418
<i>Everyone.</i>

634
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,128
<i>I hope you're all doing well.</i>

635
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,007
<i>Even when we're not there, I believe</i>
<i>you'll take good care of yourselves.</i>

636
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,221
<i>We're working hard so we can come back</i>
<i>to you as soon as possible.</i>

637
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,681
So until then, make sure you eat well,

638
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,767
don't get sick,

639
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:45,188
<i>and stay healthy.</i>

640
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,575
<i>I'm sorry I can't be there with you.</i>

641
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,159
I miss you.

642
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,037
<i>I like La-ik on stage too.</i>

643
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,333
<i>I thought I had no choice</i>
<i>but to not back down then.</i>

644
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,045
That's why we won,
because we caught the real culprit.

645
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,048
<i>Lies can't beat the truth.</i>

646
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:58,428
As the bereaved family of Maeng Ji-yong,
I earnestly request

647
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,805
<i>that you order a retrial.</i>

648
