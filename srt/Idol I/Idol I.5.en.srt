1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
Are you out of your mind?

2
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,706
Me? With that bastard?

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,503
He's just an unlucky classmate
I got stuck with.

4
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,130
I'd scrub him out if I could!

5
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,759
For a classmate,
you sound extremely hostile.

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,802
Whenever I think about that jerk,

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,805
I jolt awake
in the middle of the night, fuming.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,727
Okay, I get it, so just drive carefully!

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,103
You're a lawyer and yet…

10
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,023
No, it's not me.

11
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,568
-The car isn't listening to me.
-What?

12
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,198
Se-na!

13
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,868
Se-na!

14
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,578
-Se-na!
-No, La-ik!

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,390
Where's my Se-na?

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
Where could my little girl be?

17
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,440
There you are.

18
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,655
Why is my Se-na so upset today?

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,741
Se-na,

20
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,701
your mom didn't scold you

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,246
because you broke the pot.

22
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,374
She scolded you
because you kept saying you didn't do it.

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,084
I didn't do it.

24
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,627
Really?

25
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,754
So you didn't break it?

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,548
Yeah! I didn't!

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,008
I see.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,637
But that's strange.

29
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,306
Why is this tree getting all ticklish?

30
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,893
The tree?

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,189
Se-na, this is a tickle tree.

32
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,733
When someone tells a lie underneath it,

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,360
its leaves start fluttering

34
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,572
like it's getting tickled…

35
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,532
-There!
-You're lying.

36
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,658
It's true.

37
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,078
This tree has very thin bark,

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,497
so what's outside and inside are the same.

39
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,294
It always shows itself honestly.

40
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,920
Just like you, Se-na.

41
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,677
No, I…

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,181
I…

43
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,447
Dad?

44
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,034
Dad.

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,207
Dad?

46
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,470
Dad.

47
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,690
Dad!

48
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,194
Dad!

49
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,572
Dad!

50
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,372
Dad.

51
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,347
Attorney Maeng! Attorney Maeng?

52
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,903
-Are you okay?
-Attorney Maeng?

53
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,201
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

54
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,872
The doctor said it's just an arm fracture.
No other injuries, thankfully.

55
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,415
What exactly happened?

56
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,294
Well, the car suddenly started acting up.

57
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,004
-The car?
-Yes.

58
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,883
Do La-ik, your head…

59
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,843
Why? Does it hurt?

60
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,803
I'll go get the doctor.

61
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,806
My arm…

62
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,769
Ten years without an accident
and suddenly this?

63
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,229
I don't know.
The steering just stopped responding.

64
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,149
What about when you started the car?
Did the RPM spike out?

65
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,901
I don't remember clearly.

66
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,406
La-ik got out first,
and I stayed to talk to the prosecutor.

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,908
I came down in a rush.

68
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,039
For now, find out which shop
is handling my car

69
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,750
and figure out
what exactly caused the accident.

70
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,586
Something

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,379
doesn't feel right.

72
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,757
Are you saying someone did it on purpose?

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,387
Excuse me, our Attorney Maeng…
I mean, the patient just woke up.

74
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,598
-Could you come quickly?
-What's the patient's name?

75
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,683
It's Maeng Se-na.

76
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,813
You have a car accident patient, right?

77
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,564
He's a well-known figure…

78
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,899
Is Mr. Do La-ik here?

79
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,484
Could you please check it?

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,611
-Excuse me.
-Did you see him?

81
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,117
Se-na, we've got a problem.
Reporters are everywhere.

82
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,161
Excuse me.

83
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,747
I think I'm okay now. Can I be discharged?

84
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,832
Yes.

85
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,251
You're all done.
Just settle the bill and you can go.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
You're leaving?
You should rest a bit more.

87
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,630
You're okay, right?

88
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,965
Yes, I'm okay.

89
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,466
-But--
-I'm fine too.

90
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,468
It won't help if reporters see me now.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,763
Chung-jae, please take care of the rest.
Let's go.

92
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,363
Taxi!

93
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,200
La-ik, hurry up.

94
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,375
There they are.

95
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,002
-Isn't that him?
-The cab over there?

96
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,048
Damn it.

97
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,884
You still can't get that one done?

98
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,262
How do you fail to lock up someone
who was caught at the scene?

99
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,472
You said he was the one.

100
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,476
The circumstantial evidence is solid.
We'll have the physical evidence soon.

101
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,229
Imhwa Group is in an uproar.

102
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,149
You tagged an innocent person
as an accomplice, not even a witness.

103
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,235
Why drag their daughter?

104
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,362
Can't you ever handle things quietly?

105
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,866
-I apologize.
-Forget it.

106
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,993
To take a case everyone wanted,

107
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,579
you pulled strings,
got your father involved.

108
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,915
So you'd better deliver.

109
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,417
If you push on gut feeling
without evidence and it blows up,

110
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,169
how are you going to handle the fallout?

111
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,881
Bring me solid proof,
or admit your mistake

112
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,883
and change course now.

113
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,237
You said you wanted
to be a prosecutor, right?

114
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,781
I hope that dream comes true,

115
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,366
so you can watch me

116
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,202
set everything straight
right in front of you.

117
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,545
Man, look at that face.

118
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,965
I heard the chief chewed you out.

119
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,676
I guess you took a real beating.

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,929
What is it? You have something?

121
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,055
I do.

122
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,225
I have fresh information.

123
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,854
I checked Choi Jae-hee's alibi,
and the hospital confirmed

124
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,107
Hong Hye-joo was right.

125
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,193
So it's true Jae-hee
wasn't at the hospital?

126
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,362
Yes.

127
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,366
Something felt off,

128
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,912
so I pulled all the CCTV around the lodge.

129
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,247
And guess what,

130
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,624
he shows up on it.

131
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,879
I saw on the news that his group members
were at the hospital that night.

132
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,382
That's not true.

133
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,466
What?

134
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,885
That night I saw him

135
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,222
near La-ik's house.

136
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,474
I saw Choi Jae-hee.

137
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,148
Extend the scope.
Start an investigation on Choi Jae-hee.

138
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,901
But if we shift to Jae-hee now,

139
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,863
it'll clash with the Do La-ik case…

140
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,574
We're not switching suspects.

141
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,369
Choi Jae-hee or Do La-ik,
we tear them both apart the same way.

142
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,875
Keep going until one of them confesses.

143
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,663
Sir, could you please
drive a little slower?

144
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,165
I am sorry.

145
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,654
Thank you.

146
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,750
Wait, did you hurt your foot? Let me see.

147
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,211
No, it's just a cramp.

148
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,310
What are you doing?

149
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,021
Hold still.
You're making it heavier by squirming.

150
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,732
You're gonna hurt your back!
You already have a herniated disc!

151
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,443
How do you know I have a disc problem?

152
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,780
A herniated disc
is a modern-day disease!

153
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,949
Any adult can have it. I have it too!

154
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,871
Seriously, couldn't you live
somewhere normal with an elevator?

155
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,206
Put me down! Now!

156
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,459
-Hold still.
-Seriously!

157
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,793
Why…

158
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,378
My God.

159
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,631
-I'm dying.
-What's wrong with you?

160
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
I told you to just put me down!

161
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,303
You're hurt!

162
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,097
I don't ignore someone who's hurt.

163
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,434
Until you're healed,
I'll handle everything.

164
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,227
So don't do anything, okay?

165
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,795
I sincerely apologize.

166
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,925
My son tends to charge ahead
recklessly during investigations.

167
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,345
So I have to learn from a reporter

168
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,431
that my daughter sat
in a prosecutor's office for six hours

169
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,724
being questioned?

170
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,811
Do you know how hard
I had to work to kill that story?

171
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,063
My apologies.

172
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,774
If I had known she was your daughter,

173
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,527
I would never have allowed
such disrespect.

174
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,820
There's a difference
between being relentless

175
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,531
and going against the flow.

176
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:47,243
You said the culprit
is practically caught already.

177
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,744
Yet why are you stumbling like this?

178
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,120
Investigations

179
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,083
must be led by evidence.

180
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,418
We're still missing the decisive proof.

181
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,047
Back in your day, you weren't like this.

182
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,300
You handled things cleanly
without unnecessary noise.

183
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,179
It seems your son falls

184
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,182
far short of that decisiveness
and precision.

185
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,561
He's still young and inexperienced.

186
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,314
Please grant him
just a little more patience.

187
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,610
Cases like this only get worse

188
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,196
the longer they drag on.

189
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,073
If needed,

190
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,076
you should consider
shaping the flow yourself,

191
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,496
just as you once did.

192
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,968
He's already been discharged
from the hospital.

193
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,428
Thankfully, it wasn't serious.

194
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,681
And his whereabouts are still unknown?

195
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,349
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,353
Are you hiding something?

197
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,855
No, ma'am.

198
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,900
But if the Chairman finds out,
he'll be furious--

199
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,402
I'll handle it myself, so please…

200
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
find him as soon as you can.

201
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,161
I need to know where he is.

202
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,334
PEANUT BUTTER

203
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,254
There's nothing to cook with.

204
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,566
FRESH MILK

205
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,037
Se-na, are you okay?

206
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,500
Se-na?

207
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,632
Why? What is it?

208
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,218
I'm fine. Why?

209
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,388
I heard something breaking in there.

210
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,236
-Come here.
-Why?

211
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,363
Why?

212
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,906
I said I'm fine, why?

213
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,658
Sit down. Just for a second.

214
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,659
-I'm fine.
-Sit here.

215
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,161
I can just dry it with a dryer.

216
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay?

217
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,624
Why are you doing this?

218
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,379
Use this and dry it.

219
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,395
You hurt your hand too.
Skipping a shower once won't kill you.

220
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,480
No way. I'll smell.

221
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,441
You washed your hair this morning.

222
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
That's enough, it won't smell.

223
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,361
Stinky Se-na.

224
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,874
-Stinky Se-na?
-What?

225
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,044
Is that your childhood nickname?

226
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,628
No, it's not.

227
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,173
Come on. I heard him call you that.

228
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,637
It was just because of my name.
It wasn't because I actually smell.

229
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,435
I know it's not true,

230
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,563
but when people keep calling me that,

231
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,023
I can't help thinking

232
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,275
maybe it is.

233
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,985
What do you mean by "maybe it is"?

234
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,571
He's ridiculous. His name means germ.

235
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,741
His name is Germ,
and he's teasing your name?

236
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,702
He's the weird one. Seriously.
Even his personality's weird.

237
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,549
I'm hungry.

238
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,509
Wait a minute.

239
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,635
Seriously, I'm not invisible.

240
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,473
Shouldn't you at least talk to the person
you're eating with?

241
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,355
Sorry, I had something urgent
to look over.

242
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,402
Anyway, you seem polite
and rude at the same time.

243
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,531
Says the man who spoke informally
to me the moment we met.

244
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,158
I don't talk like that to anyone.

245
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,912
It just feels natural with you.
So it slips out.

246
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
You could talk casually back.

247
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,002
No.

248
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,048
That'd make us seem way too close.

249
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,549
Really?

250
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,510
Most people like it
when I drop formalities.

251
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,012
Makes them feel closer to me.

252
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,055
That's…

253
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,184
what people who like you say.

254
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,270
For someone saying that,
you seem to like me a lot.

255
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,023
Did you know that?

256
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,192
All of this, I was the one
who advertised them.

257
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,278
Really?

258
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,322
Yeah, really. Look.

259
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,243
How did you manage to buy

260
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,620
only the products I endorsed?
Isn't that amazing?

261
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,623
Really? Let me see.

262
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,584
You're right.

263
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,212
This was you.

264
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,339
That's funny.

265
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,176
To me…

266
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,180
this can't be a coincidence.

267
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,895
You bought them
because they're the best-selling ones.

268
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,689
Right. Yeah.

269
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,068
They're the best ones. I like them.

270
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,154
Nope. They all taste the same.

271
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,535
What changes it is
whether my face is on it.

272
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,290
But the funny thing is,
I can't even drink milk.

273
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,457
I am lactose intolerant.

274
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,501
Really?

275
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,420
I had no idea.

276
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,589
Of course you didn't. I'm a product.

277
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,258
A product that must never be opened.

278
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,180
People twist off my lid…

279
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,727
lick a little…

280
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,818
and if they ever find out
how terrible it actually tastes, I'm done.

281
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,286
Why are you saying things like that?

282
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,955
What do you mean?

283
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,624
Why do you talk about yourself that way?

284
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,754
You were loved by so many people.

285
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,381
But you always acted

286
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:25,052
like you despise the people who love you.

287
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,845
That always felt strange to me.

288
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,724
And now I'm thinking…

289
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,771
maybe the one you really hate

290
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,732
is yourself.

291
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,818
Maybe that's why
you don't believe any of it,

292
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,696
because you think
you don't deserve to be loved.

293
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,242
Spoken like a lawyer.

294
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,370
You're smart, insightful,

295
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,290
but you got one thing wrong.

296
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,128
I've never been loved.

297
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,881
People love Do La-ik of Gold Boys.

298
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,509
Not me.

299
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,970
That Do La-ik, he deserves love.

300
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,807
But I'm not.

301
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,811
I don't know how to give it or receive it.

302
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,772
All I do is complain.

303
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,902
Only one person ever understood that…

304
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,739
and now even that person's gone.

305
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,162
Which is why I'm relieved.

306
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,207
You don't like me at all.

307
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,919
Since you don't,

308
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,630
you'll never be disappointed in me.

309
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,132
Right?

310
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,608
The tire blew out.

311
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,070
That's why the steering didn't work
and the brakes felt weak.

312
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,365
The pressure sensor
didn't go off either, right?

313
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,077
It burst because someone
tried to puncture it and didn't finish it.

314
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,039
You mean
someone did this on purpose?

315
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,251
See this hole?

316
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,670
Looks like someone jabbed it
with something sharp.

317
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,964
All of them need to be replaced.

318
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,342
Unbelievable.
Who would do something like this?

319
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,187
I knew something was off.

320
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,398
So did you report it to the police?

321
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,194
Yeah, but they're dragging their feet.
So I'm looking into it myself.

322
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,532
And your dashcam was off for days.

323
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,869
It's recording, right?

324
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,788
The dashcam, I wish you'd turned it off.

325
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,585
I turned it off for a bit.

326
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,630
I must've forgotten to turn it back on.

327
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,658
Why is he here again?

328
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,888
What are they talking about this early?

329
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,641
What are those two to each other?

330
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,812
Why do I care?

331
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,772
Whatever they are.

332
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,408
I checked the CCTV at the parking lot
near your place too.

333
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,826
Nothing suspicious.

334
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,704
I'll check the cameras
near your office later.

335
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,622
But…

336
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,917
-Don't you think it's too coincidental?
-What do you mean?

337
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,837
The accident happened that day…
Isn't that strange?

338
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,425
You said La-ik came down first
that day, right?

339
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,725
What if that moment was his chance?

340
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,408
A chance to prove he was innocent.

341
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,625
-And how would that prove anything?
-I'm just saying, look at the possibility.

342
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,044
Think about it.

343
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,797
Who would gain from something like that?
Only Do La-ik.

344
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,050
If he had a non-fatal accident,

345
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,635
he could claim
someone was trying to murder him,

346
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,597
that he's not the real culprit.

347
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,390
Then he walks away innocent.

348
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,062
Chung-jae, quit the mystery novels.

349
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,772
Quit the games.

350
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,900
Say something that makes sense.
Who risks their own life like that?

351
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,153
Someone who might rot in prison
for the rest of his life.

352
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,365
If he killed someone, what wouldn't he do?

353
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,283
Don't say that.

354
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,414
Yes, he's rude, self-centered,

355
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,917
and infuriating most of the time…

356
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,555
but he would never do something like that.

357
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,558
And how would you know?

358
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,353
Chung-jae,

359
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,189
don't you remember when we first met?

360
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,276
You were arrested for pickpocketing twice,
and I defended you.

361
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,445
I told you there wouldn't be
a third defense.

362
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,489
I don't remember.

363
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,157
Why are you bringing up old stuff?

364
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,243
When you called me the third time,

365
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,871
I really wasn't going to take your case.

366
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,791
But you said

367
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,043
you didn't do it.

368
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,295
You begged me to believe you, just once.

369
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,882
You know better than anyone

370
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,720
how powerful it is

371
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,597
when someone believes you.

372
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,646
So I'm going to believe my client
until the end…

373
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,066
at least for now.

374
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,577
I didn't do it!

375
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,829
How can you suspect me?

376
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,000
I was hospitalized that day!
Do La-ik beat me up!

377
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,717
Then what is this?

378
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,054
We already confirmed on CCTV

379
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,099
that you left the hospital
and went straight to the lodge.

380
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,311
Why did you lie?

381
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,104
I…

382
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,023
-It's…
-Mr. Choi.

383
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:42,071
Lying about your alibi
strongly suggests you're hiding something.

384
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,825
Depending on how this goes,
you may no longer

385
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,036
-be a witness, but a suspect.
-What?

386
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,747
Why are you pinning this on wrong person?

387
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,416
Mr. Choi, please, don't get agitated…

388
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,877
How am I supposed to stay calm?
He's accusing me now!

389
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,464
Why are you harassing an innocent person
when the real culprit is in front of you?

390
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,510
I told you before! Do La-ik is the killer!

391
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,762
There's no evidence that he's the culprit.

392
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,765
-You need something concrete--
-I do! I have proof.

393
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,728
Do La-ik had a reason
to kill Woo-seong.

394
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,486
How much does the prosecution know?

395
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,155
I'm not sure yet.

396
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,785
I told his lawyer to keep Jae-hee
from saying anything for now, but…

397
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,245
And how much does Jae-hee know?

398
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,207
I said, how much does he know?

399
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,335
I don't think he knows about Woo-seong.

400
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,428
If it hurts, tell me.

401
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,985
Okay.

402
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,153
Try moving it.

403
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,619
Are you okay?

404
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,163
It's fine. Doesn't hurt at all.

405
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,707
Good.

406
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,132
Well, great.
I don't have to babysit you anymore.

407
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,051
Good for me.

408
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,807
Attorney Maeng.

409
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,524
See? I told you it wasn't him.

410
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,276
You need to quit those detective novels.

411
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,486
I just said it might be possible!

412
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,323
Wait, Se-na.

413
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,909
I'm coming with you.

414
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,494
Just stay home.

415
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,830
-I'm going straight to the office anyway--
-Why?

416
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,751
He should hear it too.
He should know who caused this to happen.

417
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,176
Come on.

418
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,638
Don't try to deny it.

419
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,806
It's all on CCTV.

420
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,558
Look.

421
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,311
This is you two, right?

422
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,272
Are you going to keep denying it?

423
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,365
-These are the people?
-Yes.

424
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,368
Damn it.

425
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,039
Hey.

426
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,127
-We have met before, right?
-You know each other?

427
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,589
You can't abandon us!

428
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,676
Not until we end you!

429
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,469
You're not escaping!

430
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,514
-You two…
-You do know each other.

431
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,602
So that story about
just messing with some random car,

432
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,187
that was a lie, right?

433
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,271
We had a reason.

434
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,608
-What?
-We did it because we had a reason!

435
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,194
You're so brazen.

436
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,655
How can you stand there
acting all innocent

437
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,573
after killing our Woo-seong?

438
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,536
A murderer is walking around free

439
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,829
because of her!

440
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,415
That's not right, is it?

441
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,166
That's right.

442
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,963
A lawyer defending scum like him
and threatening us.

443
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,758
-She deserves whatever's coming.
-Hey!

444
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,721
Someone almost died because of you two.

445
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,515
Someone already died
because of him!

446
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,808
Okay, okay.

447
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,892
Everyone, calm down.

448
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,563
You realize you just admitted
to intentionally damaging my car, right?

449
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,734
Detective, this isn't just
property damage.

450
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,279
Because of them,
we ended up in the hospital.

451
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,740
This could be aggravated assault,
attempted murder…

452
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,575
Can't we just let them go?

453
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,829
Let them go? Are you kidding me?

454
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,123
We can file for non-prosecution.

455
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,460
Are you sure you want to?

456
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,297
Just promise me one thing.

457
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,633
You can do whatever you want to me…

458
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,557
but don't ever do this to someone else.

459
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,642
Got it?

460
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,946
Are you really okay
with letting them go like that?

461
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,784
Yes.

462
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,244
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,623
This always happens, doesn't it?

464
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,543
Even when they broke into your house,
you didn't report them.

465
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,879
So the police never even knew.

466
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,382
If you keep avoiding things like this…

467
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,926
And if I don't avoid it?

468
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,761
What should I do?

469
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,973
If I report them and let an investigation,

470
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,851
they'll do more crazy things.

471
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:08,439
They act out because they want attention,
and when they get it, they escalate.

472
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,694
They'll make up stories, dump them online,

473
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,822
and enjoy the mess they create.

474
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,992
Ruining people is nothing to them.

475
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,246
I just…

476
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,582
I don't want you going through that.

477
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,015
Yes, Ye-sol.

478
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,645
What?

479
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,190
Attorney Maeng.

480
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,903
Where is Attorney Hwang?

481
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,993
Stay here for a moment.

482
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,203
Ye-sol, could you show him
to my room, please?

483
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,204
Yes.

484
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,505
The prosecution requested
a face-to-face interrogation?

485
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,466
Sit down first.

486
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,302
Come on, sit. Let's talk.

487
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,600
You need to drop this case.

488
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm telling you this for your own good.

489
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,105
So what do you mean by that?

490
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,695
Because of something Choi Jae-hee
said during his witness interview,

491
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,323
the prosecution started moving.

492
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,367
I can't give you details,

493
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,037
but by now you should have an idea.

494
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:53,211
The ship you're on
is sinking, okay?

495
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:57,256
And you know this well, right?

496
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,509
In principle, our firm is legal counsel
for Goldie Entertainment.

497
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,513
One law firm can't assist
two hostile clients in the same matter.

498
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,016
That's a conflict of interest. Right?

499
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,059
But--

500
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,020
No need to argue.
The decision's already been made.

501
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,523
And looking at how things are going,

502
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,611
staying on this case will only hurt you.

503
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,280
Public opinion isn't good either.

504
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,617
So you're telling me

505
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,702
to drop my client?

506
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,083
Let's be honest, you're just trying
to get your name out there, right?

507
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,751
But this case?

508
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,294
Though it's a celebrity thing,

509
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,047
there's no real money in it, right?

510
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,007
Come on, Attorney Hwang.

511
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,306
Handling this won't benefit you at all.

512
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,308
We're saying this because we care.

513
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,522
Remember that CEO assault case
at CheongyI Group?

514
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,565
Looks like we might land it. Right?

515
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,025
-Right.
-Yes.

516
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,069
We'll give that one to you. How's that?

517
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,578
"Even if the whole world turns its back,

518
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,207
a lawyer must stand by their client.

519
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,043
That's what a lawyer is."

520
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,214
I became a lawyer
because of what you said.

521
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,429
Because I wanted to be the one person

522
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,016
who would hear out someone
no one else would believe.

523
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,774
I understand

524
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,694
what you are saying.

525
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,322
But…

526
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,743
I can't abandon this case.

527
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,996
Until it's resolved,

528
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,749
I'll stay away from everyone
at Cheon-un and stop coming in.

529
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,460
If even that places a burden on the firm,

530
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,213
I'll leave
the rest of the decision to you.

531
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,966
Wait, Attorney Maeng…

532
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,135
I'll be going now.

533
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,062
Look at her,
playing hero of justice again.

534
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,230
Don't you agree, sir?

535
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,535
Why is there so much of it?

536
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,290
Wait a second.

537
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,501
Are you done?

538
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,302
What is it? Did something happen?

539
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,805
Choi Jae-hee

540
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,058
had a witness interview
with the prosecution.

541
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,352
And two of you
will have a face-to-face interrogation.

542
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,897
What are you talking about?
A face-to-face?

543
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,441
If they're preparing one,

544
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,943
it likely means

545
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,904
he gave a statement
that's unfavorable to you.

546
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,365
The prosecution wants
to confirm it directly.

547
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,284
Why would Jae-hee do that?

548
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,329
Do you have any idea?

549
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,332
Why he'd do that
or what he might've told them?

550
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:29,093
We should prepare for every possibility,
and see if anyone around you

551
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,971
might back up his statement.

552
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,390
What if I meet Jae-hee myself?

553
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,684
It's not illegal,

554
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,602
but if we contact him
while the prosecution

555
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,521
is preparing a confrontation,

556
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,942
they could see it
as trying to influence his testimony.

557
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,571
We need to be careful right now.

558
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,031
But

559
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,202
you can meet the person
who knows him best.

560
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't really know.

561
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,837
When Jae-hee comes,
you can just ask him directly…

562
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,338
No.

563
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,633
We're here to talk to you, Young-bin.

564
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,637
Young-bin,

565
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,974
you know he was questioned
by the prosecution recently, right?

566
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,730
Did Jae-hee tell you anything
about the interview?

567
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,650
Or did anything seem off
before or after it?

568
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,068
No, nothing at all.

569
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,947
I really don't know anything.

570
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,741
No.

571
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,659
You do know.

572
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,497
That night,
Jae-hee wasn't at the hospital,

573
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,540
but you…

574
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,209
Jae-hee was at the Hospital.

575
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,838
You know that he was hospitalized with me.

576
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,715
You said he was at the hospital.

577
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,052
Why did you do that?

578
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,513
Young-bin,

579
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,933
you need to tell us the truth.

580
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,687
For Kang Woo-seong
and for Choi Jae-hee.

581
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:08,025
We can only get to the bottom of this
if you're honest.

582
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,951
I'm sorry.

583
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,663
He just told me to say that…

584
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,210
Then, what exactly happened that night?

585
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,215
That night…

586
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,892
These jerks…

587
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,811
NO ONE WOULD NOTICE IF JAE-HEE LEFT

588
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,062
Come on.

589
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,231
They're just talking. Don't mind it.

590
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,440
Just talking?

591
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,110
Does this look like just talking to you?

592
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,363
It's not the first time.
La-ik's fans are just intense.

593
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,740
He makes them like that.

594
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,327
He's controlling them to bash me.

595
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,372
Now what is this?

596
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,126
Gold Boys member Do La-ik
held his first solo concert.

597
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,296
The other members were supposed to guest,

598
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,798
but their stage was canceled last minute.

599
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:17,386
The label blamed sudden health issues,

600
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,723
but insiders say Member B confronted A

601
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,058
before the show and things escalated.

602
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,768
What's the truth?

603
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,314
Someone definitely leaked that.

604
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,777
YOU ARE THE MEMBER B, RIGHT?

605
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,908
This article's Member B,
that's you, right?

606
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,328
Leave the group.

607
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,247
Know your place.
You're nothing without La-ik.

608
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:55,257
He seemed a bit upset
because of the comments,

609
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,969
but it happens all the time,
so I didn't really think much of it.

610
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,929
But then…

611
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,282
I woke up for a moment,

612
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,952
and Jae-hee was gone.

613
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,830
He didn't answer his phone either.

614
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,626
The nation is reeling

615
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,003
after popular idol group member
Kang Woo-seong

616
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,713
was found dead.

617
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,676
What's most shocking is
that his body was discovered

618
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,514
at the Seoul Gangseong-gu residence
of fellow group member Do La-ik.

619
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,765
Police have confirmed

620
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,351
that the two were together
on the day of the incident,

621
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,769
and La-ik has been named the prime…

622
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:53,148
-And then, I saw the news…
-He was taken into emergency custody…

623
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,817
…that Woo-seong was gone.

624
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,366
Then, did you ask Jae-hee?

625
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,951
Where he actually went that day?

626
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,786
I did.

627
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:11,542
But he just told me to say we were
at the hospital together.

628
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,211
And since CEO Geum

629
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:18,424
already announced we were both there,
he said to stick to that story.

630
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,509
Why didn't you tell me?

631
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,596
You should have told me!

632
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,474
It's…

633
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,746
La-ik!

634
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,417
Let's stop here for now.

635
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,212
I'll contact you again later.

636
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,648
Are you okay?

637
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,859
What?

638
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,820
Even if it was for Choi Jae-hee,

639
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,489
a lie is still a lie.

640
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,408
And because of that lie,

641
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,369
you could be put in even more danger.

642
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,997
He knew that, and still said nothing.

643
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,125
I think I would've done the same.

644
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,633
Jae-hee and Young-bin
have been close since they were trainees.

645
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,594
Like brothers.

646
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,513
How could he tell the truth?

647
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,892
It would've felt like betraying Jae-hee.

648
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,521
Then what about you?

649
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,401
I heard you and Jae-hee didn't get along.

650
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,447
Can I ask why?

651
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,702
Because…

652
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,664
I hurt him.

653
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,166
A lot.

654
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,508
What are you doing?

655
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,470
What are you doing?

656
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,181
Wow.

657
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,771
So good.

658
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,691
Why didn't you order seasoned one?

659
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:44,403
We weren't like that from the beginning.

660
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,655
But like always,

661
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,366
trouble starts with something small.

662
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,461
GOLD BOYS ON MUSIC LIVE ON
PROFESSIONALISM SHINES DESPITE HICCUP

663
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,632
STILL LIVING OFF La-ik?
DRUMS FELL SHORT

664
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,301
And by the time I realized it,

665
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,261
it was already out of control.

666
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,692
Okay.

667
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,161
Jae-hee, if you're done resting,
let's run it once.

668
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,332
What's the point? On music shows,
I use a fake stick and hand-sync anyway.

669
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,083
Why bother rehearsing?

670
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,378
Come on.

671
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,047
Don't say that.

672
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,924
Let's try it just once.

673
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,177
Seriously, stop it!

674
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,099
Hey, Choi Jae-hee,
what's with you lately?

675
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,851
Skipping practice. Always on your phone.

676
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,479
-Something wrong?
-Plenty.

677
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,606
Because of you.

678
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,110
You cut out my entire drum part,
said it didn't fit the song.

679
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,821
Shouldn't you at least
feel bad about that?

680
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,325
Jae-hee, we all agreed on that.

681
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,536
The title track turned into a ballad.

682
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,538
Your drum part
naturally had to get smaller.

683
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,040
That's right.

684
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,792
I get even fewer parts than you.

685
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,629
Exactly! Why do we have to lose
all our parts and stand in the back?

686
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,381
Then maybe get better from the start.

687
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,011
I didn't take anything from you.
You lost it. Because you couldn't keep up.

688
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,599
-Are you done?
-No, there's more.

689
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,559
Everyone knows you go around

690
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,938
saying you want to quit this stuff,
you don't need this to make a living.

691
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,731
If that's how you think, then quit.

692
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,150
We won't lose anything without you.

693
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,319
And you know that.

694
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,154
You know exactly where you stand here.

695
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,088
You went too far.

696
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,551
You didn't need to say it like that.

697
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,597
Back then,

698
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,435
I was young and immature.

699
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:29,651
I treated people badly
and threw hurtful words around.

700
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,823
I thought that was
the only way to succeed.

701
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,328
I kept thinking…

702
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:46,376
if someone really held
a grudge against me,

703
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,420
who would it be?

704
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,345
Turns out the list is long.

705
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,398
So how can you believe someone like me?

706
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,361
Can you really trust me?

707
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,576
-What if I really did--
-I trust you.

708
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,206
I trust

709
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,167
myself who believes in you.

710
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,883
Wait here. I have something to show you.

711
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,646
Watch carefully.

712
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,026
I believe

713
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,487
in Do La-ik.

714
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,712
I do not believe in Do La-ik.

715
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,391
See that?

716
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,770
This is a tickle tree.

717
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,856
If someone lies,

718
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,607
the leaves shake like this.

719
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,735
Come on, that's impossible.

720
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,946
Possible or not, it doesn't matter.

721
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,031
I believe it.

722
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,620
When this tree grows,

723
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,164
it sheds its bark like this.

724
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,376
When I was little, it looked painful,

725
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,296
so I used to glue the bark back on,

726
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,882
wrap it with bandages.

727
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,093
But one day, my parents told me…

728
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,973
a tree needs to shed its bark to grow.

729
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,641
THE LATE MAENG JIYONG
THE LATE PARK SUHEE

730
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:19,988
It's just…

731
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,700
part of the process.

732
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,294
But one day,

733
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,547
after shedding all its bark,

734
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,508
the tree showed its pale inner layer,

735
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,428
and then…

736
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,307
it started to bloom.

737
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,649
But we're the opposite.

738
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,028
As we grow, we build thicker bark

739
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,697
and hide ourselves inside it.

740
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,244
So we won't get hurt.

741
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:12,999
So,

742
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:18,004
when I look at this tree,
standing here completely exposed,

743
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,508
I feel like

744
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,094
I can trust what it tells me.

745
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,472
I'm not brave enough yet

746
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,518
to peel off all my bark either.

747
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,273
Maybe that's why
I keep asking this tree…

748
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,236
what I really want,

749
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,781
whether I can trust myself,

750
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:50,620
whether I'll ever be able to bloom too.

751
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:02,757
When you don't know what to do,
I'll let you ask this tree too.

752
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:08,304
If you hide everything inside,
you won't even know what you really want.

753
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,610
I am

754
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,530
handsome.

755
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,329
I am a genius.

756
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,515
I didn't

757
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,226
harm…

758
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,022
Woo-seong.

759
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,900
Ms. Hong Hye-joo…

760
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,697
You…

761
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,808
It's…

762
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,269
How could you do this as a lawyer?

763
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,578
Let's go.

764
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,511
No.

765
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,764
You should leave.

766
00:57:58,766 --> 00:57:59,934
This is…

767
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,406
where I belong.

768
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,724
For La-ik, I've always been his only love.

769
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,892
And it is the same for me.

770
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,854
I don't know why,
but I fall apart around you.

771
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,815
Right now,

772
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,817
this is all I can give.

773
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,944
If La-ik is really not the culprit…

774
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,154
Now they suspect me.

775
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,033
What if you found out
that someone you really trusted

776
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,327
told you a huge lie?

777
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,912
Explain it.

778
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:49,502
