1
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,746
You really think you know everything

2
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,497
about Woo-seong, don't you?

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,958
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,252
I'm asking you

5
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,589
if you're ready to accept the truth,
whatever it is.

6
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,677
Some truths

7
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:57,515
come with pain the moment you learn them.

8
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,060
Pain…

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,147
that makes you wish you'd never found out.

10
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,903
So I'll ask one last time.

11
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,615
Can you really…

12
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,285
handle the truth?

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,792
Tell me.

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,420
Whatever it is you're hiding.

15
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,890
This isn't what you promised.

16
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,559
You said if I convince La-ik
to release his solo,

17
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,437
you'd give us a group album next.

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,690
So why is La-ik booked for another tour?

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,400
You know as well as I do

20
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,986
that La-ik's solo
isn't performing that well.

21
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,407
A tour is the only way to break-even.

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,826
Jae-hee and Young-bin,

23
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,328
they've been excited for a full album.

24
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,497
They practice every day, book rehearsals,

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,666
and that's the one thing
keeping them going.

26
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,876
What do you all
have to keep going for anyway?

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,714
The more La-ik earns,
the better it is for you.

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,927
You just split the money he brings in
and take it easy.

29
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,512
What exactly is the problem?

30
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,973
What did you just say?

31
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,601
Don't go to La-ik
and fill his head with nonsense.

32
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,604
His condition isn't good
these days as it is.

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,605
Don't make it worse.

34
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,100
Please stop contacting me like this.

35
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,145
- It makes me uncomfortable…
<i>- I heard</i>

36
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,480
<i>your full album got delayed again?</i>

37
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>I already told you,</i>

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,945
Goldie has zero intention
of growing your team.

39
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,197
Even if you renew the contract,

40
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,116
the other members will just get shelved

41
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,452
while La-ik gets pushed again.
It's obvious.

42
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>If you come to our company,</i>

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,667
we can help you make real music.

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,086
We can match whatever terms you ask for.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,839
This isn't something
I can decide on my own.

46
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
- I need to ask the members first…
- And what if…

47
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,512
CEO Geum finds out?

48
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,266
<i>Too many voices</i>
<i>will only derail everything.</i>

49
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,101
From what I've heard,

50
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,562
La-ik and the others all listen to you.

51
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,148
<i>So it's time to choose</i>

52
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,192
for the team's sake.

53
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,285
They dance pretty well.

54
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,331
Yeah, but I think we're still better.

55
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,583
Well, of course we are.

56
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,089
Woo-seong! You ditched rehearsal.
Where did you run off to?

57
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,258
I cleared my whole schedule for today.

58
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,802
What schedule?

59
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,930
- Want some ramyeon?
- I'm good.

60
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,098
I already ate.

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,604
Ugh, they suck.

62
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,690
Seriously. They call that music?

63
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,693
Maybe when we make our comeback,
I should crush them.

64
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,153
Oh, right! Woo-seong,
did you see the group chat?

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,864
I posted one of those trending challenges.

66
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,701
How about we try it?

67
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,703
I think the fans would love it.

68
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,664
- Wow! Looks good!
- Right?

69
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,375
Good? We have an image, okay?

70
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,835
Pick something else.

71
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,754
Then the three of us can do it.

72
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,340
What do you mean?
We're Gold Boys, pick something else!

73
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,885
- There's a good one down here. Looks fun.
- If you don't like it, just don't do it.

74
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,117
La-ik!

75
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,715
La-ik!

76
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,841
Are you okay?

77
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,676
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>La-ik's actually going to die.</i>

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,012
He does music shows every day,
then events,

79
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,181
and on his days off,
he's prepping for the concert.

80
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,892
We need to cut back his schedule.

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,143
Manager.

82
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,395
At this rate,
something really might happen to him.

83
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,147
Why are you suddenly saying this?

84
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,816
What? Did he tell you something?

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,861
- No, it's that he…
<i>- Keep this between us, okay?</i>

86
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,750
If the company finds out

87
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,711
I'm taking meds,
it will just turn into a hassle.

88
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,713
He…

89
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,049
looks really worn out.

90
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,843
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

91
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,930
Once this promo cycle ends,
he'll get a break.

92
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,015
- The CEO promised.
- A promise?

93
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,518
Hey, I've got a meeting.
Let's talk later, okay?

94
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,860
INCOMING CALL

95
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,223
This is the newly renovated space.

96
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,977
The mixing room
was designed by a German engineer,

97
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,146
and everything's tuned,

98
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,648
so you can hear
every instrument with perfect clarity.

99
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,401
You could say
it was made specifically for Gold Boys.

100
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
We're putting together

101
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,197
a full custom team just for Gold Boys.

102
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,366
Producers, engineers,
art directors, everything.

103
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,452
We'll set things up

104
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,746
exactly the way you've wanted to work.

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,709
All you need to do is say yes.

106
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
I'll do it.

107
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,341
I'll go ahead with the contract.

108
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,218
A very wise decision.

109
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,846
However,

110
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,558
we want Gold Boys as a full group.

111
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,727
Since Do La-ik is the main vocalist,

112
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,729
we'll need to bring him over as well…

113
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,731
You don't need to worry about that.

114
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,566
If I say it, he will do it.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,359
Same with the other members.

116
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,238
Okay.

117
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,163
<i>That bastard, Do La-ik.</i>

118
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,292
I heard he secretly signed
with another company to go solo.

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
Where did you hear that?

120
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,923
My friend works
at the company he's been talking to.

121
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,425
It's solid info.

122
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,552
He even got a huge advance already.

123
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,182
I'm gonna drop it to the press tomorrow.

124
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,642
It's straight-up tampering.

125
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,603
- Once this gets out, that bastard's done.
- No!

126
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,771
Huh?

127
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,942
We don't know anything for sure yet.

128
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,611
I'll meet La-ik tomorrow
and check it myself,

129
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,031
so don't tell anyone until then. Okay?

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,591
What did you do?

131
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,469
How did something we talked about
among ourselves get out?

132
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,388
And when did I ever sign anything?

133
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,681
I only said it!

134
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,433
You did say it.

135
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,560
You said you'd sign,

136
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,104
and the other members,
including La-ik, would sign too.

137
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,819
I recorded everything you said.

138
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,655
I didn't mean I'd do it right now,

139
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,283
- I just…
- Woo-seong.

140
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,660
A verbal agreement is still an agreement.

141
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,328
You gave me your word.

142
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,541
If you keep backing out like this,
I'll have no choice but to make it public.

143
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,669
Imagine what people will say
once this gets out.

144
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,629
About you, and about La-ik.

145
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,007
They'll say all of you betrayed the team.

146
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,427
We don't want that, do we?

147
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,155
CEO!

148
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,540
You're terrible with alcohol,

149
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,042
why did you chug it so fast?

150
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,797
I'm not bad with alcohol.

151
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,342
It's because of the meds.

152
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,510
Do you still take meds?

153
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,096
And you still downed drinks like that?

154
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,182
I'm not drunk.

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,561
You said you had something to tell me.

156
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,521
What is it?

157
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,858
It's nothing.

158
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,235
We'll talk tomorrow. Get some sleep.

159
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,080
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

160
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,874
What were you doing
with Achi Entertainment?

161
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,462
I didn't violate any contract.

162
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,714
There's not much time left before renewal,

163
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,300
- and talking to another company isn't…
- Sure.

164
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,010
Customarily, that's not a problem.

165
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,139
But the law is different.

166
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,182
You haven't given a clear answer

167
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,186
- about our renewal yet, so…
- So you dragged La-ik's mother into this

168
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,938
and tried to make a big score?

169
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,233
- Sorry?
- La-ik's mother signed a contract

170
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,985
with them under his name.

171
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,322
And thanks to your verbal agreement,

172
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,200
the situation has turned
legally disadvantageous for La-ik!

173
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,038
- I didn't mean it like that…
<i>- "Mean it"?</i>

174
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,375
Your intentions don't matter at all.
What matters is

175
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,793
that if anything blows up,

176
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,296
I'll be sending the penalty fee
to both of you.

177
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>And since La-ik's contract fee</i>
<i>is much bigger,</i>

178
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,802
<i>my payout will be bigger too.</i>

179
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,263
If he finds out about this,
what do you think will happen?

180
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,600
<i>If I were him,</i>

181
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,686
I'd want to kill you.

182
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,568
Woo-seong, you're heading
for real trouble.

183
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,487
You know that, right?

184
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,366
- I know.
- Knowing all that, you still did this?

185
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,660
You think La-ik's just gonna let it slide?

186
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,330
- La-ik is…
- He will believe me.

187
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,832
And he'll try to fix everything himself.

188
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,335
That's what I'm afraid of.

189
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,672
He's always sacrificed himself for me.
I'm afraid he'll do it again.

190
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,467
That's what scares me.

191
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,221
Why did you do this?

192
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,058
- If you'd told me earlier…
- I did tell you.

193
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,894
You just didn't listen.

194
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,480
<i>But now that it's happened,</i>

195
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,901
I'll take responsibility
for everything I caused.

196
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,737
And I'm getting out from under you,
no matter what it takes.

197
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>That's the only way</i>
<i>we can live the way we want.</i>

198
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,744
<i>Then go ahead and try.</i>

199
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,539
<i>It's going to be a big fight.</i>

200
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,625
<i>Be ready for it.</i>

201
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,796
I never actually…

202
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,384
intended to charge any penalty fees.

203
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,512
I just wanted to scare him enough

204
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,138
so he'd never do something like that.

205
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,851
I regret it even now.

206
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,938
If I had known

207
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,067
that call would be the last time
I'd hear Woo-seong's voice,

208
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,861
I would never say those things.

209
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,077
Now, do you understand?

210
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,290
Why I had no choice
but to keep all of this hidden?

211
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,751
I believed

212
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,921
making that call public,

213
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,841
revealing Woo-seong's tampering

214
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,303
would only hurt La-ik.

215
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,598
They might twist it
into a motive for the crime.

216
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,475
So…

217
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,273
I ordered Jae-hee
to keep everything strictly secret.

218
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,694
La-ik.

219
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,074
I've watched you since you were a kid.

220
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,078
I hid everything because I truly believed

221
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,247
that you couldn't have done that
to Woo-seong.

222
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,833
I wanted to protect you.

223
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,376
But…

224
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,088
belief isn't evidence.

225
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,719
All right. I've told you everything.

226
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,930
Now it's your turn.

227
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,643
Did you really

228
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:41,190
not know any of this?

229
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,486
Are you…

230
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,031
sure…

231
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,035
you didn't kill…

232
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,872
Woo-seong?

233
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,754
You say

234
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,384
you stayed quiet to protect me,

235
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,260
but no.

236
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,555
You were calculating.

237
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,100
You stayed silent

238
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,977
because once this came out,

239
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,939
you were afraid of being suspected.

240
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,818
Let me tell you

241
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,987
exactly what you want to know.

242
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,533
I…

243
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,496
didn't kill Woo-seong.

244
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,875
La-ik, are you okay?

245
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,755
I didn't know.

246
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,135
I didn't know anything.
I was such an idiot.

247
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,948
What do you mean?
We're Gold Boys, pick something else!

248
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,992
- That one looks fun.
- Just don't do it then.

249
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
<i>Why didn't I notice any of it?</i>

250
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>How long had he been struggling</i>

251
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,458
<i>all on his own.</i>

252
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,460
Oh, Woo-seong's here?

253
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,672
<i>What he must've been feeling</i>

254
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,634
<i>coming to find me that night.</i>

255
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,678
Hey, enough of the depressing stuff.
Let's drink.

256
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,182
<i>I had no idea.</i>

257
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,811
<i>He was always smiling.</i>

258
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,814
<i>- So I just assumed he was fine.</i>
- This tastes great.

259
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,567
<i>I always just thought about myself.</i>

260
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,944
Stop! I said stop!

261
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,530
- La-ik.
- Woo-seong, I…

262
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,075
<i>I only saw my hardship and my pain.</i>

263
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,869
Get inside. The concert's about to start.

264
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,204
No, but…

265
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,372
Take care of La-ik.

266
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,209
<i>Woo-seong always thought about me</i>
<i>before himself.</i>

267
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,586
<i>But I…</i>

268
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,923
<i>I never once tried</i>…

269
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,552
<i>to look past that smile.</i>

270
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,931
<i>I always wanted to hear it.</i>
<i>It's even prettier in person, your voice.</i>

271
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,484
Woo-seong was…

272
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,614
carrying everything by himself
without saying a word.

273
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,618
And I realized it way too late.

274
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,707
I feel so sorry for that.

275
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,800
Just because you're close to someone
doesn't mean you get to know everything.

276
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,137
For some people,

277
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,059
opening up is harder than staying silent.

278
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,399
Maybe he was one of those people.

279
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,030
Don't blame yourself too much.

280
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,824
Realizing it late

281
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,452
doesn't mean it was your fault.

282
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,708
Sometimes people's hearts are hard to see,
even when they're right beside you.

283
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,172
And maybe showing only a smile

284
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,050
was his way of being sincere with you.

285
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,267
Right now,

286
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,895
it's okay…

287
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,899
to be sad.

288
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,111
If you hold everything in,

289
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,864
it'll only hurt more later.

290
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,449
So…

291
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
don't force yourself to endure it.

292
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,204
Let it out little by little.

293
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,749
It's okay.

294
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,117
Reassignment? What do you mean?

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,119
This case is my case! Why all of a sudden?

296
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,288
Have you not seen what's happening?

297
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,039
The media, the public,

298
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,875
everyone's screaming
that we targeted the wrong suspect!

299
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,169
Even the Commissioner was briefed on this!

300
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,964
But I've handled this case from the start.

301
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,341
- I should be the one to finish…
- Hey!

302
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,177
If you cling to it now,

303
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,598
the entire prosecution service
gets branded incompetent.

304
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,809
If you really want to take responsibility,

305
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,520
hand it over to another prosecutor

306
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,522
and step back cleanly.

307
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,942
That's the best thing
you can do right now. Understand?

308
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,106
<i>If you don't want to throw in the towel,</i>

309
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,985
<i>then indict Do La-ik.</i>

310
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,111
Sorry?

311
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,906
But, Father…

312
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,159
public sentiment is already bad.

313
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,579
Indicting someone
when the evidence is this weak,

314
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,789
isn't that far too risky?

315
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,667
What if he's found not guilty?

316
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,045
That's for the court to decide.

317
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,838
We're prosecutors.

318
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:06,009
We don't deliver the answers,
we follow procedure.

319
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,595
If there's even a one-percent possibility,

320
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,847
you use it as grounds for indictment.

321
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,854
How's Jae-hee?

322
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,774
Same as always.

323
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,069
They're not allowing visits yet,

324
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,654
so I was just heading back.

325
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,074
<i>And did you hear?</i>

326
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,951
Your house and car,

327
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,912
- the creditors withdrew all the seizures.
- What?

328
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,289
It's becoming clearer

329
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,708
that it wasn't you who killed Woo-seong.

330
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>So I guess the creditors pulled out.</i>

331
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,924
<i>No one wants backlash</i>
<i>for going after the wrong person.</i>

332
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,011
And honestly, getting you back
to work quickly is better for them too.

333
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,557
<i>But, are you sure</i>

334
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,561
you're okay with going back
to that house again?

335
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,950
I have to go back.

336
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,662
I can't stay like this forever.

337
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,083
La-ik, I'm heading out.

338
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,182
All right.

339
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,726
If you hear anything about Jae-hee,
let me know.

340
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,397
Bye.

341
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,123
La-ik.

342
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,127
Are you heading to work?

343
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,547
- You're leaving a bit late today.
- Yes.

344
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,760
I've got things I need to take care of.

345
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,136
So I should get going now.

346
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,930
There's a sandwich in the fridge,

347
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,348
and if you want something else…

348
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,808
I'll take care of it. Go on.

349
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,485
If it gets too suffocating,
you can step outside for a bit.

350
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,487
No, I'll stay here.

351
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,573
Go on, you'll be late.

352
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,578
Go on.

353
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,885
I'll go now.

354
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,910
INCOMING CALL

00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
<i>This is the last time.</i>

357
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,719
<i>I want to see you one last time</i>

358
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,347
<i>and say goodbye.</i>

359
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,149
I heard about Jae-hee.

360
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:36,946
Are you okay?

361
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,909
I came because you said
you wanted to say goodbye one last time.

362
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,871
Are you going back to the States?

363
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,998
Yeah.

364
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,336
Most of my stuff is packed already,

365
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,924
but I'm yet to find a place for this one.

366
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,137
Seeing it brought back memories.

367
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,530
We were so happy then, weren't we?

368
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,700
Do you remember?

369
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,286
Back then, before you debuted,

370
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,540
no one recognized us, and we were free.

371
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,838
We can't go back in time, but…

372
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,971
we can start over from the beginning.

373
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,764
Like back then.

374
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,101
- Hye-joo…
- They're saying

375
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,854
the case will soon be closed
with Jae-hee as the lone culprit.

376
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,440
Whether it's true or not,

377
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,442
everything will wrap up soon.

378
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,362
But you know, right?

379
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,364
How people will look at you.

380
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,121
Can you really live with all that on you?

381
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,211
I'm not asking you to love me again.

382
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,215
I'm asking you to take your life back.

383
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,719
Somewhere completely new.

384
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,140
You're right.

385
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,602
Even when all this is over,

386
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,813
my life won't go back to how it was.

387
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,735
But running away isn't an option for me.

388
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,155
From here on,

389
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,991
I'm going to live as I am.

390
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,953
With the ones who believed in me,

391
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,747
stood by me

392
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,416
and told me I could.

393
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,338
My life is here…

394
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,008
in this moment, in this place.

395
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,057
I get it.

396
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
Thank you.

397
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,570
I think I can finally let go now.

398
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:26,950
Take care.

399
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,870
Be happy.

400
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,959
Yeah, you too.

401
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,293
GOSSIPFACTS

402
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,758
THE TRUTH WE CREATED

403
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,302
Assault…

404
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,138
ignores fans…

405
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,558
bad temper…

406
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,440
Isn't there anything spicier than this?

407
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,827
This one's the theft case for Ms. Jin,
this is the assault case for Mr. Park.

408
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,037
and Mr. Seong's defamation draft.

409
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:22,375
Check for any missing case numbers
or party info and send me the final file.

410
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,211
- Are you heading out already?
- Yes.

411
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,963
See you next week.

412
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,965
Yes, have a great weekend!

413
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,341
Clocking out?

414
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,254
<i>What's all this?</i>

415
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,467
Sweet and spicy, original,
<i>Kkanpunggi </i>flavor,

416
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,968
and even chicken <i>gangjeong.</i>

417
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,181
Did you raid a whole chicken farm?
Why did you buy so much?

418
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,933
You haven't been eating much lately.

419
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,727
And you eat chicken when you're down.

420
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,855
- You knew that?
- Of course.

421
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,815
I've been your fan for years…

422
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,945
I'll set things up.

423
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,906
Could you grab some plates?

424
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,032
Sure.

425
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,429
Se-na!

426
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,307
Chung-jae.

427
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,976
Smells like fried chicken…

428
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,270
Wow! Chicken!

429
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,775
<i>Kkanpunggi </i>flavor too?

430
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,113
Yeah, you like that one.

431
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,866
Why are you acting all weird?

432
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,831
If it's because of what I said last time,
don't be.

433
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,543
I mean, you can't ignore him.

434
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,963
I know you can't ignore
someone who's struggling.

435
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,842
And since when
have you ever listened to me?

436
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,928
Hey! Come on. It's gonna get cold!

437
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,688
It's been a while since I had chicken.

438
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,027
Something's wrong with the coke.

439
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,946
It's warm.

440
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,283
I forgot to put it in the fridge.

441
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,578
I kind of like warm coke.

442
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,506
It'll be warm in your stomach anyway.

443
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,176
- Seriously!
- Oh, my.

444
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,803
Seriously.

445
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,141
It's soaked.

446
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,061
I think I'm out of my mind.

447
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,692
Please understand,

448
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,819
she looks like
a perfectionist on the outside,

449
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,446
- but really…
- Hey!

450
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,658
It's too wet.

451
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,203
I'll go change.

452
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,552
Why didn't you finish
what you were saying?

453
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,222
Tell me. What kind of person is she?

454
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,974
What do you think she's like?

455
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,856
Well, hard to describe in one word?

456
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,235
Yeah, that's true.

457
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,238
- Always a bit clumsy.
- What?

458
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,949
Do you know how long
we've known each other?

459
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
- Since we were 12 years old.
- Twelve?

460
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,247
We're neighbors. Columbarium neighbors.

461
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,709
My mom and grandma
are right next to her parents.

462
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,127
That's where we first met.

463
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,507
I'm the same as you.

464
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,134
I was a troublemaker growing up.

465
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,637
Every time I got into something,
she defended me.

466
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,888
She helped me straighten out.

467
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:52,019
People think
she's cold and flawless on the outside,

468
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,189
but if you really know her, she's soft.

469
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,403
Too soft, so she let me stay here
when she didn't even know me well.

470
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,116
I know. I'm in a similar situation.

471
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,828
So you do know.
I thought maybe you didn't.

472
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,544
You know that she used to
kind of like you.

473
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,212
Just a tiny bit.

474
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
As a fan.

475
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,428
But that doesn't mean she likes you.

476
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,932
Who you are now and who she used to like
are totally different people.

477
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,562
So don't get the wrong idea.

478
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,358
Just be grateful. That's it.

479
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,860
I know.

480
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,571
I'm not stupid enough to misunderstand.

481
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,074
She's not helping me because she likes me.

482
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,495
It's because I'm in a bad spot
and she can't ignore someone like that.

483
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,164
I know that better than anyone.

484
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,999
But the problem is,

485
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:59,211
I'm not sure I can end it
with just being grateful.

486
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,047
Not like you.

487
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,596
Why aren't you two eating?

488
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,849
- Come on, eat up.
- Yes.

489
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,394
Where did all the drumsticks go?

490
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,314
How many did you eat?

491
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,358
- La-ik, how many did you have?
- Only two.

492
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,567
Here's another one.

493
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,485
Hey!

494
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,946
Why are you giving me
something you took a bite of?

495
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,157
You should've brought ice cups too!

496
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,035
There's no ice.
You go to the store and get some.

497
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,244
Come on.

498
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,914
I can do that.

499
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,376
It's fine. I got it. It's not much.

500
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,229
It was fun.

501
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,816
Eating together,

502
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,567
laughing, talking about nothing.

503
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,155
I guess I really missed that.

504
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,908
It felt good. It's been a while.

505
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,287
It's such an ordinary thing, though.

506
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,748
Yeah.

507
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,209
But ordinary moments…

508
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,128
are the hardest to have.

509
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,719
What if…

510
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,307
What if you weren't you?

511
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:40,104
If you were just some
random passerby or something,

512
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,983
- what would you want to do most?
- Something I'd want to do?

513
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,160
It's exactly the same.

514
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,455
You wanted to come here?

515
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:03,085
Yeah.
I mean, my childhood wasn't exactly happy.

516
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,421
But I always wanted to come back once.

517
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
Why?

518
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,469
I don't know.

519
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,097
I think it was
the most ordinary time of my life.

520
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,809
You told me to be a passerby today.

521
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,899
Maybe not out there, but here
I was just a regular student.

522
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,068
Shy, quiet.

523
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,116
Looking back, I think that was
when life felt the most peaceful.

524
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,540
Just a second.

525
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,215
Sir! Hello.

526
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,387
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

527
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,520
- It's been forever.
- Right.

528
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,564
I didn't think
we'd actually be allowed inside.

529
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,154
Wait, were the desks always this tiny?

530
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,074
I know, right?

531
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,911
Everything felt huge when we were kids.

532
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,913
The school, the classrooms, the desks.

533
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,504
Wow, I must've been tiny.

534
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,633
You look like a kid sitting there.

535
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,225
I used to sit like this, never studying,
just staring out the window,

536
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,602
thinking about everything.

537
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,733
<i>I kept thinking, "Tomorrow will be better.</i>

538
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:55,990
<i>"When I grow up, I'll be happy."</i>

539
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,667
Actually, there's another reason
I wanted to come here.

540
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,546
SOONDAE - GIMBAP - EGG

541
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,674
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Yeah.

542
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,397
I came just in case. I didn't think
this place would still be here.

543
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,774
You've been coming here
since you were a kid?

544
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,234
Yes.

545
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,906
The fishcake broth here
used to be amazing.

546
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,326
I was always hungry and broke.

547
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,369
I'd pay 500 won for a plate of <i>tteokbokki</i>

548
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,413
and drink bowls and bowls of broth.

549
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,540
It is good.

550
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:52,212
If I mashed the egg yolk into the dish,
he'd scold me for more dishes to wash.

551
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,175
I think he knew.

552
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,762
No one came to pick me up,

553
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,848
so I ate <i>tteokbokki </i>here alone every day.

554
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,645
He'd give me extra fishcake
and a bit of fried food secretly.

555
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,899
I always wanted to come back someday,

556
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,651
once I became a decent adult,

557
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,403
and thank him properly.

558
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,031
You are a decent adult.

559
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,748
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

560
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,511
- What?
- It's him.

561
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,056
Really?

562
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,183
He's still here.

563
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,397
Let's eat. It looks good.

564
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,442
- I'll eat the egg.
- Yes.

565
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,032
- So good.
- Tastes the same?

566
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,743
I can't believe how long it's been.

567
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,291
Chicken yesterday, <i>tteokbokki </i>today,

568
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,045
it feels good to eat properly again.

569
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,342
We didn't order this.

570
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,743
Thank you.

571
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,802
Prosecutor,
something just came in from the police.

572
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,388
It's the inspection report
for Choi Jae-hee's car,

573
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,807
but there's nothing special in it.

574
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,769
REPORT

575
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,230
The Deputy Chief

576
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:19,443
wants all related documents
passed on to Prosecutor Jang.

577
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,363
You can't keep resisting forever, sir.

578
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,781
What is this?

579
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,910
It's a scene photo.

580
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,579
They said the fall point looked odd,
so they took extra shots.

581
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,581
What exactly is odd?

582
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,083
The spot where he fell,

583
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,419
you can get there
with a sudden hard turn of the wheel.

584
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,505
But there were no skid marks at all.

585
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,466
So instead of speeding
and crashing forward,

586
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,928
they think the car rolled off slowly.

587
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,932
But the actual vehicle inspection

588
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,017
didn't show any signs of tampering.

589
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,771
The police questioned
Lee Young-bin as a witness, right?

590
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,897
Yes.

591
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:03,904
Here it is.

592
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,703
JAE-HEE WOULD NEVER KILL HIMSELF

593
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,831
Jae-hee would never kill himself.

594
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,375
Never.

595
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,713
<i>It's not a drug</i>
<i>that knocks someone out instantly.</i>

596
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:26,510
Consciousness drops gradually
over 20 to 30 minutes.

597
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,470
If he was driving,

598
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,598
he wouldn't have been able
to brake or avoid anything.

599
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,353
The same substance was found
on Do La-ik when he was arrested.

600
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:42,442
Tell the police to send
every supplemental field detail right now.

601
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:06,800
I don't think we should stay here.
If someone recognizes you…

602
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,177
It's fine, we can just run.

603
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,805
Let's go somewhere quieter.

604
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:17,185
Didn't you say I should be a passerby?
Just a normal guy?

605
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,522
Then why didn't you go
somewhere you want to go?

606
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,275
You said this was your favorite place
when you were a kid.

607
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,154
I got curious about
what little Se-na used to like.

608
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,489
Still…

609
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,660
And actually…

610
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,079
this is my first time at an aquarium.

611
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,338
- Seriously?
- Yes.

612
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,312
- What's that?
- A stingray!

613
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,232
- Wow, it's huge.
- Is that a shark?

614
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,942
I think so.

615
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,569
This is amazing.

616
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,663
- What?
- Nothing, you look cute.

617
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,004
Cute?

618
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,173
No, I mean…

619
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,095
The way everything amazes you like a kid.

620
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,892
So you're weak for cute things.

621
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:39,893
What?

622
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,145
Nothing.

623
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,069
Se-na, what is that?

624
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,529
Is that a fish too?

625
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:54,199
If you chop it up like this and eat it,
would it taste good?

626
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,538
Forget it.

627
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,290
It's embarrassing.

628
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,849
I used to come here a lot with my family.

629
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,936
Even when I was a kid,

630
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,147
they said if they sat me here,
I wouldn't cry.

631
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,648
I'd sit quietly for hours.

632
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,277
I guess you liked fish.

633
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,325
I don't think so.

634
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,539
Coming back today,

635
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,374
I remembered…

636
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,253
thinking those calm ripples

637
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,424
were beautiful.

638
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,476
So you liked dark, gloomy places
from a young age?

639
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,227
What?

640
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,188
I'm kidding.

641
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,828
It's La-ik!

642
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,249
- La-ik.
- Huh?

643
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,751
Let's go.

644
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,589
- It's him!
- Right!

645
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,466
- He's leaving.
- Let's follow him.

646
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,510
- Let's go.
- Let's move.

647
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,533
What?

648
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,867
He's not here.

649
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,369
- What?
- Where did he go?

650
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,286
Let's just go.

651
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,704
You must have been mistaken.

652
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,164
I'm sure he was here.

653
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,415
Let's just go.

654
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,000
Where did he go?

655
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,212
Let's go.

656
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,446
Actually, I first saw you here.

657
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,048
That's why I wanted to come with you.

658
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,844
This place means something to me.

659
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,702
Sitting here like this,

660
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,121
it makes everything feel unreal.

661
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,792
Woo-seong,

662
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,543
Jae-hee,

663
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,590
everything that's happened.

664
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,846
Sometimes I think about it.

665
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,519
If you hadn't been by my side
after everything happened,

666
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,272
what would've happened to me?

667
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:43,029
I used to avoid going out.

668
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,534
Partly because of the obsessive fans,

669
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,370
but honestly,
I intentionally avoided getting out.

670
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,456
I wanted to look perfect.

671
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,255
But today, I didn't think like that once.

672
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,385
Today, I wasn't Do La-ik of Gold Boys.

673
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,179
I was really just a passerby.

674
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,102
When I'm with you,
I keep ending up like that.

675
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,524
I just become me.

676
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,111
Like actually me.

677
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,297
It's really beautiful.

678
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,765
Yes it is.

679
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,683
Beautiful.

680
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,121
There's only ten minutes left.

681
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,045
When today ends,

682
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,090
I have to go back to being me again.

683
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,676
So are you sad?

684
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,722
No.

685
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,683
I just think you'll be sad.

686
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,562
This passerby was pretty good, right?

687
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,566
Cute, tough,

688
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,902
romantic.

689
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:51,157
I like cute, tough, romantic guys too,

690
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,785
but I like you just being you even more.

691
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,748
You said it yourself

692
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:03,002
that today,
you felt the most like yourself.

693
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,214
I think that's why I liked it so much.

694
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,136
Seeing you just be yourself.

695
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,932
So that means you…

696
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,772
You like me?

697
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,693
- What?
- You just said that.

698
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,902
You like me.

699
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,408
When did I say that?

700
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:38,204
You literally just said you like me.

701
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,792
So what? Should I not like you?

702
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,212
I meant as a person.

703
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,922
Seriously, you're so weird.

704
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,759
I like you.

705
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,601
Having these feelings right now,

706
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,562
I think I must be crazy.

707
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,940
But I can't hide it anymore.

708
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,820
My feelings just won't stop.

709
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,374
I like you.

710
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,045
I really…

711
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,590
like you, Se-na.

712
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:44,247
What this feeling I have for you is…

713
