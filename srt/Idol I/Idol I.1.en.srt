1
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,095
There are days like that.

2
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,141
Days when I dreamed about you,

3
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,143
and on those days,

4
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,439
I can't help falling
into foolish little fantasies.

5
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,154
Like accidentally sharing a table
with you at a random restaurant,

6
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,243
or bumping into you
alone in an empty, late-night theater.

7
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,331
Just imagining it makes me happy.

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,460
And I imagine,

9
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,548
just once, a miracle like that

10
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:16,094
could happen to me too.

11
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,806
-The rule of law in Korea is dead!
-Dead!

12
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,227
-Punish those responsible!
-Punish them!

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,270
MINISTRY OF JUSTICEㅇ

14
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,189
Re-arrest Lee Seong-ho immediately!

15
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,150
Arrest him!

16
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,070
-Investigate without a shred of doubt!
-Investigate!

17
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,447
Table tennis player Lee Seong-ho,

18
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,158
accused of blackmail and assault

19
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,327
against a junior teammate,
was acquitted today.

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,915
A petition urging a full retrial
has been posted.

21
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,002
With news of his hiring
a high-priced lawyer,

22
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,879
some legal experts say

23
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,840
with rising distrust,
that the court favors the privileged,

24
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,677
the outrage and criticism
are unlikely to subside anytime soon.

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,887
Attorney Maeng Se-na,

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,306
public backlash
against this ruling is fierce.

27
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,432
As defense attorney,

28
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,642
what's your view on the trial outcome?

29
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,979
COURT

30
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,775
The significance lies
in revealing the truth.

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,612
The prosecution's claim of special assault

32
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,614
was not upheld.

33
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,200
-Justice in Korea is dead!
-Dead!

34
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,121
Regardless of guilt or innocence,

35
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,373
the defendant deeply regrets

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,126
causing public concern.

37
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,505
Additionally, please be advised
that spreading false information

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,008
differing from reality
may result in legal action.

39
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,967
That is all.

40
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,264
PLAYER LEE SEONG-HO
ACQUITTED OF SPECIAL ASSAULT CHARGES

41
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,772
That's our Attorney Maeng!

42
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,524
Unstoppable and undefeated.

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,360
Truly amazing!

44
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,947
She looks so good on screen.

45
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,782
She's gorgeous!

46
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,660
Don't get too excited.

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,870
People outside are going wild,

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,705
saying the poor victim

49
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,374
should file an appeal.

50
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,626
This is bad.

51
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,212
Public opinion is emotion,
but the law is logic.

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,340
Isn't it so? We speak through results.

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,260
If it came out not guilty,
that's the correct answer.

54
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,888
-All right.
-I'm Prosecutor Kim Gi-wook…

55
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,641
The prosecutor looks miserable.

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,309
He's going to get chewed out.

57
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,727
PROSECUTION BRIEFING

58
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,437
Not the only one she crushed.

59
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,273
Why did this kind of article come out?

60
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,566
Are you even prosecutors?

61
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,320
They even held an emergency meeting
at the Seoul Central District Office.

62
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,698
By the way, how did she win that case?

63
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,659
There was CCTV footage
and witness testimony.

64
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,203
That's why she made partner at that age.

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,247
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING PARTNER

66
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,750
That's a talent too.
By taking the most brutal cases,

67
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,837
she raised her name and her value.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,422
I wonder how much she's made.

69
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,091
-I'm jealous.
-Feeling jealous?

70
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,719
She takes all the hate the world throws.

71
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,263
Sometimes she doesn't even seem human.

72
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,765
More like an AI, an android.

73
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,100
No emotions,

74
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,022
no dating, no family, no friends.
She just works all the time.

75
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,568
Unless she's a robot,
no human could live like that.

76
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,487
That's a very interesting theory.

77
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,201
Earlier today, the case prosecutor said…

78
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,579
Attorney Maeng!

79
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,164
When did you get here?

80
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,460
Twenty-nine minutes ago.

81
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,421
Check for missing copies, please.

82
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,215
Hey.

83
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,136
You should've said something
when you arrived.

84
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,597
Everyone's been waiting
to congratulate you.

85
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,809
Thank you,
but I am a bit busy today.

86
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,397
Please forward the brief
from the previous embezzlement case.

87
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,815
Wait, hold on.

88
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,487
The boss set this up to congratulate you.

89
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,282
Can't you read the room?

90
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,700
That's fine.

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,453
I just thanked him a moment ago.

92
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,497
-Yes, I heard her.
-But…

93
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,876
You're not planning to lecture me
for skipping a gathering

94
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,171
I wasn't even informed about, are you?

95
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,174
-I'm just--
-I'm sorry,

96
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,177
but I can't rearrange my schedule.

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,887
And I'd rather not waste anyone's time

98
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,015
-by celebrating my personal achievements.
-Right.

99
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,980
This is why I like her.

100
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,818
But it's a happy day,
so just take a moment to cool off--

101
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,903
I'm sorry, but I must decline.

102
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,656
-My shift is over.
-Huh?

103
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,866
Already?

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,202
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

105
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,124
At least grab a bite.
You always skip your meals.

106
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,294
Is that really enough?
Should I pack this for you, then?

107
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,963
What a brat.

108
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,342
Why won't you eat it? It's expensive.

109
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,149
From listener 3751,

110
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,110
Do Ra-ik's "It's Me"

111
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,987
has finally dropped.

112
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,824
I'd love to share
this exciting first moment.

113
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,159
Today's new release.

114
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,163
Do Ra-ik of Gold Boys
has returned with a solo comeback.

115
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,957
With our final song, "It's Me,"

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,501
I hope you all have a wonderful evening.

117
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,353
I walk a path that's neither
Warm nor cold

118
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,981
After walking alone for so long

119
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:07,236
I start to mistake the creeping unease

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,655
Sometimes it feels like
It'll never end

121
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,784
And even the broken moments of rest
Were never truly mine

122
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,497
But anyone would feel the same

123
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,627
I can't live mindlessly

124
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,090
The way the world wants me to

125
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:35,389
I'm still me, just as I've always been

126
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,557
Not once…

127
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,143
You have a message from Like.

128
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,896
I'm streaming, no DMs.

129
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,147
SMING: Repeatedly streaming a song
to boost its chart ranking

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm still the same as you know me

131
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,694
There is nothing less

132
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,447
There is nothing more

133
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,327
Nice.

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,747
It's me

135
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,921
Let's get started.

136
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,924
Our cutie.

137
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,051
We'll spoil you.

138
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,261
DO RA-IK

139
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,304
ADD TO PLAYLIST

140
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,436
FANJJAEK

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,980
RA-IK SOLO

142
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,982
RA-IK SOLO COMEBACK

143
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,156
CONGRATS ON RA-IK'S SOLO

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,324
RA-IK SOLO COMEBACK

145
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
YOU ARE THE BEST, RA-IK!

146
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,754
DO RA-IK

147
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,226
DO RA-IK'S "IT'S ME" VIDEO PHOTOSHOOT

148
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,353
What is this?

149
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,564
He looks like a statue.

150
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,321
Please notify me

151
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,198
of Do Ra-ik's photoshoots

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,659
like an emergency alert.

153
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,293
Do Ra-ik, "It's me" is a total hit.

154
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,087
I heard you won the case.

155
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,839
-We should celebrate.
-I'm busy.

156
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,761
I brought this too.

157
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,516
Just leave it there.

158
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,228
What about me? Am I supposed to starve?

159
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,938
I brought it all the way here.

160
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,875
Did you eat before all that?

161
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,002
Food isn't the priority.

162
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,421
It's the historic day
Ra-ik dropped his solo.

163
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,923
Did you hit the like button?

164
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,841
We must support him however we can.

165
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,093
Please.

166
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,470
Mind your own business first.

167
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,556
The whole internet is blowing up
over the Lee Seong-ho case,

168
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,684
saying things like "They freed a devil"
and "She just wants money."

169
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,520
It's nothing new. I won, that's all.

170
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,481
You should've just made
one statement at the photo line.

171
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,651
The assault was nothing
but the victim's word,

172
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,570
and that so-called CCTV evidence
was just a light shove.

173
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,698
I gathered all the evidence
to counter it for you.

174
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,784
I already said everything in court.

175
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,538
Which is why people keep saying
you only care about money.

176
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,376
Truth is, every other lawyer
was too scared to take the case,

177
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,419
but you took it on.

178
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,214
People only see and believe
what they want.

179
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,259
No matter what I say,
they won't believe me.

180
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,804
I just do my job.

181
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,723
Because in the end,

182
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,643
the truth always comes out in court.

183
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,480
And people aren't

184
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,732
entirely wrong.

185
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,025
Money is part of it.

186
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,528
When I take tough cases, I earn more.

187
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,615
And the more I earn,
the more I can support Ra-ik.

188
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,035
You get all that hate, work so hard,
and spend it all on him.

189
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,079
You don't think it's a waste?

190
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,498
Waste? I feel bad I can't give him more.

191
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,297
What's so great about him anyway?

192
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,966
He looks pretty much the same as I do.

193
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,634
Chung-jae!

194
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,344
What you are saying is…

195
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,849
You're basically saying

196
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,979
a mud lump squeezed by a toddler
and thrown around

197
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,647
is the same

198
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,191
as Michelangelo's David

199
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,194
in an Italian museum.

200
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,197
Where's the mirror? Go look at yourself.

201
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,949
Or get your eyes checked.
You must be sick.

202
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,078
He just looks fancy on the outside.

203
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,872
He's just a person like us.

204
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,416
He poops, farts,

205
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,502
and gets chili flakes stuck
in his teeth.

206
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,712
No, Ra-ik is different.

207
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,132
These are all the same person.

208
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,717
Why are you hoarding this stuff?

209
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,179
Don't touch it with greasy hands.

210
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,685
Chung-jae,

211
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,022
you really don't know what love is.

212
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,526
I know it better than you,
a lifelong single.

213
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,822
You don't know anything.

214
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,158
Love is something

215
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,245
that destroys any sense of logic.

216
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,997
Sure, I've told myself,
"I should stop buying these,"

217
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,083
and "Why am I buying another one?"

218
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,918
How could I not?

219
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,003
It's this pretty!

220
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,715
You just go for it first.

221
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,763
Love doesn't need a reason, it never has.

222
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:14,687
Even knowing well
that no answer will come back.

223
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,107
Just shouting his name out loud

224
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,317
is enough to fill your whole heart.

225
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,822
Like a flawless diamond
admired simply for existing,

226
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,742
just its presence alone

227
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,953
makes every explanation unnecessary.

228
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,458
To give all of yourself
without a hint of regret…

229
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,462
that is what true love is.

230
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,464
Oppa!

231
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
Ra-ik!

232
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,831
How did this happen again?

233
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,125
I told you to tighten security.

234
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,461
I switched to the best security company,

235
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,004
but your fans are so…

236
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,680
Let's go.

237
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,350
You haven't told him about it yet, right?

238
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,020
It's fine.

239
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,397
He'll understand if I tell him.

240
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,068
Just tell him now.

241
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
How am I going on stage
with hair like this?

242
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,241
Why am I the only one trying?

243
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
Why am I always the only one who cares?

244
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
Let me check my outfit.

245
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,088
I'm going to the car.

246
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,255
Ra-ik!

247
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,051
Why the car? It's your solo debut.
You have to go on stage.

248
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,594
Then prepare things properly.

249
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,389
Hair, makeup, and outfit,
none of them is right.

250
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,391
How am I supposed to perform like this?

251
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,642
We can redo everything.

252
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,061
-Come on, let's--
-No, I don't need it.

253
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,106
Move.

254
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,358
-I said move.
-Wait, hold on.

255
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,861
Let's talk for a second.

256
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,324
Excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.

257
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,703
Let's step out for a moment.

258
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,089
Move out, seriously!

259
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,807
I'm sorry, it's really my fault.

260
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,017
Why didn' t you tell me?

261
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,519
-I knew you wouldn't come.
-I shouldn't have.

262
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,730
I said from the start
that I don't do music shows.

263
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,107
Given my seniority,
after all I conceded,

264
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,943
shouldn't the company support me too?

265
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,903
How could you give the ending

266
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,239
to those TMB or whatever they are?

267
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,992
You should've said, "If you're not giving
the ending, back off.

268
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,869
He's got plenty of stages waiting."

269
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,081
If you can't handle that,
why make me come here?

270
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,959
I couldn't help it.
TMB is huge these days.

271
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,925
They're huge?
I've never even heard of them.

272
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,470
They're not huge, just rookies.

273
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,722
It's your first solo,

274
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,808
so of course your solo power
can't match the group's…

275
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,895
But compared to your fandom,

276
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,897
they're tiny.

277
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,318
Honestly, if you were Ra-ik of Gold Boys,

278
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,862
that would be different.
But this is your first solo.

279
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,364
That's why we got you on music shows.

280
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,742
But with new rookies blowing up,
no one can stop that.

281
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,620
Not me, not the CEO, not the company.

282
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,621
Only you can.

283
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,795
They said to stand by.

284
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,130
You're still pretty good.

285
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm fully fired up now.

286
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,720
What are you doing?
Bring the staff in, we don't have time.

287
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,847
Yes.

288
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,727
Come in! Hurry!

289
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,231
My flame, who's tall, handsome,

290
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,274
and an amazing actor,

291
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,610
was actually the main vocalist
of a 12-year band.

292
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,322
The versatile Ra-ik from Gold Boys
excels at both bass and vocals,

293
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,534
has now returned as a solo artist.

294
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,828
He says it shows his true self, sincerely.

295
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,788
Mr. Do Ra-ik, please stand by.

296
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,998
Let's hear it now, "It's Me."

297
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,294
I walk a path
That's neither warm nor cold

298
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,713
After walking alone for so long

299
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:57,010
I start to mistake the creeping unease

300
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,763
Sometimes it feels like
It'll never end

301
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,392
And even the broken moments of rest
Were never truly mine

302
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,979
But anyone would feel the same…

303
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,731
One day, I swear I'll kill that bastard.

304
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,984
No, I'll kill him.

305
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,404
They have no idea, huh?

306
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,532
That lunatic is actually a total psycho.

307
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,200
If they knew, they wouldn't be here.

308
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:25,164
I'm still me, just as I've always been

309
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:30,377
Not once have I ever been
Anyone but myself

310
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,713
I'm still

311
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,049
The same as you know me

312
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,385
There is nothing less

313
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,929
There is nothing more

314
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,016
The purpose of this amendment

315
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,436
is to recalculate
the defendants' breach of trust

316
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,440
based on the valuation report.

317
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,318
There is a gap between the actual value

318
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,821
and the purchase price,
so I'll explain them one by one.

319
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,909
The actual value of the Areum real estate
purchased by the defendants…

320
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,786
Let me see.

321
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,624
…has been revised upward
from 50 million won.

322
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,000
to 1.46 billion won.

323
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,545
Accordingly, the difference in price

324
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,966
has also been revised,
from 640 million won to 430 million won.

325
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,553
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

326
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,430
but could you please instruct
defense counsel

327
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,934
to refrain from actions
that impede the proceedings?

328
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,854
The one obstructing this trial
is the prosecution.

329
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,147
I, as defense counsel,

330
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,067
have an unavoidable reason,
chronic respiratory condition.

331
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,528
But the prosecutor
is deliberately delaying the trial

332
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,323
by abusing
the indictment amendment system.

333
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,159
It's just to make the allegations clearer…

334
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,994
So, is it clearer now?

335
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,038
From what I see here,

336
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,375
the date, location,
and method of the offense

337
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,876
have not been supplemented.

338
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,671
You were told to file before the hearing,

339
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,215
yet you filed on the day of the hearing,

340
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,467
-without proper preparation…
-Your Honor,

341
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,387
under Article 27, Paragraph 3
of the Criminal Act,

342
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,306
it is stated that every citizen
has the right to a prompt trial.

343
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,726
For the sake of the defendant,
who is suffering from a prolonged trial,

344
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,105
I earnestly request that the court

345
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,400
proceed without further delay.

346
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,827
South entrance of the West Building.

347
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm fine.

348
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,352
Prosecutor Kwak!

349
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,062
-What are you doing here?
-Here.

350
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,857
-I came for the trial, and--
-And?

351
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,027
Something came up, so I need to spare time
for the woman who went inside.

352
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,403
A woman? You?

353
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,613
Is she pretty?

354
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,906
No, not like that.

355
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,326
Some woman did this to my coffee

356
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,579
and then walked in there,
and my shoes are a mess.

357
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,042
-Really?
-She needs to learn

358
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,002
that a simple apology
doesn't cover the damage.

359
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,211
Right?

360
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,591
Some people only learn basic manners

361
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,843
when you teach them.

362
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,220
Because they grew up
without learning basic manners.

363
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,805
Right.

364
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,433
Could you tell the person inside
to come out quickly?

365
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm in a hurry.

366
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,770
There's no one inside.

367
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,834
I said not to call me
for things like this.

368
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,169
Am I a taxi?

369
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,046
If I drive now, it's going to be jammed.

370
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,506
Then take the subway.

371
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,008
Double the premium taxi surcharge.

372
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,907
What if you get vocal nodules again?

373
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,118
I told you not to strain yourself.

374
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,037
Just hold on until the autograph session.

375
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,998
If fans find out, they'll freak out.

376
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,590
Ra-ik!

377
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,801
I know it's you.

378
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,595
Why aren't you talking, huh?

379
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,231
This is Do Ra-ik's number, right?
I love you, Do Ra-ik.

380
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,275
How can you treat a fan like this?
My love, Do Ra-ik.

381
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,693
You're so mean, Ra-ik, reply to me.

382
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm watching everything.
You're reading my messages, right?

383
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,447
I know it all.
You changed your home password.

384
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,533
Tell me too.
Why am I the only one left out?

385
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,673
TO. YOO-JIN

386
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,759
Here it is.

387
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,761
-Thank you.
-Get home safe.

388
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,263
Ra-ik, you're so handsome!

389
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,894
-What's your name?
-I'm Hye-joo.

390
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:46,193
-Your name is Hye-joo?
-Yes, it's Sim Hye-joo.

391
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,030
That's a pretty name.

392
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,618
Ra-ik, you're really handsome.

393
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,662
Thank you, Hye-joo, thanks for coming.

394
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,332
Thank you.

395
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,633
Ra-ik.

396
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,301
Hey, Ra-ik!

397
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,225
What's your name?

398
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,310
You still don't remember my name?

399
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,437
It's been years.

400
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,857
What's your IQ?

401
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,025
Sorry.

402
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,070
-Tell me again, and I'll remember it.
-Yeah?

403
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,905
I can't just tell you.

404
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,491
If you tell me what I want to know,
I'll tell you.

405
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,038
What do you want to know?

406
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:40,956
Your phone number.

407
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,042
Why do you keep changing it?

408
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,587
Give me your number, didn't you hear me?

409
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,883
Give me your phone number!

410
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,803
Hey, give me your number!

411
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,179
Hey!

412
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,430
Ra-ik, you!

413
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,308
Do you know how much money I spent on you?

414
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,394
Ra-ik, I'm sorry!

415
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,979
I was wrong!

416
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,399
I love you!

417
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,069
Ra-ik!

418
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,073
Do Ra-ik, I love you.

419
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,185
Ra-ik, what's going on?

420
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,523
Open the door.

421
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,067
I'm fine, just go.

422
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,155
Okay, I'll wait outside.
Come out when you're ready.

423
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,262
Hey, drop me off up there.

424
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,680
By this pillar?

425
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,727
Thanks, I'll go in first.

426
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,940
Excuse me.

427
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,779
Thank you.

428
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,620
So clumsy.

429
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,253
Ra-ik was really cool today, right?

430
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,671
He's even better in person.

431
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,132
The camera can't capture it all.

432
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,148
DO RA-IK, I LOVE YOU

433
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,208
I missed the autograph session,

434
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,168
and the music show too.

435
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,047
If I end up missing the solo concert too…

436
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,677
Don't cry looking like that.
It's embarrassing.

437
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,012
Why do you show up looking like that?

438
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,681
You're here to see your flame.

439
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,436
People must not recognize me.

440
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,356
I get every insult
for defending all kinds of scumbags.

441
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,858
What if someone recognizes me?

442
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,943
If they find out
someone like me is his fan,

443
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,987
he could get criticized too.

444
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,905
And if he knew, he might be disappointed.

445
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,615
That guy wouldn't recognize you

446
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,035
even if you showed up
in a bright red evening dress.

447
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,370
You look really ordinary.

448
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,877
It's fine.

449
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm fine

450
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,339
just watching…

451
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,676
from afar…

452
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,763
just being able to look at him is enough.

453
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,558
That's really enough.

454
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,978
I woke up at four, stopped by the salon,

455
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,898
went to the music show for the recording,

456
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,734
then went to the evening autograph
session, and I only just got back.

457
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,365
I didn't know
there was still a fan meeting left.

458
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,662
Come out.

459
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,166
If you're not out here in three seconds,
I'll really get mad.

460
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,377
One,

461
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,879
two,

462
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,422
three!

463
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,429
Why aren't you sleeping today…

464
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,059
But why do you drink so much?

465
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,602
Don't you care about your health?

466
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,938
Yeah, you've started promotions now.

467
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,941
You need to manage yourself
or you'll look swollen again.

468
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,614
This is something like a diffuser.

469
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,373
-Move out!
-We really had an appointment to meet.

470
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,585
For real!

471
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,421
-We have not been informed of anything.
-No, really.

472
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,258
Ra-ik promised to make us Kimchi Udon.

473
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,454
Why? Why not put soap
while you're at it?

474
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,789
Give me a towel.

475
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,507
Hey.

476
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,220
You call yourselves fans when you barge
into someone's home?

477
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,599
You're the same as cockroaches.

478
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,101
Dirty, disgusting, and repulsive!

479
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,853
The company could've handled this,

480
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,147
but you couldn't hold it in
and created this mess?

481
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,483
Do you know how much money
we spent to contain it?

482
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,526
Here, the towel.

483
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,612
What's wrong with calling a criminal
a criminal?

484
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,031
Don't I earn this much for you?

485
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,827
You really think
you're worth that much, don't you?

486
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,413
I can tell by all you're wearing.

487
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,917
I've never seen that ring,
did you get it new?

488
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,087
Gold keeps going up in value
if you hold onto it.

489
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,422
You on the other hand keep going down.

490
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,302
You haven't checked yet?

491
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,846
You dropped to tenth yesterday.

492
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,889
What?

493
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,106
You know how important
this solo promotion is, right?

494
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,150
Thanks to you cursing out fans,

495
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,321
we nearly lost every ad deal,
you know that?

496
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,657
They weren't fans, they were stalkers.

497
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,159
They snuck into my home. I'm the victim.

498
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,455
I know, you must've been shocked too.

499
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,582
They go in and out of your house
more than you,

500
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,835
and even steal your underwear.

501
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,589
Yeah, it must be driving you crazy.
I get it.

502
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,510
But the moment you show all your emotions,

503
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,806
you're no longer Do Ra-ik of Gold Boys,
you're just the human Do Ra-ik.

504
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,517
People don't want the human Do Ra-ik!

505
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,938
You can only deserve all of this
if you keep that perfect image.

506
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,650
No swearing, no drinking, understand?

507
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,363
If you understand,

508
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,116
then wash up and go practice.
The concert is soon.

509
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,413
-Take him straight to the practice room.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,166
Then…

511
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,628
when can I finally live freely?

512
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,342
Since I met you when I was ten,
I've only done exactly what I was told.

513
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,722
When will I be able to say
I'm hurting when I'm hurt,

514
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,809
and tell people who wronged me
to stop tormenting me?

515
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,104
When can I live as the human Do Ra-ik?

516
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,276
Well.

517
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,779
If you keep this up,

518
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,240
that day might come sooner.

519
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,743
The day when nobody loves you anymore.

520
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:15,947
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

521
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,915
HIGH TRAFFIC DETECTED

522
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,251
It's coming!

523
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,418
It's opening!

524
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,672
It opened!

525
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,383
Stay calm.

526
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,843
I can do this.

527
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,178
Then what about here?

528
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,180
THE SEAT IS ALREADY BOOKED.

529
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,142
THE SEAT IS ALREADY BOOKED.

530
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,398
-What? What's wrong with her?
-Don't look at her.

531
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,276
SEAT ALREADY BOOKED.

532
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,073
No way.

533
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,785
This photocard has never failed me.

534
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,704
It's my lucky charm.

535
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,217
DO RA-IK SOLO CONCERT

536
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,260
CONCERT TICKET TRANSFER

537
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,137
Solo concert ticket transfer.

538
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,597
300,000 won with the ticket.

539
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,559
Why are they auctioning off
Ra-ik's concert tickets?

540
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,731
Why do I have to miss the concert
because of scalpers?

541
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,816
Starting today,
I'm reporting scalpers.

542
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,027
Because of scalpers, macros,
and Goldie's ignorance,

543
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,863
I'm clenching my teeth through life.

544
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:42,867
TICKET SCALPERS

545
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,371
Is the transfer still available?

546
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,626
Yes, please make an offer.

547
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,087
500,000 Won.

548
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,549
I've been offered 550,000 Won.

549
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,801
I'll pay 500,000 won upfront

550
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,972
and another 500,000 won
on the day of the concert.

551
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,560
Deal.

552
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,566
SOLO FAIL?

553
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,693
To shine the brightest at the top,

554
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,446
you must completely hide your own shadow.

555
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,365
You have to smile, speak, and act

556
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,659
exactly the way they want,

557
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,955
fitting yourself to their desires.

558
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,500
That's the only way to be loved.

559
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,546
And that's how you slowly wither.

560
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,884
Erasing yourself completely.

561
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,847
The symptoms likely began because of that.

562
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,350
The fear that you're fading,

563
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,353
disappearing entirely,

564
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,147
turned into panic attacks.

565
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,609
The tinnitus is also part of the symptoms.

566
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,155
We need to begin treatment
before it worsens--

567
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,114
Doctor,

568
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,284
I already disappeared a long time ago.

569
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,706
Just give me the meds, I'm busy.

570
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,666
We will be ready soon.

571
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,920
Ra-ik, where are you!

572
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,506
Every staff member is here.
It's the day of your concert!

573
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,049
I'm almost there!

574
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,592
Stop rushing me.

575
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,969
Where on earth did you go?

576
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,223
I'm entering the parking lot.
Have Sang-beom come out.

577
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,476
-What did he say?
-Go to the parking lot now, hurry.

578
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,395
Yes.

579
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,278
Excuse me.

580
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,281
It's you.

581
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,333
Hey, money first.

582
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,181
-What is this?
-What do you think?

583
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,058
You've been caught
committing illegal ticket scalping

584
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,895
that harms the concert ecosystem
and consumer rights.

585
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,022
So you will now be escorted
to the police station

586
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,483
to face the full extent of the law.

587
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,695
Hey!

588
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,823
Under Article 3, Paragraph 2, Clause 4
of the Misdemeanor Punishment Act

589
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,326
selling tickets at a premium
is punishable by a fine

590
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,786
of up to 200,000 Won,
detention, or a minor fine.

591
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,803
Hey, isn't that Ra-ik's manager?

592
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,931
Where have you been?

593
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,015
Everyone is…

594
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,434
It's Ra-ik!

595
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,526
There's a staff passage over there.

596
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,986
-Go first, hurry!
-Where?

597
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,574
Don't chase him!

598
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,831
Why? Did you lose him?

599
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,959
With those long legs!

600
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,086
You go that way, I'll go this way.

601
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,255
-Call me when you find him.
-Sure.

602
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,817
Where is the passage?

603
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,117
Why isn't he picking up?

604
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,499
Where do you think you're running?

605
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,978
Where is he?

606
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,690
This way.

607
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,114
I'll remove my hand now.

608
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,450
Don't scream.

609
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,993
Don't follow me.

610
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:42,953
Got it?

611
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,515
I'm going.

612
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,310
Hurry, this way.

613
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,883
Hurry up.

614
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,680
Why is no one here?

615
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,100
I'll go check the rehearsal.
The waiting room is that way.

616
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,734
How is he the one late
to his own solo concert?

617
00:44:56,568 --> 00:45:00,322
-He has no manners at all.
-He's been busy lately.

618
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,950
Solo promotions, variety shows, and radio…

619
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,661
I feel bad for him.

620
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,540
It seems like he's always carrying
everything by himself.

621
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,624
Young-bin,

622
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,168
you don't know
what that psycho's been doing, do you?

623
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,545
What have I been doing?

624
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,131
You're here?

625
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,466
What's that psycho supposedly doing?

626
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,635
Dating? Gambling?

627
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,720
Drugs? What?

628
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,472
Why are you so late?

629
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,057
Can the main character be this late?

630
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,936
-Jae-hee!
-He showed up late and didn't say sorry.

631
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,356
I'm sorry, happy now?

632
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,108
You should say thanks too.

633
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:40,070
You dragged us here
since you had no guests.

634
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,530
Hey, come on.

635
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,823
Seriously!

636
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,201
It's true, right?

637
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:49,621
You're using us because you can't handle
filling two hours by yourself.

638
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,332
Aren't you?

639
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,292
WAITING ROOM / GOLD BOYS  (KANG WOO-SEONG,
CHOI JAE-HEE, LEE YOUNG-BIN)

640
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,252
You're right.

641
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,670
I'm using you.

642
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,714
But you're no different, are you?

643
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,383
Your contract's expiring,
you're getting zero offers,

644
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,927
and the only way to survive is to renew.

645
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,513
So you've been doing
whatever the company says

646
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,265
and came all the way here.

647
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,559
Trying to cling to me
for a few more years.

648
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,561
What? What did you just say?

649
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,855
Kang Woo-seong, see?

650
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,356
This is why I said no.

651
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,320
All right, I'm done.

652
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,242
-I'm done being this lunatic's lackey.
-Hey, Jae-hee.

653
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,744
-Hey!
-Yes, go!

654
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,122
I'm glad I won't have to see
you ruin my stage.

655
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,791
You are the one, screw it.

656
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,878
You think you got a solo
because of your skill?

657
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,089
No, but do you know why?

658
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,509
It's all thanks to that cheap sob story
you keep selling.

659
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,553
What's so great about suffering
under a mom who worked at a bar?

660
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,639
Hey, Choi Jae-hee!

661
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,059
-Hey, say it again.
-I'm telling the truth.

662
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,811
You sell your sad past for pity points!

663
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,189
-Say it again!
-Hold on.

664
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,484
People don't love you.

665
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,361
They just pity you.

666
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,488
-What a bastard!
-Ra-ik!

667
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,406
Stop!

668
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,533
Wait a sec…

669
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,912
-Come here!
-Choi Jae-hee!

670
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,915
Calm down, Ra-ik.

671
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,083
Move!

672
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,836
Move out!

673
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,465
-Please, stop!
-Move out!

674
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,510
-Young-bin!
-Please stop fighting!

675
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,598
Are you okay?

676
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,031
Get inside, the concert starts soon.

677
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,200
Take care of Ra-ik.

678
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,660
Ra-ik, come on.

679
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,341
SUCCESSFUL CONCERT
RECORD-BREAKING AUDIENCE

680
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,192
Why weren't the other members
there yesterday?

681
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,610
I was expecting a guest.

682
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,363
They were supposed to come out,
but they fought and got hurt.

683
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,658
I was working yesterday
and saw Ra-ik and Jae-hee fighting.

684
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,577
They came to help his solo concert
and he behaves like that?

685
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,495
His attitude hit rock bottom.

686
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,455
What are they talking about?

687
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,668
False rumor dissemination fine--

688
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,669
MESSAGE

689
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,422
LIKE

690
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,466
Did you see the comments?

691
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,469
Yeah.

692
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:36,264
What is this Gold Boys discord rumor?
Is the Ra-ik personality controversy real?

693
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,850
What? LIKE.

694
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,019
How can even you…

695
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,359
Discord rumors are nothing new.
Our boys really are close.

696
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,490
It's all over communities.

697
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,119
They say Ra-ik beat them,
so they ended up in the ER.

698
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,288
That makes no sense.

699
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:06,670
GOLD BOYS RUMORS OF DISCORD
DO RA-IK CONTROVERSY COMPILATION

700
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,594
DON'T STICK

701
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,554
DON'T STICK TO ME

702
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,264
EMBARRASSED

703
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,141
This is…

704
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,101
ANNOYED

705
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,603
I want to defend him too, but…

706
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,313
My eyes aren't blurred anymore…

707
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,526
I don't know if the Ra-ik I loved
is even the real him.

708
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,822
Sellpish, do you trust him?

709
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,781
DON'T ACT UP

710
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,284
Do you trust him 100%?

711
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
I trust him.

712
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,267
I trust our Ra-ik

713
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:14,321
I'm still me, just as I've always been

714
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:19,034
Not once have I ever been
Anyone but myself

715
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,286
I'm still

716
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,997
The same as you know me

717
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,249
There is nothing less

718
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,294
There is nothing more

719
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,670
Enough already.

720
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,422
It's me

721
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,090
The security office will call!

722
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,265
Woo-seong's here.

723
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:54,110
Come in.

724
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,987
What's all this alcohol?

725
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,781
It's been a while for us guys.

726
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,285
Hold on, then I'll bring out some snacks.

727
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,246
It's fine, it's already past eight.

728
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,081
It'll be quick.

729
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,542
-Go before it gets later.
-All right.

730
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,085
Stop chugging alcohol.

731
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,296
If you whine tomorrow about heartburn,
I will throw bread chunks at you.

732
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,965
All right.

733
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:16,633
-Go.
-Yeah.

734
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,974
He looks completely deflated.

735
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,145
I'll cook hangover soup tomorrow,
so sleep over.

736
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,605
-Be safe.
-Okay.

737
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,822
Why are you here? What about the boys?
What about Jae-hee?

738
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,533
So you do worry, huh?

739
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,663
I worry he might still be alive
when I should have finished him.

740
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,749
You came to the hospital.
I know everything.

741
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,971
You rushed over after the concert
because you were worried.

742
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,472
You didn't even go to the after party.

743
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,350
You could've at least said hello
since you came, seriously.

744
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:11,354
You were all talking behind my back
so how could I show up there?

745
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,315
Luckily, he was not badly hurt.

746
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,191
Just a cast, he will be discharged soon.

747
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,700
Jae-hee really feels sorry.

748
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,245
He knows he should never have said--

749
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,375
This is expensive, chew it and swallow.

750
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,776
Hey, this tastes just like that, right?

751
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,905
When we lived in the semi-basement room…

752
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,033
the one with a month past its expiration.

753
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,661
Yeah, that chunky milk.

754
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,996
-It tastes exactly the same.
-Right.

755
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,916
You drank it
because you didn't want to waste it,

756
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,709
and then right before the stage…

757
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,053
Back then, we were passionate.

758
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,598
No matter how sick we were,

759
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:33,311
all we wanted was to be on the stage.

760
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,241
Ra-ik, if it's too hard for you…

761
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,617
If it's too hard, then what?

762
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,247
You know about my mom.

763
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,877
Hey, we really need to work hard.

764
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:02,424
Kids these days think
Gold Boys is the name of an animation.

765
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,179
So,

766
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,143
you are thinking
of continuing Gold Boys then?

767
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,979
Didn't you see

768
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,356
my album performance?

769
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,735
Jae-hee was right.

770
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,196
I cannot do it alone.

771
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,616
People love

772
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,994
Ra-ik of Gold Boys,

773
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,622
not just Do Ra-ik.

774
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:39,711
So I have to remain Gold Boys to the end.

775
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,633
Stop the depressing talk, let's drink.

776
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,101
Woo-seong.

777
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,694
Woo-seong

778
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:32,782
Woo-seong!

779
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,951
Woo-seong!

780
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,081
Open your eyes!

781
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,833
What happened to you?

782
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,335
Woo-seong.

783
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,838
What am I supposed to do?

784
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,382
Woo-seong!

785
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,954
There are days like that.

786
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,625
Days when I dreamed about you…

787
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,379
and on those days,

788
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,050
I can't help falling
into foolish little fantasies.

789
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:41,768
Like accidentally sharing a table
with you at a random restaurant,

790
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:51,152
or bumping into you
alone in an empty, late-night theater.

791
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,658
Just imagining it makes me happy.

792
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,496
FRESH MILK

793
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,379
Ra-ik is at Gangseo Police Station
right now.

794
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,847
RA-IK MURDERED WOO-SEONG?

795
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,858
Shock spreads as Gold Boys member

796
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,987
Kang Woo-seong was found dead.

797
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,657
The core of the incident
is that his body was found

798
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:42,370
at fellow member Ra-ik's residence
in Gangseong, Seoul.

799
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,830
Police confirmed

800
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,499
that the two were together
on the day of the incident,

801
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,877
and have identified him
as the primary suspect.

802
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,463
He was arrested on site

803
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,674
and is currently
at the Gangseo Police Station.

804
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,426
And I imagine,

805
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,805
just once, a miracle like that

806
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,434
could happen to me too.

807
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,228
POLICE STATION

808
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,563
LAWYER'S ID

809
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,114
LAWYER'S RECEPTION ROOM

810
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,924
But…

811
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,345
even if I imagined it

812
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,681
a hundred times, a thousand times,

813
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,100
I never imagined

814
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,943
that we would meet…

815
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,865
as a lawyer and a murder suspect.

816
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,877
You tell me, who is Do Ra-ik?

817
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,839
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

818
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,632
There are many contradictions in the case.

819
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,551
There's definitely something there.

820
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,554
Criminal Division 3, Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office

821
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,722
Kwak Byung-gyun.

822
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,558
Guys like Kang Woo-seong
are always unlucky jerks.

823
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,977
What do you mean you dropped Ra-ik's case?

824
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,395
He's going to trial without a lawyer.

825
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,646
Do you realize?

826
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,939
But what if it really was me?

827
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,567
No matter how hard I try,
I can't remember.

828
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:22,655
