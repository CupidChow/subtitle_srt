325
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,600
What did you do?
Did you make a mistake last night?

326
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,410
No. No, I didn't. I didn't do anything.

327
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,410
You just said

328
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,950
that you made a mistake "again".

329
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,950
I just deduced that you made
another mistake based on what you said,

330
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,880
logically-speaking.

331
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,250
I see. "Logically-speaking".

332
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,060
It's... Oh, right.
I saw on my phone that you texted me

333
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,890
last night.

334
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,460
You saw it?

335
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,300
Of course, I did. How could I miss it?
It said so on my phone.

336
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,170
"The message has been deleted".

337
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,110
By the way, what was that about?

338
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,940
Why did you text me
that late and delete it?

339
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,680
What? It's nothing. It was a mistake.

340
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,750
I see. A mistake.

341
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,920
I didn't know you also made mistakes.
I mean you're only human too.

342
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,820
Why did you ask me that now
instead of asking me last night?

343
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,920
I guess you were very busy last night.

344
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,030
[-♫ Drink it up, chug it down ♫]
-Yes.

345
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,130
When you texted me, there were
so many customers all of a sudden.

346
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
And the trucks were coming.

347
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,400
I was sweating,
and there was so much to do.

348
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,840
-I see. You were busy.
-Yes.

349
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,750
Gosh, this is especially tasty today.
The noodles are great.

350
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,120
The chef is feeling good today. Nice.

351
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,060
[So you won't tell me the truth?]

352
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,200
[-I can feel her intense gaze at my head.]
-This is good.

353
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,230
-Is that so?
[-She doesn't know anything, right?]

354
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Gorgonzola pizza.

355
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,810
Honey.

356
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,410
Gosh, it hits the spot.

357
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,020
-What?
-What?

358
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,330
-Bye.
-Okay.

359
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,870
Well, you were going to meet my parents.

360
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,930
Yes.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,570
I've given that some thought.

362
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,110
I think it's polite
that I meet your parents first.

363
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,540
My parents said the same thing.

364
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,040
But why all of a sudden?

365
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,180
"All of a sudden"?

366
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
We decided to meet each other's
parents last year. Did you forget?

367
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,020
Well, I remember that.
But you and I are both crazy busy.

368
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,150
Right. We're always busy.

369
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,720
But we should still do things properly.

370
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,560
Okay. Let's think about it.

371
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,290
Okay. That sounds great.

372
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,930
You're heading back to the store, right?

373
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,430
Yes. I have to fire the part-timer.

374
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,230
Why all of a sudden? Did something happen?

375
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,270
I left right away after getting a call
from Dal-sik when we were working out.

376
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,240
Right.

377
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,940
She called her friends

378
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,610
and had a party in front of the store.
I couldn't believe my eyes.

379
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,050
My goodness. So what did you do?

380
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,850
I mean, if she called her friends,
her friends must have been young girls.

381
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,220
You should have drunk with them.

384
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,030
Why would I drink with those young girls?

385
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,970
I acted very much like an adult.
I taught them a lesson.

386
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,970
I kicked all of them out.

387
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,300
I see.

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,210
You acted like an adult
and kicked them out.

389
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,940
Yes, I did. They were crying
and making a huge scene.

I should go and fire her.

402

Oh, this must be the artwork you bought
at the Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

403

It arrived today.

Congratulations.

Shouldn't I congratulate you?

406

Ms. Yoo, I prepared the tub for your bath.

407

Why did you drink?
You don't usually drink.

411
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,850
I had a drink with beef.

412

Beef? I guess you must've had a good day.

-24 months.

Which card did you use?

417
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,500
I saw a red credit card
on the dressing table.

Right. I'm so envious of you.

where my feet are swollen

with a 24-month installment.

I only took care of this issue
for one reason.

953
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,380
That's because you promised to hire me

954
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:53,450
as an official part-timer
if I helped you take care of this issue!

955
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,820
And I did, so I'm an official part-timer.
Take this off now.

956
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,490
It's official now.

957
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,520
-Says who?
-What?

958
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,790
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself.

959
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,530
I asked you about it last night,

960
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,670
and you gave a nod like this.

961
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,070
When did I do that? Where? How? Why?

962
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,340
I don't remember.

963
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,800
My gosh, you were sitting here like this.

964
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,110
-"Okay, sure."
-What? Unbelievable.

965
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,140
When did I ever say that to you?

966
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,350
Are you just making things up
because I was sleeping?

967
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,680
I don't remember saying that.

968
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,450
My gosh, are you serious?

969
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,660
Okay, fine. I guess I have no choice.

970
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,560
I'll just give up on being an official...

971
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,860
You must think I'm really slow.

972
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,700
Saet-byul,
there's something I want to check.

973
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,460
What's that?

974
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,600
Saet-byul, by any chance...

975
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,040
Three...

976
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,240
["Three"? Three years ago?]

977
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,440
[When we first met?]

978
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,850
-"Three"?
-Were you...

979
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,710
No, I mean...

980
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,650
Your...

981
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,590
-Your first...
[-First what? First kiss?]

982
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,760
[Is he finally going to ask me?]

983
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,630
"First"? First what?

984
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,660
Well... The first...

985
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,870
The first column.

986
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,870
The first column
of the third display stand is empty.

987
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,180
I kept telling you that it's empty.
Why haven't you filled it up already?

988
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,250
When will you officially get hired
by slacking off like that?

989
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,350
You have a long way to go.

990
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,920
Do I need to explain
every little detail to you?

991
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,750
Will you please work harder?

992
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
What...

993
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,290
What? I don't...

994
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,010
I feel like he wanted to talk to me
about what happened three years ago.

995
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,250
Maybe I should've asked him
more questions.

996
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,050
He wants me to look away?

997
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,490
[Part-timer Wanted]

998
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:55,630
My gosh. You should be thanking me.

999
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,530
-Excuse me.
-Hello. Welcome.

1000
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,570
[I'm worried I might've treated her]

1001
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,510
[exactly like how I was treated
in the past.]

1002
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,780
[-Dae-hyun!]
-Yes, sir?

1003
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,350
Did you write this?

1004
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,560
Is this the best you can do? Is it because
you went to a community college?

1005
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,330
This is why I can't ignore
people's educational backgrounds.

1006
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:30,060
Sir, I wrote that.

1007
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,670
It was you?

1008
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,910
[-I was too biased to see her]
-Here you go.

1009
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,580
[-for whom she really is.]
-Thank you. Bye.

1010
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,480
[Hey, Dae-hyun.]

1011
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,250
Yeon-joo, you weren't late
to your meeting, were you?

1012
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,090
No, but I would've been late
if it weren't for you.

1013
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,000
What a relief. I'll drive your car
back to your office tomorrow.

1014
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,430
[Thank you.]

1015
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,370
There's no need to thank me for this.
By the way, Yeon-joo,

1016
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,940
I have something to tell you.

1017
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,440
What is it?

1018
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,710
I'm not going to fire the part-timer.

1019
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,250
What?

1020
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,480
Why not? You seemed so eager to fire her.

1021
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,520
-I had a misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

1022
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,660
I thought she was reckless,
but I was wrong.

1023
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,460
And I can really use her help
at the convenience store.

1024
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,160
You're being too hasty.

1025
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,330
You promised to think about it
and discuss it with me--

1026
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,360
[Yeon-joo.]

1027
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,400
I know you were my boss
when I used to work in the PR team.

1028
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,400
But this is
regarding my convenience store.

1029
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,070
And I've made up my mind as the manager.

1030
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,640
So I'd like you to respect my decision.

1031
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,740
I see.

1032
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,350
Okay then. Do whatever you want.

1033
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,390
I think she's angry.

1034
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,590
Ms. Yoo Yeon-joo.

1035
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,430
Hello, sir.

1036
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,700
Why haven't you gone home yet?

1037
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,470
I'm getting ready
for the presentation tomorrow.

1038
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,740
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?
I haven't eaten either.

1039
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:22,610
Yeon-joo.

1040
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,950
We're at work, sir.
Please call me Ms. Yoo.

1041
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,920
Okay, Ms. Yoo. I apologize.

1042
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,450
Is your boyfriend's convenience store
doing well?

1043
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,320
It's our franchise,
so I'm sure you know his sales.

1044
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,690
So can I ask you why you're asking?

1045
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,390
I'm asking how satisfied he is.

1046
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,430
Our franchises need to be happy
in order for the company to grow.

1047
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,600
Let's not talk about someone
who isn't here right now.

1048
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,040
Then should we talk about us?

1049
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,770
Yes, let's do that. Let's talk about work.

1050
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,170
Did you prepare everything
for tomorrow's presentation, sir?

1051
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,920
[I found this among the CCTV footages.]

1052
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,690
[I bet both Eun-jo's and my life]

1053
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,020
[that you'll change your mind
once you see this footage.]

1054
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,560
What is she saying? What is this?

1055
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,720
My gosh, really? Not only is he handsome,
but he even knows how to dance.

1056
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,190
I can't believe this.
Dae-hyun, what can't you do?

1057
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,610
My gosh.

1058
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,380
I can't seem to trust her.

1059
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,150
What if she's holding a party
with her friends because I'm not there?

1060
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,520
My gosh.

1061
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,960
Let's see.

1062
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,390
Let's see what she's up to.

1063
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,930
My gosh, look at her.

1064
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,070
Look at what she's doing
when she should be working right now.

1065
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,040
What? She knows how to dance.

1066
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,240
Wait a minute.

1067
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,140
That's my dance.
