This is how you're going to congratulate
the best employee?

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,190
What more do you expect?
I think I've done enough.

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,830
Gosh, forget it.

8

Is this what you want?

-Yes, it's for you.

I'm so happy.

Now, you just need to give me
a piggyback ride.

14
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,430
You still haven't given up on that?

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,730
Of course. I don't give up that easily.
That's how I became the best part-timer

in this country.

I'm sure you know how hard it is
to become that

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,070
since you used to work
at the headquarters.

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,780
Okay, fine. I'll give you a piggyback ride
just this once for one second.

for becoming the employee of the month.

and asked him for a piggyback ride.

and I get goosebumps when I eat
or drink something bitter.

97

Look at my arms.
I have goosebumps all over.

98
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,610
Stop it and put your arm down.
Why are you telling us to look at it?

99

You want me to work harder to promote
products and also for the store?

What is it?

112
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,070
I misunderstood you at the bathroom
at that weird bar back then.

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,200
"Misunderstood"?

114
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,010
I was just very anxious.
I hope you understand.

115
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,810
She's still not going to apologize?

116
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,050
Saet-byul probably knows
that you didn't do that on purpose.

117
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,380
Right?

118
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,220
Yes, probably.

119
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,190
She understands.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
I appreciate your understanding.

121
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,930
I could keep chugging the wine
with you at the table with me.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,470

What makes you call at this hour?

Sorry?
Butter soy sauce beef triangular gimbap?

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,460
Why?

131
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,260
Is it the manager?

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,330
No, we'll just take what we ordered.

133
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,900
We ordered Spicy Fire Chicken

134
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,710
-And the beef ones.
-and the gochujang beef ones.

135
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,040
Dae-hyun, can you keep your voice down?
There are people here.

136
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,640
Customers at our store only love
spicy ones,

137
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,580
so items like butter soy sauce beef
triangular gimbap always expire.

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,680
Butter soy sauce beef ones are a bad idea.

139
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,850
I made myself clear, yes?

140
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,960
-What did he say?
-Saet-byul,

141
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,730
make sure to tell the delivery man
when you get the orders.

142
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,330
He won't listen because I'm a part-timer.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,370
So, you'd take butter soy sauce beef
triangular gimbap for our store?

144
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,670
-No!
-You wouldn't, right?

145
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,800
-I wouldn't.
-Absolutely not.

146
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,000
-Absolutely not.
-Understood?

147
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,070
-Okay.
-Yes?

148
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,340
I mean, yes.

149
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,010
I'm sorry the call went on for so long,
Yeon-joo.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,320
-Let's get going.
-You can go to the store and sort it out.

151
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,650
-Sorry?
-I don't mind,

152
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,790
so you go to the store and sort out
whatever you need to.

153
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,030
Franchise owners need to stand up
to the headquarters at times too.

154
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,690
Then how will you get home?

155
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,300
You think I can't get home without you?

156
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,900

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,440
Hello, sir.

161
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,810
How do you know her?

162
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,350
She's the employee of the month.

163
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,920
She's the promotion queen who made
our private label products sold-out.

164
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,420
You must be here to dine as well.

165
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,620
No, I'm just heading back after a workout.

166
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,230
A workout?

167
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,630
I didn't know people worked out at hotels.

168
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm going home. Did you drive here?

169
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,640
That's great. Can you give me a ride?

170
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,650
You shouldn't have let your girlfriend go
like that.

171
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,650
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,820
Look who's talking.
You shouldn't have done that earlier.

173
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,520
What are you saying?

174
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,290
No idea. Let's get back
before the truck arrives.

175
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,760
Mr. Choi, why don't we take a taxi?
Just the two of us. How romantic.

176
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,970
Should we?

177
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,200
-Really?
-30 seconds.

178
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,900
-Until what?
-Until the bus arrives.

179
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,310
Seriously? Wait for me!

180
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,610
Come on, run! Hurry!

181
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,810
No, don't leave.

182
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,110
My gosh.

183
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,380
-For two, please.
-Tab your card.

184
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,650
I don't know her.

185
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,020
Sorry.

186
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,770
You could've paid for me. Move over.

187
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,810
Stop it!

188
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,080
Why do you have to sit here
when there are so many seats?

189
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,010
It's too cramped now.

190
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,250
There were so many taxis.
We should've just taken one.

191
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,250
Did you not notice how they were
all deluxe taxis?

192
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,320
Stingy, as always.

193
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,560
I haven't had a meal that expensive
in so long, but it's all digested now.

194
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,890
You should be honored.

195
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,860
You got a good meal,
all thanks to Yeon-joo.

196
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,460
You saw how great Yeon-joo is, right?

197
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,160
Don't you ever dare to bother her.

198
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,770
Let's never do anything that could
ever create any misunderstanding. Good?

199
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,540
Why aren't you answering me?

200
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,810
I was just kidding.
You don't have to be so serious.

201
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,380
Don't you think
you're a little too serious?

202
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,210
Just don't cross the line.

203
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,750
-What line?
-Don't you see this?

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,850
There are many lines between us
like these.

205
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,260
Don't cross any of them.
They're electrical wires too.

206
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,190
Look at me crossing them!
Gosh, that hurts!

207
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,590
Now I'm not crossing them.

208
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,890
Stop it.

209
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,200
I wouldn't want to cross any.
You're so petty.

210
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,860
-Goodness.
-That's great.

211
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,570
Thanks for moving away.

212
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
I love having the whole seat to myself.

213
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,450
Bye now.

214
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,490
Yeon-joo,

215
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,190
can I ask you what's wrong?

216
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,690
Nothing is wrong.
There's just a lot going on in my head.

217
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,330
Relationships don't always go as expected.

218
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Good night.

219
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,010
-Here you go.
-Please take these.

220
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,610
-I'm serious.
-You may go.

221
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,950
-Thank you!
-You can't do this to me.

222
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,220
Bye now.

223
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,390
-Drive safe. See you tomorrow!
-Thank you.

224
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,550
Drive safe.

225
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,630
You saw that?

226
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,130
What would you do without me?

227
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,830
You couldn't have done that alone.

228
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,570
Nonsense.

229
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,830
Whatever.

230
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,540
Just make sure you place
our spicy ones out nicely.

231
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,540
-You're not going to do it with me?
-No.

232
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,840
You can do it all by yourself,
Ms. Part-timer. I'm leaving now.

233
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,180
Bye!

234
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,190
I'll take a Ghost Block Oakville Estate
Cabernet Sauvignon.

235
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,700
Why do wines have such long names?

236
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,670
These wines are perfectly fine.
Why was that one so expensive?

237
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,140
It didn't even taste good.

238
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,010
I need some soju bomb on a day like this.

239
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,280
I would've been drinking soju right now
if I weren't the employee of the month.

240
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,510
But I shouldn't.

241
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,820
♫ Hello ♫

242
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,400
I can't draw if you keep watching me
like that.

243
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry, that wasn't on purpose.

244
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,730
My drawing is quite eye-catching, I know.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,440
Some say that it's like a vacuum cleaner.

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,440
That means they want to clean it
because it's so dirty.

247
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,170
No, I'm just kidding.

248
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,810
Dal-sik, did you think about what I said?

249
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Of course.

250
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,110
My friend is getting an interview,
so how can I just sit still?

251
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,820
What is it?

252
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,290
-The keyword I thought of
-Yes?

253
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,120
-is lighthouse.
-Lighthouse?

254
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,990
You wouldn't want to see anything
but a lighthouse

255
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,900
when you're in the deep, dark seas
at night, right?

256
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,830
Yes, you're right.

257
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,440
A convenience store that's open
for 24 hours

258
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,640
[is like a lighthouse.]

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,210
[It's a place for the hungry, the lonely,]

260
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,540
[and those who are afraid of the dark.
It's a place for everyone.]

261
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,750
Your convenience store equals

262
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,080
-a lighthouse.
-A lighthouse.

263
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,020
Your interview will turn out well
if you go in this direction.

264
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,350
Gosh. Dal-sik.

265
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,990
-That's not a bad idea.
-It's good, isn't it?

266
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,890
Here.

267
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,260
-What are these?
-They're all for you.

268
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm leaving now.

269
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,170
Butter soy sauce beef? This one is rare.

270
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,140
My stomach hurts.

271
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,310
Did I eat something bad at the hotel?

272
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,480
Oh, right.

273
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,410
[Yes, Saet-byul?]

274
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
-Did the package arrive?
[-What package?]

275
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,080
Why are you asking me?

276
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,550
I'm asking because you're home.

277
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,190
Aren't you home?

278
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,990
What are you saying? Of course I'm home.

279
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,600
I'll go and check with the security
and see if they have the package. Good?

280
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,430
-Did you eat?
-I ate ramyeon.

281
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
Hey, it's not like we have nothing to eat.

282
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,370
If you say that 1 more time,
it'll be your 100th time saying that.

283
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,810
[Why do you always eat ramyeon?]

284
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,340
Fine, fine!

285
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,440
I have to go and study. Bye!

286
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,150
-Look at that.
-That must be nice.

287
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,150
You're making all of us,
the sister-less ones, really sad.

288
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,020
Eun-byul's sister is really scary.

289
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,420
-That's right.
-Scarier than me?

290
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,490
-No!
-No.

291
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,790
Let's go back to practicing.

292
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,390
Eun-byul, you're good,

293
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,930
but you need

294
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,000
to make your moves bigger and clearer.
Understood?

295
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,099
Yes!

296
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,369
-Yes!
-Yes!

297
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,040
Cue the music.

298
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,069
♫ Where are you? ♫

299
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,910
♫ Are you hiding somewhere? ♫

300
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,740
♫ Are you back because you love me? ♫

301
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,090
[Yeon-joo, you got home safe, right?]

302
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,560
[She hasn't responded for 2 hours
and 10 minutes.]

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,670
-Get off me.
-No!

304
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,430
Gosh, will you please get off me?

305
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,170
Yeon-joo, I know this looks bad.

306
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,980
You're congratulating her, right?

307
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,310
I'm just asking you to keep up
the good work.

308
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,650
You know, just work.

309
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,990
That's great. Can you give me a ride?

310
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,730
Gosh.

311
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,110
Good morning, Yeon-joo.

312
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,880
Here, get in.

313
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,430
I know that you're not
in the mood to talk, so just listen.

314
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,100
I only realized how frustrated and annoyed

315
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,400
you must have been when I got home.

316
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,000
I think I was

317
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,810
always proud of you.

It's an interview for your employee,
not your family.

Why?

492
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,570
People don't judge me
based on their opinions.

493
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,940
They just see me as a part-timer.

I see. I heard there are a lot of
customers especially during your shift.

Why do you think you're so popular?

Is that your effort to stay popular?

It's nothing like that.

[You just wait and see.]

792
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,960
The products are here.

793
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,560
Organize the storage,
Kang Ji-wook's friend.

794
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,970
Look at her pretending to be upset.

795
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,570
My gosh, she must be angry.

796
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,880
Should I not have come right on time?

797
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,750
It's better than being late.

798
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,390
Welcome.

799
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,960
What do you need?

800
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,830
Well... I...

801
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,880
My gosh, you're Kang Ji-wook!

802
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,280
You're Kang Ji-wook, right?
Gosh, I can't believe this.

803
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,720
You're the guy who was in that movie
with Ma Dong-seok, right?

804
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,220
Yes, that's right.

805
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,660
My gosh, this is amazing.

806
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,560
I really enjoyed that movie, "Black City".

807
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,560
You know that action scene
where you fought with Ma Dong-seok?

808
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,730
My gosh, this is unbelievable.

809
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,700
You're so tall in real life.
My goodness, you're so handsome.

810
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,100
But do you live nearby?

811
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,010
I've never seen you in this neighborhood.

812
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,870
I'm here to meet someone.

813
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,280
Who?

814
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
Your girlfriend?

815
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,110
-Hey, Puppy. Carry this for me.
-Okay.

816
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,850
-Where should I put it?
-Over there.

817
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,990
Ji-wook, you shouldn't be...

818
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,960
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't you know who he is?

819
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,460
My gosh, he's Kang Ji-wook,

820
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,660
-the movie actor!
-That's right!

821
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,490
It's Kang Ji-wook! How did he come here?

822
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,400
-Do you know what's important?
-He's so handsome.

823
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,430
What?

824
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,270
Mr. Choi, you crossed the line.

825
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,170
Saet-byul, have you been well?

826
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,510
Yes, I've been well.
I'm surprised you actually came.

827
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,970
Of course I came.

828
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,380
What? You guys know each other?

829
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,840
We were friends since elementary school.

830
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,410
See? I'm friends with a celebrity.

831
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,810
Gosh, you weren't kidding?

832
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,120
I can't believe you guys are friends.

833
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,350
Then I should introduce myself.

834
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,320
Hello... No, wait.
Let me sanitize my hands first.

835
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,660
Hello, I'm Choi Dae-hyun,
the manager of this store.

836
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,190
-Will you excuse us?
-I'll excuse my...

837
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,070
-Hey.
-If you stay, he'll feel uncomfortable.

838
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,170
-It's uncomfortable, isn't it?
-No way.

839
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,300
-No, he's fine.
-Just a little.

840
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,410
See? He feels uncomfortable.

841
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,340
-I guess you felt uncomfortable.
-Give us some space.

842
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,940
My gosh, you really are handsome.

843
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,420
Ji-wook, we're going to have
a team dinner later on.

844
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,120
You should come if you have time.

845
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,320
-He can't. He's a busy guy.
-I'm not busy.

846
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,720
He said he's not busy. You should come.

847
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,060
-We're having tripe.
-Tripe. Got it.

848
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,290
Gosh, you're making him
feel uncomfortable.

849
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,560
My gosh.

850
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeon-joo, you know how Kang Ji-wook
models for our private label product?

851
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,770
He's at my convenience store right now.

852
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,410
Yes, he's even going to join
our team dinner later.

853
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,140
So why don't you come
to our team dinner as well?

854
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,210
Then you can meet Kang Ji-wook

855
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,480
and have tripe with us.

856
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,720
I'm also having a team dinner right now.

857
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,950
Remember when my car broke down
and you came running for me?

858
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,560
I managed to sign a huge deal
with the client I met that day.

859
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,030
Oh, really?

860
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,490
That's great. Congratulations, Yeon-joo.

861
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,630
It's all because you came
and helped me that day.

862
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,900
Have fun at your team dinner
and call me later.

863
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,270
Okay, bye.

[Coffee]

865
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,510
Saet-byul, what did you mean
by what you said last time?

866
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,650
-What?
-You said you used to have a dad.

867
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,550
Three years ago, my dad passed away.

868
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,290
What? What happened?

869
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,190
A car accident.

870
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,860
-Where is his grave?
-At the memorial park.

871
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,400
Who are you living with?

872
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,530
I live with my little sister.

873
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,170
I see.

874
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,940
What's with that look?

875
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,440
Hey, don't give me that look, Puppy.

876
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,380
Sorry.

877
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,280
I shouldn't call you Puppy anymore.

878
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,020
Right, Mr. Kang Ji-wook?

879
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,220
Just be yourself.

880
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,120
Saet-byul, it's time for your team dinner.

881
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,030
-Hey, you're here. Let's go.
-Hello.

882
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,930
-Who is he?
-My friend.

883
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,860
Let's go. Thank you.

884
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,370
Bye.

885
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,070
You're not allowed to date
in our convenience store.

886
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,140
Enjoy the tripe. I love tripe too.

887
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,090
-Hello.
-Hello. Here you go.

888
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,360
-Sir.
-What?

889
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,830
-What are you doing here?
-My friend...

890
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,330
That's not important.

891
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,460
How is "Her Reggae Boy" doing?
I bet people love it.

892
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,100
The editor-in-chief and I
drank so much today because of that.

893
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,440
-Does he like it?
-He cussed all night

894
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,710
saying it rarely gets any views.

895
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,710
You think it's funny?

896
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,480
Why don't just draw
what you're supposed to draw?

897
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,880
It's supposed to be erotic, not romantic.

898
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,690
You see, deep down inside,
I'm a very romantic guy.

899
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,260
You draw for an adult webtoon website.
It needs to be erotic to get many views.

900
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,990
Be better with erotica
if you want a chance to draw romance.

901
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,030
Come on. You're not a virgin.

902
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,530
I'm sure you've dated a lot of women.
You're not a virgin, right?

903
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,130
I am a virgin.

904
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,040
Oh, really?

905
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,270
Then there will come a day
when you're no longer a virgin.

906
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,010
Think about that day
and make things more erotic.

907
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,180
More erotic?

908
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,050
Make it more steamy.

909
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,250
Sir, wait.

910
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,490
You need to pay...

911
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,120
That jerk.

912
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,230
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

913
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,790
Great job, Saet-byul!

914
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,230
-Thank you.
-Great job, Saet-byul.

915
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,570
Welcome to you too.

916
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,270
-Cheers!
-It's so nice to meet you.

917
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,040
Mr. Choi, don't you have
anything to say to me?

918
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,470
You know, the more I think about it...

919
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,010
My gosh, this is unbelievable.
It's very surprising.

920
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,850
-Right? I'm full of surprises, aren't I?
-No, not you.

921
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,220
The fact that you're friends with him
is really hard to believe.

922
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,550
-Ji-wook...
-Don't cross the line.

923
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,820
What are you saying?

924
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,860
I was right here.
You were the one who crossed the line.

925
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,060
-Gosh, forget it.
-Whatever.

926
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,700
I'm only letting you off the hook
because we're having a team dinner.

927
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,370
Sure. Whatever.

928
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,340
Ji-wook.

929
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,810
-You model for a hangover cure, right?
-Yes.

930
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,680
My girlfriend is the team manager
of the PR Team at that company.

931
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,780
By any chance,
are you talking about Ms. Yoo Yeon-joo?

932
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,150
Yes, how did you know? That's her.

933
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,850
-She's my girlfriend.
-Hey.

934
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,290
Don't talk to him.

935
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,220
Let's all take a photo.

936
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,660
Everybody, look over here.

937
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,030
In 1, 2, 3.

938
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,200
-There.
-Great.

939
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,300
My gosh, the photo came out great.

940
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:44,100
My goodness, you look so handsome
in this photo.

[Only Ji-wook shines at this team dinner.]

942
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:48,080
When are we going to get that photo
for the interview?

943
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,310
He said he'll send me a photo
before he uploads the article.

944
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,410
I see.

945
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,350
That must be it.

946
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,350
Speak of the devil.
