00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,070
I'm working very hard already.

165
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,870
You are, right?
Let's get to 200 customers tonight.

166
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,710
I'm leaving now.
Good luck, Saet-byul! Work hard!

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,310
Mr. Choi, wait!

168
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,850
I'm a Leo,

169
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,320
-so you need to stay with me.
-Whatever.

170
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,680
Just get to work!

171
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,190
What's wrong with you today?

172
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,920
Head back inside.

173
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,290
Let me just walk you up to there.

174
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,430
No, I'm fine. Head inside.

175
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,860
Get back inside and work.

176
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,500
Bye now!

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Why is she so bright today?
It's making me anxious.

178
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,900
She won't cause trouble again, will she?
Darn it.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,370
You'll come back later, right?
You'll need me!

180
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,940
Saet-byul, were you waiting for me?

181
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,010
You're even wearing a new shirt.

182
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,180
Saet-byul?

183
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,320
[Banana milk]

184
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,150
It's not expired yet.

185
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,420
You didn't call me here just to give me
some almost-expired milk.

186
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,530
It's about Eun-byul.

187
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,260
What about Eun-byul?

188
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,330
You don't think she secretly hangs out
with bad kids,

189
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,800
do you?

190
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,470
-Sorry?
-You know,

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,440
I get worried
around this time of the year.

192
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,580
Don't you trust me,
the ultimate human detector?

193
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,250
There's nothing fishy about Eun-byul.

194
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,990
Really? I'll take your word on this.

195
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,190
-All right.
-Welcome!

196
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,590
-Wait for me here.
-What should I get?

197
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,630
I'm going to die early
because of Eun-byul.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,700
How much is this?

199
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,270
How much?

200
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,280
-That'll be a dollar.
-A dollar?

201
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,080
Jae-hyuk.
I don't need to buy anything. Let's go.

202
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,480
Seems like we've got nothing to buy.

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,350
Bye.

-Let's go.
-Let's go.

205
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,360
-I got this.
-Nice job.

206
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,720
Well done.

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Hey, watch the store for me.

208
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,000
Just let them be. Don't cause a scene.

209
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,370
My boss will cause one if I let them be.

210
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,370
Hey! Saet-byul!

211

[Part-timer Wanted]

212
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,880
You can't just leave me here!

213
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,320
Sure she can.

214
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,560
My goodness! How can you even look

215
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,830
so perfect in a uniform? Check that out.

216
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,170
I look so adorable.

217
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,340
-Let me go!
-Get over here!

218
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,890
Welcome.

219
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,090
Thank you very much for visiting
our store.

220
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,490
Why are you here? Where's Dae-hyun?

221
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,630
You better know how lucky you were
that day.

222
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,630
As you should, too.

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,270
They say that you meet your enemy
at the worst time and place.

224
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,570
Seems like this must be it.

225
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,370
No, this is just a convenience store.

226
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,070
Don't you know metaphors, you idiot?

227
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,470
You're even more of an idiot.
And did you go gambling or something?

228
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,770
Your entire outfit is a jackpot.

229
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,610
-You're covered in roses.
-I'm going to smack you.

230
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,540
I'm going to smack you!

231
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,510
-Gosh.
-Go ahead. Hit me.

232
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,980
-Seriously!
-Hit me.

233
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,720
-You're so ugly.
-Get out of my way.

234
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,690
I was just about to.

235
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,690
What's wrong with you?

236
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,460
-Hello!
-Hello...

237
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,430
-Hey!
-Why is she so scary?

238
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,330
Hold up, you prick!
Next time you see me, I'll kill you!

239
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,300
You're so ugly.

240
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,300
How annoying.

241
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,640
That startled me!

242
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,180
Darn it. Who are you?

243
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,990
Thank you for being at the perfect place
for me to beat you all up.

244
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,850
-Are you crazy?
-How did you get here?

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,290
You guys were just stealing
left and right.

246
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,890
We're always like this.

247
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,530
The old man lets us off the hook,
so why are you acting up?

248
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,130
Because I can't watch such a thing.

249
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
Close your eyes next time, then.

250
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,140
We're gentlemen, so we don't hit girls.

251
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,410
-Of course.
-Just leave.

252
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,370
Just leave already!

253
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,010
Really? I love beating men up.

254
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,510
You can just get beaten up, then.

255
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,350
What is she talking about?

256
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,780
Oh, my.

257
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,090
Kid, you won't be able to work
if you get hospitalized.

258
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,250
I won't be able to visit you all
at the hospital because I have work.

259
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
-Get rid of her.
-Gosh.

260
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,990
Take care of it, you guys.

261
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,130
-How absurd.
-You're really asking for it.

262
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,560
Hold on. Does anyone know
what Wolf's bane symbolizes?

263
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,530
I'll let you off the hook if you do.

264
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,470
Let me give you a hint. It's your future.

265
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,500
What, stealing more
from the convenience store?

266
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,770
Hearing you be obedient to us?

267
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,540
Taking your paycheck?

268
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,610
Come here. Let me just beat you up.

269
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,810
How dare a tiny thing like you

270
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,450
approach us like this?

271
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,550
I'm bleeding! You!

272
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
-I'm borrowing this.
-Give it back!

273
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,760
You're nothing but a part-timer.

274
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,130
How dare you?

275
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,340
You're dead today.

276
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,650
How can these idiots get beaten up
by a girl?

277
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,050
I'm a little different, kid.

278
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,490
How dare you?

279
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,330
My hand!

280
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,070
Hey!

281
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,770
Darn it.

282
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,640
[Wolf's bane symbolizes
misanthropy and death.]

283
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,480
Stealing someone else's property is bad.

284
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,020
It's a crime.

285
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,750
Bring the list of everything you've stolen
with the money to pay for them.

286
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,220
I'll be able to become
an official part-timer, then!

287
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,360
Seriously?

288
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,830
And don't throw your change at me
when you're buying from the store.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,970
Would you like it
if I threw things at you?

290

-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

293
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,250
Dae-hyun, pick up the phone.
It's an emergency.

-What a surprise to see you here.
-Hello.

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,530
Are you calling Mr. Choi?

297
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,740
No, I'm just calling my parents
in Onyang, South Chungcheong Province,

298
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,410
just to check up on how they're doing.

No, I didn't see anything.

302
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,319
I severely lack in Vitamin A,
so I have a terrible night vision.

303
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,630
I'm practically blind at night,

304
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,560

305

306
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,300
Be careful on your way home, then.

so sketchy?

Gosh, what are you doing here, Yeon-joo?

313

Who on earth turned you into this stalker?

315
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,610
He hired an eye candy for his part-timer.

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,110
Excuse me. Can you ring these up?

325
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,880
-It's 20 dollars.
-Okay. Here you go.

326
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,020
Goodness, girl.

327
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,760
I can tell that you have
very high standards. I got you.

328
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,560
But I'm really sorry to break it to you.
I'm not into that.

329
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,960
Pardon?

330
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,860
You know? I like men.

331
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,930
Sure thing. I didn't say anything.

332
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,370
But why are you asking me for my number?
You gave me your phone. That's adorable.

333
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,470
I want you to run the transaction
with my phone.

334
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,810
What's that?

335
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,610
You really don't know?
This replaces a physical card.

336
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,210
I see. Oh, that? I've heard of that.
I know what it is,

337
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,180
but I only use cash.

338
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,880
Please run it quickly.

339
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,550
Wait, so what am I supposed
to do with this?

340
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,920
What do I do?

341
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,690
Girl, if you had cash, you should've paid
with that from the get-go.

342
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,970
Seriously. I know that
men dig anyone young and interesting.

343
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,180
But she doesn't look young or interesting.
How am I supposed to understand this?

344
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,840
Gosh, I came here to get mad,

345
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,050
but it makes me angrier
that there's nothing to be mad about.

346
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,380
It's only ruining my style.

347
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,050
-Come on.
-I was just kidding.

348
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,390
-Seriously.
-That's too much.

349
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,920
But I'm really happy to be drinking
with former colleagues today.

350
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,560
It's been a while.

351
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,330
-I agree.
-Hey, you guys.

352
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,160
I'm going to use the restroom.

353
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,730
-You don't have to tell us that.
-She's cute.

354
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,740
Dae-hyun, you'd better keep this in mind.

355
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,540
I know this because
I'm dating a colleague in secret.

356
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,210
Director Cho likes Ms. Yoo.

357
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,110
Well, he can't make his move on her
because she's involved with you.

358
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,450
But he's the son of the chairman.

359
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,020
If he wants something, I'm sure
nothing will stop him from pursuing it.

360
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,550
Hey, stop it. Stop talking nonsense.

361
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,760
If you have time to talk nonsense,
you should have one more drink.

362
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,430
You insolent girl! Where have you been?

363
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Your Highness,
I had to deal with those thugs.

364
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,770
What? Tell me how you handled them.

365
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,440
I completely destroyed them.

366
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,850
Let me award you a big present.

367
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,150
Hurry and give me a high-five.

368
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,220
Gosh.

369
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,420
Your Highness,
why don't you take that off now?

370
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,220
If you want me to take it off, I will.

371
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,260
Cut! Let's stop there. That was perfect.

372
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,490
Did my acting improve?

373
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,630
Yes, of course. Hey, nothing happened
while I was away, right?

374
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,830
Didn't you have customers?

375
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,470
A lot of guys came in,
but they left without buying anything.

376
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,600
Hey, you and I are different.

377
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,700
Come on.

378
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,470
Hey, there was an awful customer,
but he left.

379
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,510
An awful customer?
There was an awful customer?

380
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,080
Whatever. Forget it.

381
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,150
On top of that, there was a lady
who had a total crush on me.

382
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,020
What are you talking about?

383
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,590
It's true. She had really high standards.

384
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,690
I told her that I wasn't into girls.

385
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,630
I had to comfort and reason with her.
It was so hard to send her away.

386
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,460
Hey, have a cool can of beer.

387
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,860
No beer for me. Instead of drinking this,

388
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,430
you should drink expensive liquor,
so our sales go up.

389
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,740
You're breaking my heart.

390
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,040
-Drink some more, so our sales go up.
-Seriously?

391
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,670
-Hey, Saet-byul.
-Mr. Choi, you're back.

392
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,610
Hey, you with curly hair.

393
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,480
You should go now. Clean up before you go.

394
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,380
-Hey, you.
-Make sure you pay!

395
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,020
Did you come back because you missed me?
Do you know what I did today?

396
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,880
Of course, I do.

397
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,490
You must have gotten my package.
Give me the package.

398
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,020
And this is for you.

399
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,660
-What's that?
-It's hotteok.

400
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,260
-Hotteok?
-Give me my package.

401
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,360
Goodness. Whose package is this?

402
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,230
Let's see. All right.

403
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,510
Saet-byul, what do you think?

404
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,040
It's nice. You have good eyes.
Who is that for?

405
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,810
"Father, it's a gift from me."

406
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,420
"My gosh, Dae-hyun. You know me so well."

407
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,020
"This is perfect for me. I love it."

408
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,390
What are you doing?

409
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,460
You said that was for your father.
So I was pretending to be your father.

410
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,790
Hey, this is... Forget it.
You don't have to know.

411
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Wait, Mr. Choi. If this is a present,
you should remove the tag.

412
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,800
Yes, you're right. Thank you.

413
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,670
Throw this out for me.

414
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,970
-Throw it out?
-Yes.

415
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,740
It's...

416
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,510
Hey, Yeon-joo.

417
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,480
[Hey, Dae-hyun.
I was just about to call you.]

418
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,650
Really? Why?

419
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,490
That darn Yeon-joo.

420
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,230
I told you to fire that part-timer before.

421
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,030
I think I overstepped.

422
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,930
I will respect your decision.

423
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Why did you have a sudden change of heart?

424
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,040
I only told you that because I was worried
about her safety as a woman.

425
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,110
So don't mind me. Just be nice to her.

426
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,710
Teach her about the store and how to
run the transactions on the phone.

427
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,110
She's good at her job.

428
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,810
Oh, right. Why did you call me?

429
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,150
Oh, right. Yeon-joo, isn't tomorrow

430
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,920
your father's birthday?

431
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,650
Yes, how do you know that?

432
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,790
Of course, I know. I know everything.

433
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,820
After hearing that last year from you,

434
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,190
I marked the date,
so I can say hello to your dad.

435
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,460
I see. I didn't know.

436
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,700
Dae-hyun.

437
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,840
My dad hasn't been feeling well lately.
He wants a small family gathering

438
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,040
at home.

439
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,240
I see. At home?

440
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,340
Okay, then.

441
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,480
I guess I won't be able to meet
your dad again, right?

442
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,880
I'm sorry.
I'll try to introduce you to him soon.

443
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,580
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry. I'm okay.

444
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,020
Just help your dad feel better.

445
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,020
That's the most important thing.
We can meet next time.

446
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,030
Okay. You should hang up first.

447
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,830
Okay, Yeon-joo.

448
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,630
What's wrong? Your girlfriend
doesn't want to meet up?

449
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,770
Why did you eavesdrop?

450
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,970
What? I wasn't eavesdropping!

451
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,540
You were talking to her so loudly
right in front of the counter.

452
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,110
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

453
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,680
Hey, I'm going to refund...

454
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,980
Oh, no. Why did you rip this?

455
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,250
You told me to throw this out.

456
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,350
No.

457
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,190
-Piece them back together.
-What?

458
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,020
-Piece them back together.
-How can I do that?

459
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,930
I don't know. Just make it work.

460
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,130
You have to piece them back together.

461
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,260
Me?

462
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,600
Hey, Jin-young.

463
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,770
As it so happens,
my plans tomorrow got canceled.

464
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,770
So I can make it to the reunion.

465
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,640
Where is that again?

466
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,010
[It's in Pyeongchang-dong.]

467
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,710
[There's a Chinese restaurant
near Professor Kim's house.]

468
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,520
I see. Pyeongchang-dong?
Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye.

469
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,120
Why does it have to be
in Pyeongchang-dong?

470
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,560
Dad! Dad.

471
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,830
What?

472
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,060
Where are you going?

473
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,400
I just bought bean sprouts.

474
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,770
Your mother wants to have
bean sprout soup tomorrow morning.

475
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,270
-Bye.
-Okay.

476
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,940
Dad.

477
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,010
What?

478
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,120
Dad, do you want to have a drink with me?

479
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,420
No, I'm good.

480

-The next time we meet,

650

Why are you sitting here?

703
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,370
You asked me for a new menu.

704
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,010
So this time,
I plan to try something with noodles.

705

You know my Oh Gamja Cheese French Fries
are really popular, right?

706

If you plan to do something with noodles,
make it spicy.

707

They say Koreans get their energy

It looks like someone got you good.

711
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,800
Make sure you add enough toppings

712
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,430
so that it'll be filling.

713
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,040
Toppings? How about chicken breasts
or sausages?

714
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,000
Sausages are too artificial.

715
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,170
And chicken breasts are too dry.

716
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,380
Then what should I add?

717
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,110
Why are you asking me?
It's your job to come up with it.

to come up with a new menu.

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,450
Well, yes. I have time.

798
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,790
-Where should we meet?
-He must have a date.

799
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,620
I knew he had a girlfriend.

800
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,830
No, my son doesn't have a girlfriend.

801
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,830
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

802
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,470
Can I have my phone back?
See you next time.

803
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,770
-Bye.
-Bye.

804
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,140
I think there's a misunderstanding.
My son doesn't...

805
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,040
I can't believe he had a girlfriend.

806
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,440
-I'm so disappointed.
-He even liked my post.

807
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,410
-Let's go.
-But... My goodness.

808
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,610
-What's going on?
-My son doesn't have a girlfriend.

809
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,780
What happened? Why? Where...
Where did they all go?

810
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,820
They all just left, you punk.

811
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,520
Couldn't you answer the phone
a little later?

812
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,990
They're the only customers we get
during the afternoon.

813
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,390
You're such an idiot!

814
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,360
Mom, I'll work twice as hard tomorrow.

815
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,290
I need to meet Yeon-joo right now.

816
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,800
-What?
-Saet-byul is busy today,

817
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,000
so Dal-sik will be here instead.

818
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,630
Stay here until he comes. Bye, Mom.

819
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
You little...

820
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,440
My goodness. What a pathetic punk.

821
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,640
He's like a dog
wagging its tail for its owner.

822
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,840
Darn it. We're done for today.

823
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,410
Yeon-joo, you don't like
sausage stew that much.

824
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,880
Do you have something to say?

825
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,420
Remember how we promised
not to keep secrets from each other?

826
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,490
Yes.

827
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,190
You know Director Cho Seung-joon, right?

828
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,860
He was at my dad's birthday party.

829
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,460
He had dinner with us

830
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,400
and even had wine with us at our house.

831
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,800
Right. Yeon-joo--

832
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,470
To be honest, we knew each other
before you were even born.

833
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,040
Both our dads are really close,
so we were friends since we were born.

834
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,210
You were friends with Director Cho,
the chairman's son,

835
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,110
ever since you guys were young?

836
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,720
But don't get mistaken.
I got the job because I deserved it.

837
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,750
I got offers
from a lot of other companies.

838
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,950
But I chose to work here
because I liked the company's vision.

839
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,060
No wonder.

840
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,730
No wonder he seemed to be on your level.

841
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
I get it now.
It's because you guys are friends.

842
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,830
I guess it's not a big deal
if you guys are friends.

843
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,810
The look on your face
after seeing my parents with Director Cho.

844
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,310
[Did I get caught?]

845
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,510
I tried to imagine it.

846
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,950
I figured you'd be upset if you found out.

847
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,520
Anyway, what matters
is that it's not a big deal.

848
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,790
I did nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

849
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,490
Why are you telling me this all of sudden?

850
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,460
I trust you.

851
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,000
I have so much faith in you,
so you didn't need to tell me.

852
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,160
But I'm grateful
that you opened up to me about it.

853
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,700
So be good to me. And don't get any ideas.

854
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,640
-No, don't add the noodles.
-Got it.

855
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,410
I don't like it when the soup gets thick.

856
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,810
I offered to eat sausage stew,
so it's your turn to yield.

857
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,850
[Yeon-joo was honest with me,
but I was a coward.]

858
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,850
[I couldn't tell her
that I was there that night]

859
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,490
[or that I didn't like the fact
that she's friends with Director Cho.]

860
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,560
[And suddenly,
I felt like a block of instant noodles.]

861
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,560
[Yeon-joo, her parents, and Director Cho]

862
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,330
[were like a good combination]

863
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,100
[of ham, rice cakes, and vegetables
boiling in the same pot.]

864
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,200
[And I just felt like]

865
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,340
[a block of hard instant noodles
that couldn't join them.]

866
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,110
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

867
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,480
Look at me with those eyes.

868
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,050
Hello, everyone.

869
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,480
Welcome to Munich Bar.

870
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,120
-Hello.
-He was always like that.

871
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,860
-Yes, you're right.
-We're newly opened. We have great food.

872
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,190
Welcome. Our bar just opened.

873
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,290
-The food here is great.
-When did it change?

874
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,060
You're right. I guess we haven't been here
in a long time. Let's go somewhere else.

875
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,630
-Yeon-joo.
-If you spend more than...

876
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,730
Don't you want to see
if our seat is still there?

877
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,740
The food here is very good.
You should come visit.

878
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,870
-Let's check it out.
-I'm not sure.

879
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,340
-Let's go.
-Welcome. The food here is great.

880
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,210
Thank you. Come inside.

881
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
The food here is really good. Come inside.

882
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,150
This place has changed completely.

883
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,920
-You're right.
-Yes.

884
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,720
-Should we sit here?
-Sure.

885
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,950
Our seat is gone.

886
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,520
-Exactly.
-Yes.

887
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,120
The waiter is here.

888
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,330
Yeon-joo, should we have just one drink?

889
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,630
Sure, that's fine with me.
You can order whatever.

890
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,060
"Whatever"? Okay.

891
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,740
Do we get two glasses of beer
if we order the set menu?

892
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,600
-Yes.
-Then we'll have Set A.

893
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,070
-Okay, Set A.
-Thank you.

894
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,440
It comes with chicken
and some dried pollack.

895
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,110
-Does it sound okay?
-Yes.

896
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,710
-Welcome.
-Hello.

897
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,550
-Hey, you're here.
-Hey.

898
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,320
-What did you order?
-Have a seat.

899
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,390
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

900
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,560
Welcome.

901
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,730
I'll take what I usually order, honey.

902
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,830
We opened today.

903
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,900
I was just kidding.

904
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,040
Normally,
I'd ask for the bottle I left behind,

905
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,940
but this looks like a cheap bar,
so that won't sound right.

906
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,310
Honey, what do you want to eat?
I'll get you anything you want.

907
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,650
Geum-bi, stop it.

908
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,450
What? I'm just trying to have fun.

909
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,280
Honey, isn't this fun?

910
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:28,220
You're the only one having fun.
The worker doesn't find it amusing at all.

911
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,890
I bet he wants to punch you in the face,

912
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,830
take your eyeballs out,
and just chew on them.

913
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,670
Isn't that right?

914
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,740
What would you like?

915
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,270
We'll order Set A
and an extra glass of beer.

916
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,870
Okay, Set A.

917
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,280
-See you later, honey.
-Hey.

918
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,210
-What?
-Your face scared him off.

919
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,480
-This is called love.
-Are you going to come here tomorrow?

920
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,750
I'm going to come here tomorrow.

921
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,190
Yeon-joo, I'll be withdrawing
my installment savings soon.

922
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,320
And I still have
the housing subscription account I made

923
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,020
when I first got hired at our company.

924
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,860
Why are you telling me that?

925
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,830
You know, they say guys become mature
once they get married.

926
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,360
I disagree with that.

927
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,230
They should be mature to begin with.

928
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,300
It's useless to force oneself
to grow up after marriage.

929
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,370
Yes, you do have a point.

930
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,740
-But considering our age--
-Hello.

931
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,870
We're here to promote a product.

932
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,080
-Yeon-joo, this is--
-What's this?

933
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,850
It's a product made by
a convenience store brand.

934
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,950
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

935
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,590
[A totally different...]

936
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,520
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes...

937
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,790
It maximizes your energy
and gets rid of your hangover.

938
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,400
Okay, great.

939
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

940
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,470
Yeon-joo, isn't this the product
you worked on?

941
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,000
Are they promoting the product
or boycotting it?

942
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,410
Don't be like that.
She just got it all mixed up.

943
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,040
-"It gets rid of--"
-Dae-hyun.

944
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,680
Hello!

945
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,810
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

946
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,850
It contains herbal medicine,
so it's great for your body!

947
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,320
-It's great!
-Let's go.

948
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,360
-Sir.
-Yes?

949
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,690
You need to give us one more.

950
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,690
-Oh, there are two of you.
-There are two people.

951
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,230
What are you talking about?
There are three...

952
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,660
Where did she go?

953
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,830
Just give us one more.

954
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,340
-Okay, great!
-Great!

955
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,210
-Let's go.
-Okay.

956
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,050
What just happened?

957
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,150
-Is he your ex-boyfriend?
-Are you nuts?

958
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,550
I used to do that before I got a job
at the convenience store.

959
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,760
-Then why did you hide?
-You idiot.

960
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,360
-Is your brain an ornament?
-Yes, I think so.

961
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,560
He's only working with that fool
because Saet-byul is

962
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,560
no longer available.

963
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:52,230
You really know
how it feels not to have much.

964
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,740
-Did you visit your dad?
-Yes.

965
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,480
-Did Eun-byul go too?
-Yes.

966
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,240
How is she doing? Is she doing okay?

967
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,050
Why wouldn't she be doing okay?

968
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,050
She's being raised by a great sister.

969
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,280
I miss Eun-byul.

970
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,550
You can come see her at my house.
She's probably sleeping right now.

971
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,230
♫ That's what life is all about ♫

972
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,530
♫ Everyone is born empty-handed ♫

973
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,100
♫ Life is all about the present moment ♫

974
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,300
♫ Amor fati ♫

975
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,380
♫ Amor fati ♫

976
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,010
♫ Amor fati ♫

977
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,890
[It was perfect!]

978
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,360
[Nice one!]

979
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,360
Hey, I got a perfect score.

980
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,900
Will you forgive my friends now?

981
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,370
Consider yourselves lucky
for having such a good friend.

982
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,810
Eun-byul, you're an amazing singer.

983
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,570
You should become an idol star.

984
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,880
She's going to audition.

985
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:17,150
Really? You guys,
why don't we take a group photo

986
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,050
to wish her good luck on her audition?

987
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,760
-Gather together. Come here.
-Okay.

988
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,520
Get on your knees.

989
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,490
Hey, get out of there. Come here.

990
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,660
Eun-byul, you're a star. Get up.

991
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,700
You're going to be an idol star,
so strike a pose and put your foot there.

992
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,970
Place it on her leg.

993
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,900
Make it look natural. Smile for me.

994
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,270
-Let's keep it natural.
-Good job.

995
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,340
Smile.

996
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,210
If we upload this on social media
after you become famous,

997
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,950
it'll cause a pretty big issue.

998
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,850
"Jung Eun-byul,
an idol star who used to be a bully."

999
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,420
Yes, exactly. There are tons of idol stars
who totally messed up their careers

1000
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,190
for being a bully in the past
regardless of how hard they worked.

1001
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,630
If anyone gets in the way of her success,
I'll teach that person a lesson.

1002
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,370
Eun-byul, don't worry about a thing.
Just work hard

1003
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,840
and make a lot of money.

1004
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Okay, thank you.

1005
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,610
Let's split your income by half.

1006
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,810
My dream is to make tons of money
by becoming a talent agent.

1007
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,920
What are you laughing about?

1008
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,160
Hey, you'd better work hard.

1009
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,220
-Okay.
-Okay.

1010
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,230
I heard Joon opened up a bar nearby.

1011
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,430
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1012
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,470
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

1013
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,300
Come on. Please?

1014
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,670
I need to see your IDs.

1015
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,070
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1016
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,910
I swear we're not underage.

1017
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,410
Then show me your ID.

1018
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,650
This is totally killing the mood.

1019
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,350
Gosh, I'm serious.
Didn't you bring your ID?

1020
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,920
-No, I didn't.
-We just didn't bring our IDs.

1021
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,090
What is this? Who asked for this song?

1022
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,920
It's my dad's song.

1023
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,060
I was going to request it first.
You beat me to it.

1024
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,770
What kind of a song is this?
It doesn't suit the place at all.

1025
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,040
Why? I like it.

1026
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,370
This song is really touching.
It makes you tear up.

1027
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,940
Then I'll leave you to cry.
I need to go to the bathroom.

1028
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,350
Okay.

1029
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,020
-Gosh, this is so annoying.
-My gosh.

1030
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,320
Excuse me.

1031
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,990
Can't you see that we're talking?
Do you have no manners?

1032
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,960
Either crawl under my arm
or just use another path.

1033
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,860
She's so annoying.

1034
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,870
I'll come back next time for a drink.

1035
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,870
Let me use the bathroom though.

1036
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,240
Okay, I'll be right there.

1037
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,760
Go smoke outside.

1038
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,560
What's wrong with this?

1039
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,630
I want to smoke, but I can't.

1040
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,700
I can't light up a cigarette
because my shoulder hurts.

1041
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,210
Do you know why? Because you hit
my shoulder and broke my collarbone.

1042
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,670
What?

1043
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,480
Are you talking to me
like I'm your friend?

1044
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,080
You'll have to pay for my treatment,
compensation,

1045
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,520
and the alcohol I didn't get to drink.

1046
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,960
You at least owe me 1,000 dollars.

1047
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,130
My gosh!

1048
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,460
What do you think you're doing?

1049
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,060
Do you have a death wish?

1050
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,160
Why are you doing this?

1051
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,830
I heard your boss has a girlfriend.

1052
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,670
You should teach him a lesson
for cheating on you.

1053
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,040
No, technically speaking,
he didn't cheat on her.

1054
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,940
She may have liked him first,
but she never got to make him hers.

1055
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,280
That's such a cheap expression,

1056
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,350
but it's very easy to understand.

1057
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:09,180
Hey, forget it.

1058
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,720
Daily Guru told me
I'll get a boyfriend this year,

1059
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,120
so mind your own business.

1060
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:18,060
And he'd be crazy
to not fall for a beauty like me.

1061
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,100
Sometimes, I'm worried
that she actually thinks she's pretty.

1062
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,870
-Then am I not pretty?
-No, you're not.

1063
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,340
You only come in second
among all three of us.

1064
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,640
Then who's the ugliest?

1065
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,580
Gosh, come on.
Don't make me say it out loud.

1066
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,010
Why? Because it's you?

1067
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,510
Don't you have a mirror at home?

1068
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,920
You guys can choose who's the ugliest
until I come back from the bathroom.

1069
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,790
Personally, I think both of you
come in last.

1070
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:47,850
Get lost. Just go and poop.

1071
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,460
-Use another bathroom.
-What?

1072
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
Can you move? I really need to go.

1073
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,270
Then just do it here.

1074
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,040
What are you glaring at?

1075
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,470
Do you want to get beaten up
or just leave quietly?

1076
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,940
-You'll really regret it.
-My gosh.

1077
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,550
Come on. Let's make it quick.
I'm really tired right now.

1078
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,950
You hurt me, so you need to pay for that.

1079
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,520
-You must be out of your mind.
-Unbelievable.

1080
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,430
I don't want your phone.
I want your money. Give me money.

1081
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,070
No one is around to help you,
so hurry up and give me money.

1082
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,580
Hey, I don't care what you're doing,
but take it outside.

1083
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,480
You can't just hog the bathroom like this.

1084
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,190
Where do you think you're going?

1085
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,260
Did... Did you do that to my friends?

1086
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,720
Why? Do you need a beating as well?

1087
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,330
Go ahead and try if you can.

1088
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,760
Where are you going? Just stay inside.

1089
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,230
Stay right there. Everything will be fine.

1090
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,000
You'll get hurt, so stay inside.

1091
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,180
Hey, Yeon-joo.

1092
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,220
What? Where?

1093
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,560
[They normally
don't get beaten up like that.]

1094
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,860
I guess you're here with a big group.

1095
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,800
Can't you see that I'm here by myself?
You must be pretty intimidated.

1096
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,100
No, I'm not.

1097
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,870
Oh, hello.

1098
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,070
You little... What just happened?

1099
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,210
Where is it?

1100
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,240
What the...

1101
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,680
-Will you please come out?
-Why are you doing this to me?

1102
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:58,280
Why do you think?
I really need to go to the bathroom.

1103
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,820
-Stop it.
-Yeon-joo!

1104
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,960
-Gosh, please get out.
-Stop it.

01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,160
-Yeon-joo, are you okay? What happened?
-I don't know.

1106
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,300
-Gosh, what was that?
-What happened?

1107
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,070
Mr. Choi?

01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,640
Saet-byul.

01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,340
Who?

01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,340
What the... What happened?
She's our part-timer.

The girl you told me to be nice to.

1112
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,450

"Yeon-joo"?
