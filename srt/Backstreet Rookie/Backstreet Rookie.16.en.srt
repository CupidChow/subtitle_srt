It's really urgent for me.
It's really important.

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,820
Could you at least tell me the last
four digits of another victim's number?

96
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,220
I'll take this since you're so desperate,

97
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,990
but no. Now, get going.

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,490
Just this once.

99
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560

Okay, Dae-hyun. Bye.

-Yes.

Hold on.

106
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,710
Saet-byul has moments like this,

107
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,450
but she always comes back.

108

Why did you call me here?

111
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,960
The reason I wanted to see you

112
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,060
is because I got a call from my dad.

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,600
He wants me to go on a blind date.

114
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,230
A blind date? Are you so old
that you should have an arranged marriage?

115
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,530
Are you that old?

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,930
No, I'm not. We're about the same age.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,300
We really are.

118
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,470
But my dad says
that marriage makes a man stable.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,680
That's why I told him
that I have a girlfriend.

120
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,840
And then?

121
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,110
Then, Dad said

122
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,720
-that he's going to kill me.
-What?

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,250
He thinks I've become a liar
since moving to Seoul.

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,020
Maybe he'll believe you
if he sees me in person.

125
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,590
Geum-bi!

126
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,990
Let's visit him tomorrow.

127
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,260
-Tomorrow?
-Yes!

128
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,530
If I had love in my heart,

129
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,840
I'd want the expiration date to be
10,000 years away.

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Dal-sik!

131
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,210
Just call me 10,000 Years.

132
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,570
Hwang 10,000 Years.

133
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,240
No, that doesn't sound good at all.

134
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't want to call you that.

135
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,100
2, 3!

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
Give it here.

137
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,159

-Do you want to go play some pool?
-Sure.

141
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,850
What was that?

142
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,950
You can't just go like that.

143
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,650
Anyone that gets on my nerves around here
is dead.

144
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,690
You're a clueless girl, aren't you?

145
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Of course. I'm new here.

146
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,060
Not that I want to know.

147
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,530
Okay. Are you a fighter?

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,930
Fine. Come at me.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hey!

150
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,010
-My arm!
-Money.

151

You're dead.

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,020
Are you okay?

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,450
Here. Now you can buy your books.

154
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,060
Darn it. Who do you think you are?

155

162

Maybe I should've minded my own business.

163
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,880

Gosh.

170
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
All right.

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,970
Let's eat.

172
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,540
It's good, isn't it?

173
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,150
I told you that I was great
at making ramyeon!

174
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,650
I have to admit it's good.

175
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,590
Mr. Choi's ramyeon was delicious.

Where's your dad?

180
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,940
He's probably working at the fields
right now.

181

-Hello.
-Hello.

182

-Dal-sik, you're back!
-Yes.

Hello.

What are you doing?

185

It's the dance my dad used to dance
back in the day.

-Really?
-Like this.

Hello, sir!

My name is Hwang Geum-bi.

190

I'm just an assistant to the chairman.

Sir, you're back.

-Hello, how have you been?
-I've been great.

-Where's Dad?
-Right this way.

194

Look at her. I wasn't lying.

198

Hello, sir. My name is Hwang Geum-bi.

199

Nice to see you!

200
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm Dal-sik's dad, Han Man-pyeong.

201
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Go over there and have some of the thing.

202
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,180
Here's some watermelon.

-Enjoy.
-Thank you!

Dad, how is farming these days?

206
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,490
I'm not the one farming.

207
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,120
Mother Nature does all the work.

208
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
How are the cows growing?

209
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,190
I'm not the one raising them.

210
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,690
Nature raises them.

211
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,000
What about the orchard?

212
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,260
I'm not the one growing the fruits.

213
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,300
The land grows them.

214
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,640
My dad is not the best talker.

215
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,800
Stop it.

216
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,170
At least you spray
all the pesticides yourself.

217

I'm not the one spraying the pesticides.

[What? He even owns a helicopter?]

220
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,750
Speaking of which, where is it?

221
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,180
Where did you park the helicopter?

222
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,320
We built a new helicopter pad over there.

223
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,220
There's our helicopter.

224
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,560
How do you get up there?

225
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,060
We're going to build cable cars soon.

226
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,170
[What? Cable cars?]

227

[How crazy rich is he?]

228
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,840

229
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,140
Where?

230
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,640
Everything after we passed the tollbooths

231
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,250
to all the fields you see here.

232
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,310
That's all our land.

233
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,190
She's a guest. Don't make her feel
uncomfortable by talking like that.

234
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,690
It's barely the size
of a grasshopper's forehead.

235
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
You're right. It's the size
of a grasshopper's forehead.

236
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,630
Geum-bi, what does your father do?

237
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,160
Yes, well,

238
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,900
he runs a very small education business.

239
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,100
It's very small.

240
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,100
An educator!

241
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,540
Such good work he's doing.

242
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,110
Sir, I came here to tell you

243
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,710
that Dal-sik doesn't need to go
on blind dates.

244
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,740
Goodness.

245
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,280
How did a beautiful woman like you meet
someone so pathetic like my son?

246
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,650
Dal-sik doesn't need a blind date,

247
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,690
but Geum-bi, you do.

248
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,420
I know the best eligible bachelor

249
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,820
here in Onyang.

250
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,760
Dad, stop talking nonsense!

251
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,630
This is exactly why I don't bring
anyone here.

252
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,730
You think you can get married?

253
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,040
Since it's rush hour,
let's take the helicopter instead.

254
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,940
That's the helicopter pad.

255
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,080
Thank you. This is my first time
riding a helicopter.

256
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,650
Dal-sik, it's time for you
to quit the thing and do the thing.

257
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,780
[Translation: Dal-sik, it's time for you
to stop drawing webtoons]

[and come home to learn the business.]

259
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,280
No, I'm just like you.
I have to make it on my own.

260
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,820
There will be no soup for you
if you keep this up.

261
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,690
I always liked the vegetables in soup
more than the soup itself,

262
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,390
so you can have all the soup, Dad.

263
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,070
Geum-bi, I think you're all the things
and whatnot.

264

[Translation: Geum-bi,
you're so kind and beautiful,]

Sorry?

267

He's saying that he likes you
because you're so kind and beautiful.

268
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,080
Do you know how to do the thing?

269
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,510
Sorry?

270
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,450
Isn't that Saet...

271
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,880
Dal-sik, your dad is talking!

272
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,420
They say if it's not good,
it's not the end.

273
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,560
Geum-bi, you're really great.

274
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,260
Stop!

-Goodness.
-I'll come with you!

277
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,970
Over there.

278

-Duck!
-Ducking.

279
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,540
-You really saw Saet-byul?
-Yes, I did.

280
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,640
I have the eyes of a hawk, 20-20 vision.

281

Where?

282
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,110
Where do I go?

283

Geum-bi, where are you?

284
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,420
I'm right here.

285

My goodness.

286
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,860
I can't tell you apart from the flowers,
not even with my hawk's eyes.

287
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,700
-Goodness, you!
-Don't scare me like that.

288
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,000
Come on.

My goodness!

291
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,080
-Why?
-As a cartoonist,

292
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,880
I know that it'll be much more dramatic

293
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,980
if Dae-hyun appeared instead of us.

294
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,780
I see.

295
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,890
Why did she come all the way here?

296
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,690
-My family owns this property, too.
-Really?

297
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,359
Our property starts--

298
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,890
I get it. Call Dae-hyun already.

299
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,000
Why is she all the way here in Onyang?

300
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,970
I can't understand her.

301
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,510
Dae-hyun, don't be surprised
and just listen to me.

302
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,910
Saet-byul is working at my family's farm.

303
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,980
Send me the address. Thank you.

-Who are you?
-Are you a thief?

310

There's a thief in Shinseong-dong now
because I'm not around for a few days?

-Get him.
-How was your trip?

312

Are you okay?

314

He's the new owner of the store!

-Yes.

-My gosh.
-You sold the convenience store?

No, Dae-hyun is now working
at the headquarters.

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,100
And we told Jang-mi
about how you're doing.

329
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,470
Did you?

330
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,640
You guys.

331
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,280
Oh, right. We have a present for you.

332
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,440
What's this?

333
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,980
This is awesome!

334
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,420
It'll just make you want to go like this.

335
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,950
Mr. Choi?

336
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,820
How did you get here?

337
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,190
What do you mean, how?

338
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,860
You found me, so what makes you think
that I wouldn't be able to find you?

339
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,330
Hey, Jung Saet-byul.
Why did you lie to me?

340
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,400
This isn't the end for you and I.

341
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,770
This is the start.

342
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,740
It's all set and done.

343
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,510
I'm busy.

344
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,780
Saet-byul...

345
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,580
Why is it raining?

346
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,090
Are you the guy who broke
my little brother's arm?

347
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,830
No, it's the lady over there.

348
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,500
What? You got beat up by a girl?

349
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,130
How embarrassing. You idiot!

350
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,170
Gosh!

351
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,970
Saet-byul, what's going on?
Did something happen?

352
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,270
No.

353
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,080
I was just helping someone out.

354
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Excuse me,

355
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,180
we're having a really important talk
right now.

356
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,520
I don't think this is a good way
to talk to us.

357
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,260
Do you mind leaving?

358
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,760
Do I hear a Seoul dog barking?

359
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,360
You two can talk all you want

360
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,900
as you die.

361
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Saet-byul, choose.

362
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,210
-Sorry?
-If you choose number one,

363
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,410
you'll see a completely new side of me.

364
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,480
If you choose number two,

365
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,010
you'll see the man you've known.

366
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,250
The choice is yours.

367
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,950
Well...

368
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,820
Don't think about it too much.
Just choose.

369
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,990
Mr. Choi,

370
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,630
I'll go with number one.

371
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,530
Good choice.

but an untrained street fighter.]

[I'll hit him back with a counterpunch.]

378
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,570
Mr. Choi! He's so cool.

379
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,280
[Here comes the 1, 2, straight,
as I predicted.]

381

-Mr. Choi!
-What was that?

382
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,960
Mr. Choi?

383
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,830
Are you okay?

384
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,990
-Mr. Choi!
-Is that it?

385
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,600
I've never seen such a wuss before.

386
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,870
Did you see that?
I can't believe I was slightly scared.

387
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,440
How dare you hurt Mr. Choi?

388
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,770
Mr. Choi, hold on. Okay?

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,140
Breathe!

390
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,820
I'm the boss here. Get her.

391
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,520
Come at me.

392
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,970
What was that? Come on.

393
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,800
How dare you?

394
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,510
Don't you dare get in my way again.

395
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,340
Okay! Let me go.

396
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,420
-Mr. Choi!
-Gosh.

397
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,750
What are you doing? Get out quick!

398
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,420
Go!

399
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,890
Mr. Choi, are you okay?

400
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,190
They're all gone. Wake up.

401
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,290
Mr. Choi?

402
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,130
Hey!

403
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,330
Where did they all go?

404
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,530
Where are they?

405
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,930
They all ran away
because they're scared of you.

406
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,470
What? I scared them away?

407
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,140
Those kids.

408
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,440
They're smart ones.

409
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,480
Kids are so smart these days.

410
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,310
I'm totally fine.

411
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,620
-Is your face okay?
-I'm not hurt at all.

412

I think your jaw is crooked.

413
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,990
I'm fine.

414
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,330
That was a close call. For them.

415
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,480
It's nice here.

416
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,610
I thought of

417
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,780
about 100 questions,

418
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,890
no, 500 questions to ask you
on my way here,

419
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,190
but I'm not going to ask you any of them.

420
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,930
I saw that you're here,

421
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,260
and that you're doing well.

422

-Wait for who?
-You, Saet-byul.

425
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,250
I'm going to wait for you to come back.

426
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,720
And I'm going to wait for you
to answer my question.

427
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,820
-Mr. Choi...
-Saet-byul,

428
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,360
don't change your address officially.

429
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,160
You're family to us.

430
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,630
I'll collect all of your mail
and keep them safe,

431
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,800
so don't worry.

432
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,770
I'm not going to call or text you
from now on.

433

Of course,

434
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,210
well,

435
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,980
if you happen to text first, I'll respond.

436

Goodness.

437
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,690

438
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,120
Don't I smell good?

439
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,090
I put on the perfume that you got me.

440
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,070
I'll get going now.

at Taekwondo, ten years ago.

442
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,980
You thanked me back then, right?

443
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,720
I loved hearing that.

444
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,390
I started helping others
only after hearing that.

445
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
So, thank you, Saet-byul.

446
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,940
I'll wait for you.

447

448
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,110

nor call?

456
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,300
Is he saying that he'll wait for me
or not?

457
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,670

from the consultant's position?
