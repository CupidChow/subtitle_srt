00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,020
I don't want your phone.
I want your money. Give me money.

6
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,600
Hey, I don't care what you're doing,
but take it outside.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,470
You can't just hog the bathroom like this.

8
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,140
Where do you think you're going?

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,810
Did... Did you do that to my friends?

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,240
Why? Do you need a beating as well?

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,910
Go ahead and try if you can.

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,150
Where are you going? Just stay inside.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,920
Stay right there. Everything will be fine.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,590
You'll get hurt, so stay inside.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,830
I guess you're here with a big group.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,860
Can't you see that I'm here by myself?
You must be pretty intimidated.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,060
No, I'm not.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,830
Oh, hello.

19
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,240
You little... What just happened?

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,340
You're safe now. You can come out.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,180
You can come out now. It's safe.

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,980
Why are you doing this to me?

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,650
Why do you think?
I really need to go to the bathroom.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,360
Get out already!

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,190
My goodness, I need to go!

26
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,460
You're so stubborn. Come out already!

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,600
-Come out now.
-I'm fine.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,070
-Gosh, please get out.
-Yeon-joo!

29
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,240
Stop it!
Yeon-joo, are you okay? What happened?

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,340
-What happened?
-I don't know.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,810
-Gosh, what was that?
-Are you okay? What happened?

32
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,740
Mr. Choi?

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,380
Jung Saet-byul?

34
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,050
Who?

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,120
She's the part-timer at my store.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,620
She's the part-timer?

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,350
Yeon-joo?

38
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,060
What happened?
What are you two doing here?

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,130
What are you doing here, then?
This is a women's bathroom.

40
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeon-joo, are you okay?

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,940
Do I look okay to you?

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,410
Saet-byul, what are you doing here?

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,010
-Sorry?
-Why are you beating people up?

44
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,920
No, it's not what it looks like.

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,250
Then what is it? What happened?
Did Yeon-joo do it?

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,190
No.

47
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,690
Excuse me.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,390
Tell him that I saved you.
I wasn't bullying you.

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,360
How would I know that?

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,270
I saved you from getting beaten up!

51
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,600
Jung Saet-byul! Are you threatening her?

52
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,510
-Mr. Choi, why don't you listen--
-Whatever.

53
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,880
You told me that you have a family thing
and you're fighting at a bar?

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,080
Is this all that you are?

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,020
I'm so disappointed in you.
Yeon-joo, let's get out of here.

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,450
We'll talk about this later.

57
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,390
Are you okay?

58
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,560
Darn it.

59
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,760
Isn't that Saet-byul's boss?

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,340
You're right, it's the stingy boss.
She must be his girlfriend.

61
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,010
What kind of a convenience store
has an owner and a part-timer

62
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,880
who don't even watch the store?

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,380
Do you think Saet-byul saw them?

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,020
I feel so much better.

65
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,420
Isn't this bar so mediocre?

66
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,160
-Totally.
-I know a better one. Let's go.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,360
Okay? Thank you. Let's go!

68
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,060
Bring my purse for me.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,460
-Let's go.
-Darn it.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,370
[What was that?]

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,140
[It was definitely someone else.]

72
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,410
Jung Saet-byul?

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,950
What are you doing here, then?
This is a women's bathroom.

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
[I don't like her eyes, either.]

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,260
-What's the deal with that part-timer?
-What?

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,260
I don't like the way she looks at you.

77
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,460
It's nothing. She was just surprised
to see me there.

78
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,900
So, what are you going to do?

79
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,130
-About what?
-"About what"?

80
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,630
Do you know how terrified I was?

81
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,240
She fights better than a man!

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,010
She's a strong one, indeed.

83
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,740
How can you hire someone so lowly?

84
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,510
You told me to be nice to her.

85
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,480
That's before I found out
what kind of a person she is!

86
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,680
Are you going to keep her there?

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,990
Remember when I had
a little misunderstanding with her?

88
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,960
I promised her that I'll let her
continue to work at the store.

89
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,630
Is keeping that promise that important?

90
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,200
Even after watching what happened to me
back there?

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,930
Can you imagine what would've happened
if you didn't come for me?

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,940
Should I have gotten hurt back there?
Would you have taken care of it, then?

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,270
Why would you bring me to such a place
and let this happen to me?

94
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,640
Yeon-joo, I'm sorry.
I'm the one who did wrong.

95
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,310
I was hoping that we'd be able
to reminisce our old days there.

96
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,610
Sorry that I made you make
a bad memory of the place

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,320
when I only wanted to reminisce
the good days.

98
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,750
Exactly. We could've just passed by.

99
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,490
Why did we have to drink there?

100
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,960
As a business owner,
I know how bad it feels

101
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,390
to have a customer come in
and just leave after.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,460
Come on. You only think about others.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,970
Don't let this go like the last time.

104
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm serious.

105
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,970
Yeon-joo.

106
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,280
My goodness.

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,390
Some girls were trying to steal money
from that woman,

108
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,720
so I beat them all up.

109
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,590
So, Mr. Choi's girlfriend was getting
beaten up and looted,

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,230
and you saved her but got misunderstood
like an idiot?

111
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,700
Are you a guru or something?

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,170
You're Daily Guru, aren't you?

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,170
You idiot, you didn't say anything?

114
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,050
What would this idiot even say?

115
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,350
I'm fine.

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,450
-Let's keep drinking.
-Drink it up.

117
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,090
Welcome.

118
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,990
You're the customer here.

119
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,360
Really?

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,860
He's looking at us!

121
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,830
-He's looking at your pretty face!
-He is!

122
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,570
Your beautiful face shines
even in the darkness!

You're Saet-byul, right? Jung Saet-byul?

124
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,010
Yes, that's me.

125
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,520
Who is this?

126
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,220
It's me, Kang Ji-wook.

127
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,820
-Goodness!
-No way.

128
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,960
Who's that?

129
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,560
He's Kang Ji-wook the celebrity!

130
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,590
You said that you know someone
with the same name.

131
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,830
Kang Ji-wook?

132
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,900
Yes, your father used to train me.
Don't you remember?

133
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,900
Wait, you're Puppy?

134
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,740
I haven't heard that in so long.
You always used to call me Puppy.

135
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,280
Hey! Puppy!

136
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,280
-Hey!
-Puppy? Puppy who?

137
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,450
Look how much my puppy has grown.

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,060
-She's touching his face!
-She's touching him!

139
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,830
My goodness, she's touching him!

140
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,500
No way. My goodness!

141
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Look how much you've grown.

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,410

143
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,020
[What is she?]

144
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm going to beat someone up
sometime soon, so get ready.

145
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,000
Get ready to fight when I call, okay?

146
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,360
-Okay.
-Okay.

147
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,270
Whatever it takes, I'm going to find her.

148

Let's go.

Hey, kids.

150

You must clean up after yourself.

Gosh, my back hurts.

165
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,320
-Dal-sik.
-Hey, Dae-hyun.

166
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,560
Why do you look so tired?
How are things these days?

167
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,090
It's going well.

168
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,000
The profit drops
when Saet-byul isn't here.

169
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,370
Of course.

170
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,200
Have a good shift. I'll get going.
I'll come back in the morning.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,940
You can eat the expired items.

172
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,110
Thank you.

173
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,380
Hold on, Dae-hyun.

174
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,440
What is it?

175
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,490
A couple of nights ago,
the part-timer girl...

176
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,990
You mean Saet-byul? What about her?

177
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,290
Nothing.

178
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,460
No, but you should know.

179
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,360
But I can't tell you.

180
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,230
Should I tell him or should I not?

181
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,900
I can't decide.

182
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,400
Dal-sik?

183
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
-I saw the part-timer girl...
-Yes?

184
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,440
beat people up.

185
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,610
Jung Saet-byul did?

186
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,180
She completely beat up three men,

187
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,480
and I thought she was a UFC champion.

188
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,550
I thought she was Conor McGregor.

189
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,690
A bunch of weirdos came by just now too.

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,690
Young people are scary these days.

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,920
Are you sure that it was Saet-byul
that you saw?

192
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,660
You know me.

193
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,190
I'm a man of 20-20 vision,
the man of eagle eyes.

194
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,330
Watch.

195
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,170
[-Hey.]
-It's her, right?

196
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,770
[How dare you?]

197
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,510
Why was she beating them up?

198
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,910
I have no idea. Look.

199
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,080
She didn't just do double-flying kicks
and slap their faces.

200
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,910
She had them kneel down
and had a whole talk with them.

201
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,750
She even threatened me to never tell you.

202
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,090
Dae-hyun, please come up to my studio

203
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,190
to check that I'm alive here and there.

204
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,990
I'm too scared.

205
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,690
I'll get going now. Bye.

206
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,670
Dae-hyun, there's a monster
behind that smiling face!

207
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,500
She's a scary one.

208
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,840
Surveillance cameras?

209
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,310
I hope my voice didn't get recorded.

210
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,410
You're too heavy. I'm exhausted.

211
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,350
Driver...

212
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,450
How dare you call me a driver?
Do you have a death wish?

213
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,950
-I really hate you.
-Am I home?

214
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,020
Don't pull my hair!

215
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,660
Sweet dreams, Your Majesty.

216
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,560
Please maintain your dignity,
Your Majesty.

217
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,430
Seriously?

218
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,730
I saw the part-timer girl beat people up.

219
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,190
She even threatened me to never tell you.

220
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,630
How can you hire someone so lowly?

221
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,750
[Choi Dae-hyun,]

222
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,960
[must I have such a bad start to my day
because of a girl like her?]

223
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,590
-Yeon-joo?
-Yes?

224
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,260
-What are you thinking about?
-What do you mean?

225
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,700
-Is something wrong?
-No, it's nothing.

226
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,510
I'm just not feeling hungry today.
I'll get going now.

227
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
We must've had low sales last night.

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,550
-Why?
-Saet-byul had to go home,

229
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,780
so Dal-sik had to replace her.

230
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,020
Is her family okay?

231
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,720
I don't know, and I don't care.

232
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,290
What are you saying?

233
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,420
A boss shouldn't treat
his employee like this!

234
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,890
Don't be like that.

235
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,560
Indeed. Imagine how the store
would've been if it weren't for her.

236
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,730
Don't you know how much the sales have
gone up ever since she started working?

237
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,500
Anybody who works at our store is
like family to us.

238
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,500
How can you not care

239
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,300
about what may be going on in her family?

240
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,740
She's just a temporary part-timer.
That's unnecessary.

241
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,980
We can increase our sales without her.

242
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,940
You think I'm being like this
because of sales?

243
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,350
You really shouldn't be like this.

244
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,950
You're always talking about money.

245
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,220
And who made me like this?

246
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,690
Just be kind to Saet-byul, you punk.

247
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,660
Don't be like that. We don't even know
what kind of a person she is.

248
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm heading to work.

249
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,170
What's wrong with him?

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,170
Isn't it so funny?

251
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,510
How did he manage to finish the whole meal
in the midst of all the nagging?

252
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,380
Perhaps we haven't nagged him enough.

253
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,710
-Good morning, Ms. Yoo.
-We're almost ready for the shoot.

254
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
I see.

255
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
-Did something bad happen to her?
-Let's get going.

256
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,570
Yeon-joo, I'm going to fire
the part-timer today.

257
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,830
I'll also do some interviews
for a new part-timer.

258
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,670
Yes.

259
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,610
So please stop being so mad at me.

260
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,640
I'll make sure that you have
nothing more to worry about.

261
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes.

262
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,180
Good work, Seong-tae and Jeong-ha.

263
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,950
From the morning shoot
to the afternoon training,

264
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,080
we've got a long day ahead of us.
Let's stay strong. Cheers!

265
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,950
What happened in the last five minutes?

266
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,490
She's a completely different person.

267
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,090
My goodness!

268
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,920
Can't you tell?

269
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,690
-What is it?
-What is it?

270
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,960
-It's Choi Dae-hyun.
-What about him?

271
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,560
You guys are so slow.

272
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,210
My head hurts.

273
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,610
I need water.

274
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,650
You told me that you have a family thing
and you're fighting at a bar?

275
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,720
Is this all that you are?

276
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,590
I'm so disappointed in you.

277
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,700
All right, you jerk.

278
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm disappointed in you too,
Choi Dae-hyun!

279
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,640
This is why you need to get to know
someone before you judge them.

280
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,240
Why did I have to fall in love with him
at first sight?

281
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,610
I'm such an idiot!

282
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,620
Yes, I beat people up. So what?

283
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,630
[What's the matter with her?]

284
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,090
And lastly, Scholar Jung Yak-Yong said

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,460
that there are two standards
to judge a human on.

286

[Heart fluttering]

287
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,470
One is the idea of right or wrong,

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,300
and the other is the idea
of benefits and harms.

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm telling you this again
when I've already mentioned it before.

290
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,380
[No!]

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,280
[Gosh!]

292
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,480
What do you think this means?

293
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,180
-It will be on the exam.
-It will be on the exam.

[Hey, what happened yesterday?]

296
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,250
Precisely! This will be

[Hey, what happened yesterday?]

298

-on the exam for sure.
[-Girls, why don't I remember anything?]

299
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,820
-Understood?
-Yes.

300
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,859
Ramyeon is the best hangover food.

[Please let me have your puppy.
I'll pay you handsomely.]

[Right. Your puppy totally]

[Look how brazen you are.]

[It's me, Kang Ji-wook.]

311

Hey, lower your head.
My neck hurts looking up.

312
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,780
My gosh, I even saw you
at the bathhouse back in the day, right?

313
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,790
When?

314
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,420
I saw everything when you came
to the women's bathhouse with your mom.

-Women's bathhouse?
-You saw him?

316
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,390
What did you see?

317
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
I was happy too

318
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,100
because I had my dad back then.

319
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,670
Puppy.

By the way, wouldn't you make
more money by having

498
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,500
more sales jobs than working
at a convenience store?

499
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,640
I guess you only work to make money.

I know you're gathering saliva
inside your mouth.

634
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,440
Keep your manners and just swallow it.

635
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,750
I've gathered a lot myself.

636
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,550
On the count of three,
let's both swallow our saliva, okay?

637
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,120
One.

638
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,190
Two.

639
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,290
Hey!

640
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,230
I knew it, you darn brat.

641
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,840
That darn punk!

642
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,500
Gosh, I might as well just kill him!

643
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,910
-Over here.
-Sir, over here.

644
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,450
Taxi. Over here.

645
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,390
Can you please...

646
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,590
Please stop.

647
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,820
[Taxi]

648
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,490
Where to?

649
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,230
Hello. Pyeongchang-dong, please.

650
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
This is a Gyeonggi Province cab,
so I can't go there.

651
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
You can't?

652
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,230
[Taxi]

653
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,740
Gosh, shouldn't there be a lot of cabs
in this kind of situation?

654
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,260
My gosh, she's unbelievable.

655
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,230
So what if she wears expensive clothes?

656
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,300
Why would she coach Mr. Choi?

657
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,270
I hope she didn't say
anything weird to him about me.

658
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,670
Let's just skip work today. Let's go.
Let's just skip work.

659
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,750
No, wait.

660
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,780
Mr. Choi told me he has something to say.

661
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,620
I shouldn't just run away.

662
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,200
Ma'am.

663
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,770
Saet-byul, you're here.
You're finally here.

664
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,840
But where is Mr. Choi?

665
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,440
Dae-hyun went somewhere.

666
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,540
What? He told me
he needs to say something to me.

667
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,880
Oh, really?
Gosh, you'll have a lot of work to do.

668
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,950
It's actually better. Time goes faster,
and your sales will go up.

669
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,220
Gosh, you're such a lucky charm.

670
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll be off now. Those people
are probably dying to talk to you.

671
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,790
Okay. Oh, there's someone
waiting for you too.

672
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,190
What? What do you mean?

673
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,930
Over there.

674
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,660
My gosh, what is he doing here?

675
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,630
Don't be like that. He's handsome.

676
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,500
You won't be able to say that
once you live with him. I'll see you.

677
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,840
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

678
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,310
Good luck.

679
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,750
Gosh, where did he go?
I thought he wanted to talk to me.

680
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,030
Yeon-joo, why do you have
so much on your mind?

681
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,070
I don't have anything on my mind.

682
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,640
That's not true. You can't lie to me.

683
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,510
Is it because of the sales queen?

684
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,340
Because she works
at his convenience store?

685
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,310
Choi Dae-hyun. Mr. Choi. Manager Choi.

686
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,810
Address him properly.

687
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,650
Why are you wasting your energy
on Mr. Choi's part-timer?

688
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,360
I never wasted any of my energy on her.

689
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,430
-Yeon-joo.
-My goodness. Dae-hyun.

690
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,130
What are you doing here?

691
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,260
I wanted to take you home.

692
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,530
Sir, I didn't see you there.

693
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,970
It's been a long time, Mr. Choi.

694
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Yes, it has.

695
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,270
Yeon-joo, let's go.

696
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,980
Okay.

697
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,450
I can't wait to hear
what you're going to say.

698
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,020
That day at the bar...

699
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,300
Everyone else was on the floor.

700
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
And you were the only one who was fine.
Why was that?

701
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,540
You made a surprise visit to ask me that?

702
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,010
I don't even want to think about it,
so you can make your own judgment.

703
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,940
Yeon-joo.

704
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,240
This might not mean much to you.

705
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,210
But to that kid,
her life might depend on it.

706
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,720
I think you're overreacting.

707
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,920
All jobs are precious
whether it's an office job at a big firm

708
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,520
or a part-time job at a convenience store.

709
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,850
No one deserves

710
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,860
to lose their job for an unsure reason.

711
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,730
I know I'm just a manager
of a small convenience store.

712
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,570
But she's the first employee I ever hired,
and I don't want to fire her like this.

713
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,870
I want to make a decision
after I check the facts.

714
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,740
The fact is that she used violence.

715
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,980
But she didn't use it on you.
She used it on those girls

716
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,580
who harassed you. Isn't that also correct?

717
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,220
What doesn't change
is that she's a violent person.

718
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,030
Yeon-joo.

719
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,400
You know how you said
you never did anything behind my back?

720
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,440
The same goes for me.

721
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Please don't think
that I'm taking someone's side.

722
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,780
You see, I'm just trying

723
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,150
to stick to our principle
and do what's right.

724
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,550
But no principle is more important to me

725
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,720
than you, Yeon-joo.

726
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,750
You're the most
important principle of all.

727
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,420
So Yeon-joo,

728
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,390
I'll just do as you say.

729
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,470
Think about it carefully,

730
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,670
and let me know
once you've made up your mind.

731
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,380
I should go now.

732
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,350
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

733
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,820
You're just going to leave like that?

734
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,630
Gosh, you make it so hard for me
to hate you.

735
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,470
-You should go now.
-Yeon-joo.

736
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,070
Hey, Mom.

737
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,580
-You should go now.
-Your... Your mother?

738
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,620
Gosh, what should I do?

739
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,730
I should go and say hello,
but I'm not dressed properly.

740
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,790
Let's go.

741
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,070
Mother.

742
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,040
Hello?

743
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,510
[Hello, are you
the convenience store manager?]

744
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,910
[This is the police station.]

745
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,850
The... The police station?

746
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,350
Stop asking me.

747
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,580
What kind of person is he?

748
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,220
-My gosh.
-Come on.

749
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,690
He has common sense, he's conscientious,

750
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,660
and he's also a very trustworthy guy.

751
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,720
No, not that. What is his job?

752
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,390
Why does that matter?

753
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,230
Did you recently start dating him?

754
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,060
No, we've been together
for over two years.

755
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,830
What? "Two years"?

756
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,930
Then why didn't you tell me?

757
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,640
Because I'm finally confident now.

758
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,570
I'm going to stand my ground
regardless of what you say.

759
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,810
Saet-byul, what happened?

760
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,910
Are you okay?

761
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,180
Why did you come?
You'll only get disappointed again.

762
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,590
Did you get hurt?

763
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,920
No, I'm okay.

764
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,360
-What about the convenience store?
-Dal-sik is there.

765
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,900
My gosh, I think I tore a ligament.

766
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,970
I won't let this slide.

767
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,870
-We meet again.
-Yes.

768
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,300
My gosh, you're very busy.

769
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,310
What happened?

770
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,810
He apparently tried
to encourage her a little,

771
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,980
but she twisted his arm.

772
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,480
He didn't encourage me.
He kept massaging my hand.

773
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,910
See? Look at her!

774
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:15,880
You did nothing right!

775
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,720
You deserve to go to prison.

776
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:27,430
Hello, sir.
Let me apologize on her behalf.

777
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,960
-I'm sorry.
-Who are you?

778
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,430
I'm the manager of the convenience store.

779
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,870
You're the manager?
How did you educate your staff

780
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,770
for her to be so rude to me?

781
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,210
You see, I held her hand

782
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,240
because I thought of her like a daughter.

783
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,880
Then the least she could do
was thank me for it.

784
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:49,520
Hey, listen.

785
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,390
You sexually harassed her,
but I still apologized.

786
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,820
You should be satisfied with that.

787
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,920
What? "Sexually harass"? You little punk.

788
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,930
I was going to let this slide
because I didn't want to be like you.

789
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,860
But you know what?

790
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,630
I want you to apologize to my part-timer

791
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,070
for sexually harassing her.

792

♫ Congratulations, congratulations ♫

949
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,580
♫ Congratulations on becoming
the best employee of the month ♫

950
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,720
♫ Congratulations ♫

951
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:18,350
Why aren't you happy?

952
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,590
A job-hunting site is even going to come
and interview you.

953
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,890
What's so great about that?

954
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,290
We'll just end up getting more customers
and be more tired.

955
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,990
How could you say that?
You're the employee of the month.

956
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,900
Employee of the month, my foot.

957
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,330
All I do is make you go
to the police station.

958
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,300
Yes, will you please stop
making me go to the police station?

959
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,140
Oh, right.

960
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,640
You told me to come early yesterday
because you had something to say.

961
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:42,910
-What was it about?
-What?

962
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,620
Oh, well... You were late two days ago.
I wanted to talk to you about that.

963
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,050
That's because someone outside
asked me the directions--

964
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,620
Anyway, you'd better work hard.
Otherwise, I'll demote you to a temp.

965
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,160
Gosh, you're so narrow-minded.

966
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:01,530
No wonder my friends call you
Mr. Narrow-minded.

967
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,600
I'm not narrow-minded.
I'm just not generous with everyone.

968
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,330
People who know me know that I'm a man

969
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,070
with a very generous heart.

970
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,770
Are you impressed?

971
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,480
Why did you start
a convenience store business?

972
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,650
What?

973
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,920
Most of the convenience store owners
are middle-aged men.

974
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,360
I've never seen one
who's as young as you are.

975
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,260
I remember you telling me

976
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,260
that the convenience store
is your life and future.

977
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,130
And I can't stop thinking about that.

978
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:46,110
You want to know why I do this business?

979
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,210
I guess I should answer since you became
the employee of the month.

980
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,020
Instead, don't tell anyone.
This is a secret.

981
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,360
I'm sure you already know
that I used to work at the main branch.

982
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,630
I spent my days working really hard.

983
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,100
But one day,

984
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,240
a spirit showed up in my dreams
and said this.

985
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,710
"Dae-hyun, quit your office job"

986
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,280
"and open up a convenience store."
I was given a message.

987
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:26,750
So this story almost made it
to the show called "Incredible Moments".

988
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,750
My gosh, you're such a liar.

989
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,550
Don't try to find out why. It's a secret.

990
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,560
It'll make me seem too attractive.

991
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,800
Your confidence is so groundless.

992
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,560
What are you talking about?
I'm confident for a reason.

993
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,600
That's nonsense.

994
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,870
You just don't know.
There are reasons to my confidence.

995
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,240
But is this it? You're going to
congratulate me just by tearing the sign?

996
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:55,140
Yes, that's it.
Now, you need to clean it up.

997
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,880
-Throw me up in the air.
-I can't do that alone.

998
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,510
Then give me a ride on your shoulders.

999
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,280
No one's ever done that for me before.
You can be the first one to do it.

1000
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,050
Didn't I tell you that I have
a herniated cervical disk?

1001
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,120
My neck is bent forward like this.

1002
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,590
How lame. Then at least give me
a piggyback ride.

1003
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,360
Forget it. Why would I do that?

1004
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,940
Seriously? This is it? This is how you're
going to congratulate the best employee?

1005
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,910
What more do you expect?
I think I've done enough.

1006
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:27,610
Gosh, forget it.

1007
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,140
My gosh, what do you expect?

1008
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,810
Is this what you want?

1009
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,330
-Is that for me?
-Yes, it's for you.

1010
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,660
Take it.

1011
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,340
This is my favorite flower.

1012
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
I was going to buy red roses.

1013
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,040
But the florist told me
the meaning of that flower.

1014
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,780
It means admiration,
gratefulness, and faithfulness.

1015
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,910
I chose that flower
because the meaning suited you.

1016
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,880
There's also another meaning.

1017
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,450
What's that?

1018
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,360
[A pink rose symbolizes
a declaration of love.]

1019
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,360
-You don't need to know.
-My gosh.

1020
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,590
I'm so happy.

1021
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,260
Now, you just need to give me
a piggyback ride.

1022
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,730
You still haven't given up on that?

1023
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,440
Of course. I don't give up that easily.
That's how I became the best part-timer

1024
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,140
among millions of part-timers
in this country.

1025
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,270
I'm sure you know how hard it is
to become that

1026
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,640
since you used to work
at the headquarters.

1027
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,350
Okay, fine. I'll give you a piggyback ride
just this once for one second.

1028
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,720
-Forget it.
-Okay, fine.

1029
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,150
Three seconds. No more negotiating.
Three seconds. Deal?

1030
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,260
Come here.

1031
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,560
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

1032
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,330
Wait. Let me get my knees ready.

1033
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:57,930
Okay, come on.

1034
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,730
-Are you ready?
-Yes. In 1, 2, 3.

1035
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:05,210
Okay. Now, 1, 2, 3. Get off.

1036
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:09,110
-Hurry up and get off.
-Try and make me.

1037
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,480
Are you kidding me? Hey, get off me.

1038
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,680
Hey, you'll get hurt if I use my strength.

1039
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,980
-Get off me.
-No!

1040
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,920
Gosh, will you please get off me?

1041
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:22,820
Yeon...
