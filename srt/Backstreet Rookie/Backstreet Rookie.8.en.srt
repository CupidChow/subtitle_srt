-Thank you for the food.

163
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,210
-No worries.
-Come and join me.

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,450
Sure.

165
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,950
Let's eat.

166
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,990
Try some bulgogi.

167
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,300
Geum-bi, why did you bring me here?

168
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,940
Someone is looking for you.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
-Me?
-Yes.

170
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,700
Take the call.

171
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,910
Hello?

172
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,850
-Who is this?
-I'm Eun-byul's sister.

173
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,880
Hello, Saet-byul!

174
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,920
I'm Oh Hyeon-ji.

175
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,250
Yes, I know that you're Hyeon-ji.

176
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,720
I also know that you're Eun-byul's
closest friend.

177
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,760
That's why I'm heading over to see you
right now.

178
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,190
Right now? Why?

179
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,800
Because you won't tell me
where Eun-byul is.

180
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,330
If words don't work,
that leaves me with no other choice.

181
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,800
No, you don't need to come here.

182
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,370
I really don't know anything.

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,810
Yes, you do.

184
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,710
Tell me before things get ugly.

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,750
Whatever it takes, you must not tell her.

186
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,250
You said that you want to be my manager.

187
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,490
You know how managers are
featured on shows now too, right?

188
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,590
Let's take over the entertainment industry
together, you and I.

189
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,600
Saet-byul, my father is a pastor.

190
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,130
[Do you think a pastor's daughter
would possibly lie?]

191
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,140
And if I knew anything,
I would've told Geum-bi already.

192
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,740
Don't you think?

193
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,010
And I also can't reach Eun-byul

194
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,040
after she passed
the first round of the audition.

195
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm serious.

196
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,380
-Fine.
-Okay.

197
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,470
Gosh.

198
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,140
-Girls, look here for a moment.
-Hello!

199
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,210
She's the new member
to your four-member group.

200
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,510
Say hello.

201
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,210
Hello, my name is Jung Eun-byul.
Nice to meet you all.

202
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,510
-Welcome to the team.
-Nice to meet you!

203
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,980
You're the best-looking one.

204
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,920
No, you're being too kind.
You can just talk to me informally.

205
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,950
Should we?

206
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,320
Take good care of her.
She's a part of your group now.

207
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,920
-Okay!
-Will do!

208
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,390
-Don't worry.
-Bye!

209
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,390
-How old are you?
-I'm in grade 12.

210
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,360
-Really?
-You're so young.

211
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,840
This is clean enough.

212
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,370
Nonsense.

213
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,640
Look at the dust!
How can we let her sleep here?

214
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,850
My back is hurting badly
because I slept wrong.

215
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,050
I'm going to clean the whole room!

216
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,790
Can't you just help out
with the little things?

217
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,060
-I guess I could help you out.
-Unbelievable.

218
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,530
Look at that.

219
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,130
Yes, Mrs. Kim?

220
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,770
Your daughter-in-law
needs health insurance?

221
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,940
Bothersome? Not at all!

222
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,940
Yes, I'll be right there in a moment.

223
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,040
Bye.

224
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,610
Hey, I'm going to go and make some money.

225
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,280
Here.

226
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,920
Clean this place sparkling clean.
Take this.

227
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,160
-Don't forget the stairs.
-My gosh.

228
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,760
Yes, I'll clean the stairs squeaky clean
as well.

229
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,730
You better.

230
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,770
Let me tell you more in detail.

231
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,370
The entrails here is so good.

232
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,810
My daughter-in-law loves entrails.

233
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,450
I know!

234
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,380
Could we get two servings to-go

235
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,350
as I mentioned earlier?

236
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,990
-It's already packed and ready!
-It's ready.

237
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,520
As I was saying...

238
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,920
My daughter-in-law is so pretty and kind.

239
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,060
Of course I know! I attended
your son's wedding, remember?

240
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,830
I also paid
quite some congratulatory money.

241
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,660
I remember that, of course.

242
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,800
That's why I'm here to treat you out
on a lunch.

243
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,200
No, don't do that!

244
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,070
-Sir, we'll pay for the bill now.
-Okay!

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,040
Don't you dare to pay.

246
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,810
-Here I come.
-Let me pay for it all.

247
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,210
How much is the bill?

248
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,710
Let's see.

249
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,620
Yes? I'm here to sign you up
for insurance.

250
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,420
Really?

251
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
You've already signed up
for health insurance?

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,930
Okay. We'll talk later.

253
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,300
My daughter-in-law already signed up
for health insurance online.

255
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Is that right?

256
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,270
You offer pregnancy insurance too, right?

257
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,010
My daughter-in-law is planning
to have a baby

258
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,210
sometime next year.

259
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,780
Well,

260
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll make sure to contact you then,
Mrs. Gong.

261
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,450
Don't worry about it.

262
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Don't worry. You can count on me.

263

She's a real swindler, isn't she?

264
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,430
Here's your credit card.

265
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,670
Just put it down right here!

266
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,970
It's quite a bit.

267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I didn't ask!

268
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,910
-Right.
-Excuse me.

269
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,410
Coming!

270

That pig ate so much.

271

that I moved to Zhangjiajie, right?

Fine. Go ahead. Go with her. Leave.

I told you to clean the room.
Where are you going with Jang-mi?

284

Go with Jang-mi. Don't live in my house.
Go and live with her!

Go and live with Jang-mi.

I don't want to see this happen again.

797
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,940
What?

798
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,840
But she's the best
when it comes to sales promotion.

799
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,580
Don't you want to keep working with us?

800
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,610
I'm guessing you understood.

801
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,730
-My gosh.
-Gosh, you startled me.

802
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:56,270
Hey, you look exhausted.
You should go home and get some rest.

803
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,710
Hey, Dal-sik.
I'm going to go home and get some sleep.

804
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,840
Tell your mom to give me some kimchi.

805
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,850
Let's make sure today's award ceremony

806
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,690
motivated both the award winners

807
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,590
and those who didn't get to win an award.

808
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,520
Yes, of course, sir.

809
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,630
Based on today's award ceremony,
the first half of...

810
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,800
[I'm not trying to interfere.
I'm just complaining.]

811
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,930
[If I'm going to lose Mr. Choi to someone,
I'd rather lost him to someone]

812
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,370
[who knows how much he's worth.]

813
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,270
Yeon-joo!

814
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,310
Yeon-joo!

815
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,480
Yeon-joo.

[Team manager: Yoo Yeon-joo]

818

[Team manager]

819
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,280
But no principle is more important to me

820
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,380
than you, Yeon-joo.

821
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,450
You're the most
important principle of all.

822
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,080
That will be all for today's meeting.

823
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,770
[I'm sorry, Dae-hyun.
I got swayed for a moment.]

824
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,740
[I won't let this happen again.]

825
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
[Let's start over, Dae-hyun.]

826
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,550
Yeon-joo, can we talk?

827
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,990
No, let's talk later.

828
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,640
Excuse me.

829
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,840
Hey. Excuse me.

830
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,610
Hey.

831
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,010
Where is Dae-hyun?

832
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:22,450
-Who are you?
-I'm Yoo Yeon-joo.

833
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,390
"Yoo Yeon-joo"?
Oh, you're Dae-hyun's girlfriend.

834
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,490
Yes.

835
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,120
You look much prettier in real life.

836
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,320
Thank you.

837
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:34,090
Dae-hyun went home a while ago
because he was too tired.

838
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,500
He went home? Okay.

839
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,870
Where does he live?

840
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,570
Go straight from here.

[Convenience Store]

842
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,170
Then turn right
and turn left after a little while.

843
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,070
Then turn right and keep going.

844
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,780
Then turn right at the stationary.
And walk past three big trees,

and then you'll see a two-story house
with a black gate.

847
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,180
Thank you.

848
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,190
She's so pretty. Dae-hyun is...

Oh, yes. Hello. I'm Yoo Yeon-joo.

My goodness, I'm Dae-hyun's mother.

Are you here to see Dae-hyun?

854
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,600
Yes, I couldn't reach him.

00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,060
Oh, dear.

My goodness,
I've always wanted to meet you.

You really are beautiful. My gosh.

858
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,410
You should come inside for some tea.

859

No, it's okay.

00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,780
No, don't refuse. Come inside.

-Come on inside.
-No, it's okay.

-What is it?
-What are you doing here?

Why are you so angry?

What? Yeon-joo?

870

She came looking for you,
so I told her you went home.

871

Why didn't you answer your phone?

No one called me.
