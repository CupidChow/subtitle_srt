00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,570
Ma'am, what a wise woman you are.

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,400
Don't worry about it. I'll make sure
that he goes to that dinner.

167
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,070
Thank you, ma'am.

168
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,870
I'll take that as a yes and get going now.

169
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,640
-Sure.
-Thank you, ma'am!

170
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,640
No worries.

171
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,740
-Why did you say that I'll be going?
-Of course you should go!

172
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,910
It's none other than the chairman
who wants to buy you dinner!

173
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,610
-Goodness.
-Stop being so ridiculous.

174
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,650
-He's...
-Hello.

175
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,280
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

176
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,190
What? You don't know
about the congratulatory money?

177
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,820
I'm speechless.

178
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,530
Get the money. Now.

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
Stop talking nonsense.

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,000
How dare you?

181
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,230
Take this.

182
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you not know what we've got?

183
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,140
How dare you talk back?

184
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Kick her.

185
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,420
You prepare Eun-byul's
debut congratulatory money yourself.

186
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,600
We'll stay quiet if you pay us.

187
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,470
Until we get paid, of course.

188
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,400
Prepare the most amount of money you can.
Try your best.

189
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,600
Hello?

190
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,480
Mr. Choi!

191
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,010
-What?
-Come out quick!

192
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,450
-What's wrong?
-Quick!

193
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,780
What's wrong? What happened?

194
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,180
It's Saet-byul!

195
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,490
Hey! What happened to her?

196
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,990
Saet-byul? What happened to her?
What happened to you?

197
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,060
Mr. Choi...

198
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,690
Come here.

199
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,560
Eun-jo, what happened to her?

200
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,430
Saet-byul, tell me what happened.

201
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,430
What happened?
Did you get into a fight again?

202
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,170
No, I just fell down some stairs.

203
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,240
Stairs? As if.

204
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,770
Some bullies are blackmailing Eun-byul,

205
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,480
and Saet-byul took the hit for her.

206
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,610
Bullies?

207
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,750
Those girls from the last time?

208
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,110
Why are they blackmailing Eun-byul?

209
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
And why did they beat Saet-byul up
like this?

210
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,590
Apparently, Eun-byul hung out with them
to look tough like them.

211
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,160
Seeing Eun-byul starting to get popular,

212
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,620
they're blackmailing her
with some bad photos for money.

213
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,700
Saet-byul,
let's get you to the hospital first.

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,130
I'm really fine. It's not that bad.

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,040
Mr. Choi, I have to get back
to my shop now.

216
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,910
Please take good care of Saet-byul.

217
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,610
She insisted that she wouldn't come,
so I had to drag her here.

218
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,950
Please look after her.

219
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,990
Let's apply some ointment.

220
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,500
Saet-byul, I can't watch this anymore.

221
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,860
Let's report them to the police.

222
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,470
Or just come with me
to the police station.

223
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,570
It's fine. Everything is sorted out now.

224
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,370
I'll report them for you.

225
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,010
I'm really fine.

226
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,310
We settled

227
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,020
that this is for me beating them up
the last time.

228
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,970
Saet-byul.

229
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,040
I mean it, Mr. Choi.

230
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,250
Why are you crying, then?

231
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,050
Are you crying because it hurts?

232
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,260
I'm not hurt because I'm beaten up.

233
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,460
My heart just breaks

234
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,200
when I think about Eun-byul.

235
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,200
I feel like I've done it all wrong.

236
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,840
I feel like I don't deserve
to be her guardian.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,750
That's not true.

238
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,080
Don't think that way.

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,920
You did nothing but to live your best.
You are not at fault.

240
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,960
And there's no one else who takes
better care of her sister than you do.

241
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
I know that for sure.

242
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,400
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

243
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,140
Thank you for letting me work here,

244
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,440

worrying for me,

246
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,650
and telling me things like that.

247
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,820
You're the only person who has
ever done that for me.

248
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,990
I'm really thankful for you.

249
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,790
I'm really sorry, Mr. Choi.

250

I'm so sorry.

As if my day hasn't been bad enough.
You're making it even worse!

That's probably

my heart is torn into pieces.

Even if you're not hungry, go eat.

326
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,020
Come out. You'd better come out!

327
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Are you crazy? How dare
you use your muscles against me?

328
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,550
-Go. Go now. We're leaving.
-I...

329
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,220
-I...
-You'd better put on a suit.

330
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,860
You look dashing in a suit.

331
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,930
I think she'll be there too.

332
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,470
Gosh. Again?

333
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,170
He'd better come back soon.

334
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,160
[This is just a dream.]

335
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,790
[It's the unluckiest dream of all.]

336
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,900
[Geum-bi, get some more sleep.]

337
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,740
[What is this?]

338
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,940
[I hear someone's breathing.]

339
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,070
[And I can feel someone's breath.]

340
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,680
[And it feels hot too.]

341
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,150
[Am I dreaming in 3D?]

342
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,480
[No, is this a dream in 4D?]

343
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,260
Darn it!

344
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,640
Hey, what have you done to me?

345
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,710
No, I should ask you that.

346
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,540
My teeth.

347
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,110
Where am I?

348
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,150
Why am I here?

349
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,350
I should ask you that.

350
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,850
Why are you here all of a sudden?

351
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
There's no way I willingly walked in here.

352
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,120
And not even in a million years
will I bring you here.

353
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,990
-Hey, Rickshaw.
-Yes?

354
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,830
Rickshaw, turn around.

355
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,930
See? I didn't come here on my own will.

356
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,330
There you go!

357
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Hey, spread the blanket!

358
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,210
-The blanket?
-Yes.

359
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,710
-Here I go, my lady.
-Go.

360
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,240
I feel nauseated.

361
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,450
See? There's no way I brought you here.

362
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,020
Anyway, I don't even remember
what happened.

363
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,090
Pretend this never happened.

364
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,820
This is our first time seeing eye to eye.

365
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,360
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

366
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,990
So this never happened.

367
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,830
-Great. Bye.
-Don't tell anyone.

368
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,630
It's not that way. Go that way.

369
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,500
-Don't tell anyone.
-Gosh.

370
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,570
Darn it.

371
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,510
Oh, no. This is bad. Darn it.

372
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,010
Gosh, Saet-byul.

373
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,010
What do I do? What should I do?

374
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,280
Darn it.

375
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,380
[Lifestyle Platform, GS25]

376
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,350
Gosh, you must be
out of your mind, Geum-bi.

377
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,230
Hello. Keep going.

378
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,670
Goodness.

379
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,150
What's wrong with me?

380
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,690
What? Darn it.

381
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,000
What's wrong with me?

382
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,000
What's wrong with you, Dal-sik?

383
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,970
This feels weird. What's happening?

384
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,470
Sir.

385
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,540
For the sake of marketing
and reputation of our company,

386
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,240
why don't we appoint Mr. Choi Dae-hyun

387
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,340
as the advisor
on behalf of the branch owners?

388
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,780
Advisor?

389
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,950
Ms. Yoo.

390
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,690
Mr. Choi has worked at the head office
and runs a convenience store.

391
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,490
For the projects you mentioned
to make social contributions

392
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,730
and to grow together as teams,
he will be useful.

393
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,000
He will help improve
our reputation as well.

394
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
My gosh.

395
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,270
Hello, I'm sorry I'm late.

396
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,110
I'm Choi Dae-hyun.

397
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,410
Welcome. Please take a seat.

398
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Okay.

399
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,850
Three years ago, when you saved a man,

400
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,690
I never got to treat you to a meal,
so I always felt bad.

401
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,460
And I never got to thank you for it.

402
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,160
Gosh, you didn't have to.

403
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,200
It's all right. I don't need it.

404
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,460
Please accept it.

405
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,470
You did a fine job with Go Star 25.

406
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,100
It helped improve our reputation.

407
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,370
I see.

408
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,310
How is running the store
after working at the head office?

409
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,840
Well, I'm not sure.

410
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,710
I don't know if this is
the right expression to use.

411
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,020
But it feels like
I've worn both sides of a vest.

412
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,660
That's an interesting expression.

413
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,660
-Be careful.
-Can I bite it?

414
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,300
Bite gently. Be gentle.

415
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,100
-Hey, this is pure gold.
-It is.

416
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,940
Do you know how much this is?

417
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,970
Did he give you anything else?

418
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,340
Will we get privileges
when placing our orders?

419
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,010
Gosh, Mom. There's no such thing.

420
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,340
-Go home now.
-What?

421
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,250
Okay. Let go of me.

422
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,850
I'll keep this safely at home. Okay?

423
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,980
Okay.

424
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,290
Gosh, this must be expensive. I'm leaving.

425
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,450
-Bye.
-Gosh. Well done, my son.

426
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,220
-Let go of me.
-Mom, you're taking that?

427
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,360
She took it.

428
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,300
What? What is it? Do I smell?

429
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,600
I was checking if you're wearing cologne.

430
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,570
You're not wearing it. You pass.

431
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,240
I was bothered that
your ex-girlfriend would be there,

432
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,600
but I'll let this one go.

433
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,040
Don't go near the company.
Stay right next to me from now on.

434
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,210
Okay?

435
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,110
How? Like this?

436
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,910
Like this.

437
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,820
Hey, you just pushed me.

438
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Hey.

439
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,970
[Saet-byul! Dae-hyun!]

440
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,810
-Hey, I told you to clean thoroughly.
-Gosh. I'm sorry.

441
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,010
-You should be sorry.
-I'm sorry.

442
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
-Have you gone mad?
-I...

443
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,480
Hey, what are you doing to her?

444
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,190
What did she do wrong?

445
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,550
Listen, Mom.

446
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,560
Is that how I raised you?

447
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,860
My gosh, Saet-byul. Imagine
if I didn't come back here, you know?

448
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,900
You punk.

449
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,100
[It could have been really nice.]

450
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,340
Mom, did you forget something?

451
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,240
Why did you have to come back?

452
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,670
Yes, I forgot something.

453
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,110
I forgot to take Saet-byul with me.
I'm taking her with me. What?

454
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,410
Why would you do that?

455
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,580
She's taking the GED.
If she's studying for GED,

456
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,580
this place isn't appropriate.
You should study at home.

457
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,550
-Let's go home.
-No, I have my own study here.

458
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,650
-Gosh, be quiet. Take off your vest.
-He made it for me.

459
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,920
-Be quiet. Take off your vest.
-No, I can do it here.

460
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,290
Let's put that away. Let's go.

461
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,490
-Really?
-Let's go.

462
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,920
-Go. You better watch it.
-Can I go?

463
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,230
Let's go. Let's go home.

464
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,300
How dare you put your hand on her head?

465
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,830
I almost killed him just now.

466
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
He's gone mad. He must be out of his mind.

467
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,800
I'll kill him when he comes home.

468
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,770
I won't let him slide for this.

469
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,150
Welcome.

470
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,650
How can I help you?

471
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,290
I came here because
I needed to talk to you, Mr. Choi.

472
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,960
What is this about?

473
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,400
The chairman wishes to appoint you

474
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,600
as an advisor at the head office.

475
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,270
Me?

476
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,640
With this position, you will be
representing all of the branch owners.

477
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,140
No, it hasn't even been a year,

478
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,150
so I don't think it's fair for me
to represent other branch owners.

479
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,910
You should make this offer
to other branch owners

480
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,880
with more experience.

481
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,080
I'll turn it down.

482
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,350
No, Dae-hyun.

483
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,690
Fine. To be honest,
I want to apologize to you.

484
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,730
I'm sorry that I was disappointed at you

485
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,660

Why did you come back here
when you don't even like my neighborhood?

There's something I must tell you.

497
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,280
The chairman wants to appoint Dae-hyun

498
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,550
as the advisor at the head office.

499
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,250
But Dae-hyun seems uncomfortable
to take the position.

502
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,730
he will be working at the head office
like an executive.

503
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,360
An executive?

504
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,330
Does it mean he'll get hundreds
of millions of won for his salary?

505
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes, that's a given.

506
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,240
But why does he feel uncomfortable
to take the position?

507
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,940
It's probably because of me.

508

And my mother was very rude
to you and your husband.

only Dae-hyun can do.

13,000 convenience stores.
