to the police.

00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,030
-Have you gone crazy?
-You're the one who's crazy!

637
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,200
Why would you kiss your cell phone?

638
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,400
Are you a wireless charger?

639
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,370
You look mentally sick.
You should go to the hospital.

640
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,670
I'm sorry, but you're the one
who needs to go to the hospital.

641
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,800
You look way too old to be 22.

642
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,540
Your aging speed is like 5G.

643
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,210
-You look like the moon.
-"The moon"?

644
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,410
Yes, the moon.
You look like the surface of the moon.

645
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,050
You know what?
Don't bother going to a hospital.

646
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,390
I'll help you get to your senses instead.
Come on.

647
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,360
Go away.

648
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,260
-I might just...
-You little...

649
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,730
Let me go! Let go!

650
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,200
Are you serious? You little jerk.

651
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,940
Hey, let's go.

652
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,550
I'm sorry.

653
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,820
Aphrodite.

654
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,390
I can't believe
a person like her even exists.

655
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,320
What's that?

656
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,660
Gosh, I must be drunk.

657
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm seeing things now.

658
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,670
What...

659
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,540
Is this...

660
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,010
My gosh, is this real?

661
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,780
It looks so real.

662
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,320
Is it really real?

663
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,420
-Hey, you...
-You almost ripped my cheeks.

664
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,390
What... What are you doing here?
Is it really you?

665
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,300
I thought I'd be joining you for sashimi.

666
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,770
Why are you eating this?
You're like a kid who ran away from home.

667
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:17,100
Hey, why do you keep
showing up like a ghost?

668
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,310
Well, someone keeps texting me
every time I think of him.

669
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,410
Who's that?

670
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,180
Who do you think?

671
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,950
Hey, stop scaring me.

672
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,180
Don't tell me you're talking about me.

673
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,950
Forget it.

674
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,050
-Give me some drink.
-No, get your own.

675
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,560
There's a convenience store over there.

676
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,130
And look around you. The beach is huge.

677
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,430
You really are stingy.

678
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,130
You stingy manager.
Gosh, let me have a sip.

679
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,770
-My gosh, give me some.
-Hey.

680
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,970
Are you serious right now?

681
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,640
Hey, don't drink it all!

682
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,410
I only bought one bottle! This is it!

683
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,180
It's mine!

684
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,460
Ji-wook, don't you need to eat dinner?

685
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,960
No, it's okay. I'll eat at home.

686
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,260
Hey, wait.

687
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,100
Saet-byul isn't home.

688
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,270
What?

689
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,170
I went to your place this morning
to pick up a file.

690
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,840
And I was startled to see her
sleeping there.

691
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,770
I talked some sense into her,
and she willingly left.

692
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,510
You kicked out my guest
without even telling me?

693
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,410
You should've discussed it with me
before you invited a friend.

694
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,840
But this is my house.

695
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,480
The agency provided you
this accommodation.

696
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,610
Why won't you let me hang around
with Saet-byul?

697
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,180
Because she's of no help to you.

698
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,450
Then what about celebrities?

699
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,290
-That depends on whom it is.
-Sir!

700
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,990
Ji-wook, you're a celebrity.
You earn a living thanks to your fans.

701
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,090
And it's not just you. The agency
and staff also depend on your fame.

702
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,460
You should think carefully
before you do anything.

703
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,120
[Puppy, thanks for letting me sleep over.
From Saet-byul.]

704
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,500
I guess you're really not
going to eat sashimi.

705
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:30,340
Hey, buy it yourself.

706
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,470
Forget it.

707
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,790
Dae-hyun, why are you here?

708
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,300
Is it to get over me?

709
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Yes.

710
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,770
Yes, I'm here to clear my mind
and get over you.

711
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,140
Yeon-joo.

712
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,770
You see,

713
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,780
I don't mind why you wanted
to break up with me.

714
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,680
But it really breaks my heart

715
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,290
that we had to break up the way we did.

716
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,120
I was the only one who had to get hurt.

717
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,060
But... But my family...

718
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,500
You even hurt my family.

719
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,100
Gosh, stop drinking.

720
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,670
Hey, you...

721
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,180
What's going on? What are you doing here?

722
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,720
Who do you think I am?

723
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,080
What kind of question is that?
You're the girl

724
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,420
who asked me to buy you cigarettes.

725
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,520
Then you came running like a rhino

726
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,160
and kissed...

727
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,760
-"Kissed"?
-You...

728
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,460
What did I do?

729
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,040
Do you know
what I'm going through right now?

730
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,370
My dad hurt his pride because of me.

731
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,310
My goodness.

732
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,750
What is this? Do you have
dissociative identity disorder?

733
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,090
You're awful when you're drunk.
You stingy manager!

734
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,860
Hey, I'm not stingy. You're too feisty.

735
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:36,100
You're always getting into fights,
you feisty little girl!

736
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,700
You're a feisty girl.

737
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,570
I must've been crazy.
I can't believe I liked you for 10 years.

738
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,740
10 years is long enough
to change mountains and rivers.

739
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,510
That means the expiration date
for mountains and rivers is 10 years.

740
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,280
If I knew you were like this,
I never would've kept you in my heart.

741
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,980
Why would you keep me anywhere?
I'm not an object.

742
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,980
Or maybe I'm a fertile chicken egg.

743
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,460
A fertile chicken egg. That's me.

744
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,530
My gosh, I want to go back in time.
Compensate me for the time I've wasted.

745
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,430
If you want compensation,
go to the service center, ma'am.

746
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,100
I've never wanted
to kill someone this badly.

747
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:20,340
What? "Badly"?
I've never wanted to drink this badly!

748
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,480
Hey, let's drink alcohol!
But I think I've had too much to drink.

749
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,280
My goodness, I'm dying.

750
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,320
Excuse me! Does anyone know
when the tide rises here?

751
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,560
When do I need to throw him into the sea
so he can float far away?

752
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,350
My gosh, he's heavy. Gosh, my back.

753
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,190
My goodness.

754
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,690
Okay, there. I did it.

755
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,620
Gosh, it's so hot.

756
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,190
If it weren't for his handsome face,
I would've dragged him here.

757
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,030
My gosh, I'm so tired.

758
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,240
Mr. Choi.

759
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,380
Do you know when I started
having feelings for you?

760
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,890
It was when you saved me.

761
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,690
You don't know when that happened, do you?

762
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,800
It was 10 years ago.

763
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,440
-1, 2, 3!
-Taekwondo!

764
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,040
-Puppy, do you know how to do this?
-What?

765
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,840
-1, 2, 3!
-Taekwondo!

766
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,980
Yes.

767
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,250
-1, 2, 3!
-Taekwondo!

768
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,410
1, 2,

769
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,080
-Then how about this?
-3, 4!

770
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,180
What?

771
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,920
You deserved that.
You'd better practice harder.

772
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,660
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

773
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,710
[No, I wasn't okay.]

774
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,380
Ever since that day,
I never once forgot about you.

775
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,320
But you don't remember, do you?

776
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,520
It's okay because I'll make sure
you remember that soon.

777
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,560
I'm going to make you remember that day
for the rest of your life.

778
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,200
Sleep tight, Mr. Choi.
