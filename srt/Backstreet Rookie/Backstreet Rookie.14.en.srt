-Of course, I do.
-What is it?

33

Red tulips symbolize

-What?
-The Netherlands.

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,880
These are the flowers of the Netherlands.

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,440
That's why they symbolize the Netherlands.

38

70

Then why did he quit in the first place?

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,300

72
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
What?

73
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,940
He apparently took the hit for me,

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,740
because I was supposed to get suspended.

75

to try everything and regret it after.

My child is trying to jump
into a fire pit.

86

What kind of a parent would
just sit and watch?

to the fire.

-I said, let go.

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,580
-You must have lost your mind.
-No.

170
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,650
Let go. Are you crazy?

171
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,420
Fine. Don't let go.
If you let go, you will be dead.

172
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,150
Yong-pil, you're in danger. Don't let go.

173
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't let go.

174
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,660
Let go. Hey!

175
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,960
You idiot. Choi Yong-pil! Let go of me!

176
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,270
-Let go! Let go! Let go!
-Oh, my.

177
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,340
-Did you just bite me?
-Let go!

178
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,970
Hey! Stop biting me!

179
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,810
Ms. Yoo.

180
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,890
Jung Eun-byul.
What do you think a team is?

181
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,890
Team?

182
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,990
You're still on our team
and a member of Fancy Girls.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,030
Practice harder during
the self-reflection break.

184
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,330
Until we make a comeback.
Do you understand?

185
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,270
Yes.

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Thank you.

187
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,310
Thank you so much.

188
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,180

[Franchise contract]

[Owner]

191
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,170
This is our first franchise store
which is 30 years old.

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,480
The contract expires next month,

193
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,580
and the owner wishes to switch it
into our rival franchise.

194
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,010
While we were preparing
its 30th anniversary event.

195
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,220
But even the sales team gave up on them.
Why do you want me to...

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,890
It's because I have
high expectations on you.

197
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,960
If you're not sure if you can do it,
you can say no.

198
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,230
Never mind. I will try.

199
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,330
I should get going.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,870
Let me see. Where is it?
I should turn right here.

201
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,010
Here we go.

202
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,380
[You are 220m away from the destination.]

203

[30th anniversary, Thank you very much]

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,070
Gosh. This place used to be
much busier before.

205
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,110
Why are you here?
Seong-tae is supposed to come.

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,620
There's been an issue with a new store,
so I came on his behalf.

207
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,920
I thought it would be too much work
to do by yourself, so I came to help.

208
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,660
I can help both you and the first store.

209
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,230
It's for the company's sake.

210
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,330
Thank you. Shall we go now?

211
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,530
Yes.

212
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,770
Welcome.

214
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,610
Hi, sir. I'm from the head office.

215
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm a consultant, Choi Dae-hyun.

216
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,310
I would like to talk to you.

217
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,850
I'm done talking with the company.

218
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,550
Sir, I'm not here
as the company's employee.

219
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm here as a store owner.
I'm running their franchise store as well.

220
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,290
I'm not interested in what you came as.

221
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,960
If you're not buying anything,
I want you to leave.

222
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,400
Sir, can we please talk?

223
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,400
Stop bothering me!

224
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,430
-But...
-That's not...

225
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,800
Please never come back.

226
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,610
Please never come back.

227
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,480
Dae-hyun, are you all right?

228
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,920
This is why you shouldn't have come.

229
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,850
I'm okay, sir.

230
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,950
-Unbelievable.
-Sir.

231
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,470
I said I'm fine.

232
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,470
My bone is fine.
It's my muscle that is a little hurt.

233
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,740
I didn't have to come to the hospital.

234
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,940
You got hurt because of me.

235
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,250
That's not true.
You don't have to feel so bad about it.

236
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,050
This is not your fault. So don't worry.

237
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,480
Still...

238
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,760
Wait. My bag.

239
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,860
I will stop by the first store
before I go.

240
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,970
Goodness. Red chili pepper paste,
mixed paste, freshwater snails...

241
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,670
You're buying so many things.

242
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,010
Sir, you look gorgeous today.

243
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,510
I'm taking an airplane,
so I put extra effort into dolling up.

244
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,080
If you did that a long time ago,

245
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,950
so many women would have fought over you.

246
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,720
All right. That would be 57,000 won.

247
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,550
57,000 won.

248
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,190
Sir, don't you have cash?

249
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,230
There seems to be a problem
with the internet.

250
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,660
The credit card machine isn't working.

251
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,960
Since when?

252
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,170
What? Since a while ago.

253
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,200
I have a lot of cash. Here. 60,000 won.

-Thanks.
-You can keep the change.

255

-Bye.
-See you later.

261
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,460
-Do you have your passport?
-Yes.

262
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,070
-Did you exchange money?
-Yes.

263
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,070
When you see Jang-mi, tell her I said hi.

264

-We will.
-Tell her I'm doing fine.

265
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,870
-Okay?
-Fine. We will.

266
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
You've got to hurry.

267
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,570
Hurry and get to the airport.

268
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,040
You know what happens when you're late.

269
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,580
I want to go too.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,390
Goodness. It's huge. It must be
because it's an international airport.

271

Guys. Come over here.

272

-Take a video.

274

-Right.
-It's a video, so let's move.

-Spin.
-Let's spin.

-It's the D section.

Yes. We're in the D section.

-I didn't do it on purpose.
-There's a cab!

Run!

-Sorry.
-Hurry!

How could I trust you and leave

Yes, I'm totally fine.

If there are no customers,
just lock the store up and leave.

Of course I'm leaving. Bye now.

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,020
Where are all the 50,000 won bills?

330
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,420
-60,000 won.
-Okay.

331
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,490
She took all the 50,000 won bills!

332
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,290
My goodness!

333
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,560
This is so frustrating!

334
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,130
I'm not

335
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,170
feeling any less mad
because we're eating this today.

336
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,940
Don't you ever think that I'm no longer
mad at you.

337
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,580
Nothing will work. You better work
to pay for the massage chair.

338
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,250
I worked all day to cook you these.

339
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,080
Just shut up.

340
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,090
[♫ A rose ♫]

341
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,320
[♫ In your hands ♫]

342
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,190
Why? Do you miss Jang-mi?

343
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,200
Why is that on TV?

344
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,630
Hey.

345
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,470
Do you miss your old days with Jang-mi?

346
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,310
No, why would I miss her?

347
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,440
"Jang-mi! Where are you?"

348
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,710
"Jang-mi!"

349
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,220
"Miss, have you seen a girl named
Hong Jang-mi? She's beautiful."

350
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,020
-Hey.
-"Jang-mi, I'm here!"

351
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,150
-"Yong-pil is here!"
-Stop it.

352
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,050
She was your friend, too.
Don't you miss her?

353
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,320
Nonsense.

354
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,330
I don't ever want to see her.

355
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
You miss her so much, don't you?

356
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,400
Your heart is longing for her, isn't it?

357
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,900
What are you saying? Why would I miss her?

358
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,970
Sure.

359
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,310
Hello, ma'am.

360
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,580
Tomorrow? Yes, I have time.

361
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,720
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

362
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,760
Why does she want to see me?

363
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,120
Who is it?

364
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,960
It's the lady in Pyeongchang-dong.

365
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,060
Her? You mean, Yeon-joo's mother?

366
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Why?

367
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,700
It'd be nice if I knew, too.

368
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,500
Do you want me to come with you?

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,940
I'll go with you tomorrow.

370
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,540
You're no help.

371
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,510
I'm going to bed now.

372
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,690
[Math]

373
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,090
This is so hard.

374
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,360
Why don't I ask Mr. Choi?

375
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,430
You don't even know this? It's so easy.

376
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,170
Listen. I'll explain it to you.
Here's a triangle.

377
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,510
One angle is 42 degrees and the other 75.
What's the angle of the last one?

378
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,840
All angles in a triangle add up to...

379
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,150
how many degrees was it?

380
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,380
-Mr. Choi!
-What?

381
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,950
I can do it if I had the answer key, too.

382
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,220
I'm not trying to see the answer.

383
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,420
I'm seeing if they still use
the same calculation method.

384
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,650
I'm just checking
in case the curriculum has changed.

385
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,120
What's there to change about a triangle?

386
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,560
-Why wouldn't it?
-It's just a triangle.

387
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,130
Triangles can change, too.

388
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,360
Triangles...

389
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,060
That reminds me. I haven't put away
the triangular gimbap yet.

390
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,230
Triangular gimbap changes every year, too.

391
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,510
Never mind.

392
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,180
I have to check the answers now.

393
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,150
I started from here,

394
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,650
so I'll check the answers from here.

395
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,790
A call?

396
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,660
Hello, student.

397
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,290
Mr. Choi!

398
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,000
Did you finish all the homework
I assigned you?

399
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,730
Of course I have.

400
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,270
Give me the answers.

401
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,870
You have to call out the answers
for me to mark.

402
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
Call them out now.

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,910
Unbelievable.
How dare you try to be sneaky?

404
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,010
Have you ever seen a teacher
give answers to a student?

405
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,210
I'll mark. You call your answers out.

406
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,180
-Call them out.
-Sneaky?

407
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,980
You don't trust me?

408
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,690
Don't be sneaky with me.

409
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,420
Come on.

410
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,920
-Here I go.
-All right, go.

411
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,190
-Question 1, A.
-Correct.

412
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,460
Awesome!

413
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,500
Question 2, D.

414
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,260
-Wrong.
-What?

415
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,270
There's no way.

416
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
From question 3 to 5, it's C,

417
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,840
That's right.

418
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,140
-C,
-Yes.

419
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,540
-and D.
-Wrong.

420
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,210
How could you get this wrong?
It's so easy.

421
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,510
It's not easy.

422
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,910
Next.

423
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,910
That's right.

424
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,280
Yes, that one is correct.

425
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,850
That was a tough one,
but you came through.

426
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,350
I'm quite smart, as you know.

427
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,190
Wrong! I can't believe you.

428
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,990
Even elementary school kids
would get this right.

429
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,220
How could you get this wrong?

430
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,390
This one is really hard.

431
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,190
You somehow get all the hard ones right
and easy ones wrong.

432
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,800
Last one. Wrong.

433
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,570
I got more than half right.

434
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,300
That's a pass.

435
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,770
Saet-byul, you sure you can pass
with this much studying?

436
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,440
What are you talking about? Whatever.

437
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,510
I'm doing great for someone who's working
at a convenience store while studying.

438
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,450
Those results are nothing
to be ashamed of.

439
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,850
I did great.

440
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,650
Mr. Choi,

441
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,750
when are you coming today?

442
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,890
I don't think I can go today.

443
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,960
What? Why not?

444
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,290
I'm at the first branch
of our brand's convenience store,

445
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,360
and the owner had something urgent
to take care of.

446
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,000
That's why I'm working the night shift
for him.

447
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,900
I see.

448
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,100
You're so cool.

449
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,470
Saet-byul,

450
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,070
When you're done taking your GED,
let's prepare you for university.

451
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,910
What? You want me to go to university?

452
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,250
I'll pay for your tuition.

453
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,380
I'll pay it all the way through.
What do you think?

454
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm amazing, aren't I?

455
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,690
What would you have done without me?

456
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,620
You're right. What would I have done?

457
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,730
Saet-byul, hang up now.

458
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,430
You need to study.

459
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,130
I'll get you some rice cake
to bid you good luck tomorrow.

460
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,730
And I'll buy you a delicious dinner after
your test, so don't make other plans.

461
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,040
Sounds great.

462
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,870
Keep studying hard. Keep it up.

463
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,310
All right. I can do it!

464
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,510
Aren't you Yong-pil? It's me, Jang-mi.

465
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,120
"Ma'am"? Come on, we're friends.

467
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,690
It's so nice to see you.

468
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,760
How did you get my number?

469
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,400
I called the alumni association
of Haeundae Commercial High.

470
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,200
So? How have you been? What do you do?

471
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,440
I'm in business. Business.

472
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,470
Business? What's it about?

473
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,610
I kill my time running a convenience store
at Shinseong-dong.

474
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,620
I guess people in that town
call me a leader.

475
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,120
I knew you'd be a success.

476
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,420
So? Are you married?

477
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,520
I am.

478
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,560
I have a son, a daughter, and a wife.

479
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,300
I have everything a man should have.

480
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,360
How have you been, Jang-mi?

481
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,130
I run a Korean restaurant
in Zhangjiajie, China.

482
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,870
I got divorced ages ago,
and I live alone with my daughter.

483
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,570
My daughter is getting married,

484
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,010
and she wanted to take
her wedding photos in Korea.

485
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,380
That's why I came back after 40 years.

486
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,320
Yong-pil, I wanted to see you today

487
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,190
because of this.

488
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,990
What's this?

489
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,960
The money you let me borrow.

490
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm sorry to pay you back so late.

491
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,630
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

492
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,600
You stole that from your dad's safe
expecting to get kicked out.

493
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,510
And you must've been flustered
when I disappeared as soon as I got that.

494
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,880
It's all in the past.

495
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,380
Forget it.
I don't need a million won. Here.

496
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,950
Take a good look. It's ten million won.
I'm paying you back with interest.

497
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,290
-It... It's ten million won?
-Yes.

498
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,490
Then I'll accept your gesture.

499
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,060
Yong-pil.

500
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,600
There's someone I really want to meet.

501
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,640
Who?

502
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,410
Do you remember Boon-hee? Gong Boon-hee.

503
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,540
She used to be my best friend.

504
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,910
To be honest,

505
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,850
I never want to see Jang-mi again
until the day I die.

506
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,450
Yong-pil, do you know
what Boon-hee is up to?

507
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,590
I asked the alumni association,
and they only had her old 018 number.

508
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,960
I don't know.
I have no idea what she's up to.

509
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,700
One second. This is a business call.

510
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,670
Goodness,
why does she have to call me now?

511
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,210
Boon-hee, it's me.

512
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,850
Hey. I guess you aren't home.

513
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,750
I got a text that we got a delivery.
It's frozen food.

514
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,620
Make sure you keep it in the fridge, okay?

515
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,160
Well, I just came out on business,

516
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,790
so as soon as I go back...

517
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,700
Boon-hee.

518
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,630
What are you doing here?

519
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,910
A... A friend wanted to see me.

520
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,940
You don't have a friend
who'd meet you at a hotel.

521
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,010
You don't know who this is.
Oh, the army. We were friends in the army.

522
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,610
We trained
in the seventh division together.

523
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,780
What about the Pyeongchang-dong lady?

524
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,920
-I came to see her.
-I see.

525
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,220
-You need to go now.
-Okay.

526
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,490
-Don't stay here.
-Okay.

527
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,460
The Pyeongchang-dong lady
can't see you. Go.

528
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,560
I'll go.

529
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,810
I'm going to cancel my annuity insurance
that's worth 10 million won.

530
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,410
You can't!

531
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,050
What? What do you mean, I can't?

532
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,660
I mean, right. Never mind. Yes.

533
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,390
So why did you want to see me?

534
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,130
I was wondering if you were doing well.

535
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,900
Right, I've been doing very well.

536
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,950
Jang-mi.

537
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,340
You have a great son. Congratulations.

538
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,810
A consultant who reports directly
to the chairman for the franchises.

539
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,750
You do know Yeon-joo worked hard
to make it happen, right?

540
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,280
Yes.

541
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,490
Oh, it looks like you're a Buddhist.

542
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,960
Oh, yes, I am.

543
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,360
There's this saying in "Diamond Sutra".

544
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,500
"Once you cross the river,
abandon the raft."

545
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,970
It's about time your son did that.

546
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,970
Could you make that a bit easier?
I'm not that smart.

547
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,180
He's like an executive of the head office
in charge of all franchises.

548
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,580
Running a convenience store
doesn't suit him.

549
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,350
And I'm not saying this
only for your son's sake.

550
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,460
"Aside from".

551
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,590
"Apart from".

552
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,740
You're banned from this convenience store
as of today.

553
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,340
Goodness, what are you talking about?

554
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,880
Stop talking nonsense. Move aside.

555
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,910
My goodness.

556
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,450
Hey! Who do you think you are?

557
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,250
An employee here.
This convenience store is my workplace.

558
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,220
An employee? Whatever.

559
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,390
Hey! You! I'm a major shareholder here!

560
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,560
This convenience store opened up
all thanks to me!

561
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,530
-So you want to shut it down too?
-What?

562
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,730
This store is like Mr. Choi's life,

563
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,700
and I've been working day and night

564
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,970
trying to grow the store
until I can open up a second location.

565
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,770
But it seems like a playground for you.

566
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,740
You hang out, eat, and steal from here.

567
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,610
You shouldn't do that
if you receive a payment every month.

568
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,050
What? I... I can't...

569
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,520
His family may have let you slide,
but I won't.

570
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,450
If you aren't going to actually work,
stop snooping around.

571
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,420
Wait, that... You little...

572
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,560
Wow, I can't believe this.

573
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,000
Something urgent just came up,

574
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,130
so I have to go now.

575
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,570
I'll teach you a good lesson
when I see you again.

576
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,870
Goodness, that little... That girl.

577
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,510
Unbelievable.

578
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,550
[Backstreet Rookie]

579
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,290
Man, I have zero inspirations.

580
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,460
Han Dal-sik, get a grip.

581
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,500
Things are going haywire.

582
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,470
It's all done now.

583
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,940
That lady.

584
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,940
My heart hurts. What is this feeling?

585
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,909
Dal-sik?

586
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,050
I need to get some fresh air.

587
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,570
I'm now seeing things.

588
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,840
Forget her.

589
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,409
She wants to move on
as if nothing happened.

590
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,280
Why do I keep seeing things?

591
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,389
How did you know that I'd be here?

592
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,560
I didn't come looking for you.

593
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,390
You're the one who just came out
of nowhere like you're my destiny!

594
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,930
Destiny?

595
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,200
How tragic it is.

596
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,730
-Mr. Han,
-What?

597
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,140
what's wrong?

598
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,400
You look so glum.

599
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,940
My deadline is tomorrow,

600
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,380
but I can't seem to come up with a story.

601
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,150
I'm going to finish "Her Reggae Boy".

602
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,620
I can't draw,

603
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,690
and I have to pay my rent.

604
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,320
Stop! What do you mean,
you can't come up with anything?

605
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,890
My idea notebook is more full of ideas
I've gotten from your cartoon

606
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,760
than my study notebook.

607
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,300
Tell me where you got stuck.

608
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,300
I'll make up a heck of a story for you.

609
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,430
A heck of a story?

610
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,400
Take the lead.

611
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,140
-Are you preparing anchovies?
-Yes.

612
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,480
Did you have a good meeting?

613
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,620
What did that lady say?

614
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,220
She started out by complimenting me,

615
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,930
saying that she heard everything
from Yeon-joo.

616
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,590
And then,

617
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,260
she suggested that Dae-hyun closes
the convenience store

618
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,170
if he wants to go off and do great things.

619
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,500
What?

620
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,340
What is she trying to say?

621
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,810
I did find it unpleasant to hear at first,

622
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:21,240
but it's not wrong.

623
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,110
He opened the store after quitting
his job at the head office,

624
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,610
but now that he's back there,

625
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,850
the store is now just extra work
for Dae-hyun.

626
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,850
You're right.

627
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,590
Why did you meet that hotel friend?

628
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,460
Why? Is he trying to borrow
some more money from you?

629
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,130
No. She paid me back in full.

630
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,670
She?

631
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,710
Did I say she?

632
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,880
Yes, you did.

633
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,310
I meant he.

634
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,320
You heard it wrong.

635
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,390
You just said she!

636
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,720
Choi Yong-pil! You lent money to a girl?

637
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,830
He definitely said she.

638
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,240
Saet-byul!

639
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,610
Mr. Choi!

640
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,970
-Stop.
-Why?

641
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,110
Hey! What are you doing?

642
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,950
-I'm sanitizing you
-Why?

643
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,850
from the flu virus
and ex-girlfriend virus.

644
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,920
Look at you.

645
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,020
Here. Go ahead.

646
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,030
What's wrong with your wrist?
Did you get hurt?

647
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,400
No, it's nothing. I just sprained it.

648
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,900
-I'm totally fine. Look.
-But...

649
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,640

00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,980
I have been waiting for the special love.

811
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,020
You know, platonic love.

812
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,690
You're just like me.

813
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,960
Judging by your first impression,
I thought you were a spoiled man.

814
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,860
I am pretty spoiled.

815
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,830
When I scratch my ankle bone,
my skin looks like scorched rice.

816
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,430
I can scratch off all the dead skin.

817
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,370
But my soul is pure like a newborn baby.

818
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,140
Goodness.

819
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,140
You have such a pure soul,

820
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,420
but you have been drawing
adult cartoons just to make money.

821
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,690
I'm sure it has been tough.

822
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,290
Thank you

823
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,520
for soothing my soul.

824
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,830
Don't worry.

825
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,430
Come here. Let me soothe you for real.

826
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,640
Really? Wait.

827
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,310
If I hug you now, I think I will lose it.

828
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,410
You won't lose me.

829
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,920
This feeling, this chill...

830
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,420
I don't want to lose
my inspiration for creativity.

831
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:57,160
To be honest, I want to hug you
really bad right now.

832
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,630
But I'm trying to fight my desire,
straining my toes.

833
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,300
Until when should I wait?

834
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,330
When "Her Reggae Boy" is finished.

835
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,340
When the time comes,
please be my reggae boy.

836
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
I will.

837
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,810
I can't control myself anymore!

838
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,550
No, no, no.

839
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,780
-Come back.
-Well done.

840
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,920
I really can't stand anymore.

841
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,190
Gosh, it hurts. Fine. You win.

842
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,260
My ears hurt.

843
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,030
-Please wait a little longer.
-I will.

844
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,860
I can't control myself either.

845
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,230
Let go!

846
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,870
-You can get back to work now.
-Okay.

847
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,350
What do you mean by switching the store
to a company-operated store?

848
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,620
I would never do that.

849
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,150
You're going to pass out again!

850
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,190
Wouldn't it be better

851
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,730
to just hand the store over
and work at the head office?

852
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,330
Mom!

853
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,830
Dae-hyun,

854
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,400
I didn't like the idea of you operating
a convenience store from the start.

855
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,600
And I hated the idea of you quitting
your job at the head office.

856
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,610
I told you to run a store

857
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,810
because I didn't want you to become
like your dad.

858
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,440
When Yeon-joo told us

859
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,150
that the head office can take
over the store for us,

860
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,480
I almost cried tears of happiness.

861
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,650
That's my honest opinion.

862
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,660
That's right.

863
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,430
You think the store will be fine
without you there?

864
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,160
I completely agree with your mom.

865
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,260
-I'm doing good, right?
-Dad!

866
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,400
There's no reason for you
to even think about this.

867
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,990
[You can own a convenience store
whenever you want,]

868
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,620
[but being a consultant is different.]

869
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,460
[It's Dae-hyun's chance
to live his dream.]

870
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:16,000
Think carefully about

871
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,960
what the best is for Dae-hyun.

872
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Director Yoo,

873
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,350
what were you thinking
when you made my mom that offer?

874
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,980
If I had to choose between the two,

875
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,650
I'd choose the convenience store,

876
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,290
not the consultant job.

877
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,160
The owner from the first branch called
yesterday,

878
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,630
saying that he's so thankful

879
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,000
that everything worked out because of you.

880
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,670
More stores need a consultant like you.

881
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,900
Helping out is important,

882
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,240
but I believe

883
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,910
that taking care of my own store first
as a store owner is more important.

884
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,910
I understand that you care

885
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,210
about your store as the owner.

886
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,880
I'm sure you're mostly worried
about your employee,

887
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,650
which is why I'd like to make an offer.

888
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,730
Why are you buying me sashimi?

889
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,960
You said you wanted to have some.

890
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,300
You worked so hard for the exam,

891
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,130
and it's also to celebrate
Eun-byul's return.

892
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,940
This is wild red sea-bream!

893
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,310
-Really?
-Yes. Eat up.

894
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,410
Thank you.

895
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,080
I'm going to take some of this,

896
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,780
and some of that.

897
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,990
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

898
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,730
You're enjoying it so much,
it feels like I'm watching an eating show.

899
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,430
I have to eat up.

900
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,970
You might get busy and not have time
to treat me to meals for a while.

901
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,730
No, I won't be.

902
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,540
Why?

903
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,010
Did the head office notice
how inefficient you are at your job?

904
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,780
What are you talking about?
I'm very good at what I do.

905
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,910
Nobody knows both the head office
and the stores more than I do.

906
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
Come on.

907
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,350
Which is why it was so rewarding.

908
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,180
Then why?

909
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
But

910
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,720
the head office

911
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,190
asked me to resign.

912
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,460
-From the head office?
-No, from the convenience store.

913
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,430
They want me to quit running the store
and focus on the work there.

914
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,730
That's why I'm going to resign.

915
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,240
From being a store owner?

916
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,440
No, from being a consultant.

917
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,040
My main job is owning the store,
after all.

918
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,980
The company is ridiculous.

919
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,820
How can they just make you
make a choice like that?

920
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,790
It was nothing like that.

921
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,920
They offered to take
ownership of the store,

922
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,560
then when I quit my job as a consultant,

923
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,260
they'll give the store back to me.

924
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,790
They also said that they'll promote you
as the store's assistant manager.

925
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,600
[Think carefully about]

926
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,630
[what the best is for Dae-hyun.]

927
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:09,300
Mr. Choi,

928
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,140
what did I tell you my dream was?

929
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,610
To be the manager of the store.

930
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,510
What are you going to promote me to?

931
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,940
Assistant manager.

932
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,150
What happens when an assistant manager
gets promoted?

933
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,250
They become the manager.

934
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,780
See? You know.

935
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,150
Are you trying to keep me
from living my dream?

936
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:29,360
It's not easy for a middle-school graduate
like me

937
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,820
to become the manager of a store.

938
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,530
Mr. Choi, you can come back to the store
once you quit your job as a consultant.

939
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,630
Don't you think so?

940
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,830
Just call them already!

941
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,140
Call them before they change their mind.

942
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,140
Saet-byul,

943
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,640
you don't know who they'll be sending
as the manager from the head office.

944
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:49,880
So what?

945
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,780
Don't you know me?

946
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:56,150
Yes, I get to become
the assistant manager!

947
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,050
Assistant Manager Jung Saet-byul.

948
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,220
The manager of a store?

949
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,260
Think of this as your opportunity
to get close to me.

950
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,160
What do I need to do?

951
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,330
Do what you do best.

952
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,270
Get rid of Jung Saet-byul.

953
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,140
I'll let you come back
as soon as you get that done.

954
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,510
Yes, I'm an expert on that.

955
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,540
Have a great evening!

956
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,210
-Thank you for the dinner.
-It's my pleasure.

957
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,350
Didn't you say that you have
something to give to me?

958
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,290
-That?
-Yes.

959
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,160
Give it to me.

960
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,260
Close your eyes.

961
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,890
Why do I have to close my eyes?
What is it?

962
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,130
Don't get me so excited.

963
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,530
Come on.

964
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,330
What is it?

965
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,670
Did that hurt?

966
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,610
-What are you doing?
-"What are you doing?"

967
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,080
-I'll give it to you if you're good.
-If I'm good?

968
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,480
This won't do. Follow me.

969
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,620
Come on.

970
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,260
What's all this?

971
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,360
How did you find this place?

972
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,570
I know how important this place is to you.

973
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,270
That's why I wanted to bring you here.

974
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,310
I wanted to say something to you
right here.

975
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,110
What is it?

976
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,950
Saet-byul,

977
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,190
I actually know what red tulips symbolize.

978
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,260
[Red tulips symbolize]

979
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,770
[confession of love.]

980
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,570
I thought I had to fall in love
at first sight to be in love.

981
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,640
I thought that was what happened
when people are meant to be.

982
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,380
But when I first saw you three years ago,

983
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,480
and then again as a part-timer
at the convenience store,

984
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,890
you changed my mind.

985
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,820
I started thinking that destiny is
something gradual,

986
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,530
something you make with memories.

987
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:32,040
And I felt that once again
as I made another day with you today.

988
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,910
You're so special to me.

989
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,650
Saet-byul,

990
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,050
I would like to be

991
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,190
someone special to you, too.

992
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,130
Will you accept my red tulips?
