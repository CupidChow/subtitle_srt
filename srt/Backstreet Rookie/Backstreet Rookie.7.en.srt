your retirement present.

Here. Take it.

476
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,500
Take care.

Gosh, why would you give me
something like this?

480
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,700
He should curse at me or something.

Hello, Director Cho.

493

-Hi.

-Gosh.

-Yeon-joo.
-Let me apologize first.

539
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,720
My mom was very rude to you.

540
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,460
She tends to get involved in my business,
but this was over the line.

541
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,430
And she does that
because I'm the only daughter.

542
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,900
That day,

543
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,310
I was embarrassed, so I couldn't
properly say hello and just left.

When I thought about it again,

545
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,210
it made me think
how hard this must have been for you.

better at being your boyfriend.

I'll do my best,
so you don't misunderstand anything.

552
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,739
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,070
My part-timer quit.

554

Please stop causing trouble between us

555
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,179
and stop working at the convenience store.

556
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,790
Why all of a sudden?

557
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,790
I think she's going
to get a different job.

558
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,360
It's understandable
because I can't pay her a lot.

559
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,760
Oh, right. I woke up because
my alarm went off early in the morning.

560
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,730
When I checked, there were 48 hours left.

561
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,270
For what?

562
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,940
Until our 1,000th day together.

563

We promised each other
we'd go on a fancy date for that.

565
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,680
Of course, I remember.

566
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,880
I prepared something for that day.

-My pleasure.

579

But it was hard to get the tickets.

580
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,770
You can't deliver
while following all the traffic signals.

581
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,670
Don't suddenly stop like that.

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,380
What? He's not going
to follow the traffic lights?

583
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,280
Does he think he's above the law?

584
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680

587
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,890

You're back. I heard from Ms. Shin.

You're going to the first show
in two days.

590
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,370
Yes. I met with Chairman Cho.

591
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,410
I heard he introduced you guys as a couple
to the director.

592

by Edward.

And Seung-joon is one of those few people.

And you deserve to go to this show.

596

Don't judge someone based on that.

597
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,320
He knew that I was your mother,

598
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,390
but he didn't say hello.
That's what I judged him on.

599
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,860
If he said hello to you,
would you have accepted him?

600
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,370
If you had introduced him to me.

601
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,310
I introduced your father to my parents
when I was dating him, so I married him.

602
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,980
Do you think I did a good job?

going to keep hanging out with her?

I'm never going to speak to you again.

I won't eat or drink.

I was just about to call you.

I can watch the show with you.

We're going with the Minister of Culture,
Sports and Tourism

and other VIP businessmen.

626

Assemblyman Park told me
he can't wait to meet you.

627
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,250
Yeon-joo, this is work.
We're not doing this for fun.

628
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,660
Hey, Dae-hyun.

629
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,660
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can make it tomorrow.

630
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,660
Our client from abroad
was supposed to come next week,

631
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,030
but he suddenly changed it to tomorrow.

632

He's a very important client,
and I'm the person in charge.

The second part of the show is
about to begin. Please take your seats.

950
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:04,420
The second part of the show is
about to begin. Let me check your tickets.

951
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,430
Oh, right. I woke up because
my alarm went off early in the morning.

952
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,560
When I checked, there were 48 hours left.

953
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:12,870
For what?

954
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,730
Until our 1,000th day together.

955
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,540
We promised each other
we'd go on a fancy date for that.

956
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,740
Don't you remember?

957
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

958
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,920
7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

959
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,150
11, 12...

960
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,660
Don't you dare try to take a single cent.

961
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,090
Do you not trust me?

962
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,990
No, I don't. Would you?

963
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,060
There are cameras everywhere,
so don't you dare try to do anything.

964
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,970
Leave everything where it belongs.

965
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,170
I think she left one out.

966
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,310
[Choi Yong-pil]

967
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

968
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,650
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

969
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,520
-Boon-hee.
-What?

970
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,550
Remember that girl who used to work
at your convenience store? Is she okay?

971
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,560
What do you mean?

972
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,490
My goodness, I guess you don't know.

973
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,330
I heard she lives
at the dry sauna these days.

974
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,800
She got scammed
and got kicked out of her house.

975
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,670
-What?
-You're the only one who doesn't know.

976
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,140
Hey, take this
to my convenience store for me.

977
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,440
My gosh.

978
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,010
[Saet-byul!]

979
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,780
Saet-byul! Where are you?

980
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,390
Saet-byul! My goodness, Saet-byul!

981
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:42,990
Get up.

982
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,390
I'm sorry. Go back to sleep.

983
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,490
-My gosh, what's her problem?
-Saet-byul!

984
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,160
Where is she? Saet-byul!

985
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,930
-Will you please be quiet?
-Lower your voice.

986
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,530
My goodness, where did she go?

987
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,700
Gosh, shut it!

988
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,570
-Be quiet!
-Hey!

989
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,600
A kid got scammed for goodness' sake!

990
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:59,840
Have you seen Saet-byul?
She's the really pretty kid!

991
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,870
Be quiet!

992
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,080
She has long hair and big eyes!

993
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,140
She's driving me crazy.

994
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,550
Saet-byul!

995
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:17,720
Hey, Dad.

996
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,930
[What's taking you so long?]

997
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,070
I'm on my way there.

998
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,770
You'd better be here in 10 minutes.

999
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:30,270
Dad, there's a traffic jam.

1000
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,170
I'll be there after I go home
and get changed.

1001
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,440
Tell Saet-byul to come back to work.

1002
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,880
Tell her to take her parcel too.

1003
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,540
Dad, just hang in there.
I'll be right there.

1004
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,160
My gosh, I'm so tired.

1005
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,930
I want to get some sleep.
