This is the right one.

She's nothing.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,210
Do you think she might be dead?
Why did you hit her right in the head?

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,140
-Let's run. Quick!
-Darn it!

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,960
The CCTV probably didn't catch us, right?

12
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,620
No, it couldn't have.

13
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,430
-This is so tiring.
-Why did you smash her head like that?

14
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,690
You told me to hit her hard.

15
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,229
Whatever. Let's just get going.

16
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,830
There wouldn't be any CCTV cameras
around here, right?

Whatever. Let's just get going.

-Let's go.
-Whatever.

Hey!

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,419
Are you okay? What happened?

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,630
What? What do you mean?

26
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't you remember? You passed out here.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,730
I was cleaning the tables

28
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,600
and my head...

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,370
Your head? What about your head?

30
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,810
-Is your head hurting?
-My stomach!

31
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,550
Your stomach hurts?

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,450
Are you okay? How does it hurt?

33
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,390
Hello, is this 911? I'm calling
from the convenience store.

34
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,120
She has acute appendicitis,
which is AA in short.

35
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,030
Is it anything serious?

36
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,600
-Could you tell me what that is?
-It hurts!

37
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,260
It means that she has

38
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,770
an inflammation in her appendix.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,540
-She has an appendix inflammation?
-Yes.

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,870
You could've just said that
from the start.

41
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,010
You look familiar.

42
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,310
-Me?
-Yes.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,580
I get that a lot.

44
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,880
It hurts!

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,350
She was hit in the head,

46
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,290
so why is her appendix the one
that's acting out?

47
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,920
There's a small bump on her head.
I'll do a CT scan for that.

48
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,960
Anyway, she has appendicitis.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,030
Nurse,

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,800
-prepare for surgery.
-Yes, Doctor.

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,130
What? Surgery? No!

52
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,070
Saet-byul, you have appendicitis.

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,810
You were hit in the head,
but you got appendicitis. Are you okay?

54
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,180
Where is this appendix?
Why does it hurt so much?

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,750
Of course it hurts. It's appendicitis.
You need to get surgery.

56
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,720
How did you get hit in the head
and get appendicitis?

57
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,890
Who's calling at this hour?

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,230
Hello?

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,070
Saet-byul?

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,240
Goodness. I'll get going right now.

62
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,180
Goodness,

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,580
I should've paid closer attention
when she said that her stomach hurt.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,550
Wake up.

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,490
Wake up. We have to go to the store.

66
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,620
Come on, quick.

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,830
[Police]

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,800
I've seen these kids.

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,930
Where?

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,900
They were picking on my girlfriend
at a bar.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,340
But wait,

72
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,770
Saet-byul was the one who saved
my girlfriend back then.

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,180
Did they come back to take revenge?

74
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
Could be.

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
Are you sure that it's these girls?

76
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,380
They're wearing hoodies and masks,
so I can't see their faces clearly.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,050
I'm sure it's them.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,820
I ran into them as they were running away.

79
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,790
I saw their faces then
because their hoodies were off.

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,060
They have very distinct faces,
so I definitely remember. It is them.

81
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,630
We'll check on the CCTV cameras
around the store then.

82
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,530
-I'll get going now.
-Thank you.

83
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,210
Yes, Mom?

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,850
Saet-byul's surgery went well.

85
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,950
She's in a room now.

86
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
That's good to hear.

87
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,620
Are you going to come to the hospital?

88
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,290
Yes, wait for me. I'll be there soon.

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,000
I guess this is how it feels
to get a piggyback ride.

90
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,570
I also got myself a piggyback ride.

91

[Yeon-joo, it wasn't that I wanted
to give her a piggyback ride.]

[I'm so sorry, Yeon-joo.]

93
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,420
Saet-byul,

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,890
are you okay?

95
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,730
-Mr. Choi,
-Yes?

96
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,690
I want to go to the bathroom.

97
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,030
Give me a piggyback ride.

98
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,330
What? A piggyback ride? No.

99
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,000
No way. Absolutely not.

100
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,870
I'm a patient! Just give me one.

101
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
No, not even if you're a patient.

102
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,410
No way! I'll never do that again.

103
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,380
I'll never give you a piggyback ride
ever again.

104
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,220
I really have to go! Just give me one!

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
No, I really can't!

106
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,820
Absolutely not.

107
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,720
Hey! You... Hey!

108
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,230
Get off of me!

109

110
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,000
My goodness!

111
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,840
Yeon-joo?

112
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,010
I told you that I didn't want
a piggyback ride.

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,680
What? You asked me to!

114
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeon-joo, I wasn't trying to give her
a piggyback ride. It's just...

115
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,060
It's fine. I understand you, Dae-hyun.

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,460
It's fine?

117
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,090
I hope you'll understand me as well.

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,730
Of course. I always understand you.

119
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,970
I brought someone to give you
a piggyback ride.

120
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,170
Me? Who?

121
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
Your purse?

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,070
This is...

123
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,440
Do you know what this is?

124
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,850
Blood!

125
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,820
-I'm sorry, Dae-hyun.
-Oh, gosh.

126
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,550
My heart...

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh, my.

128
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,200
No, get back inside.

129
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,670
Get back into the body.

130
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,940
No, this can't be.

131
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,550
Yeon-joo, am I dead?

132
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,550
♫ Come here, let me you a piggyback ride ♫

133

Dae-hyun,

134
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,830
get on my back.

135
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,030
No.

136
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,700
-There we go.
-No!

137
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,970
-Great. Let's go.
-No!

138
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,200
Yeon-joo, help me out here.
I don't want to go.

139
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,510
No!

140
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,010
Gosh, no!

141
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,809
You don't want to do what?

142
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,250
Saet-byul,

143
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,650
Am I okay?

144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,049
Are you feeling unwell?

145
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,260
You're supposed to ask me if I'm okay.
I'm the one who got surgery.

146
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,430
My goodness.

147
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,930
I had a dream.

148
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,030
-You had a dream?
-Yes.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,840
Do you remember what happened yesterday?
Are you okay?

150
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes. Who hit me in the head?

151
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,710
I reported this to the police,

152
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,810
so they'll catch them real soon.

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,550
Why do you think I got appendicitis
right then?

154
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,980
I don't know.
You should ask your appendix.

155
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,220
I guess you can't do that anymore
since your appendix is gone.

156
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,120
-What about the store?
-Don't worry about the store.

157
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,890
Just think of yourself
until you're out of here.

158
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,390
I can't do that.

159
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,200
I don't want to cause you
any inconvenience.

160
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,330
This isn't inconvenient at all.

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,570
You got hurt while working at my store,

162
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,200
so I'm going to pay you double
and pay for your hospital bills.

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,900
-Really?
-Of course.

164
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,810
You won't take your words back, right?

165
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,570
Of course. I'm great, aren't I?

166
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,440
Awesome!

167
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,580
This is like a dream vacation for me.

168
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,410
I guess it's a hospital vacation.

169
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,680
Is your head okay?

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,850
-You have a small bump on your head.
-A bump?

171
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,790
I think it's gone. I'm fine.

172
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,590
The CT scan results came back fine,
so that's good,

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,570
but this is fascinating.
It's like your skull is a helmet.

174
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,530
Is it bulletproof? Can I try touching it?

175
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,270
If you're here, who's watching the store?

176
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,240
I left my fish shop to a cat.

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Sorry?

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,610
My sister.

179
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,960
Welcome, sir.

180
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,690
This is my first time this week

181
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,800
seeing such a beautiful woman.

182
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,200
No way.

183
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,840
There are so many beautiful women
in Paris.

184
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,140
I can only see one woman

185
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,440
with my eyes.

186
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,040
Miss?

187
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,510
Honey!

188
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,450
I missed you so much! My love!

189
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,720
Wait.

190
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,120
What happened? How did you get
so beautiful just within a week?

191
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,190
-Honey,
-Yes?

192
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,090
we can't do this here.
Dae-hyun is coming back soon.

193
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,990
Quick.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,100
-Right here.
-This should be big enough.

195
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,170
Hold on. These aren't expired.

196
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,970
It's okay, they'll expire soon.

197
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,240
How did you know that I was craving
for milk today?

198
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,470
You adorable baby, you!

199
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,640
You haven't tried these, have you?

200
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,080
-Pack these as well.
-Wow.

201
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,450
I love these.

202
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,680
-It's full.
-Close it!

203
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,560
Let's go.

204
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,890
You're here.

205
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,830
It's been a while, Dae-hyun.

206
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,430
Your suitcase looks very heavy.

207
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,270
I'm just back from Paris,
so my suitcase is very heavy.

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,510
-Paris?
-Yes.

209
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,110
Paris. Yes.

210
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,240
-All those designer bags.
-Designer bags?

211
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,780
-That's right.
-Chanel.

212
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,250
-Chanel?
-Yes.

213
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,780
-Hermès.
-Louis Vuitton.

214
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,680
-Paris. What a beautiful city it is.
-Right.

215
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,820
That's right.

216
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,650
Sorry, there are flies here.

217
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,160
Right.

218
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,220
Dae-hyun, we're going to get going now.

219
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,860
Kill those flies. Keep up the good work.
Let's get going.

220
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,000
The store is so clean and nice.
It's so big.

221
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,400
Brother-in-law,

222
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,800
you forgot your cap.

223
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes, thank you.

224
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,770
Are you looking at me?

225
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,280
See you.

226
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,950
That woman.

227
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,700
[Yeon-joo, I know that whatever I'll say
will upset you.]

228
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,170
[But could you at least give me a chance
to explain it myself?]

229
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,610
[Talking over the phone would be
good enough.]

230
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,380
[She's not just a part-timer to us.]

231
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,280
[She's like our lucky charm.]

232
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,630
Are you that worried about Saet-byul?

233
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,130
Hello, Mom.

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,030
Go check on Saet-byul at the hospital

235
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,400
and get some sleep at home.

236
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,270
You should take over the night shift.

237
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,670
-Okay.
-Right.

238
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,740
How many customers did we have yesterday?

239
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,910
Just one person. She came for stockings.

240
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,880
That girl...

241
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,350
Hello, Ms. High School Student?

242
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,320
Yes, Ms. Middle-school Graduate.
Where are you?

243
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm on the top of your dumb head.
What's up?

244
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,730
You're home, right? I'll drop by soon.

245
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,730
Don't come. I'm not home.

246
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,000
Where are you then?

247
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,900
I'm at the convenience store.

248
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,270
I'm taking over a shift,
so I came here a little early.

249
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,800
What is it? You have anything to tell me?

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,240
Can you clean off anything in the store
that's fragile?

251
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,370
Anything expensive?

252
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,610
Fragile things?

253
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,310
Here they are.

254
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,310
Eun-byul is going for the second round
of auditions,

255
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,080
so she's skipping school.

256
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,080
What?

257
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,090
To where?

258
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,920
I don't know yet. I'm looking into it.

259
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,420
Hello?

260
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,730
Eun-byul, you're dead.

261
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,530
It'll be a minute.

262
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,800
Please just let me out.

263
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,760
It's too dangerous for you to go outside
right now.

264
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm feeling perfectly fine.

265
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,540
-Just for an hour. Please?
-No, you can't.

266
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,170
-But it's...
-Jung Saet-byul.

267
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,610
Go home if you're going to be like this.

268
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Mr. Choi...

269
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,880
Ma'am, just let her be.

270
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,180
Do whatever you want.
I don't care anymore.

271
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,350
Where are you going?

272
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,500
I'm sorry. I'll head back inside.

273
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,340
Seriously!

274
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,980
Goodness.

275
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,850
If the artist has no tears,

276
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,350
the audience will have no tears.

277
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,190
If the artist isn't surprised,

278
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,090
the audience won't be surprised, either.

279
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,200
I can't think!

280
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,830
What could it be?

281
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,040
That's it.

282
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,680
Han Dal-sik, what a man you are.

283
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,650

[Deadlines are stressful, but that's
what makes this moment so great.]

I'm the king of webtoon.]

[Today, I'm the king
of the dance machine.]

289
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,670
Awesome!

290
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,140
Dae-hyun? Right now?
Okay, I'll be there soon.

291
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,650
My record! Darn it!

292
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,780
You said you were just going
to check if your record's been broken.

293
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,020
We're supposed to see Saet-byul!

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,450
I can't just go
when my record has been broken.

295
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,660
This is nothing important!

296
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,760
It's important to me that I'm first place
in something.

297
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,630
If you focused on your studies this much,
you could've gotten accepted at SNU.

298
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,869
Darn it. Who broke my record? Come on.

299
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,980
What brings you here, Dal-sik?

300
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,950
I got a call from Dae-hyun.

301
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,520
He said he had to stop by somewhere,
so he asked to watch the store.

302
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,920
You can go home now, ma'am.

303
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,550
I was going to organize the storage.

304
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,220
Let me take care of that.

305
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,260
You haven't had dinner yet?
You should go home and have your dinner.

306
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,890
Stop twisting your hair.

307
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,200
Bye.

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,800
Dae-hyun told me to clean the fridge.

309
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,340
Saet-byul.

310
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,120
-Saet-byul!
-Saet-byul!

311
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,190
Oh, my nose!

312
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,630
A nosebleed. I have a nosebleed.

313
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,470
Why are you here?

314
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,640
I should ask you that!

315
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,640
Because I work here.

316
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,240
No, Saet-byul works here.

317
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,580
Saet-byul and I work as a pair.

318
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,550
That's ridiculous. Where is Saet-byul?

319
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,090
Don't you know she's at the hospital?
And you call yourself her bestie?

320
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,290
What did you say? Saet-byul is
at the hospital? Why? How?

321
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,730
-Which hospital? Answer me. Tell me now.
-What?

322
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,530
How would I know that? I'm the one
who should be at the hospital.

323
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey, come with me now.

324
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,600
Move out of my way!

325
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,370

Dae-hyun is kind and pure at heart.

805
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,390
-You little...
-Wait!

806
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,200
I'm the one who gets to beat her up.
She's mine.

807
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,270
You'd better not touch her.

808
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,970
That little...

809
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,880
So you're the girls
who haven't learned your lesson.

810
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,680
-You crazy little...
-Hey, stop.

811
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,350
Do you want to get beaten up again?

812
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,450
If you're confident,
then go ahead and give it a try.

813
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,390
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

814
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,620
There's a mango, a patient,

815
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,090
and a middle-aged lady
in a school uniform.

816
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,230
My gosh.

817
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,730
"A middle-aged lady in a uniform"?
Are you talking about me?

818
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,830
I don't see any other middle-aged lady
wearing a school uniform.

819
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,670
I really hate him.
Saet-byul, hit him harder than the others.

820
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,010
Hey, just be careful of that patient.

821
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,580
The others are nothing.

822
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,180
"Nothing"?
You red head, I'm going to kill you.

823
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,510
Get over here!

824
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,620
-You're all dead today!
-Come here!

825
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,750
-Hey!
-Get off me!

826
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,820
-Come here, you brat!
-Let me go!

827
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,430
-Come over here!
-You little brat!

828
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,300
[Praying Mantis Fist]

829
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,140
[Tai chi]

830
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,460
-Come here!
-Hey, look.

831
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,990
Look... Look at them.

832
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,000
You little...

833
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,940
You!

834
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,460
How many beatings do you want?

835
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,690
-Aren't you going to run?
-Oh, now?

836
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,330
Hey.

837
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,630
I'll see you when you're more relaxed.

838
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,700
That little brat.

839
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,600
What?

840
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,320
You guys, I'm free now.

841
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,150
Nice!

842
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,820
Shouldn't she have said
"I can get discharged now"?

843
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,490
Her appendix is okay now.

844
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,460
But I bet something's wrong
with her brain.

845
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:13,670
I can go home now.

846
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,610
Hey, Saet-byul.

847
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,080
Where were you?

848
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,820
I had to go somewhere.

849
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,290
Where? You should be getting treated.

850
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,960
Where else do you need to be?

851
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,530
Why do you keep annoying me
by not listening to your doctor?

852
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,330
You should be...

853
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,000
What's this?

854
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,970
You're a patient.
You shouldn't be going out.

855
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,770
What if your condition gets worse?

856
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,180
What in the world were you thinking?

857
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,150
Please stop causing trouble between us

858
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,550
and stop working at the convenience store.

859
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,700
What? What is it?
Why you looking at me like that?

860
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,330
What's wrong?

861
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:20,730
Mr. Choi.

862
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,270
What?

863
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,040
I have a question.

864
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,070
What is it?

865
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,970
I'm not

866
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,510
as bad of a person
as you thought I was, right?

867
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,580
What?

868
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,120
You're no longer
going to misunderstand me, right?

869
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,690
You're not going to be
suspicious of me either, right?

870
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,560
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

871
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,530
Give me an answer.

872
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,100
Tell me if you're still
suspicious of me or not.

873
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,440
Well...

874
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,200
Of course there's nothing
to be suspicious of.

875
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,340
That's good.

876
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,250
Mr. Choi, I think it's time

877
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,520
that I quit working at your store.

878
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,090
-What?
-To be honest,

879
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,090
I've been planning to quit.

880
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,860
But I didn't want you
to think of me like you used to.

881
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,730
So I wanted to work hard
and help you resolve the misunderstanding.

882
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,770
I know I didn't graduate high school,
and I don't have parents.

883
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,500
But I wanted to show you

884
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,110
that I'm not a bad kid.
That's why I kept working at your store.

885
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,310
Thank you for everything.

886
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:46,520
I wish you all the best
with your convenience store.

887
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,160
Good luck, Mr. Choi.
